    "title": "One-step Multi-view Clustering with Diverse Representation",
    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering has attracted broad attention due to its capacity to utilize consistent and complementary information among views. Although tremendous progress has been made recently, most existing methods undergo high complexity, preventing them from being applied to large-scale tasks. Multi-view clustering via matrix factorization is a representative to address this issue. However, most of them map the data matrices into a fixed dimension, which limits the expressiveness of the model. Moreover, a range of methods suffer from a two-step process, i.e., multimodal learning and the subsequent $k$-means, inevitably causing a sub-optimal clustering result. In light of this, we propose a one-step multi-view clustering with diverse representation method, which incorporates multi-view learning and $k$-means into a unified framework. Specifically, we first project original data matrices into various latent spaces to attain comprehensive information and auto-weight them in a self-supervised manner. Then we directly use the information matrices under diverse dimensions to obtain consensus discrete clustering labels. The unified work of representation learning and clustering boosts the quality of the final results. Furthermore, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the resultant problem with proven convergence. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the promising clustering performance of our proposed method. ",

    "title": "CLC: Cluster Assignment via Contrastive Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Clustering remains an important and challenging task of grouping samples into clusters without manual annotations. Recent works have achieved excellent results on small datasets by performing clustering on feature representations learned from self-supervised learning. However, for datasets with a large number of clusters, such as ImageNet, current methods still can not achieve high clustering performance. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Learning-based Clustering (CLC), which uses contrastive learning to directly learn cluster assignment. We decompose the representation into two parts: one encodes the categorical information under an equipartition constraint, and the other captures the instance-wise factors. We propose a contrastive loss using both parts of the representation. We theoretically analyze the proposed contrastive loss and reveal that CLC sets different weights for the negative samples while learning cluster assignments. Further gradient analysis shows that the larger weights tend to focus more on the hard negative samples. Therefore, the proposed loss has high expressiveness that enables us to efficiently learn cluster assignments. Experimental evaluation shows that CLC achieves overall state-of-the-art or highly competitive clustering performance on multiple benchmark datasets. In particular, we achieve 53.4% accuracy on the full ImageNet dataset and outperform existing methods by large margins (+ 10.2%). ",

Cycles make topological orderings moot, of course, however tolerating them is useful in practice.

In these cases it is better to maintain the relevant data structures so that if and when the directed graph becomes acyclic again, a topological ordering can be instantly recovered.

    "abstract": "Accurate trajectory prediction of nearby vehicles is crucial for the safe motion planning of automated vehicles in dynamic driving scenarios such as highway merging. Existing methods cannot initiate prediction for a vehicle unless observed for a fixed duration of two or more seconds. This prevents a fast reaction by the ego vehicle to vehicles that enter its perception range, thus creating safety concerns. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel transformer-based trajectory prediction approach, specifically trained to handle any observation length larger than one frame. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method using two large-scale highway trajectory datasets, namely the highD and exiD. In addition, we study the impact of the proposed prediction approach on motion planning and control tasks using extensive merging scenarios from the exiD dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first instance where such a large-scale highway merging dataset has been employed for this purpose. The results demonstrate that the prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance on highD dataset and maintains lower prediction error w.r.t. the constant velocity across all observation lengths in exiD. Moreover, it significantly enhances safety, comfort, and efficiency in dense traffic scenarios, as compared to the constant velocity model. ",

Finite basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs) improve the performance of PINNs in this regime by combining them with an overlapping domain decomposition approach. In this paper, the FBPINN approach is extended by adding multiple levels of domain decompositions to their solution ansatz, inspired by classical multilevel Schwarz domain decomposition methods (DDMs). Furthermore, analogous to typical tests for classical DDMs, strong and weak scaling studies designed for measuring how the accuracy of PINNs and FBPINNs behaves with respect to computational effort and solution complexity are carried out. Our numerical results show that the proposed multilevel FBPINNs consistently and significantly outperform PINNs across a range of problems with high frequency and multi-scale solutions. Furthermore, as expected in classical DDMs, we show that multilevel FBPINNs improve the scalability of FBPINNs to large numbers of subdomains by aiding global communication between subdomains. ",

We make three contributions: first, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate informative language descriptions for object classes, and construct powerful text-based classifiers; second, we employ a visual aggregator on image exemplars that can ingest any number of images as input, forming vision-based classifiers; and third, we provide a simple method to fuse information from language descriptions and image exemplars, yielding a multi-modal classifier. When evaluating on the challenging LVIS open-vocabulary benchmark we demonstrate that: (i) our text-based classifiers outperform all previous OVOD works; (ii) our vision-based classifiers perform as well as text-based classifiers in prior work; (iii) using multi-modal classifiers perform better than either modality alone; and finally, (iv) our text-based and multi-modal classifiers yield better performance than a fully-supervised detector.

However, ML has been found to have several flaws, on top of them are adversarial attacks, which aim to trick ML models into producing faulty predictions. While most adversarial attack research focuses on computer vision datasets, recent studies have explored the practicality of such attacks against ML-based network security entities, especially NIDS. This paper presents two distinct contributions: a taxonomy of practicality issues associated with adversarial attacks against ML-based NIDS and an investigation of the impact of continuous training on adversarial attacks against NIDS. Our experiments indicate that continuous re-training, even without adversarial training, can reduce the effect of adversarial attacks. While adversarial attacks can harm ML-based NIDSs, our aim is to highlight that there is a significant gap between research and real-world practicality in this domain which requires attention. ",

    "abstract": "Large annotated datasets inevitably contain incorrect labels, which poses a major challenge for the training of deep neural networks as they easily fit the labels. Only when training with a robust model that is not easily distracted by the noise, a good generalization performance can be achieved. A simple yet effective way to create a noise robust model is to use a noise robust loss function. However, the number of proposed loss functions is large, they often come with hyperparameters, and may learn slower than the widely used but noise sensitive Cross Entropy loss. By heuristic considerations and extensive numerical experiments, we study in which situations the proposed loss functions are applicable and give suggestions on how to choose an appropriate loss. Additionally, we propose a novel technique to enhance learning with bounded loss functions: the inclusion of an output bias, i.e. a slight increase in the neuron pre-activation corresponding to the correct label. Surprisingly, we find that this not only significantly improves the learning of bounded losses, but also leads to the Mean Absolute Error loss outperforming the Cross Entropy loss on the Cifar-100 dataset - even in the absence of additional label noise. This suggests that training with a bounded loss function can be advantageous even in the presence of minimal label noise. To further strengthen our analysis of the learning behavior of different loss functions, we additionally design and test a novel loss function denoted as Bounded Cross Entropy. ",

However, their extensive assimilation into various services introduces significant security risks. This study deconstructs the complexities and implications of prompt injection attacks on actual LLM-integrated applications. Initially, we conduct an exploratory analysis on ten commercial applications, highlighting the constraints of current attack strategies in practice. Prompted by these limitations, we subsequently formulate HouYi, a novel black-box prompt injection attack technique, which draws inspiration from traditional web injection attacks. HouYi is compartmentalized into three crucial elements: a seamlessly-incorporated pre-constructed prompt, an injection prompt inducing context partition, and a malicious payload designed to fulfill the attack objectives. Leveraging HouYi, we unveil previously unknown and severe attack outcomes, such as unrestricted arbitrary LLM usage and uncomplicated application prompt theft. We deploy HouYi on 36 actual LLM-integrated applications and discern 31 applications susceptible to prompt injection. 10 vendors have validated our discoveries, including Notion, which has the potential to impact millions of users. Our investigation illuminates both the possible risks of prompt injection attacks and the possible tactics for mitigation. ",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to provide a framework to quantitatively evaluate and rank explanation methods for the time series classification task, which deals with a prevalent data type in critical domains such as healthcare and finance. The recent surge of research interest in explanation methods for time series classification has provided a great variety of explanation techniques. Nevertheless, when these explanation techniques disagree on a specific problem, it remains unclear which of them to use. Comparing the explanations to find the right answer is non-trivial. Two key challenges remain: how to quantitatively and robustly evaluate the informativeness (i.e., relevance for the classification task) of a given explanation method, and how to compare explanation methods side-by-side. We propose AMEE, a Model-Agnostic Explanation Evaluation framework for quantifying and comparing multiple saliency-based explanations for time series classification. Perturbation is added to the input time series guided by the saliency maps (i.e., importance weights for each point in the time series). The impact of perturbation on classification accuracy is measured and used for explanation evaluation. The results show that perturbing discriminative parts of the time series leads to significant changes in classification accuracy. To be robust to different types of perturbations and different types of classifiers, we aggregate the accuracy loss across perturbations and classifiers. This allows us to objectively quantify and rank different explanation methods. We provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis for synthetic datasets, a variety of UCR benchmark datasets, as well as a real-world dataset with known expert ground truth. ",

    "abstract": "With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) and the huge amount of text they generated, it becomes more and more impractical to manually distinguish whether a text is machine-generated. Given the growing use of LLMs in social media and education, it prompts us to develop methods to detect machine-generated text, preventing malicious usage such as plagiarism, misinformation, and propaganda. Previous work has studied several zero-shot methods, which require no training data. These methods achieve good performance, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. In this paper, we introduce two novel zero-shot methods for detecting machine-generated text by leveraging the log rank information. One is called DetectLLM-LRR, which is fast and efficient, and the other is called DetectLLM-NPR, which is more accurate, but slower due to the need for perturbations. Our experiments on three datasets and seven language models show that our proposed methods improve over the state of the art by 3.9 and 1.75 AUROC points absolute. Moreover, DetectLLM-NPR needs fewer perturbations than previous work to achieve the same level of performance, which makes it more practical for real-world use. We also investigate the efficiency--performance trade-off based on users preference on these two measures and we provide intuition for using them in practice effectively.

    "abstract": "Research on GNNs has highlighted a relationship between high homophily (i.e., the tendency for nodes of a similar class to connect) and strong predictive performance in node classification. However, recent research has found the relationship to be more nuanced, demonstrating that even simple GNNs can learn in certain heterophilous settings. To bridge the gap between these findings, we revisit the assumptions made in previous works and identify that datasets are often treated as having a constant homophily level across nodes. To align closer to real-world datasets, we theoretically and empirically study the performance of GNNs when the local homophily level of a node deviates at test-time from the global homophily level of its graph. To aid our theoretical analysis, we introduce a new parameter to the preferential attachment model commonly used in homophily analysis to enable the control of local homophily levels in generated graphs, enabling a systematic empirical study on how local homophily can impact performance. We additionally perform a granular analysis on a number of real-world datasets with varying global homophily levels. Across our theoretical and empirical results, we find that (a)~ GNNs can fail to generalize to test nodes that deviate from the global homophily of a graph, (b)~ high local homophily does not necessarily confer high performance for a node, and (c)~ GNN models designed to handle heterophily are able to perform better across varying heterophily ranges irrespective of the dataset's global homophily. These findings point towards a GNN's over-reliance on the global homophily used for training and motivates the need to design GNNs that can better generalize across large local homophily ranges. ",

The reward distributions of each arm vary across clients and rewards are generated independently over time by an environment based on distributions that include both sub-exponential and sub-gaussian distributions. Each client pulls an arm and communicates with neighbors based on the graph provided by the environment. The goal is to minimize the overall regret of the entire system through collaborations. To this end, we introduce a novel algorithmic framework, which first provides robust simulation methods for generating random graphs using rapidly mixing Markov chains or the random graph model, and then combines an averaging-based consensus approach with a newly proposed weighting technique and the upper confidence bound to deliver a UCB-type solution. Our algorithms account for the randomness in the graphs, removing the conventional doubly stochasticity assumption, and only require the knowledge of the number of clients at initialization. We derive optimal instance-dependent regret upper bounds of order $\\log{T}$ in both sub-gaussian and sub-exponential environments, and a nearly optimal mean-gap independent regret upper bound of order $\\sqrt{T}\\log T$ up to a $\\log T$ factor. Importantly, our regret bounds hold with high probability and capture graph randomness, whereas prior works consider expected regret under assumptions and require more stringent reward distributions.

To operate in complex urban environment, precise air traffic management, in particular the management of traffic overflows due to operational disruptions will be critical to ensuring system safety and efficiency. To this end, we propose a methodology for the design of UAM networks with reserve capacity, i.e., a design where alternative landing options and flight corridors are explicitly considered as a means of improving contingency management and reducing risk. Similar redundancy considerations are incorporated in the design of many critical infrastructures, yet remain unexploited in the air transportation literature. In our methodology, we first model how disruptions to a given on-demand UAM network might impact on the nominal traffic flow and how this flow might be re-accommodated on an extended network with reserve capacity. Then, through an optimization problem, we select the locations and capacities for the backup vertiports with the maximal expected throughput of the extended network over all possible disruption scenarios, while the throughput is the maximal amount of flights that the network can accommodate per unit of time. We show that we can obtain the solution for the corresponding bi-level and bi-linear optimization problem by solving a mixed-integer linear program. We demonstrate our methodology in the case study using networks from Milwaukee, Atlanta, and Dallas--Fort Worth metropolitan areas and show how the throughput and flexibility of the UAM networks with reserve capacity can outcompete those without.

Due to their increase in demand, addressing security vulnerabilities to both UAVs and the Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANET) they form is more important than ever. As the network traffic is communicated through open airwaves, this network of UAVs relies on monitoring applications known as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect and mitigate attacks. This paper will survey current IDS systems that include machine learning techniques when combating various vulnerabilities and attacks from bad actors.

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) hold great potential to support a wide range of applications due to the high maneuverability and flexibility. Compared with single UAV, UAV swarm carries out tasks efficiently in harsh environment, where the network resilience is of vital importance to UAV swarm. The network topology has a fundamental impact on the resilience of UAV network. It is discovered that scale-free network topology, as a topology that exists widely in nature, has the ability to enhance the network resilience. Besides, increasing network throughput can enhance the efficiency of information interaction, improving the network resilience. Facing these facts, this paper studies the throughput of UAV Network with scale-free topology. Introducing the hybrid network structure combining both ad hoc transmission mode and cellular transmission mode into UAV Network, the throughput of UAV Network is improved compared with that of pure ad hoc UAV network. Furthermore, this work also investigates the optimal setting of the hop threshold for the selection of ad hoc or cellular transmission mode. It is discovered that the optimal hop threshold is related with the number of UAVs and the parameters of scale-free topology. This paper may motivate the application of hybrid network structure into UAV Network. ",

To alleviate this problem, we apply low-rank adaptation(LoRA) to the wav2vec2 model, freezing the pre-trained model weights and injecting a trainable rank-decomposition matrix into each layer of the transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks.

Firstly, we outline three basic mechanisms of R-PMAC, containing precise time difference calculation, preambles generation and short ID allocation. Secondly, we elaborate its networking process of single layer and multiple layers. Thirdly, we illustrate its robust mechanisms, including collision handling and data retransmission. Moreover, a low-cost hardware platform is established to measure the time of connecting hundreds of PLC nodes for the R-PMAC, P-MAC, and IEEE1901.1 mechanisms in a real power line environment. The experiment results show that R-PMAC outperforms the other mechanisms by achieving a 50% reduction in networking time.

The underlying principle of these methods is to learn temporally predictive representations by predicting future states in the latent space.

To address this issue, we propose a novel URL framework that causally predicts future states while increasing the dimension of the latent manifold by decorrelating the features in the latent space. Through extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate that our framework effectively learns predictive representations without collapse, which significantly improves the sample efficiency of state-of-the-art URL methods on the Atari 100k benchmark.

Extensive experiments with various settings empirically demonstrate that our approach, which is named WSPAlign, is an effective and scalable way to pre-train word aligners without manual data. When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, WSPAlign has set a new state-of-the-art by improving upon the best-supervised baseline by 3.3~6.1 points in F1 and 1.5~6.1 points in AER. Furthermore, WSPAlign also achieves competitive performance compared with the corresponding baselines in few-shot, zero-shot and cross-lingual tests, which demonstrates that WSPAlign is potentially more practical for low-resource languages than existing methods.

Pre-trained Language Models (LMs) can assess users' social media data and classify them in terms of their mental health risk. We propose a Question-Answering (QA) approach to assess mental health risk using the Unified-QA model on two large mental health datasets. To protect user data, we extend Unified-QA by anonymizing the model training process using differential privacy. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of modeling risk assessment as a QA task, specifically for mental health use cases. Furthermore, the model's performance decreases by less than 1% with the inclusion of differential privacy.

In this paper, we will shed light on some vulnerabilities of PLMs, by proposing a prompt-based adversarial attack on manual templates in black box scenarios. First of all, we design character-level and word-level heuristic approaches to break manual templates separately. Then we present a greedy algorithm for the attack based on the above heuristic destructive approaches. Finally, we evaluate our approach with the classification tasks on three variants of BERT series models and eight datasets. And comprehensive experimental results justify the effectiveness of our approach in terms of attack success rate and attack speed.

Existing 3D object detectors tend to perform well on the point cloud regions closer to the LiDAR sensor as opposed to on regions that are farther away. In this paper, we investigate this problem from the data perspective instead of detector architecture design. We observe that there is a learning bias in detection models towards the dense objects near the sensor and show that the detection performance can be improved by simply manipulating the input point cloud density at different distance ranges without modifying the detector architecture and without data augmentation. We propose a model-free point cloud density adjustment pre-processing mechanism that uses iterative MCMC optimization to estimate optimal parameters for altering the point density at different distance ranges. We conduct experiments using four state-of-the-art LiDAR 3D object detectors on two public LiDAR datasets, namely Waymo and ONCE. Our results demonstrate that our range-based point cloud density manipulation technique can improve the performance of the existing detectors, which in turn could potentially inspire future detector designs.

With the spread of deep learning, a new problem has also emerged; deep learning models can sometimes have undesirable information from an ethical standpoint. This problem must be resolved if deep learning is to make sensitive decisions such as hiring and prison sentencing. Machine unlearning (MU) is the research area that responds to such demands. MU aims at forgetting about undesirable training data from a trained deep learning model. A naive MU approach is to re-train the whole model with the training data from which the undesirable data has been removed. However, re-training the whole model can take a huge amount of time and consumes significant computer resources. To make MU even more practical, a simple-yet-effective MU method is required. In this paper, we propose a one-shot MU method, which does not need additional training. To design one-shot MU, we add noise to the model parameters that are sensitive to undesirable information. In our proposed method, we use the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to estimate the sensitive model parameters. Training data were usually used to evaluate the FIM in existing methods. In contrast, we avoid the need to retain the training data for calculating the FIM by using class-specific synthetic signals called mnemonic code. Extensive experiments using artificial and natural datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods. ",

Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-output dehazing network by introducing illumination controllable ability, called IC-Dehazing. The proposed IC-Dehazing can change the illumination intensity by adjusting the factor of the illumination controllable module, which is realized based on the interpretable Retinex theory. Moreover, the backbone dehazing network of IC-Dehazing consists of a Transformer with double decoders for high-quality image restoration. Further, the prior-based loss function and unsupervised training strategy enable IC-Dehazing to complete the parameter learning process without the need for paired data.

Full-duplex (FD) systems, enabling simultaneous transmission and reception from a base station (BS), offer the theoretical advantage of doubled spectrum efficiency. However, the presence of strong self-interference (SI) in FD systems significantly degrades performance, which can be mitigated by leveraging the capabilities of RIS. Moreover, accurately obtaining channel state information (CSI) from RIS poses a critical challenge. Our objective is to maximize downlink (DL) user data rates while ensuring quality-of-service (QoS) for uplink (UL) users under imperfect CSI from reflected channels. To address this, we introduce the robust active BS and passive RIS beamforming (RAPB) scheme for RIS-FD, accounting for both SI and imperfect CSI. RAPB incorporates distributionally robust design, conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), and penalty convex-concave programming (PCCP) techniques. Additionally, RAPB extends to active and passive beamforming (APB) with perfect channel estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the UL/DL rate improvements achieved considering various levels of imperfect CSI. The proposed RAPB/APB schemes validate their effectiveness across different RIS deployment and RIS/BS configurations. Benefited from robust beamforming, RAPB outperforms existing methods in terms of non-robustness, deployment without RIS, conventional successive convex approximation, and half-duplex systems. ",

The emerging wireless powered backscatter communications (WPBC) enable IoT nodes to harvest energy from the incident radio frequency signals transmitted by a power beacon (PB) to support their circuit operation, but the energy consumption of the PB (a potentially high cost borne by the network operator) has not been sufficiently studied for WPBC. In this paper, we aim to minimize the energy consumption of the PB while satisfying the throughput requirement per IoT node by jointly optimizing the time division multiple access (TDMA) time slot duration and backscatter reflection coefficient of each IoT node and the PB transmit power per time slot. As the formulated joint optimization problem is non-convex, we transform it into a convex problem by using auxiliary variables, then employ the Lagrange dual method to obtain the optimal solutions. To reduce the implementation complexity required for adjusting the PB's transmit power every time slot, we keep the PB transmit power constant in each time block and solve the corresponding PB energy consumption minimization problem by using auxiliary variables, the block coordinated decent method and the successive convex approximation technique. Based on the above solutions, two iterative algorithms are proposed for the dynamic PB transmit power scheme and the static PB transmit power scheme. The simulation results show that the dynamic PB transmit power scheme and the static PB transmit power scheme both achieve a lower PB energy consumption than the benchmark schemes, and the former achieves the lowest PB energy consumption.

In this paper, we propose JABBERWOCK (JAvascript-Based Binary EncodeR by WebAssembly Optimization paCKer), a tool to generate WebAssembly datasets in a pseudo fashion via JavaScript. Loosely speaking, JABBERWOCK automatically gathers JavaScript code in the real world, convert them into WebAssembly, and then outputs vectors of the WebAssembly as samples for malicious website detection. We also conduct experimental evaluations of JABBERWOCK in terms of the processing time for dataset generation, comparison of the generated samples with actual WebAssembly samples gathered from the Internet, and an application for malicious website detection. Regarding the processing time, we show that JABBERWOCK can construct a dataset in 4.5 seconds per sample for any number of samples. Next, comparing 10,000 samples output by JABBERWOCK with 168 gathered WebAssembly samples, we believe that the generated samples by JABBERWOCK are similar to those in the real world. We then show that JABBERWOCK can provide malicious website detection with 99\\% F1-score because JABBERWOCK makes a gap between benign and malicious samples as the reason for the above high score.

However, existing methods focus on reducing the domain bias of the detection backbone by inferring a discriminative visual encoder, while ignoring the domain bias in the detection head. Inspired by the high generalization of vision-language models (VLMs), applying a VLM as the robust detection backbone following a domain-aware detection head is a reasonable way to learn the discriminative detector for each domain, rather than reducing the domain bias in traditional methods. To achieve the above issue, we thus propose a novel DAOD framework named Domain-Aware detection head with Prompt tuning (DA-Pro), which applies the learnable domain-adaptive prompt to generate the dynamic detection head for each domain. Formally, the domain-adaptive prompt consists of the domain-invariant tokens, domain-specific tokens, and the domain-related textual description along with the class label. Furthermore, two constraints between the source and target domains are applied to ensure that the domain-adaptive prompt can capture the domains-shared and domain-specific knowledge. A prompt ensemble strategy is also proposed to reduce the effect of prompt disturbance. Comprehensive experiments over multiple cross-domain adaptation tasks demonstrate that using the domain-adaptive prompt can produce an effectively domain-related detection head for boosting domain-adaptive object detection.

Specifically, we introduce removal-based attribution and demonstrate its substantiated link to interpretability fidelity theoretically and experimentally. The explainer in LARA learns to generate removal-based attribution which enables providing explanations with high fidelity. A strategy of subgraph sampling is designed in LARA to improve the scalability of the training process. In the deployment, LARA can efficiently generate the explanation through a feed-forward pass. We benchmark our approach with other state-of-the-art GNN explanation methods on six datasets. Results highlight the effectiveness of our framework regarding both efficiency and fidelity. In particular, LARA is 3.5 times faster and achieves higher fidelity than the state-of-the-art method on the large dataset ogbn-arxiv (more than 160K nodes and 1M edges), showing its great potential in real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Deep-learning techniques, particularly the transformer model, have shown great potential in enhancing the prediction performance of longitudinal health records. While previous methods have mainly focused on fixed-time risk prediction, time-to-event prediction (also known as survival analysis) is often more appropriate for clinical scenarios. Here, we present a novel deep-learning architecture we named STRAFE, a generalizable survival analysis transformer-based architecture for electronic health records. The performance of STRAFE was evaluated using a real-world claim dataset of over 130,000 individuals with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and was found to outperform other time-to-event prediction algorithms in predicting the exact time of deterioration to stage 5. Additionally, STRAFE was found to outperform binary outcome algorithms in predicting fixed-time risk, possibly due to its ability to train on censored data. We show that STRAFE predictions can improve the positive predictive value of high-risk patients by 3-fold, demonstrating possible usage to improve targeting for intervention programs. Finally, we suggest a novel visualization approach to predictions on a per-patient basis. In conclusion, STRAFE is a cutting-edge time-to-event prediction algorithm that has the potential to enhance risk predictions in large claims datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Causal discovery from interventional data is an important problem, where the task is to design an interventional strategy that learns the hidden ground truth causal graph $G(V,E)$ on $|V| = n$ nodes while minimizing the number of performed interventions. Most prior interventional strategies broadly fall into two categories: non-adaptive and adaptive. Non-adaptive strategies decide on a single fixed set of interventions to be performed while adaptive strategies can decide on which nodes to intervene on sequentially based on past interventions. While adaptive algorithms may use exponentially fewer interventions than their non-adaptive counterparts, there are practical concerns that constrain the amount of adaptivity allowed. Motivated by this trade-off, we study the problem of $r$-adaptivity, where the algorithm designer recovers the causal graph under a total of $r$ sequential rounds whilst trying to minimize the total number of interventions. For this problem, we provide a $r$-adaptive algorithm that achieves $O(\\min\\{r,\\log n\\} \\cdot n^{1/\\min\\{r,\\log n\\}})$ approximation with respect to the verification number, a well-known lower bound for adaptive algorithms. Furthermore, for every $r$, we show that our approximation is tight. Our definition of $r$-adaptivity interpolates nicely between the non-adaptive ($r=1$) and fully adaptive ($r=n$) settings where our approximation simplifies to $O(n)$ and $O(\\log n)$ respectively, matching the best-known approximation guarantees for both extremes. Our results also extend naturally to the bounded size interventions. ",

Our algorithm is versatile and can be used with many popular compression methods including pruning, low-rank factorization, and quantization.

For BERT compression on GLUE fine-tuning tasks, we achieve $50\\%$ reduction in FLOPs with only $1\\%$ drop in performance. For compressing MobileNetV3 on ImageNet-1K, we achieve $15\\%$ reduction in FLOPs, and $11\\%$ reduction in on-device latency without drop in accuracy, while still requiring $3\\times$ less training compute than SOTA compression techniques.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Blockchain-based Online Social Media (BOSM) platforms have evolved fast due to the advancement of blockchain technology. BOSM can effectively overcome the problems of traditional social media platforms, such as a single point of trust and insufficient incentives for users, by combining a decentralized governance structure and a cryptocurrency-based incentive model, thereby attracting a large number of users and making it a crucial component of Web3. BOSM allows users to downvote low-quality content and aims to decrease the visibility of low-quality content by sorting and filtering it through downvoting. However, this feature may be maliciously exploited by some users to undermine the fairness of the incentive, reduce the quality of highly visible content, and further reduce users' enthusiasm for content creation and the attractiveness of the platform. In this paper, we study and analyze the downvoting behavior using four years of data collected from Steemit, the largest BOSM platform. We discovered that a significant number of bot accounts were actively downvoting content. In addition, we discovered that roughly 9% of the downvoting activity might be retaliatory. We did not detect any significant instances of downvoting on content for a specific topic. We believe that the findings in this paper will facilitate the future development of user behavior analysis and incentive pattern design in BOSM and Web3. ",

Our method has two stages, with the first stage performing joint reconstruction of coarse hair and bust shapes and hair orientation using implicit volumetric representations. The second stage then estimates a strand-level hair reconstruction by reconciling in a single optimization process the coarse volumetric constraints with hair strand and hairstyle priors learned from the synthetic data. To further increase the reconstruction fidelity, we incorporate image-based losses into the fitting process using a new differentiable renderer. The combined system, named Neural Haircut, achieves high realism and personalization of the reconstructed hairstyles. ",

However, this incline in complexity, and furthermore the increase in the dimensions of the observation came at the cost of volatility that can be taken advantage of via adversarial attacks (i.e. moving along worst-case directions in the observation space). To solve this policy instability problem we propose a novel method to detect the presence of these non-robust directions via local quadratic approximation of the deep neural policy loss. Our method provides a theoretical basis for the fundamental cut-off between safe observations and adversarial observations. Furthermore, our technique is computationally efficient, and does not depend on the methods used to produce the worst-case directions. We conduct extensive experiments in the Arcade Learning Environment with several different adversarial attack techniques. Most significantly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach even in the setting where non-robust directions are explicitly optimized to circumvent our proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "For many years, car keys have been the sole mean of authentication in vehicles. Whether the access control process is physical or wireless, entrusting the ownership of a vehicle to a single token is prone to stealing attempts. For this reason, many researchers started developing behavior-based authentication systems. By collecting data in a moving vehicle, Deep Learning (DL) models can recognize patterns in the data and identify drivers based on their driving behavior. This can be used as an anti-theft system, as a thief would exhibit a different driving style compared to the vehicle owner's. However, the assumption that an attacker cannot replicate the legitimate driver behavior falls under certain conditions. In this paper, we propose GAN-CAN, the first attack capable of fooling state-of-the-art behavior-based driver authentication systems in a vehicle. Based on the adversary's knowledge, we propose different GAN-CAN implementations. Our attack leverages the lack of security in the Controller Area Network (CAN) to inject suitably designed time-series data to mimic the legitimate driver. Our design of the malicious time series results from the combination of different Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and our study on the safety importance of the injected values during the attack. We tested GAN-CAN in an improved version of the most efficient driver behavior-based authentication model in the literature. We prove that our attack can fool it with an attack success rate of up to 0.99. We show how an attacker, without prior knowledge of the authentication system, can steal a car by deploying GAN-CAN in an off-the-shelf system in under 22 minutes. ",

We move toward a standard approach in evaluating a generative AI system for any modality, in two overarching categories: what is able to be evaluated in a base system that has no predetermined application and what is able to be evaluated in society. We describe specific social impact categories and how to approach and conduct evaluations in the base technical system, then in people and society. Our framework for a base system defines seven categories of social impact: bias, stereotypes, and representational harms; cultural values and sensitive content; disparate performance; privacy and data protection; financial costs; environmental costs; and data and content moderation labor costs. Suggested methods for evaluation apply to all modalities and analyses of the limitations of existing evaluations serve as a starting point for necessary investment in future evaluations. We offer five overarching categories for what is able to be evaluated in society, each with their own subcategories: trustworthiness and autonomy; inequality, marginalization, and violence; concentration of authority; labor and creativity; and ecosystem and environment. Each subcategory includes recommendations for mitigating harm. We are concurrently crafting an evaluation repository for the AI research community to contribute existing evaluations along the given categories.

    "abstract": "The rapid urbanization trend in most developing countries including India is creating a plethora of civic concerns such as loss of green space, degradation of environmental health, clean water availability, air pollution, traffic congestion leading to delays in vehicular transportation, etc. Transportation and network modeling through transportation indices have been widely used to understand transportation problems in the recent past. This necessitates predicting transportation indices to facilitate sustainable urban planning and traffic management. Recent advancements in deep learning research, in particular, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and their modifications in spatial data analysis such as CityGAN, Conditional GAN, and MetroGAN have enabled urban planners to simulate hyper-realistic urban patterns. These synthetic urban universes mimic global urban patterns and evaluating their landscape structures through spatial pattern analysis can aid in comprehending landscape dynamics, thereby enhancing sustainable urban planning. This research addresses several challenges in predicting the urban transportation index for small and medium-sized Indian cities. A hybrid framework based on Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and CityGAN is introduced to predict transportation index using spatial indicators of human settlement patterns. This paper establishes a relationship between the transportation index and human settlement indicators and models it using KRR for the selected 503 Indian cities. The proposed hybrid pipeline, we call it RidgeGAN model, can evaluate the sustainability of urban sprawl associated with infrastructure development and transportation systems in sprawling cities. Experimental results show that the two-step pipeline approach outperforms existing benchmarks based on spatial and statistical measures. ",

    "abstract": "Including human analysis has the potential to positively affect the robustness of Deep Neural Networks and is relatively unexplored in the Adversarial Machine Learning literature. Neural network visual explanation maps have been shown to be prone to adversarial attacks. Further research is needed in order to select robust visualizations of explanations for the image analyst to evaluate a given model. These factors greatly impact Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) evaluation tools due to their reliance on adversarial images, including explanation maps and measurements of robustness. We believe models of human visual attention may improve interpretability and robustness of human-machine imagery analysis systems. Our challenge remains, how can HITL evaluation be robust in this adversarial landscape? ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently become the standard approach for learning with graph-structured data. Prior work has shed light into their potential, but also their limitations. Unfortunately, it was shown that standard GNNs are limited in their expressive power. These models are no more powerful than the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) algorithm in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs. In this paper, we propose Path Neural Networks (PathNNs), a model that updates node representations by aggregating paths emanating from nodes. We derive three different variants of the PathNN model that aggregate single shortest paths, all shortest paths and all simple paths of length up to K. We prove that two of these variants are strictly more powerful than the 1-WL algorithm, and we experimentally validate our theoretical results. We find that PathNNs can distinguish pairs of non-isomorphic graphs that are indistinguishable by 1-WL, while our most expressive PathNN variant can even distinguish between 3-WL indistinguishable graphs. The different PathNN variants are also evaluated on graph classification and graph regression datasets, where in most cases, they outperform the baseline methods. ",

Given access to $V$ and an oracle that given two vertices $u,v\\in V$, returns the shortest path distance between $u$ and $v$, how many queries are needed to reconstruct $E$? We give a simple deterministic algorithm to reconstruct trees using $\\Delta n\\log_\\Delta n+(\\Delta+2)n$ distance queries and show that even randomised algorithms need to use at least $\\frac1{100} \\Delta n\\log_\\Delta n$ queries in expectation.

Our lower bound also extends to related query models including distance queries for phylogenetic trees, membership queries for learning partitions and path queries in directed trees. We extend our deterministic algorithm to reconstruct graphs without induced cycles of length at least $k$ using $O_{\\Delta,k}(n\\log n)$ queries, which includes various graph classes of interest such as chordal graphs, permutation graphs and AT-free graphs. Since the previously best known randomised algorithm for chordal graphs uses $O_{\\Delta}(n\\log^2 n)$ queries in expectation, we both get rid off the randomness and get the optimal dependency in $n$ for chordal graphs and various other graph classes.

    "abstract": "Existing offboard 3D detectors always follow a modular pipeline design to take advantage of unlimited sequential point clouds. We have found that the full potential of offboard 3D detectors is not explored mainly due to two reasons: (1) the onboard multi-object tracker cannot generate sufficient complete object trajectories, and (2) the motion state of objects poses an inevitable challenge for the object-centric refining stage in leveraging the long-term temporal context representation. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel paradigm of offboard 3D object detection, named DetZero. Concretely, an offline tracker coupled with a multi-frame detector is proposed to focus on the completeness of generated object tracks. An attention-mechanism refining module is proposed to strengthen contextual information interaction across long-term sequential point clouds for object refining with decomposed regression methods. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset show our DetZero outperforms all state-of-the-art onboard and offboard 3D detection methods. Notably, DetZero ranks 1st place on Waymo 3D object detection leaderboard with 85.15 mAPH (L2) detection performance. Further experiments validate the application of taking the place of human labels with such high-quality results. Our empirical study leads to rethinking conventions and interesting findings that can guide future research on offboard 3D object detection. ",

    "abstract": "Relational inference aims to identify interactions between parts of a dynamical system from the observed dynamics. Current state-of-the-art methods fit a graph neural network (GNN) on a learnable graph to the dynamics. They use one-step message-passing GNNs -- intuitively the right choice since non-locality of multi-step or spectral GNNs may confuse direct and indirect interactions. But the \\textit{effective} interaction graph depends on the sampling rate and it is rarely localized to direct neighbors, leading to local minima for the one-step model. In this work, we propose a \\textit{dynamical graph prior} (DYGR) for relational inference. The reason we call it a prior is that, contrary to established practice, it constructively uses error amplification in high-degree non-local polynomial filters to generate good gradients for graph learning. To deal with non-uniqueness, DYGR simultaneously fits a ``shallow'' one-step model with shared graph topology. Experiments show that DYGR reconstructs graphs far more accurately than earlier methods, with remarkable robustness to under-sampling. Since appropriate sampling rates for unknown dynamical systems are not known a priori, this robustness makes DYGR suitable for real applications in scientific machine learning. ",

Our goal is to mitigate these imperfections from various sources with a joint solution: we take advantage of the ability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce realistic images and use them to enhance realism in 3D scene reconstruction with NeRFs. To this end, we learn the patch distribution of a scene using an adversarial discriminator, which provides feedback to the radiance field reconstruction, thus improving realism in a 3D-consistent fashion. Thereby, rendering artifacts are repaired directly in the underlying 3D representation by imposing multi-view path rendering constraints. In addition, we condition a generator with multi-resolution NeRF renderings which is adversarially trained to further improve rendering quality. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves rendering quality, e.g., nearly halving LPIPS scores compared to Nerfacto while at the same time improving PSNR by 1.4dB on the advanced indoor scenes of Tanks and Temples.

Recent CLIP-based fine-tuning methods such as prompt learning have demonstrated significant improvements in ID classification and OOD generalization where OOD labels are available. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether the model is reliable to semantic shifts without OOD labels. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap and present a comprehensive study to understand how fine-tuning impact OOD detection for few-shot downstream tasks. By framing OOD detection as multi-modal concept matching, we establish a connection between fine-tuning methods and various OOD scores. Our results suggest that a proper choice of OOD scores is essential for CLIP-based fine-tuning. In particular, the maximum concept matching (MCM) score provides a promising solution consistently. We also show that prompt learning demonstrates the state-of-the-art OOD detection performance over the zero-shot counterpart. ",

    "abstract": "=One of the most frequently farmed crops is the tomato crop. Late blight is the most prevalent tomato disease in the world, and often causes a significant reduction in the production of tomato crops. The importance of tomatoes as an agricultural product necessitates early detection of late blight. It is produced by the fungus Phytophthora. The earliest signs of late blight on tomatoes are unevenly formed, water-soaked lesions on the leaves located on the plant canopy's younger leave White cottony growth may appear in humid environments evident on the undersides of the leaves that have been impacted. Lesions increase as the disease proceeds, turning the leaves brown to shrivel up and die. Using picture segmentation and the Multi-class SVM technique, late blight disorder is discovered in this work. Image segmentation is employed for separating damaged areas on leaves, and the Multi-class SVM method is used for reliable disease categorization. 30 reputable studies were chosen from a total of 2770 recognized papers. The primary goal of this study is to compile cutting-edge research that identifies current research trends, problems, and prospects for late blight detection.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful technique for learning robust representations from unlabeled data. By learning to remain invariant to applied data augmentations, methods such as SimCLR and MoCo are able to reach quality on par with supervised approaches. However, this invariance may be harmful to solving some downstream tasks which depend on traits affected by augmentations used during pretraining, such as color. In this paper, we propose to foster sensitivity to such characteristics in the representation space by modifying the projector network, a common component of self-supervised architectures. Specifically, we supplement the projector with information about augmentations applied to images. In order for the projector to take advantage of this auxiliary guidance when solving the SSL task, the feature extractor learns to preserve the augmentation information in its representations. Our approach, coined Conditional Augmentation-aware Selfsupervised Learning (CASSLE), is directly applicable to typical joint-embedding SSL methods regardless of their objective functions. Moreover, it does not require major changes in the network architecture or prior knowledge of downstream tasks. In addition to an analysis of sensitivity towards different data augmentations, we conduct a series of experiments, which show that CASSLE improves over various SSL methods, reaching state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "The challenge of fairness arises when Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems do not perform equally well for all sub-groups of the population. In the past few years there have been many improvements in overall speech recognition quality, but without any particular focus on advancing Equality and Equity for all user groups for whom systems do not perform well. ASR fairness is therefore also a robustness issue. Meanwhile, data privacy also takes priority in production systems. In this paper, we present a privacy preserving approach to improve fairness and robustness of end-to-end ASR without using metadata, zip codes, or even speaker or utterance embeddings directly in training. We extract utterance level embeddings using a speaker ID model trained on a public dataset, which we then use in an unsupervised fashion to create acoustic clusters. We use cluster IDs instead of speaker utterance embeddings as extra features during model training, which shows improvements for all demographic groups and in particular for different accents. ",

Majority of the coin styles in market circulation for denominations of Rs.1 and Rs.2 coins are nearly the same except for numerals on its reverse side. If a coin is resting on its obverse side, the correct denomination is not distinguishable by humans. Therefore, it was hypothesized that a digital image of a coin resting on its either size could be classified into its correct denomination by training a deep neural network model. The digital images were generated by using cheap cell phone cameras. To find the most suitable deep neural network architecture, four were selected based on the preliminary analysis carried out for comparison.

Various machine learning models have been proposed for estimating brain age through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of healthy controls. However, developing a robust brain age estimation (BAE) framework has been challenging due to the selection of appropriate MRI-derived features and the high cost of MRI acquisition. In this study, we present a novel BAE framework using the Open Big Healthy Brain (OpenBHB) dataset, which is a new multi-site and publicly available benchmark dataset that includes region-wise feature metrics derived from T1-weighted (T1-w) brain MRI scans of 3965 healthy controls aged between 6 to 86 years. Our approach integrates three different MRI-derived region-wise features and different regression models, resulting in a highly accurate brain age estimation with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.25 years, demonstrating the framework's robustness. We also analyze our model's regression-based performance on gender-wise (male and female) healthy test groups. The proposed BAE framework provides a new approach for estimating brain age, which has important implications for the understanding of neurological disorders and age-related brain changes. ",

In this work, we investigate for the first time the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in solving the 1D COUCSI problem in both early (ET) and late (LT) times. Also novel, we examine the Change-of-Variables technique for improving the performance of PINNs. We formulated the COUCSI problem in three equivalent forms by changing the independent variables: XT-, XY-, and Z-formulations. The first describes saturation as function of normalized position X and time T; the second as function of X and Y=T^0.5; and the third as a sole function of Z=X/T^0.5 (valid only at ET). The PINN model was generated using a feed-forward neural network and trained based on minimizing a weighted loss function, including the physics-informed loss term and terms corresponding to the initial and boundary conditions. No synthetical or experimental data were involved in the training. All three formulations could closely approximate the correct solutions (obtained by fine-grid numerical simulations), with water saturation mean absolute errors (MAE) around 0.019 and 0.009 for XT and XY formulations and 0.012 for the Z formulation at ET. The Z formulation perfectly captured the self-similarity of the system at ET. This was less captured by XT and XY formulations. The total variation (TV) of saturation was preserved in the Z formulation, and it was better preserved with XY- than XT formulation. It was demonstrated that redefining the problem based on physics-inspired variables reduced the non-linearity of the problem and allowed higher solution accuracies, a higher degree of loss-landscape convexity, a lower number of required collocation points, smaller network sizes, and more computationally efficient solutions.

Acoustic scene clustering aims at merging the audio recordings of the same class of acoustic scene into a single cluster without using prior information and training classifiers. In this study, we propose a method for acoustic scene clustering that jointly optimizes the procedures of feature learning and clustering iteration. In the proposed method, the learned feature is a deep embedding that is extracted from a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), while the clustering algorithm is the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). We formulate a unified loss function for integrating and optimizing these two procedures. Various features and methods are compared. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other unsupervised methods in terms of the normalized mutual information and the clustering accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a method for DAC from audio recordings using a multi-scale dilated depthwise separable convolutional network (DSCN). The DSCN is a lightweight neural network with small size of parameters and thus suitable to be deployed in portable terminals with limited computing resources. To expand the receptive field with the same size of DSCN's parameters, dilated convolution, instead of normal convolution, is used in the DSCN for further improving the DSCN's performance. In addition, the embeddings of various scales learned by the dilated DSCN are concatenated as a multi-scale embedding for representing property differences among various classes of domestic activities. Evaluated on a public dataset of the Task 5 of the 2018 challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE-2018), the results show that: both dilated convolution and multi-scale embedding contribute to the performance improvement of the proposed method; and the proposed method outperforms the methods based on state-of-the-art lightweight network in terms of classification accuracy.

Dualization requires expertise and is tedious and error-prone. We demonstrate how CVXPY can be used to automate this dualization procedure in a user-friendly manner. Our framework allows practitioners to specify and solve robust ERM problems with a general class of convex losses, capturing many standard regression and classification problems. Users can easily specify any complex uncertainty set that is representable via disciplined convex programming (DCP) constraints. ",

Utilizing the advantage that neurons in the brain communicate via spikes, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are emerging as a new type of neural network model, boosting the frontier of theoretical investigation and empirical application of artificial neural networks and deep learning. Neuroscience research proposes that the precise timing of neural spikes plays an important role in the information coding and sensory processing of the biological brain. However, the role of spike timing in SNNs is less considered and far from understood. Here we systematically explored the timing mechanism of spike coding in SNNs, focusing on the robustness of the system against various types of attacks. We found that SNNs can achieve higher robustness improvement using the coding principle of precise spike timing in neural encoding and decoding, facilitated by different learning rules. Our results suggest that the utility of spike timing coding in SNNs could improve the robustness against attacks, providing a new approach to reliable coding principles for developing next-generation brain-inspired deep learning.

Building upon the recent neural tangent kernel theory, we create statistically guaranteed schemes to principally \\emph{quantify}, and \\emph{remove}, the procedural uncertainty of over-parameterized neural networks with very low computation effort. In particular, our approach, based on what we call a procedural-noise-correcting (PNC) predictor, removes the procedural uncertainty by using only \\emph{one} auxiliary network that is trained on a suitably labeled data set, instead of many retrained networks employed in deep ensembles.

In this study, we employed transfer learning to overcome the challenge of limited data availability in EEG-based emotion detection. The base model used in this study was Resnet50. Additionally, we employed a novel feature combination in EEG-based emotion detection. The input to the model was in the form of an image matrix, which comprised Mean Phase Coherence (MPC) and Magnitude Squared Coherence (MSC) in the upper-triangular and lower-triangular matrices, respectively. We further improved the technique by incorporating features obtained from the Differential Entropy (DE) into the diagonal, which previously held little to no useful information for classifying emotions. The dataset used in this study, SEED EEG (62 channel EEG), comprises three classes (Positive, Neutral, and Negative). We calculated both subject-independent and subject-dependent accuracy. The subject-dependent accuracy was obtained using a 10-fold cross-validation method and was 93.1%, while the subject-independent classification was performed by employing the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) strategy. The accuracy obtained in subject-independent classification was 71.6%. Both of these accuracies are at least twice better than the chance accuracy of classifying 3 classes. The study found the use of MSC and MPC in EEG-based emotion detection promising for emotion classification. The future scope of this work includes the use of data augmentation techniques, enhanced classifiers, and better features for emotion classification. ",

This paper presents the design and development of voice stress detection, trained on more than 100 speakers from 9 language groups and five different types of stress. We address individual variabilities in voice stress analysis by adding speaker embeddings to the hybrid BYOL-S features. The proposed method significantly improves voice stress detection performance with an input audio length of only 3-5 seconds. ",

    "title": "Robust Data-driven Prescriptiveness Optimization",
    "abstract": "The abundance of data has led to the emergence of a variety of optimization techniques that attempt to leverage available side information to provide more anticipative decisions. The wide range of methods and contexts of application have motivated the design of a universal unitless measure of performance known as the coefficient of prescriptiveness. This coefficient was designed to quantify both the quality of contextual decisions compared to a reference one and the prescriptive power of side information. To identify policies that maximize the former in a data-driven context, this paper introduces a distributionally robust contextual optimization model where the coefficient of prescriptiveness substitutes for the classical empirical risk minimization objective. We present a bisection algorithm to solve this model, which relies on solving a series of linear programs when the distributional ambiguity set has an appropriate nested form and polyhedral structure. Studying a contextual shortest path problem, we evaluate the robustness of the resulting policies against alternative methods when the out-of-sample dataset is subject to varying amounts of distribution shift.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted resource demand prediction scheme to enhance prediction accuracy for multicast short video streaming. Particularly, we construct user DTs (UDTs) for collecting real-time user status, including channel condition, location, watching duration, and preference. A reinforcement learning-empowered K-means++ algorithm is developed to cluster users based on the collected user status in UDTs, which can effectively employ the mined users' intrinsic correlation to improve the accuracy of user clustering. We then analyze users' video watching duration and preferences in each multicast group to obtain the swiping probability distribution and recommended videos, respectively. The obtained information is utilized to predict radio and computing resource demand of each multicast group. Initial results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively abstract multicast groups' swiping probability distributions for accurate resource demand prediction. ",

We show that the statistical efficiency in terms of expected squared error can be improved by combining estimators arising from both the observational and interventional setting. To this end, we derive methods based on matrix weighted linear estimators and prove that our methods are asymptotically unbiased in the infinite sample limit. This is an important improvement compared to the pooled estimator using the union of interventional and observational data, for which the bias only vanishes if the ratio of observational to interventional data tends to zero. Studies on synthetic data confirm our theoretical findings. In settings where confounding is substantial and the ratio of observational to interventional data is large, our estimators outperform a Stein-type estimator and various other baselines. ",
