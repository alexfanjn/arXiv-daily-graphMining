    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) facilitates collaborative learning among multiple clients in a distributed manner, while ensuring privacy protection. However, its performance is inevitably degraded as suffering data heterogeneity, i.e., non-IID data. In this paper, we focus on the feature distribution skewed FL scenario, which is widespread in real-world applications. The main challenge lies in the feature shift caused by the different underlying distributions of local datasets. While the previous attempts achieved progress, few studies pay attention to the data itself, the root of this issue. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to develop a general data augmentation technique at the input level, to mitigate the feature shift. To achieve this goal, we propose FedRDN, a simple yet remarkably effective data augmentation method for feature distribution skewed FL, which randomly injects the statistics of the dataset from the entire federation into the client's data. By this, our method can effectively improve the generalization of features, thereby mitigating the feature shift. Moreover, FedRDN is a plug-and-play component, which can be seamlessly integrated into the data augmentation flow with only a few lines of code. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that the performance of various representative FL works can be further improved by combining them with FedRDN, which demonstrates the strong scalability and generalizability of FedRDN. The source code will be released. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence for scientific discovery has recently generated significant interest within the machine learning and scientific communities, particularly in the domains of chemistry, biology, and material discovery. For these scientific problems, molecules serve as the fundamental building blocks, and machine learning has emerged as a highly effective and powerful tool for modeling their geometric structures. Nevertheless, due to the rapidly evolving process of the field and the knowledge gap between science (e.g., physics, chemistry, & biology) and machine learning communities, a benchmarking study on geometrical representation for such data has not been conducted. To address such an issue, in this paper, we first provide a unified view of the current symmetry-informed geometric methods, classifying them into three main categories: invariance, equivariance with spherical frame basis, and equivariance with vector frame basis. Then we propose a platform, coined Geom3D, which enables benchmarking the effectiveness of geometric strategies. Geom3D contains 16 advanced symmetry-informed geometric representation models and 14 geometric pretraining methods over 46 diverse datasets, including small molecules, proteins, and crystalline materials. We hope that Geom3D can, on the one hand, eliminate barriers for machine learning researchers interested in exploring scientific problems; and, on the other hand, provide valuable guidance for researchers in computational chemistry, structural biology, and materials science, aiding in the informed selection of representation techniques for specific applications.

The human mobility simulation task aims to generate human mobility trajectories given a small set of trajectory data, which have aroused much concern due to the scarcity and sparsity of human mobility data. Existing methods mostly rely on the static relationships of locations, while largely neglect the dynamic spatiotemporal effects of locations. On the one hand, spatiotemporal correspondences of visit distributions reveal the spatial proximity and the functionality similarity of locations. On the other hand, the varying durations in different locations hinder the iterative generation process of the mobility trajectory. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to model the dynamic spatiotemporal effects of locations, namely SpatioTemporal-Augmented gRaph neural networks (STAR). The STAR framework designs various spatiotemporal graphs to capture the spatiotemporal correspondences and builds a novel dwell branch to simulate the varying durations in locations, which is finally optimized in an adversarial manner. The comprehensive experiments over four real datasets for the human mobility simulation have verified the superiority of STAR to state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "In the current age, human lifestyle has become more knowledge oriented leading to generation of sedentary employment. This has given rise to a number of health and mental disorders. Mental wellness is one of the most neglected but crucial aspects of today's world. Mental health issues can, both directly and indirectly, affect other sections of human physiology and impede an individual's day-to-day activities and performance. However, identifying the stress and finding the stress trend for an individual leading to serious mental ailments is challenging and involves multiple factors. Such identification can be achieved accurately by fusing these multiple modalities (due to various factors) arising from behavioral patterns. Certain techniques are identified in the literature for this purpose; however, very few machine learning-based methods are proposed for such multimodal fusion tasks. In this work, a multimodal AI-based framework is proposed to monitor a person's working behavior and stress levels. We propose a methodology for efficiently detecting stress due to workload by concatenating heterogeneous raw sensor data streams (e.g., face expressions, posture, heart rate, computer interaction). This data can be securely stored and analyzed to understand and discover personalized unique behavioral patterns leading to mental strain and fatigue. The contribution of this work is twofold; proposing a multimodal AI-based strategy for fusion to detect stress and its level and secondly identify a stress pattern over a period of time. We were able to achieve 96.09% accuracy on the test set in stress detection and classification. Further, we reduce the stress scale prediction model loss to 0.036 using these modalities. This work can prove important for the community at large, specifically those working sedentary jobs to monitor and identify stress levels, especially in current times of COVID-19. ",

Existing traffic forecasting studies focus on modeling spatial-temporal dynamics in traffic data, among which the graph convolution network (GCN) is at the center for exploiting the spatial dependency embedded in the road network graphs. However, these GCN-based methods operate intrinsically on the node level (e.g., road and intersection) only whereas overlooking the spatial hierarchy of the whole city. Nodes such as intersections and road segments can form clusters (e.g., regions), which could also have interactions with each other and share similarities at a higher level. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Hierarchical SpatioTemporal Network (AHSTN) to promote traffic forecasting by exploiting the spatial hierarchy and modeling multi-scale spatial correlations. Apart from the node-level spatiotemporal blocks, AHSTN introduces the adaptive spatiotemporal downsampling module to infer the spatial hierarchy for spatiotemporal modeling at the cluster level. Then, an adaptive spatiotemporal upsampling module is proposed to upsample the cluster-level representations to the node-level and obtain the multi-scale representations for generating predictions. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that AHSTN achieves better performance over several strong baselines. ",

With the advance of deep learning, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), as a mesh-free method, have shown great potential for fast PDE solving in various applications.

Specifically, ST-PINN introduces a pseudo label based self-learning algorithm during training. It employs governing equation as the pseudo-labeled evaluation index and selects the highest confidence examples from the sample points to attach the pseudo labels. To our best knowledge, we are the first to incorporate a self-training mechanism into physics-informed learning. We conduct experiments on five PDE problems in different fields and scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed method allows the network to learn more physical information and benefit convergence. The ST-PINN outperforms existing physics-informed neural network methods and improves the accuracy by a factor of 1.33x-2.54x.

This framework addresses the problem of classifying a stream of unlabeled data in a distributed manner. We consider two kinds of classification tasks with limited observations in the prediction phase, namely, the statistical classification task and the single-sample classification task. For each task, we describe the distributed learning rule and analyze the probability of error accordingly. To do so, we first introduce a stronger consistent training condition that involves the margin distributions generated by the trained classifiers. Based on this condition, we derive an upper bound on the probability of error for both tasks, which depends on the statistical properties of the data and the combination policy used to combine the distributed classifiers. For the statistical classification problem, we employ the geometric social learning rule and conduct a non-asymptotic performance analysis. An exponential decay of the probability of error with respect to the number of unlabeled samples is observed in the upper bound. For the single-sample classification task, a distributed learning rule that functions as an ensemble classifier is constructed. An upper bound on the probability of error of this ensemble classifier is established. ",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-destructive and contactless technology that provides valuable information about the structure and composition of an object. It can capture detailed information about the chemical and physical properties of agricultural crops. Due to its wide spectral range, compared with multispectral- or RGB-based imaging methods, HSI can be a more effective tool for monitoring crop health and productivity. With the advent of this imaging tool in agrotechnology, researchers can more accurately address issues related to the detection of diseased and defective crops in the agriculture industry. This allows to implement the most suitable and accurate farming solutions, such as irrigation and fertilization before crops enter a damaged and difficult-to-recover phase of growth in the field. While HSI provides valuable insights into the object under investigation, the limited number of HSI datasets for crop evaluation presently poses a bottleneck. Dealing with the curse of dimensionality presents another challenge due to the abundance of spectral and spatial information in each hyperspectral cube. State-of-the-art methods based on 1D- and 2D-CNNs struggle to efficiently extract spectral and spatial information. On the other hand, 3D-CNN-based models have shown significant promise in achieving better classification and detection results by leveraging spectral and spatial features simultaneously. Despite the apparent benefits of 3D-CNN-based models, their usage for classification purposes in this area of research has remained limited. This paper seeks to address this gap by reviewing 3D-CNN-based architectures and the typical deep learning pipeline, including preprocessing and visualization of results, for the classification of hyperspectral images of diseased and defective crops. Furthermore, we discuss open research areas and challenges when utilizing 3D-CNNs with HSI data. ",

However, this has led to an increase in embodied emissions, encompassing carbon emissions arising from design, manufacturing, packaging, and other infrastructural activities. While existing research has developed tools to analyze embodied carbon at the computer architecture level for traditional monolithic systems, these tools do not apply to near-mainstream heterogeneous integration (HI) technologies. HI systems offer significant potential for sustainable computing by minimizing carbon emissions through two key strategies: ``reducing\" computation by reusing pre-designed chiplet IP blocks and adopting hierarchical approaches to system design. The reuse of chiplets across multiple designs, even spanning multiple generations of integrated circuits (ICs), can substantially reduce embodied carbon emissions throughout the operational lifespan. This paper introduces a carbon analysis tool specifically designed to assess the potential of HI systems in facilitating greener VLSI system design and manufacturing approaches. The tool takes into account scaling, chiplet and packaging yields, design complexity, and even carbon overheads associated with advanced packaging techniques employed in heterogeneous systems. Experimental results demonstrate that HI can achieve a reduction of embodied carbon emissions up to 70\\% compared to traditional large monolithic systems. These findings suggest that HI can pave the way for sustainable computing practices, contributing to a more environmentally conscious semiconductor industry. ",

    "abstract": "Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have been extensively investigated by monitoring real network traffic and analyzing suspicious activities. However, there are limitations in detecting specific types of attacks with NIDS, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). Additionally, NIDS is restricted in observing complete traffic information due to encrypted traffic or a lack of authority. To address these limitations, a Host-based Intrusion Detection system (HIDS) evaluates resources in the host, including logs, files, and folders, to identify APT attacks that routinely inject malicious files into victimized nodes. In this study, a hybrid network intrusion detection system that combines NIDS and HIDS is proposed to improve intrusion detection performance. The feature flattening technique is applied to flatten two-dimensional host-based features into one-dimensional vectors, which can be directly used by traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. A two-stage collaborative classifier is introduced that deploys two levels of ML algorithms to identify network intrusions. In the first stage, a binary classifier is used to detect benign samples. All detected attack types undergo a multi-class classifier to reduce the complexity of the original problem and improve the overall detection performance. The proposed method is shown to generalize across two well-known datasets, CICIDS 2018 and NDSec-1. Performance of XGBoost, which represents conventional ML, is evaluated. Combining host and network features enhances attack detection performance (macro average F1 score) by 8.1% under the CICIDS 2018 dataset and 3.7% under the NDSec-1 dataset. Meanwhile, the two-stage collaborative classifier improves detection performance for most single classes, especially for DoS-LOIC-UDP and DoS-SlowHTTPTest, with improvements of 30.7% and 84.3%, respectively, when compared with the traditional ML XGBoost.

However, their application has been generally limited to interpolation scenarios, where predictions rely on inputs within the support of the training set. In real-world applications, extrapolation is often required, but the out of domain behavior of PINNs is understudied. In this paper, we provide a detailed investigation of PINNs' extrapolation behavior and provide evidence against several previously held assumptions: we study the effects of different model choices on extrapolation and find that once the model can achieve zero interpolation error, further increases in architecture size or in the number of points sampled have no effect on extrapolation behavior. We also show that for some PDEs, PINNs perform nearly as well in extrapolation as in interpolation. By analyzing the Fourier spectra of the solution functions, we characterize the PDEs that yield favorable extrapolation behavior, and show that the presence of high frequencies in the solution function is not to blame for poor extrapolation behavior. Finally, we propose a transfer learning-based strategy based on our Fourier results, which decreases extrapolation errors in PINNs by up to $82 \\%$. ",

    "abstract": "Image-based motion prediction is one of the essential techniques for robot manipulation. Among the various prediction models, we focus on diffusion models because they have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various applications. In image-based motion prediction, diffusion models stochastically predict contextually appropriate motion by gradually denoising random Gaussian noise based on the image context. While diffusion models are able to predict various motions by changing the random noise, they sometimes fail to predict a contextually appropriate motion based on the image because the random noise is sampled independently of the image context. To solve this problem, we propose R2-Diff. In R2-Diff, a motion retrieved from a dataset based on image similarity is fed into a diffusion model instead of random noise. Then, the retrieved motion is refined through the denoising process of the diffusion model. Since the retrieved motion is almost appropriate to the context, it becomes easier to predict contextually appropriate motion. However, traditional diffusion models are not optimized to refine the retrieved motion. Therefore, we propose the method of tuning the hyperparameters based on the distance of the nearest neighbor motion among the dataset to optimize the diffusion model for refinement. Furthermore, we propose an image-based retrieval method to retrieve the nearest neighbor motion in inference. Our proposed retrieval efficiently computes the similarity based on the image features along the motion trajectory. We demonstrate that R2-Diff accurately predicts appropriate motions and achieves high task success rates compared to recent state-of-the-art models in robot manipulation. ",

Feature construction and selection are powerful techniques used for this aim. In this paper, a feature selection and construction approach is presented for the detection of wind turbine generator heating faults. Data were collected from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system of a wind turbine. The original features directly collected from the data collection system consist of wind characteristics, operational data, temperature measurements and status information. In addition to these original features, new features were created in the feature construction step to obtain information that can be more powerful indications of the faults. After the construction of new features, a hybrid feature selection technique was implemented to find out the most relevant features in the overall set to increase the classification accuracy and decrease the computational burden. Feature selection step consists of filter and wrapper-based parts. Filter based feature selection was applied to exclude the features which are non-discriminative and wrapper-based method was used to determine the final features considering the redundancies and mutual relations amongst them. Artificial Neural Networks were used both in the detection phase and as the induction algorithm of the wrapper-based feature selection part. The results show that, the proposed approach contributes to the fault detection system to be more reliable especially in terms of reducing the number of false fault alarms. ",

Current approaches randomly select one negative sample for each reference entity pair to minimize a margin-based ranking loss, which easily leads to a zero-loss problem if the negative sample is far away from the positive sample and then out of the margin. Moreover, the entity should have a different representation under a different context. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Relation-Aware Network with Attention-Based Loss (RANA) framework. Specifically, to better utilize the plentiful negative samples and alleviate the zero-loss issue, we strategically select relevant negative samples and design an attention-based loss function to further differentiate the importance of each negative sample. The intuition is that negative samples more similar to positive samples will contribute more to the model. Further, we design a dynamic relation-aware entity encoder for learning a context-dependent entity representation. Experiments demonstrate that RANA outperforms the state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets. ",

To detect the load-path, we generate a directed weighted graph from the CAE data. The vertices represent the vehicle's parts, and the edges are an abstraction of the connectivity of the parts. The edge direction follows the temporal occurrence of the collision, where the edge weights reflect aspects of the energy absorption. We introduce and assess three methods for graph extraction and an additional method for further updating each graph with the sequences of absorption. Based on longest-path calculations, we introduce an automated detection of the load-path, which we analyse for the different graph extraction methods and weights.

Sequences of skeletal body joints are extracted from consecutive RGB video frames and analyzed by many-to-one sequential neural networks to evaluate exercise quality. Existing datasets for exercise rehabilitation lack adequate samples for training deep sequential neural networks to generalize effectively. A cross-modal data augmentation approach is proposed to resolve this problem. Visual augmentation techniques are applied to video data, and body joints extracted from the resulting augmented videos are used for training sequential neural networks. Extensive experiments conducted on the KInematic assessment of MOvement and clinical scores for remote monitoring of physical REhabilitation (KIMORE) dataset, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over previous baseline approaches. The ablation study highlights a significant enhancement in exercise quality assessment following cross-modal augmentation. ",

Simply coupling NeRF with diffusion models will result in cross-view inconsistency and degradation of stylized view syntheses. To address this challenge, we propose the Edit-DiffNeRF framework, which is composed of a frozen diffusion model, a proposed delta module to edit the latent semantic space of the diffusion model, and a NeRF. Instead of training the entire diffusion for each scene, our method focuses on editing the latent semantic space in frozen pretrained diffusion models by the delta module. This fundamental change to the standard diffusion framework enables us to make fine-grained modifications to the rendered views and effectively consolidate these instructions in a 3D scene via NeRF training. As a result, we are able to produce an edited 3D scene that faithfully aligns to input text instructions. Furthermore, to ensure semantic consistency across different viewpoints, we propose a novel multi-view semantic consistency loss that extracts a latent semantic embedding from the input view as a prior, and aim to reconstruct it in different views. Our proposed method has been shown to effectively edit real-world 3D scenes, resulting in 25% improvement in the alignment of the performed 3D edits with text instructions compared to prior work. ",

Most existing STR methods adopt encoder-decoder-based CNNs, with direct copies of the features in the skip connections. However, the encoded features contain both text texture and structure information. The insufficient utilization of text features hampers the performance of background reconstruction in text removal regions. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Feature Erasing and Transferring (FET) mechanism to reconfigure the encoded features for STR in this paper. In FET, a Feature Erasing Module (FEM) is designed to erase text features. An attention module is responsible for generating the feature similarity guidance. The Feature Transferring Module (FTM) is introduced to transfer the corresponding features in different layers based on the attention guidance. With this mechanism, a one-stage, end-to-end trainable network called FETNet is constructed for scene text removal. In addition, to facilitate research on both scene text removal and segmentation tasks, we introduce a novel dataset, Flickr-ST, with multi-category annotations. A sufficient number of experiments and ablation studies are conducted on the public datasets and Flickr-ST.

    "abstract": "Deep-learning-based surrogate models provide an efficient complement to numerical simulations for subsurface flow problems such as CO$_2$ geological storage. Accurately capturing the impact of faults on CO$_2$ plume migration remains a challenge for many existing deep learning surrogate models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Neural Operators. We address this challenge with a graph-based neural model leveraging recent developments in the field of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our model combines graph-based convolution Long-Short-Term-Memory (GConvLSTM) with a one-step GNN model, MeshGraphNet (MGN), to operate on complex unstructured meshes and limit temporal error accumulation. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately predict the temporal evolution of gas saturation and pore pressure in a synthetic reservoir with impermeable faults. Our results exhibit a better accuracy and a reduced temporal error accumulation compared to the standard MGN model. We also show the excellent generalizability of our algorithm to mesh configurations, boundary conditions, and heterogeneous permeability fields not included in the training set. This work highlights the potential of GNN-based methods to accurately and rapidly model subsurface flow with complex faults and fractures. ",

    "abstract": "Multimodal interactions have been shown to be more flexible, efficient, and adaptable for diverse users and tasks than traditional graphical interfaces. However, existing multimodal development frameworks either do not handle the complexity and compositionality of multimodal commands well or require developers to write a substantial amount of code to support these multimodal interactions. In this paper, we present ReactGenie, a programming framework that uses a shared object-oriented state abstraction to support building complex multimodal mobile applications. Having different modalities share the same state abstraction allows developers using ReactGenie to seamlessly integrate and compose these modalities to deliver multimodal interaction. ReactGenie is a natural extension to the existing workflow of building a graphical app, like the workflow with React-Redux. Developers only have to add a few annotations and examples to indicate how natural language is mapped to the user-accessible functions in the program. ReactGenie automatically handles the complex problem of understanding natural language by generating a parser that leverages large language models. We evaluated the ReactGenie framework by using it to build three demo apps. We evaluated the accuracy of the language parser using elicited commands from crowd workers and evaluated the usability of the generated multimodal app with 16 participants. Our results show that ReactGenie can be used to build versatile multimodal applications with highly accurate language parsers, and the multimodal app can lower users' cognitive load and task completion time.

    "abstract": "The color video inpainting problem is one of the most challenging problem in the modern imaging science. It aims to recover a color video from a small part of pixels that may contain noise. However, there are less of robust models that can simultaneously preserve the coupling of color channels and the evolution of color video frames. In this paper, we present a new robust quaternion tensor completion (RQTC) model to solve this challenging problem and derive the exact recovery theory. The main idea is to build a quaternion tensor optimization model to recover a low-rank quaternion tensor that represents the targeted color video and a sparse quaternion tensor that represents noise. This new model is very efficient to recover high dimensional data that satisfies the prior low-rank assumption. To solve the case without low-rank property, we introduce a new low-rank learning RQTC model, which rearranges similar patches classified by a quaternion learning method into smaller tensors satisfying the prior low-rank assumption. We also propose fast algorithms with global convergence guarantees. In numerical experiments, the proposed methods successfully recover color videos with eliminating color contamination and keeping the continuity of video scenery, and their solutions are of higher quality in terms of PSNR and SSIM values than the state-of-the-art algorithms.

    "abstract": "Deciding on an appropriate intervention requires a causal model of a treatment, the outcome, and potential mediators. Causal mediation analysis lets us distinguish between direct and indirect effects of the intervention, but has mostly been studied in a static setting. In healthcare, data come in the form of complex, irregularly sampled time-series, with dynamic interdependencies between a treatment, outcomes, and mediators across time. Existing approaches to dynamic causal mediation analysis are limited to regular measurement intervals, simple parametric models, and disregard long-range mediator--outcome interactions. To address these limitations, we propose a non-parametric mediator--outcome model where the mediator is assumed to be a temporal point process that interacts with the outcome process. With this model, we estimate the direct and indirect effects of an external intervention on the outcome, showing how each of these affects the whole future trajectory. We demonstrate on semi-synthetic data that our method can accurately estimate direct and indirect effects. On real-world healthcare data, our model infers clinically meaningful direct and indirect effect trajectories for blood glucose after a surgery. ",

While detection training data can be expanded by using Web image-text pairs as weak supervision, this has not been done at scales comparable to image-level pretraining. Here, we scale up detection data with self-training, which uses an existing detector to generate pseudo-box annotations on image-text pairs. Major challenges in scaling self-training are the choice of label space, pseudo-annotation filtering, and training efficiency. We present the OWLv2 model and OWL-ST self-training recipe, which address these challenges. OWLv2 surpasses the performance of previous state-of-the-art open-vocabulary detectors already at comparable training scales (~10M examples). However, with OWL-ST, we can scale to over 1B examples, yielding further large improvement: With an L/14 architecture, OWL-ST improves AP on LVIS rare classes, for which the model has seen no human box annotations, from 31.2% to 44.6% (43% relative improvement). OWL-ST unlocks Web-scale training for open-world localization, similar to what has been seen for image classification and language modelling. ",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently proven their excellent ability to segment 2D cardiac ultrasound images. However, the majority of attempts to perform full-sequence segmentation of cardiac ultrasound videos either rely on models trained only on keyframe images or fail to maintain the topology over time. To address these issues, in this work, we consider segmentation of ultrasound video as a registration estimation problem and present a novel method for diffeomorphic image registration using neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODE). In particular, we consider the registration field vector field between frames as a continuous trajectory ODE. The estimated registration field is then applied to the segmentation mask of the first frame to obtain a segment for the whole cardiac cycle. The proposed method, Echo-ODE, introduces several key improvements compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Firstly, by solving a continuous ODE, the proposed method achieves smoother segmentation, preserving the topology of segmentation maps over the whole sequence (Hausdorff distance: 3.7-4.4). Secondly, it maintains temporal consistency between frames without explicitly optimizing for temporal consistency attributes, achieving temporal consistency in 91% of the videos in the dataset. Lastly, the proposed method is able to maintain the clinical accuracy of the segmentation maps (MAE of the LVEF: 2.7-3.1). The results show that our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art in multiple aspects, demonstrating the importance of spatial-temporal data processing for the implementation of Neural ODEs in medical imaging applications. These findings open up new research directions for solving echocardiography segmentation tasks. ",

Sentiment analysis (SA) is a useful natural language processing (NLP) technique that utilizes lexical/statistical and deep learning methods to determine whether different-sized texts exhibit positive, negative, or neutral emotions. Recurrent networks are widely used in machine-learning communities for problems with sequential data. However, a drawback of models based on Long-Short Term Memory networks and Gated Recurrent Units is the significantly high number of parameters, and thus, such models are computationally expensive. This drawback is even more significant when the available data are limited. Also, such models require significant over-parameterization and regularization to achieve optimal performance. Tensorized models represent a potential solution. In this paper, we classify the sentiment of some social media posts. We compare traditional recurrent models with their tensorized version, and we show that with the tensorized models, we reach comparable performances with respect to the traditional models while using fewer resources for the training.

The term DAG-DNN refers to a graphical representation of a DNN in which the architecture is expressed as a direct-acyclic graph (DAG), on which arcs are associated with functions. The level of a node denotes the maximum number of hops between the input node and the node of interest. In the current study, we demonstrate that DAG-DNNs can be used to derive all functions defined on various sub-architectures of the DNN. We also demonstrate that the functions defined in a DAG-DNN can be derived via a sequence of lower-triangular matrices, each of which provides the transition of functions defined in sub-graphs up to nodes at a specified level. The lifting structure associated with lower-triangular matrices makes it possible to perform the structural pruning of a network in a systematic manner. The fact that decomposition is universally applicable to all DNNs means that network pruning could theoretically be applied to any DNN, regardless of the underlying architecture. We demonstrate that it is possible to obtain the winning ticket (sub-network and initialization) for a weak version of the lottery ticket hypothesis, based on the fact that the sub-network with initialization can achieve training performance on par with that of the original network using the same number of iterations or fewer.

Meanwhile, a hybrid-switched DCN design combining optical circuit switches (OPS) and electrical packet switches (EPS) for transmitting high-volume traffic and low-volume traffic separately has received considerable research attention recently. Efficient scheduling of coflows on hybrid network links is crucial for reducing the overall communication time. However, because of the reconfiguration delay in the circuit switch due to the ultra-high transmission rate and the limitation of bandwidth in the packet switch, coflow scheduling becomes increasingly challenging. The existing coflow scheduling algorithms in hybrid-switched DCNs are all heuristic and provide no performance guarantees. In this work, we propose an approximation algorithm with the worst-case performance guarantee of 2+ \\lambda?, where \\lambda? is a factor related to system parameters and demand characteristics, for single coflow scheduling in hybridswitched DCN to minimize the coflow completion time (CCT). Extensive simulations based on Facebook data traces show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes Solstice by 1.14? and Reco-Sin by 1.42? in terms of minimizing CCT. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in medical image classification and achieve remarkable classification performance. These achievements heavily depend on large-scale accurately annotated training data. However, label noise is inevitably introduced in the medical image annotation, as the labeling process heavily relies on the expertise and experience of annotators. Meanwhile, DNNs suffer from overfitting noisy labels, degrading the performance of models. Therefore, in this work, we innovatively devise noise-robust training approach to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy labels in medical image classification. Specifically, we incorporate contrastive learning and intra-group attention mixup strategies into the vanilla supervised learning. The contrastive learning for feature extractor helps to enhance visual representation of DNNs. The intra-group attention mixup module constructs groups and assigns self-attention weights for group-wise samples, and subsequently interpolates massive noisy-suppressed samples through weighted mixup operation. We conduct comparative experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy medical datasets under various noise levels. Rigorous experiments validate that our noise-robust method with contrastive learning and attention mixup can effectively handle with label noise, and is superior to state-of-the-art methods. An ablation study also shows that both components contribute to boost model performance. The proposed method demonstrates its capability of curb label noise and has certain potential toward real-world clinic applications. ",

However, GFlowMeta suffers from performance degradation when encountering heterogeneous transitions from distinct tasks. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a personalized approach named pGFlowMeta, which combines task-specific personalized policies with a meta policy. Each personalized policy balances the loss on its personalized task and the difference from the meta policy, while the meta policy aims to minimize the average loss of all tasks.

Linguistic studies in these languages have identified a connection between gender bias and politeness levels, however it is not yet known if language models reproduce these biases. We analyze relative prediction probabilities of the male and female grammatical genders using templates and find that informal polite speech is most indicative of the female grammatical gender, while rude and formal speech is most indicative of the male grammatical gender. Further, we find politeness levels to be an attack vector for allocational gender bias in cyberbullying detection models. Cyberbullies can evade detection through simple techniques abusing politeness levels. We introduce an attack dataset to (i) identify representational gender bias across politeness levels, (ii) demonstrate how gender biases can be abused to bypass cyberbullying detection models and (iii) show that allocational biases can be mitigated via training on our proposed dataset.

    "abstract": "To automate harvesting and de-leafing of tomato plants using robots, it is important to search and detect the relevant plant parts, namely tomatoes, peduncles, and petioles. This is challenging due to high levels of occlusion in tomato greenhouses. Active vision is a promising approach which helps robots to deliberately plan camera viewpoints to overcome occlusion and improve perception accuracy. However, current active-vision algorithms cannot differentiate between relevant and irrelevant plant parts, making them inefficient for targeted perception of specific plant parts. We propose a semantic active-vision strategy that uses semantic information to identify the relevant plant parts and prioritises them during view planning using an attention mechanism. We evaluated our strategy using 3D models of tomato plants with varying structural complexity, which closely represented occlusions in the real world. We used a simulated environment to gain insights into our strategy, while ensuring repeatability and statistical significance. At the end of ten viewpoints, our strategy was able to correctly detect 85.5% of the plant parts, about 4 parts more on average per plant compared to a volumetric active-vision strategy. Also, it detected 5 and 9 parts more compared to two predefined strategies and 11 parts more compared to a random strategy. It also performed reliably with a median of 88.9% correctly-detected objects per plant in 96 experiments. Our strategy was also robust to uncertainty in plant and plant-part position, plant complexity, and different viewpoint sampling strategies. We believe that our work could significantly improve the speed and robustness of automated harvesting and de-leafing in tomato crop production. ",

    "abstract": "Disaster mapping is a critical task that often requires on-site experts and is time-consuming. To address this, a comprehensive framework is presented for fast and accurate recognition of disasters using machine learning, termed DisasterNets. It consists of two stages, space granulation and attribute granulation. The space granulation stage leverages supervised/semi-supervised learning, unsupervised change detection, and domain adaptation with/without source data techniques to handle different disaster mapping scenarios. Furthermore, the disaster database with the corresponding geographic information field properties is built by using the attribute granulation stage. The framework is applied to earthquake-triggered landslide mapping and large-scale flood mapping. The results demonstrate a competitive performance for high-precision, high-efficiency, and cross-scene recognition of disasters. To bridge the gap between disaster mapping and machine learning communities, we will provide an openly accessible tool based on DisasterNets. The framework and tool will be available at https://github.com/HydroPML/DisasterNets. ",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the potential of 5G new radio (NR) Time-of-Arrival (TOA) data for indoor drone localization under different scenarios and conditions when fused with inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. Our approach involves performing graph-based optimization to estimate the drone's position and orientation from the multiple sensor measurements. Due to the lack of real-world data, we use Matlab 5G toolbox and QuaDRiGa (quasi-deterministic radio channel generator) channel simulator to generate TOA measurements for the EuRoC MAV indoor dataset that provides IMU readings and ground truths 6DoF poses of a flying drone. Hence, we create twelve sequences combining three predefined indoor scenarios setups of QuaDRiGa with 2 to 5 base station antennas. Therefore, experimental results demonstrate that, for a sufficient number of base stations and a high bandwidth 5G configuration, the pose graph optimization approach achieves accurate drone localization, with an average error of less than 15 cm on the overall trajectory. Furthermore, the adopted graph-based optimization algorithm is fast and can be easily implemented for onboard real-time pose tracking on a micro aerial vehicle (MAV). ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks (AA). For an image recognition task, this means that a small perturbation of the original can result in the image being misclassified. Design of such attacks as well as methods of adversarial training against them are subject of intense research. We re-cast the problem using techniques of Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and obtain novel contributions leveraging recent insights from DRO sensitivity analysis. We consider a set of distributional threat models. Unlike the traditional pointwise attacks, which assume a uniform bound on perturbation of each input data point, distributional threat models allow attackers to perturb inputs in a non-uniform way. We link these more general attacks with questions of out-of-sample performance and Knightian uncertainty. To evaluate the distributional robustness of neural networks, we propose a first-order AA algorithm and its multi-step version. Our attack algorithms include Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) as special cases. Furthermore, we provide a new asymptotic estimate of the adversarial accuracy against distributional threat models. The bound is fast to compute and first-order accurate, offering new insights even for the pointwise AA. It also naturally yields out-of-sample performance guarantees. We conduct numerical experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset using DNNs on RobustBench to illustrate our theoretical results.

    "abstract": "With the current ubiquity of deep learning methods to solve computer vision and remote sensing specific tasks, the need for labelled data is growing constantly. However, in many cases, the annotation process can be long and tedious depending on the expertise needed to perform reliable annotations. In order to alleviate this need for annotations, several self-supervised methods have recently been proposed in the literature. The core principle behind these methods is to learn an image encoder using solely unlabelled data samples. In earth observation, there are opportunities to exploit domain-specific remote sensing image data in order to improve these methods. Specifically, by leveraging the geographical position associated with each image, it is possible to cross reference a location captured from multiple sensors, leading to multiple views of the same locations. In this paper, we briefly review the core principles behind so-called joint-embeddings methods and investigate the usage of multiple remote sensing modalities in self-supervised pre-training. We evaluate the final performance of the resulting encoders on the task of methane source classification. ",

The main contributions of this paper are twofold: First, a reduced student architecture with optimal layer selection is proposed, then a new Student-Teacher architecture with network bias reduction combining two teachers is proposed in order to jointly enhance the performance of anomaly detection and its localization accuracy.

The framework takes into account the structure of neural network-based constitutive models, in particular, that their derivatives are more complex compared to analytical models. The proposed framework allows for convenient mixed Hu-Washizu like finite element formulations applicable to nearly incompressible material behavior. The key feature of this work is a tailored energy-momentum scheme for time discretization, which allows for energy and momentum preserving dynamical simulations. Both the mixed formulation and the energy-momentum discretization are applied in finite element analysis. For this, a hyperelastic physics-augmented neural network model is calibrated to data generated with an analytical potential. In all finite element simulations, the proposed discretization techniques show excellent performance. All of this demonstrates that, from a formal point of view, neural networks are essentially mathematical functions. As such, they can be applied in numerical methods as straightforwardly as analytical constitutive models. Nevertheless, their special structure suggests to tailor advanced discretization methods, to arrive at compact mathematical formulations and convenient implementations. ",

We developed and employed a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based approach, using a hierarchical multi-step BERT model (BERT-MS) to predict the prescription of targeted cancer therapy to patients based solely on documentation by clinical social workers. Our corpus included free-text clinical social work notes, combined with medication prescription information, for all patients treated for breast cancer. We conducted a feature importance analysis to pinpoint the specific social circumstances that impact cancer therapy selection. Using only social work notes, we consistently predicted the administration of targeted therapies, suggesting systematic differences in treatment selection exist due to non-clinical factors. The UCSF-BERT model, pretrained on clinical text at UCSF, outperformed other publicly available language models with an AUROC of 0.675 and a Macro F1 score of 0.599. The UCSF BERT-MS model, capable of leveraging multiple pieces of notes, surpassed the UCSF-BERT model in both AUROC and Macro-F1. Our feature importance analysis identified several clinically intuitive social determinants of health (SDOH) that potentially contribute to disparities in treatment. Our findings indicate that significant disparities exist among breast cancer patients receiving different types of therapies based on social determinants of health. Social work reports play a crucial role in understanding these disparities in clinical decision-making. ",

This dilemma arises from the numerous zeros and over-dispersed demand patterns within these matrices, which challenge the Gaussian assumption inherent to deterministic deep learning models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach: the Spatial-Temporal Tweedie Graph Neural Network (STTD). The STTD introduces the Tweedie distribution as a compelling alternative to the traditional 'zero-inflated' model and leverages spatial and temporal embeddings to parameterize travel demand distributions. Our evaluations using real-world datasets highlight STTD's superiority in providing accurate predictions and precise confidence intervals, particularly in high-resolution scenarios. ",

In the latter case, it can reduce the amount of data to downlink by pruning the cloudy areas, or to make a satellite more autonomous through data-driven acquisition re-scheduling. We approach this task with nnU-Nets, a self-reconfigurable framework able to perform meta-learning of a segmentation network over various datasets. Unfortunately, such models are commonly memory-inefficient due to their (very) large architectures. To benefit from them in on-board processing, we compress nnU-Nets with knowledge distillation into much smaller and compact U-Nets. Our experiments, performed over Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images revealed that nnU-Nets deliver state-of-the-art performance without any manual design. Our approach was ranked within the top 7% best solutions (across 847 teams) in the On Cloud N: Cloud Cover Detection Challenge, where we reached the Jaccard index of 0.882 over more than 10k unseen Sentinel-2 images (the winners obtained 0.897, the baseline U-Net with the ResNet-34 backbone: 0.817, and the classic Sentinel-2 image thresholding: 0.652). Finally, we showed that knowledge distillation enables to elaborate dramatically smaller (almost 280x) U-Nets when compared to nnU-Nets while still maintaining their segmentation capabilities. ",

Self-repair -- in which the model debugs and fixes mistakes in its own code -- has recently become a popular way to boost performance in these settings. However, only very limited studies on how and when self-repair works effectively exist in the literature, and one might wonder to what extent a model is really capable of providing accurate feedback on why the code is wrong when that code was generated by the same model. In this paper, we analyze GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's ability to perform self-repair on APPS, a challenging dataset consisting of diverse coding challenges. To do so, we first establish a new evaluation strategy dubbed pass@t that measures the pass rate of the tasks against the total number of tokens sampled from the model, enabling a fair comparison to purely sampling-based approaches. With this evaluation strategy, we find that the effectiveness of self-repair is only seen in GPT-4. We also observe that self-repair is bottlenecked by the feedback stage; using GPT-4 to give feedback on the programs generated by GPT-3.5 and using expert human programmers to give feedback on the programs generated by GPT-4, we unlock significant performance gains.

    "abstract": "Malware detectors based on machine learning (ML) have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial malware examples. However, current methods to generate adversarial malware examples still have their limits. They either rely on detailed model information (gradient-based attacks), or on detailed outputs of the model - such as class probabilities (score-based attacks), neither of which are available in real-world scenarios. Alternatively, adversarial examples might be crafted using only the label assigned by the detector (label-based attack) to train a substitute network or an agent using reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, label-based attacks might require querying a black-box system from a small number to thousands of times, depending on the approach, which might not be feasible against malware detectors. This work presents a novel query-free approach to craft adversarial malware examples to evade ML-based malware detectors. To this end, we have devised a GAN-based framework to generate adversarial malware examples that look similar to benign executables in the feature space. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach we have applied the GAN-based attack to three common types of features usually employed by static ML-based malware detectors: (1) Byte histogram features, (2) API-based features, and (3) String-based features. Results show that our model-agnostic approach performs on par with MalGAN, while generating more realistic adversarial malware examples without requiring any query to the malware detectors. Furthermore, we have tested the generated adversarial examples against state-of-the-art multimodal and deep learning malware detectors, showing a decrease in detection performance, as well as a decrease in the average number of detections by the anti-malware engines in VirusTotal.

Therefore, anomaly detection for workflows is an important paradigm that aims to identify unexpected behavior or errors in workflow execution.

In addition, in terms of sustainability, it is essential to find methods to reduce the energy consumption of mobile devices since the extensive use of billions of smartphones worldwide significantly impacts the environment. Despite the existence of several energy-efficient programming practices in Android, the leading mobile ecosystem, machine learning-based energy prediction algorithms for mobile App development have yet to be reported. Therefore, this paper proposes a histogram-based gradient boosting classification machine (HGBC), boosted by a metaheuristic approach, for energy prediction in mobile App development. Our metaheuristic approach is responsible for two issues. First, it finds redundant and irrelevant features without any noticeable change in performance. Second, it performs a hyper-parameter tuning for the HGBC algorithm. Since our proposed metaheuristic approach is algorithm-independent, we selected 12 algorithms for the search strategy to find the optimal search algorithm. Our finding shows that a success-history-based parameter adaption for differential evolution with linear population size (L-SHADE) offers the best performance. It can improve performance and decrease the number of features effectively. Our extensive set of experiments clearly shows that our proposed approach can provide significant results for energy consumption prediction. ",

The ability to subvert a model into making errant predictions using seemingly inconsequential changes to input is startling, as is our lack of success in building models robust to this concern. Existing research shows progress, but current mitigations come with a high cost and simultaneously reduce the model's accuracy. However, such trade-offs may not be necessary when other design choices could subvert the risk. In this survey we review the current literature on attacks and their real-world occurrences, or limited evidence thereof, to critically evaluate the real-world risks of adversarial machine learning (AML) for the average entity. This is done with an eye toward how one would then mitigate these attacks in practice, the risks for production deployment, and how those risks could be managed. In doing so we elucidate that many AML threats do not warrant the cost and trade-offs of robustness due to a low likelihood of attack or availability of superior non-ML mitigations. Our analysis also recommends cases where an actor should be concerned about AML to the degree where robust ML models are necessary for a complete deployment. ",

In particular, we consider linearly separable data for which a relatively small proportion of labels are corrupted or flipped. We identify conditions on the margin of the clean data that give rise to three distinct training outcomes: benign overfitting, in which zero loss is achieved and with high probability test data is classified correctly; overfitting, in which zero loss is achieved but test data is misclassified with probability lower bounded by a constant; and non-overfitting, in which clean points, but not corrupt points, achieve zero loss and again with high probability test data is classified correctly. Our analysis provides a fine-grained description of the dynamics of neurons throughout training and reveals two distinct phases: in the first phase clean points achieve close to zero loss, in the second phase clean points oscillate on the boundary of zero loss while corrupt points either converge towards zero loss or are eventually zeroed by the network. We prove these results using a combinatorial approach that involves bounding the number of clean versus corrupt updates across these phases of training. ",

    "title": "HePCo: Data-Free Heterogeneous Prompt Consolidation for Continual  Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the important yet understudied problem of Continual Federated Learning (CFL), where a server communicates with a set of clients to incrementally learn new concepts over time without sharing or storing any data. The complexity of this problem is compounded by challenges from both the Continual and Federated Learning perspectives. Specifically, models trained in a CFL setup suffer from catastrophic forgetting which is exacerbated by data heterogeneity across clients. Existing attempts at this problem tend to impose large overheads on clients and communication channels or require access to stored data which renders them unsuitable for real-world use due to privacy. In this paper, we attempt to tackle forgetting and heterogeneity while minimizing overhead costs and without requiring access to any stored data. We achieve this by leveraging a prompting based approach (such that only prompts and classifier heads have to be communicated) and proposing a novel and lightweight generation and distillation scheme to consolidate client models at the server. We formulate this problem for image classification and establish strong baselines for comparison, conduct experiments on CIFAR-100 as well as challenging, large-scale datasets like ImageNet-R and DomainNet. Our approach outperforms both existing methods and our own baselines by as much as 7% while significantly reducing communication and client-level computation costs. ",

Our experiments were performed on the VCC2018 dataset and a Brazilian-Portuguese dataset called BRSpeechMOS, which was created for this work. The results show that the Whisper model is appropriate in all scenarios: with both the VCC2018 and BRSpeech- MOS datasets. Among the supervised and self-supervised learning models using BRSpeechMOS, Whisper-Small achieved the best linear correlation of 0.6980, and the speaker verification model, SpeakerNet, had linear correlation of 0.6963. Using VCC2018, the best supervised and self-supervised learning model, Whisper-Large, achieved linear correlation of 0.7274, and the best model speaker verification, TitaNet, achieved a linear correlation of 0.6933. Although the results of the speaker verification models are slightly lower, the SpeakerNet model has only 5M parameters, making it suitable for real-time applications, and the TitaNet model produces an embedding of size 192, the smallest among all the evaluated models.

Heart diseases or cardiovascular diseases are classified into four types: coronary heart disease, heart failure, congenital heart disease, and cardiomyopathy.

As a result, we need a system that can predict cardiovascular disease before it becomes a critical situation. Machine learning has piqued the interest of researchers in the field of medical sciences. For heart disease prediction, researchers implement a variety of machine learning methods and approaches. In this work, to the best of our knowledge, we have used the dataset from IEEE Data Port which is one of the online available largest datasets for cardiovascular diseases individuals. The dataset isa combination of Hungarian, Cleveland, Long Beach VA, Switzerland & Statlog datasets with important features such as Maximum Heart Rate Achieved, Serum Cholesterol, Chest Pain Type, Fasting blood sugar, and so on. To assess the efficacy and strength of the developed model, several performance measures are used, such as ROC, AUC curve, specificity, F1-score, sensitivity, MCC, and accuracy. In this study, we have proposed a framework with a stacked ensemble classifier using several machine learning algorithms including ExtraTrees Classifier, Random Forest, XGBoost, and so on.

Instead of underperforming and getting trapped in local minima due to the batch noise, SGD leverages it to learn to generalize better and find minima that are good enough for the entire dataset. This led to numerous theoretical and experimental investigations, especially in the context of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), leading to better machine learning algorithms. However, SGD is not applicable in a non-differentiable setting, leaving all that prior research off the table. In this paper, we show that a class of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) inspired by the Gillespie-Orr Mutational Landscapes model for natural evolution is formally equivalent to SGD in certain settings and, in practice, is well adapted to large ANNs. We refer to such EAs as Gillespie-Orr EA class (GO-EAs) and empirically show how an insight transfer from SGD can work for them. We then show that for ANNs trained to near-optimality or in the transfer learning setting, the equivalence also allows transferring the insights from the Mutational Landscapes model to SGD. We then leverage this equivalence to experimentally show how SGD and GO-EAs can provide mutual insight through examples of minima flatness, transfer learning, and mixing of individuals in EAs applied to large models.

In this paper, we introduce a novel integration scheme that combines the multi-view stereo with neural signed distance function representations, which potentially overcomes the limitations of both methods. MVS uses per-view depth estimation and cross-view fusion to generate accurate surface, while NIS relies on a common coordinate volume. Based on this, we propose to construct per-view cost frustum for finer geometry estimation, and then fuse cross-view frustums and estimate the implicit signed distance functions to tackle noise and hole issues. We further apply a cascade frustum fusion strategy to effectively captures global-local information and structural consistency. Finally, we apply cascade sampling and a pseudo-geometric loss to foster stronger integration between the two architectures.

Existing methods for enhancing privacy fail to generate naturalistic images that can protect facial privacy without compromising user experience. We propose a novel two-step approach for facial privacy protection that relies on finding adversarial latent codes in the low-dimensional manifold of a pretrained generative model. The first step inverts the given face image into the latent space and finetunes the generative model to achieve an accurate reconstruction of the given image from its latent code. This step produces a good initialization, aiding the generation of high-quality faces that resemble the given identity. Subsequently, user-defined makeup text prompts and identity-preserving regularization are used to guide the search for adversarial codes in the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that faces generated by our approach have stronger black-box transferability with an absolute gain of 12.06% over the state-of-the-art facial privacy protection approach under the face verification task. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for commercial face recognition systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/fahadshamshad/Clip2Protect. ",

However, existing perception tasks like object detection, road structure segmentation, depth & elevation estimation, and open-set object localization each only focus on a small facet of the holistic 3D scene understanding task. This divide-and-conquer strategy simplifies the algorithm development procedure at the cost of losing an end-to-end unified solution to the problem. In this work, we address this limitation by studying camera-based 3D panoptic segmentation, aiming to achieve a unified occupancy representation for camera-only 3D scene understanding. To achieve this, we introduce a novel method called PanoOcc, which utilizes voxel queries to aggregate spatiotemporal information from multi-frame and multi-view images in a coarse-to-fine scheme, integrating feature learning and scene representation into a unified occupancy representation. We have conducted extensive ablation studies to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results for camera-based semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation on the nuScenes dataset. Furthermore, our method can be easily extended to dense occupancy prediction and has shown promising performance on the Occ3D benchmark.

However, the biological determinants through which changes in multi-omics measurements influence cellular morphology have not yet been systematically explored, and the degree to which cell imaging could potentially enable the prediction of multi-omics directly from cell imaging data is therefore currently unclear. Here, we address the question of whether it is possible to predict bulk multi-omics measurements directly from cell images using Image2Omics -- a deep learning approach that predicts multi-omics in a cell population directly from high-content images stained with multiplexed fluorescent dyes. We perform an experimental evaluation in gene-edited macrophages derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) under multiple stimulation conditions and demonstrate that Image2Omics achieves significantly better performance in predicting transcriptomics and proteomics measurements directly from cell images than predictors based on the mean observed training set abundance. We observed significant predictability of abundances for 5903 (22.43%; 95% CI: 8.77%, 38.88%) and 5819 (22.11%; 95% CI: 10.40%, 38.08%) transcripts out of 26137 in M1 and M2-stimulated macrophages respectively and for 1933 (38.77%; 95% CI: 36.94%, 39.85%) and 2055 (41.22%; 95% CI: 39.31%, 42.42%) proteins out of 4986 in M1 and M2-stimulated macrophages respectively. Our results show that some transcript and protein abundances are predictable from cell imaging and that cell imaging may potentially, in some settings and depending on the mechanisms of interest and desired performance threshold, even be a scalable and resource-efficient substitute for multi-omics measurements.

The majority of existing anomaly detection methods either are exclusively developed for (semi) supervised settings, or provide poor performance in unsupervised applications where there is no training data with labeled anomalous samples. To bridge this research gap, we introduce a robust, efficient, and interpretable methodology based on nonlinear manifold learning to detect anomalies in unsupervised settings. The essence of our approach is to learn a low-dimensional and interpretable latent representation (aka manifold) for all the data points such that normal samples are automatically clustered together and hence can be easily and robustly identified. We learn this low-dimensional manifold by designing a learning algorithm that leverages either a latent map Gaussian process (LMGP) or a deep autoencoder (AE). Our LMGP-based approach, in particular, provides a probabilistic perspective on the learning task and is ideal for high-dimensional applications with scarce data. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over existing technologies via multiple analytic examples and real-world datasets. ",

We derive guarantees on worst-case, finite-sample false-positive rate (FPR) over the family of all distributions with bounded second moment. Thus, our method is the first OCPD algorithm that guarantees finite-sample FPR, even if the data is high dimensional and the underlying distributions are heavy-tailed. The technical contribution of our paper is to show that clipped-SGD can estimate the mean of a random vector and simultaneously provide confidence bounds at all confidence values. We combine this robust estimate with a union bound argument and construct a sequential change-point algorithm with finite-sample FPR guarantees. We show empirically that our algorithm works well in a variety of situations, whether the underlying data are heavy-tailed, light-tailed, high dimensional or discrete.

In this work, we concentrate on the specific type of these models: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). First, we unveil a significant theoretical flaw in the assumption of the classical VAE model. Second, we enforce an accommodating topological property to the image of the deep neural mapping to the latent space: compactness to alleviate the flaw and obtain the means to provably bound the image within the determined limits by squeezing both inliers and outliers together. We enforce compactness using two approaches: (i) Alexandroff extension and (ii) fixed Lipschitz continuity constant on the mapping of the encoder of the VAEs. Finally and most importantly, we discover that the anomalous inputs predominantly tend to land on the vacant latent holes within the compact space, enabling their successful identification. For that reason, we introduce a specifically devised score for hole detection and evaluate the solution against several baseline benchmarks achieving promising results. ",

However, existing INR-based methods have failed to deliver rate quality performance comparable with the state of the art in video compression. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the employed network architectures, which limit their representation capability. In this paper, we propose HiNeRV, an INR that combines bilinear interpolation with novel hierarchical positional encoding. This structure employs depth-wise convolutional and MLP layers to build a deep and wide network architecture with much higher capacity. We further build a video codec based on HiNeRV and a refined pipeline for training, pruning and quantization that can better preserve HiNeRV's performance during lossy model compression. The proposed method has been evaluated on both UVG and MCL-JCV datasets for video compression, demonstrating significant improvement over all existing INRs baselines and competitive performance when compared to learning-based codecs (72.3% overall bit rate saving over HNeRV and 43.4% over DCVC on the UVG dataset, measured in PSNR).

The proposed DNN processing can provide both aliasing-free radar imaging and super-resolution. The results are validated by measuring the detection performance on realistic simulation data and by evaluating the Point-Spread-function (PSF) and the target-separation performance on measured point-like targets. Also, a qualitative evaluation of a typical automotive scene is conducted. It is shown that this approach can outperform state-of-the-art subspace algorithms and also other existing machine learning solutions. The presented results suggest that machine learning approaches trained with sufficiently sophisticated virtual input data are a very promising alternative to compressed sensing and subspace approaches in radar signal processing. The key to this performance is that the DNN is trained using realistic simulation data that perfectly mimic a given sparse antenna radar array hardware as the input. As ground truth, ultra-high resolution data from an enhanced virtual radar are simulated. Contrary to other work, the DNN utilizes the complete radar cube and not only the antenna channel information at certain range-Doppler detections. After training, the proposed DNN is capable of sidelobe- and ambiguity-free imaging. It simultaneously delivers nearly the same resolution and image quality as would be achieved with a fully occupied array. ",

    "abstract": "Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) measures a scene from multiple views in order to increase the resolution of reconstructed imagery. Image reconstruction methods for SAS coherently combine measurements to focus acoustic energy onto the scene. However, image formation is typically under-constrained due to a limited number of measurements and bandlimited hardware, which limits the capabilities of existing reconstruction methods. To help meet these challenges, we design an analysis-by-synthesis optimization that leverages recent advances in neural rendering to perform coherent SAS imaging. Our optimization enables us to incorporate physics-based constraints and scene priors into the image formation process. We validate our method on simulation and experimental results captured in both air and water. We demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that our method typically produces superior reconstructions than existing approaches. We share code and data for reproducibility. ",

    "title": "The temporal dynamics of group interactions in higher-order social  networks",
    "abstract": "The structure and behaviour of many social systems are shaped by the interactions among their individuals. Representing them as complex networks has shed light on the mechanisms that govern their formation and evolution. Such representations, however, focus on interactions between pairs of individuals (represented by the edges of the network), although many social interactions involve instead groups: these can be represented as hyperedges, that can comprehend any number of individuals, leading to the use of higher-order network representations. While recent research has investigated the structure of static higher-order networks, little is known about the mechanisms that govern their evolution. How do groups form and develop? How do people move between different groups? Here, we investigate the temporal dynamics of group change, using empirical social interactions collected in different settings. We leverage proximity records from two data-collection efforts that have tracked the temporal evolution of social interactions among students of a university and children in a preschool. We study the mechanisms governing the temporal dynamics both at the node and group level, characterising how individuals navigate groups and how groups form and disaggregate, finding robust patterns across contexts. We then propose a dynamical hypergraph model that closely reproduces the empirical observations. These results represent a further step in understanding the social dynamics of higher-order interactions, stressing the importance of considering their temporal aspect. The proposed model moreover opens up research directions to study the impact of higher-order temporal network patterns on dynamical processes that evolve on top of them. ",

Existing methods that provably achieve the optimal mislabeling error, such as the Lloyd algorithm, are usually vulnerable to outliers. In contrast, clustering methods seemingly robust to adversarial perturbations are not known to satisfy the optimal statistical guarantees. We propose a simple algorithm that obtains the optimal mislabeling rate even when we allow adversarial outliers to be present. Our algorithm achieves the optimal error rate in constant iterations when a weak initialization condition is satisfied. In the absence of outliers, in fixed dimensions, our theoretical guarantees are similar to that of the Lloyd algorithm. Extensive experiments on various simulated data sets are conducted to support the theoretical guarantees of our method. ",

    "abstract": "Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential climate variable that can be measured via ground truth, remote sensing, or hybrid model methodologies. Here, we celebrate SST surveillance progress via the application of a few relevant technological advances from the late 20th and early 21st century. We further develop our existing water cycle observation framework, Flux to Flow (F2F), to fuse AMSR-E and MODIS into a higher resolution product with the goal of capturing gradients and filling cloud gaps that are otherwise unavailable. Our neural network architecture is constrained to a deep convolutional residual regressive neural network. We utilize three snapshots of twelve monthly SST measurements in 2010 as measured by the passive microwave radiometer AMSR-E, the visible and infrared monitoring MODIS instrument, and the in situ Argo dataset ISAS. The performance of the platform and success of this approach is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric. We determine that the 1:1 configuration of input and output data and a large observation region is too challenging for the single compute node and dcrrnn structure as is. When constrained to a single 100 x 100 pixel region and a small training dataset, the algorithm improves from the baseline experiment covering a much larger geography. For next discrete steps, we envision the consideration of a large input range with a very small output range. Furthermore, we see the need to integrate land and sea variables before performing computer vision tasks like those within. Finally, we see parallelization as necessary to overcome the compute obstacles we encountered. ",
