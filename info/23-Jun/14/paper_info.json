    "abstract": "Code pre-trained models (CodePTMs) have recently demonstrated a solid capacity to process various software intelligence tasks, e.g., code clone detection, code translation, and code summarization. The current mainstream method that deploys these models to downstream tasks is to fine-tune them on individual tasks, which is generally costly and needs sufficient data for large models. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we present TransCoder, a unified Transferable fine-tuning strategy for Code representation learning. Inspired by human inherent skills of knowledge generalization, TransCoder drives the model to learn better code-related meta-knowledge like human programmers. Specifically, we employ a tunable prefix encoder as the meta-learner to capture cross-task and cross-language transferable knowledge, respectively. Besides, tasks with minor training sample sizes and languages with small corpus can be remarkably benefited from our approach. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate that our method can lead to superior performance on various code-related tasks and encourage mutual reinforcement. We also show that TransCoder is applicable in low-resource scenarios. ",

    "title": "Urban Spatiotemporal Data Synthesis via Neural Disaggregation",
    "abstract": "The level of granularity of open data often conflicts the benefits it can provide. Less granular data can protect individual privacy, but to certain degrees, sabotage the promise of open data to promote transparency and assist research. Similar in the urban setting, aggregated urban data at high-level geographic units can mask out the underline particularities of city dynamics that may vary at lower areal levels. In this work, we aim to synthesize fine-grained, high resolution urban data, by breaking down aggregated urban data at coarse, low resolution geographic units. The goal is to increase the usability and realize the values as much as possible of highly aggregated urban data. To address the issue of simplicity of some traditional disaggregation methods -- 1) we experimented with numerous neural-based models that are capable of modeling intricate non-linear relationships among features. Neural methods can also leverage both spatial and temporal information concurrently. We showed that all neural methods perform better than traditional disaggregation methods. Incorporating the temporal information further enhances the results. 2) We proposed a training approach for disaggregation task, Chain-of-Training (COT), that can be incorporated into any of the training-based models. COT adds transitional disaggregation steps by incorporating intermediate geographic dimensions, which enhances the predictions at low geographic level and boosts the results at higher levels. 3) We adapted the idea of reconstruction (REC) from super-resolution domain in our disaggregation case -- after disaggregating from low to high geographic level, we then re-aggregate back to the low level from our generated high level values. Both strategies improved disaggregation results on three datasets and two cities we tested on. ",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied in a range of fields such as image classification and object segmentation. To improve their expressivity, various techniques, such as novel CNN architectures, have been explored. However, the performance gain from such techniques tends to diminish. To address this challenge, many researchers have shifted their focus to increasing the non-linearity of neurons, the fundamental building blocks of neural networks, to enhance the network expressivity. Nevertheless, most of these approaches incur a large number of parameters and thus formidable computation cost inevitably, impairing their efficiency to be deployed in practice. In this work, an efficient quadratic neuron structure is proposed to preserve the non-linearity with only negligible parameter and computation cost overhead. The proposed quadratic neuron can maximize the utilization of second-order computation information to improve the network performance. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed quadratic neuron can achieve a higher accuracy and a better computation efficiency in classification tasks compared with both linear neurons and non-linear neurons from previous works.

Pretrained large language models (LLMs) demonstrated exceptional performance in these tasks. This study aims to explore the utilization of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, for data augmentation to overcome the limited availability of annotated data for identifying the key factors in EHRs. Additionally, different pre-trained BERT models, initially trained on extensive datasets like Wikipedia and MIMIC, were employed to develop models for identifying these key variables in EHRs through fine-tuning on augmented datasets. The experimental results of two EHR analysis tasks, namely medication identification and medication event classification, indicate that data augmentation based on ChatGPT proves beneficial in improving performance for both medication identification and medication event classification.

    "abstract": "Explainability poses a major challenge to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Current studies on explainable AI (XAI) lack the efficiency of extracting global knowledge about the learning task, thus suffer deficiencies such as imprecise saliency, context-aware absence and vague meaning. In this paper, we propose the class association embedding (CAE) approach to address these issues. We employ an encoder-decoder architecture to embed sample features and separate them into class-related and individual-related style vectors simultaneously. Recombining the individual-style code of a given sample with the class-style code of another leads to a synthetic sample with preserved individual characters but changed class assignment, following a cyclic adversarial learning strategy. Class association embedding distills the global class-related features of all instances into a unified domain with well separation between classes. The transition rules between different classes can be then extracted and further employed to individual instances. We then propose an active XAI framework which manipulates the class-style vector of a certain sample along guided paths towards the counter-classes, resulting in a series of counter-example synthetic samples with identical individual characters. Comparing these counterfactual samples with the original ones provides a global, intuitive illustration to the nature of the classification tasks. We adopt the framework on medical image classification tasks, which show that more precise saliency maps with powerful context-aware representation can be achieved compared with existing methods. Moreover, the disease pathology can be directly visualized via traversing the paths in the class-style space. ",

Additionally, some parts of the LiDAR data may be occluded and parts of the data may be missing due to hardware malfunction or weather conditions. This work presents a novel fusion step that addresses data corruptions and makes sensor fusion for 3D object detection more robust.

A major challenge therein is the effective 6DoF grasping of objects in cluttered environments from any viewpoint without requiring additional scene exploration. We introduce $\\textit{NeuGraspNet}$, a novel method for 6DoF grasp detection that leverages recent advances in neural volumetric representations and surface rendering. Our approach learns both global (scene-level) and local (grasp-level) neural surface representations, enabling effective and fully implicit 6DoF grasp quality prediction, even in unseen parts of the scene. Further, we reinterpret grasping as a local neural surface rendering problem, allowing the model to encode the interaction between the robot's end-effector and the object's surface geometry. NeuGraspNet operates on single viewpoints and can sample grasp candidates in occluded scenes, outperforming existing implicit and semi-implicit baseline methods in the literature. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of NeuGraspNet with a mobile manipulator robot, grasping in open spaces with clutter by rendering the scene, reasoning about graspable areas of different objects, and selecting grasps likely to succeed without colliding with the environment.

Our evaluation on nine web apps shows that WEBEMBED outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by detecting near-duplicates more accurately, inferring better web app models that exhibit 22% more precision, and 24% more recall on average. Consequently, the test suites generated from these models achieve higher code coverage, with improvements ranging from 2% to 59% on an app-wise basis and averaging at 23%. ",

In machine translation, majority of the language pairs around the world are considered low resource because they have little parallel data available and the quality of neural machine translation (NMT) systems depend a lot on the availability of sizable parallel corpora. We study and apply three simple data augmentation techniques popularly used in text classification tasks; synonym replacement, random insertion and contextual data augmentation and compare their performance with baseline neural machine translation for English-Swahili (En-Sw) datasets. We also present results in BLEU, ChrF and Meteor scores.

However, some recent work challenges the robustness of feature attributions by showing that these methods are sensitive to input and model perturbations, while other work addresses this robustness issue by proposing robust attribution methods and model modifications. Nevertheless, previous work on attribution robustness has focused primarily on gradient-based feature attributions. In contrast, the robustness properties of removal-based attribution methods are not comprehensively well understood. To bridge this gap, we theoretically characterize the robustness of removal-based feature attributions. Specifically, we provide a unified analysis of such methods and prove upper bounds for the difference between intact and perturbed attributions, under settings of both input and model perturbations. Our empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate their practical implications. ",

    "abstract": "An expurgating linear function (ELF) is a linear outer code that disallows the low-weight codewords of the inner code. ELFs can be designed either to maximize the minimum distance or to minimize the codeword error rate (CER) of the expurgated code. List decoding of the inner code from the noiseless all-zeros codeword is an efficient way to identify ELFs that maximize the minimum distance of the expurgated code. For convolutional inner codes, this paper provides distance spectrum union (DSU) upper bounds on the CER of the concatenated code. For short codeword lengths, ELFs transform a good inner code into a great concatenated code. For a constant message size of $K=64$ bits or constant codeword blocklength of $N=152$ bits, an ELF can reduce the gap at CER $10^{-6}$ between the DSU and the random-coding union (RCU) bounds from over 1 dB for the inner code alone to 0.23 dB for the concatenated code. The DSU bounds can also characterize puncturing that mitigates the rate overhead of the ELF while maintaining the DSU-to-RCU gap. The reduction in DSU-to-RCU gap comes with a minimal increase in average complexity. List Viterbi decoding guided by the ELF approaches maximum likelihood (ML) decoding of the concatenated code, and average list size converges to 1 as SNR increases. Thus, average complexity is similar to Viterbi decoding on the trellis of the inner code. For rare large-magnitude noise events, which occur less often than the FER of the inner code, a deep search in the list finds the ML codeword. ",

    "abstract": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are quickly gaining traction with promises of impressively low latency, high bandwidth, and global reach. However, the research community knows relatively little about their operation and performance in practice. The obscurity is largely due to the high barrier of entry for measuring LEO networks, which requires deploying specialized hardware or recruiting large numbers of satellite Internet customers. In this paper, we introduce LEO HitchHiking, a new methodology that democratizes global visibility into LEO satellite networks. HitchHiking builds on the observation that Internet exposed services that use LEO Internet can reveal satellite network architecture and performance, without needing physical hardware. We evaluate HitchHiking against ground truth measurements and prior methods, showing that it provides more coverage, speed, and accuracy. With HitchHiking, we complete the largest study to date of Starlink network latency, measuring over 1,600 users across 13~countries. We uncover unexpected patterns in latency that surface how LEO routing is more complex than previously understood. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for future research on LEO networks. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting ever-evolving social bots has become increasingly challenging. Advanced bots tend to interact more with humans as a camouflage to evade detection. While graph-based detection methods can exploit various relations in social networks to model node behaviors, the aggregated information from neighbors largely ignore the inherent heterophily, i.e., the connections between different classes of accounts. Message passing mechanism on heterophilic edges can lead to feature mixture between bots and normal users, resulting in more false negatives. In this paper, we present BotSCL, a heterophily-aware contrastive learning framework that can adaptively differentiate neighbor representations of heterophilic relations while assimilating the representations of homophilic neighbors. Specifically, we employ two graph augmentation methods to generate different graph views and design a channel-wise and attention-free encoder to overcome the limitation of neighbor information summing. Supervised contrastive learning is used to guide the encoder to aggregate class-specific information. Extensive experiments on two social bot detection benchmarks demonstrate that BotSCL outperforms baseline approaches including the state-of-the-art bot detection approaches, partially heterophilic GNNs and self-supervised contrast learning methods.

More precisely, we introduce a multi-task framework merging a supervised objective using ground-truth labels and a self-supervised objective relying on clustering assignments with a single cross-entropy loss. This approach may be interpreted as imposing the cluster centroids to be class prototypes. Despite its simplicity, we provide empirical evidence that our approach is highly effective and achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and ImageNet. ",

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for various conditions, there is a pressing need for the discovery of new medications. In this study, we propose a deep generative model that combines a stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based diffusion modeling with the latent space of a pretrained autoencoder model. The molecular generator enables efficient generation of molecules that are effective on multiple targets, specifically the mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. Furthermore, we assess the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of the generated molecules to identify drug-like compounds. To enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of some lead compounds, we employ a molecular optimization approach. We obtain a diverse set of drug-like molecules. We construct binding affinity predictors by integrating molecular fingerprints derived from autoencoder embeddings, transformer embeddings, and topological Laplacians with advanced machine learning algorithms. Further experimental studies are needed to evaluate the pharmacological effects of these drug-like compounds for OUD treatment. Our machine learning platform serves as a valuable tool in designing and optimizing effective molecules for addressing OUD. ",

    "abstract": "Most existing pre-trained language models for source code focus on learning the static code text, typically augmented with static code structures (abstract syntax tree, dependency graphs, etc.). However, program semantics will not be fully exposed before the real execution. Without an understanding of the program execution, statically pre-trained models fail to comprehensively capture the dynamic code properties, such as the branch coverage and the runtime variable values, and they are consequently less effective at code understanding tasks, such as retrieving semantic clones and detecting software vulnerabilities. To close the gap between the static nature of language models and the dynamic characteristics of programs, we introduce TRACED, an execution-aware pre-training strategy for source code. Specifically, we pre-train code language models with a combination of source code, executable inputs, and corresponding execution traces. Our goal is to teach code models the complicated execution logic during the pre-training, enabling the model to statically estimate the dynamic code properties without repeatedly executing code during task-specific fine-tuning. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we fine-tune and evaluate TRACED on three downstream tasks: static execution estimation, clone retrieval, and vulnerability detection. The empirical results show that TRACED relatively improves the statically pre-trained code models by 12.4% for complete execution path prediction and by 25.2% for runtime variable value predictions. TRACED also significantly outperforms statically pre-trained models in clone retrieval and vulnerability detection across four public benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Label error is a ubiquitous problem in annotated data. Large amounts of label error substantially degrades the quality of deep learning models. Existing methods to tackle the label error problem largely focus on the classification task, and either rely on task specific architecture or require non-trivial additional computations, which is undesirable or even unattainable for industry usage. In this paper, we propose LEDO: a model-agnostic and computationally efficient framework for Label Error Detection and Overwrite. LEDO is based on Monte Carlo Dropout combined with uncertainty metrics, and can be easily generalized to multiple tasks and data sets. Applying LEDO to an industry opinion-based question answering system demonstrates it is effective at improving accuracy in all the core models. Specifically, LEDO brings 1.1% MRR gain for the retrieval model, 1.5% PR AUC improvement for the machine reading comprehension model, and 0.9% rise in the Average Precision for the ranker, on top of the strong baselines with a large-scale social media dataset. Importantly, LEDO is computationally efficient compared to methods that require loss function change, and cost-effective as the resulting data can be used in the same continuous training pipeline for production. Further analysis shows that these gains come from an improved decision boundary after cleaning the label errors existed in the training data. ",

The new reasoning task is formulated as a noisy Positive-Unlabeled learning problem. We propose a variational framework, namely nPUGraph, that jointly estimates the correctness of both collected and uncollected facts (which we call \\textit{label posterior}) and updates model parameters during training. The label posterior estimation facilitates speculative reasoning from two perspectives. First, it improves the robustness of a label posterior-aware graph encoder against false positive links. Second, it identifies missing facts to provide high-quality grounds of reasoning. They are unified in a simple yet effective self-training procedure. Empirically, extensive experiments on three benchmark KG and one Twitter dataset with various degrees of false negative/positive cases demonstrate the effectiveness of nPUGraph. ",

Specifically, assuming a fixed set of predefined beams, we address an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem to obtain the optimal beam selection, Resource Block (RB), and transmit power allocation policy to serve URLLC and eMBB users on the same physical radio resources. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear fractional programming (MINLFP) problem considering minimum data rate and latency in packet delivery constraints. By leveraging the properties of fractional programming theory, we first transform the formulated non-convex optimization problem in fractional form into a tractable subtractive form. Subsequently, we solve the transformed problem using a two-loop iterative algorithm. The main resource-slicing problem is solved in the inner loop utilizing the difference of convex (DC) programming and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Subsequently, the outer loop is solved using the Dinkelbach method to acquire an improved solution in every iteration until it converges. Our simulation results illustrate the performance gains of the proposed methodology with respect to baseline algorithms with the fixed and mixed resource grid models. ",

Our evaluation leverages the recent release of the Noisy Measure File (NMF) as well as the availability of two independent runs of the TopDown algorithm applied to the 2010 decennial Census. We find that the NMF contains too much noise to be directly useful alone, especially for Hispanic and multiracial populations. TopDown's post-processing dramatically reduces the NMF noise and produces similarly accurate data to swapping in terms of bias and noise. These patterns hold across census geographies with varying population sizes and racial diversity. While the estimated errors for both TopDown and swapping are generally no larger than other sources of Census error, they can be relatively substantial for geographies with small total populations.

Applying these results along with new Rademacher complexity bounds for adversarial training near initialization, we prove that for general data distributions and perturbation sets, adversarial training on shallow networks with early stopping and an idealized optimal adversary is able to achieve optimal adversarial test error.

The main algorithmic novelty is in the design of SHAdaVar, which allocates budget greedily based on overestimating the unknown reward variances. We bound probabilities of misidentifying the best arms in both SHVar and SHAdaVar. Our analyses rely on novel lower bounds on the number of pulls of an arm that do not require closed-form solutions to the budget allocation problem. Since one of our budget allocation problems is analogous to the optimal experiment design with unknown variances, we believe that our results are of a broad interest.

In this work, we break these trade-offs with our novel parametric implicit face representation and propose a novel audio-driven facial reenactment framework that is both controllable and can generate high-quality talking heads. Specifically, our parametric implicit representation parameterizes the implicit representation with interpretable parameters of 3D face models, thereby taking the best of both explicit and implicit methods. In addition, we propose several new techniques to improve the three components of our framework, including i) incorporating contextual information into the audio-to-expression parameters encoding; ii) using conditional image synthesis to parameterize the implicit representation and implementing it with an innovative tri-plane structure for efficient learning; iii) formulating facial reenactment as a conditional image inpainting problem and proposing a novel data augmentation technique to improve model generalizability.

Taking inspiration from the analysis of neural networks' robustness against adversarial perturbations, we propose a novel gray-box algorithm for creating adversarial examples in image-to-text models. Unlike image classification tasks that have a finite set of class labels, finding visually similar adversarial examples in an image-to-text task poses greater challenges because the captioning system allows for a virtually infinite space of possible captions. In this paper, we present a gray-box adversarial attack on image-to-text, both untargeted and targeted. We formulate the process of discovering adversarial perturbations as an optimization problem that uses only the image-encoder component, meaning the proposed attack is language-model agnostic. Through experiments conducted on the ViT-GPT2 model, which is the most-used image-to-text model in Hugging Face, and the Flickr30k dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed attack successfully generates visually similar adversarial examples, both with untargeted and targeted captions. Notably, our attack operates in a gray-box manner, requiring no knowledge about the decoder module. We also show that our attacks fool the popular open-source platform Hugging Face. ",

While graphs with homophily-prone edges tend to connect nodes with the same class (i.e., intra-class nodes), heterophily-prone edges tend to build relationships between nodes with different classes (i.e., inter-class nodes). Existing GNNs only take the original graph during training. The problem with this approach is that it forgets to take into consideration the ``missing-half\" structural information, that is, heterophily-prone topology for homophily-prone graphs and homophily-prone topology for heterophily-prone graphs. In our paper, we introduce Graph cOmplementAry Learning, namely GOAL, which consists of two components: graph complementation and complemented graph convolution. The first component finds the missing-half structural information for a given graph to complement it. The complemented graph has two sets of graphs including both homophily- and heterophily-prone topology. In the latter component, to handle complemented graphs, we design a new graph convolution from the perspective of optimisation. The experiment results show that GOAL consistently outperforms all baselines in eight real-world datasets. ",

Our approach involves a training protocol that integrates rescaled square loss, cyclic learning rates, and erasing-based data augmentation. The outcomes we have achieved are comparable to those of the model trained with state-of-the-art techniques, which is currently the predominant choice for adversarial training. Our baseline, referred to as SimpleAT, yields three novel empirical insights. (i) By switching to square loss, the accuracy is comparable to that obtained by using both de-facto training protocol plus data augmentation. (ii) One cyclic learning rate is a good scheduler, which can effectively reduce the risk of robust overfitting. (iii) Employing rescaled square loss during model training can yield a favorable balance between adversarial and natural accuracy. In general, our experimental results show that SimpleAT effectively mitigates robust overfitting and consistently achieves the best performance at the end of training. For example, on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, SimpleAT achieves approximately 52% adversarial accuracy against the current strong AutoAttack. Furthermore, SimpleAT exhibits robust performance on various image corruptions, including those commonly found in CIFAR-10-C dataset. Finally, we assess the effectiveness of these insights through two techniques: bias-variance analysis and logit penalty methods. Our findings demonstrate that all of these simple techniques are capable of reducing the variance of model predictions, which is regarded as the primary contributor to robust overfitting. In addition, our analysis also uncovers connections with various advanced state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "One-shot medical landmark detection gains much attention and achieves great success for its label-efficient training process. However, existing one-shot learning methods are highly specialized in a single domain and suffer domain preference heavily in the situation of multi-domain unlabeled data. Moreover, one-shot learning is not robust that it faces performance drop when annotating a sub-optimal image. To tackle these issues, we resort to developing a domain-adaptive one-shot landmark detection framework for handling multi-domain medical images, named Universal One-shot Detection (UOD). UOD consists of two stages and two corresponding universal models which are designed as combinations of domain-specific modules and domain-shared modules. In the first stage, a domain-adaptive convolution model is self-supervised learned to generate pseudo landmark labels. In the second stage, we design a domain-adaptive transformer to eliminate domain preference and build the global context for multi-domain data. Even though only one annotated sample from each domain is available for training, the domain-shared modules help UOD aggregate all one-shot samples to detect more robust and accurate landmarks. We investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively the proposed UOD on three widely-used public X-ray datasets in different anatomical domains (i.e., head, hand, chest) and obtained state-of-the-art performances in each domain.

    "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have achieved remarkable performance in data generation, e.g., generating high-quality images. Nevertheless, chemistry molecules often have complex non-Euclidean spatial structures, with the behavior changing dynamically and unpredictably. Most existing diffusion models highly rely on computing the probability distribution, i.e., Gaussian distribution, in Euclidean space, which cannot capture internal non-Euclidean structures of molecules, especially the hierarchical structures of the implicit manifold surface represented by molecules. It has been observed that the complex hierarchical structures in hyperbolic embedding space become more prominent and easier to be captured. In order to leverage both the data generation power of diffusion models and the strong capability to extract complex geometric features of hyperbolic embedding, we propose to extend the diffusion model to hyperbolic manifolds for molecule generation, namely, Hyperbolic Graph Diffusion Model (HGDM). The proposed HGDM employs a hyperbolic variational autoencoder to generate the hyperbolic hidden representation of nodes and then a score-based hyperbolic graph neural network is used to learn the distribution in hyperbolic space. Numerical experimental results show that the proposed HGDM achieves higher performance on several molecular datasets, compared with state-of-the-art methods. ",

While sample recovery has already been explored in an FL setting, the ability to group samples per client, despite the use of SA, is novel. This poses a significant unforeseen security threat to FL and effectively breaks SA. We show that SRATTA is both theoretically grounded and can be used in practice on realistic models and datasets.

The widely adopted mutual information maximization-based objective leads to a short-cut solution of the weak teacher, i.e., achieving the maximum mutual information by simply making the teacher model as weak as the student model. To prevent such a weak solution, we introduce an additional objective term, i.e., the mutual information between the teacher and the auxiliary modality model. Besides, to narrow down the information gap between the student and teacher, we further propose to minimize the conditional entropy of the teacher given the student. Novel training schemes based on contrastive learning and adversarial learning are designed to optimize the mutual information and the conditional entropy, respectively. Experimental results on three popular multimodal benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed method outperforms a range of state-of-the-art approaches for video recognition, video retrieval and emotion classification.

Therefore, automated algorithms must be used in order to fully exploit the continuous data feeds coming from satellites. In this paper, we present a novel approach for sea ice segmentation based on SAR satellite imagery using hybrid convolutional transformer (ConvTr) networks. We show that our approach outperforms classical convolutional networks, while being considerably more efficient than pure transformer models.

    "abstract": "Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have novel features such as multi-stage penetration, highly-tailored intention, and evasive tactics. APTs defense requires fusing multi-dimensional Cyber threat intelligence data to identify attack intentions and conducts efficient knowledge discovery strategies by data-driven machine learning to recognize entity relationships. However, data-driven machine learning lacks generalization ability on fresh or unknown samples, reducing the accuracy and practicality of the defense model. Besides, the private deployment of these APT defense models on heterogeneous environments and various network devices requires significant investment in context awareness (such as known attack entities, continuous network states, and current security strategies). In this paper, we propose a few-shot multi-domain knowledge rearming (FMKR) scheme for context-aware defense against APTs. By completing multiple small tasks that are generated from different network domains with meta-learning, the FMKR firstly trains a model with good discrimination and generalization ability for fresh and unknown APT attacks. In each FMKR task, both threat intelligence and local entities are fused into the support/query sets in meta-learning to identify possible attack stages. Secondly, to rearm current security strategies, an finetuning-based deployment mechanism is proposed to transfer learned knowledge into the student model, while minimizing the defense cost. Compared to multiple model replacement strategies, the FMKR provides a faster response to attack behaviors while consuming less scheduling cost. Based on the feedback from multiple real users of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) over 2 months, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can improve the defense satisfaction rate. ",

    "abstract": "Temporal Graph Learning, which aims to model the time-evolving nature of graphs, has gained increasing attention and achieved remarkable performance recently. However, in reality, graph structures are often incomplete and noisy, which hinders temporal graph networks (TGNs) from learning informative representations. Graph contrastive learning uses data augmentation to generate plausible variations of existing data and learn robust representations. However, rule-based augmentation approaches may be suboptimal as they lack learnability and fail to leverage rich information from downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose a Time-aware Graph Structure Learning (TGSL) approach via sequence prediction on temporal graphs, which learns better graph structures for downstream tasks through adding potential temporal edges. In particular, it predicts time-aware context embedding based on previously observed interactions and uses the Gumble-Top-K to select the closest candidate edges to this context embedding. Additionally, several candidate sampling strategies are proposed to ensure both efficiency and diversity. Furthermore, we jointly learn the graph structure and TGNs in an end-to-end manner and perform inference on the refined graph. Extensive experiments on temporal link prediction benchmarks demonstrate that TGSL yields significant gains for the popular TGNs such as TGAT and GraphMixer, and it outperforms other contrastive learning methods on temporal graphs. We will release the code in the future. ",

In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end OAD model, termed E2E-LOAD, designed to address the major challenge of OAD, namely, long-term understanding and efficient online reasoning. Specifically, our proposed approach adopts an initial spatial model that is shared by all frames and maintains a long sequence cache for inference at a low computational cost. We also advocate an asymmetric spatial-temporal model for long-form and short-form modeling effectively. Furthermore, we propose a novel and efficient inference mechanism that accelerates heavy spatial-temporal exploration. Extensive ablation studies and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.

In particular, Ethernet technology has been extended by time-triggered scheduling mechanisms in standards like TTEthernet and Time-Sensitive Networking. Although the scheduling mechanisms have become part of standards, the traffic planning algorithms to create time-triggered schedules are still an open and challenging research question due to the problem's high complexity. In particular, so-called plug-and-produce scenarios require the ability to extend schedules on the fly within seconds. The need for scalable scheduling and routing algorithms is further supported by large-scale distributed real-time systems like smart energy grids with tight communication requirements. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two novel algorithms called Hierarchical Heuristic Scheduling (H2S) and Cost-Efficient Lazy Forwarding Scheduling (CELF) to calculate time-triggered schedules for TTEthernet. H2S and CELF are highly efficient and scalable, calculating schedules for more than 45,000 streams on random networks with 1,000 bridges as well as a realistic energy grid network within sub-seconds to seconds.

Prior works show that SAM is biased towards texture (style) rather than shape, motivated by which we start by investigating SAM's robustness against style transfer, which is synthetic corruption. With the effect of corruptions interpreted as a style change, we further evaluate its robustness on 15 common corruptions with 5 severity levels for each real-world corruption. Beyond the corruptions, we further evaluate the SAM robustness on local occlusion and adversarial perturbations.

We observe that the discriminator model, trained on historically generated data, often slows down its adaptation to the changes in the new arrival generated data, which accordingly decreases the quality of generated results. By treating the generated data in training as a stream, we propose to detect whether the discriminator slows down the learning of new knowledge in generated data. Therefore, we can explicitly enforce the discriminator to learn new knowledge fast. Particularly, we propose a new discriminator, which automatically detects its retardation and then dynamically masks its features, such that the discriminator can adaptively learn the temporally-vary distribution of generated data.

Additionally, the few available fine-grained semantic models rely on clustering algorithms, resulting in limited performance and applicability due to the cumbersome two-stage training process. In this paper, we present a novel method utilizing contextual dictionary lookup, enabling conventional embedding models to learn fine-grained semantics of relations in an end-to-end manner. More specifically, we represent each relation using a dictionary that contains multiple latent semantics. The composition of a given entity and the dictionary's central semantics serves as the context for generating a lookup, thus determining the fine-grained semantics of the relation adaptively. The proposed loss function optimizes both the central and fine-grained semantics simultaneously to ensure their semantic consistency. Besides, we introduce two metrics to assess the validity and accuracy of the dictionary lookup operation. We extend several KGE models with the method, resulting in substantial performance improvements on widely-used benchmark datasets. ",

This approach is implemented by a program allowing quick and easy examination of any type of permissions granted or denied to active directory users on any folder.

Thus, this study evaluates the robustness and generalization performance of DL architectures on multivariate time series data from CPS. Our investigation focuses on the models' ability to handle a range of perturbations, such as sensor faults and noise, and assesses their impact on overall performance. Furthermore, we test the generalization and transfer learning capabilities of these models by exposing them to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. These include deviations from standard system operations, while the core dynamics of the underlying physical system are preserved. Additionally, we test how well the models respond to several data augmentation techniques, including added noise and time warping. Our experimental framework utilizes a simulated three-tank system, proposed as a novel benchmark for evaluating the robustness and generalization performance of DL algorithms in CPS data contexts.

While they have aroused public concerns about their malicious misuses or misinformation broadcasts, just as what Deepfake visual and auditory media has been delivering to society. Hence it is essential to regulate the prevalence of generated graphs. To tackle this problem, we pioneer the formulation of the generated graph detection problem to distinguish generated graphs from real ones. We propose the first framework to systematically investigate a set of sophisticated models and their performance in four classification scenarios. Each scenario switches between seen and unseen datasets/generators during testing to get closer to real-world settings and progressively challenge the classifiers. Extensive experiments evidence that all the models are qualified for generated graph detection, with specific models having advantages in specific scenarios. Resulting from the validated generality and oblivion of the classifiers to unseen datasets/generators, we draw a safe conclusion that our solution can sustain for a decent while to curb generated graph misuses.

    "title": "Compositionally Equivariant Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models often need sufficient supervision (i.e. labelled data) in order to be trained effectively. By contrast, humans can swiftly learn to identify important anatomy in medical images like MRI and CT scans, with minimal guidance. This recognition capability easily generalises to new images from different medical facilities and to new tasks in different settings. This rapid and generalisable learning ability is largely due to the compositional structure of image patterns in the human brain, which are not well represented in current medical models. In this paper, we study the utilisation of compositionality in learning more interpretable and generalisable representations for medical image segmentation. Overall, we propose that the underlying generative factors that are used to generate the medical images satisfy compositional equivariance property, where each factor is compositional (e.g. corresponds to the structures in human anatomy) and also equivariant to the task. Hence, a good representation that approximates well the ground truth factor has to be compositionally equivariant. By modelling the compositional representations with learnable von-Mises-Fisher (vMF) kernels, we explore how different design and learning biases can be used to enforce the representations to be more compositionally equivariant under un-, weakly-, and semi-supervised settings. Extensive results show that our methods achieve the best performance over several strong baselines on the task of semi-supervised domain-generalised medical image segmentation.

While defenses against adversarial attacks have been proposed, they usually involve retraining a new neural network from scratch, a costly task. In this work, I introduce the Finite Gaussian Neuron (FGN), a novel neuron architecture for artificial neural networks. My works aims to: - easily convert existing models to Finite Gaussian Neuron architecture, - while preserving the existing model's behavior on real data, - and offering resistance against adversarial attacks. I show that converted and retrained Finite Gaussian Neural Networks (FGNN) always have lower confidence (i.e., are not overconfident) in their predictions over randomized and Fast Gradient Sign Method adversarial images when compared to classical neural networks, while maintaining high accuracy and confidence over real MNIST images. To further validate the capacity of Finite Gaussian Neurons to protect from adversarial attacks, I compare the behavior of FGNs to that of Bayesian Neural Networks against both randomized and adversarial images, and show how the behavior of the two architectures differs. Finally I show some limitations of the FGN models by testing them on the more complex SPEECHCOMMANDS task, against the stronger Carlini-Wagner and Projected Gradient Descent adversarial attacks. ",

Accurate inference of these dynamic relationships is crucial for understanding and predicting system behavior. In this paper, we propose Regulatory Temporal Interaction Network Inference (RiTINI) for inferring time-varying interaction graphs in complex systems using a novel combination of space-and-time graph attentions and graph neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RiTINI leverages time-lapse signals on a graph prior, as well as perturbations of signals at various nodes in order to effectively capture the dynamics of the underlying system. This approach is distinct from traditional causal inference networks, which are limited to inferring acyclic and static graphs. In contrast, RiTINI can infer cyclic, directed, and time-varying graphs, providing a more comprehensive and accurate representation of complex systems. The graph attention mechanism in RiTINI allows the model to adaptively focus on the most relevant interactions in time and space, while the graph neural ODEs enable continuous-time modeling of the system's dynamics. We evaluate RiTINI's performance on various simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art capability in inferring interaction graphs compared to previous methods. ",

Particularly uncertainty estimation is a crucial component for down-stream tasks and deep neural networks remain error-prone even for predictions with high confidence. Previously proposed methods for quantifying prediction uncertainty tend to alter the training scheme of the detector or rely on prediction sampling which results in vastly increased inference time. In order to address these two issues, we propose LidarMetaDetect (LMD), a light-weight post-processing scheme for prediction quality estimation. Our method can easily be added to any pre-trained Lidar object detector without altering anything about the base model and is purely based on post-processing, therefore, only leading to a negligible computational overhead. Our experiments show a significant increase of statistical reliability in separating true from false predictions. We propose and evaluate an additional application of our method leading to the detection of annotation errors. Explicit samples and a conservative count of annotation error proposals indicates the viability of our method for large-scale datasets like KITTI and nuScenes. On the widely-used nuScenes test dataset, 43 out of the top 100 proposals of our method indicate, in fact, erroneous annotations. ",

However, most previous methods learn both text location and background inpainting implicitly within a single network, which weakens the text localization mechanism and makes a lossy background. To tackle these problems, we propose a simple Progressive Segmentation-guided Scene Text Removal Network(PSSTRNet) to remove the text in the image iteratively. It contains two decoder branches, a text segmentation branch, and a text removal branch, with a shared encoder. The text segmentation branch generates text mask maps as the guidance for the regional removal branch. In each iteration, the original image, previous text removal result, and text mask are input to the network to extract the rest part of the text segments and cleaner text removal result. To get a more accurate text mask map, an update module is developed to merge the mask map in the current and previous stages. The final text removal result is obtained by adaptive fusion of results from all previous stages.

We depart from previous literature by assuming no knowledge of the causal graph except that latent confounders between the outcome and its ancestors are not present. We first show that the unknown graph problem can be exponentially hard in the parents of the outcome. To remedy this, we adopt an additional additive assumption on the outcome which allows us to solve the problem by casting it as an additive combinatorial linear bandit problem with full-bandit feedback. We propose a novel action-elimination algorithm for this setting, show how to apply this algorithm to the causal bandit problem, provide sample complexity bounds, and empirically validate our findings on a suite of randomly generated causal models, effectively showing that one does not need to explicitly learn the parents of the outcome to identify the best intervention.

    "abstract": "Frequent interactions between individuals are a fundamental challenge for pose estimation algorithms. Current pipelines either use an object detector together with a pose estimator (top-down approach), or localize all body parts first and then link them to predict the pose of individuals (bottom-up). Yet, when individuals closely interact, top-down methods are ill-defined due to overlapping individuals, and bottom-up methods often falsely infer connections to distant body parts. Thus, we propose a novel pipeline called bottom-up conditioned top-down pose estimation (BUCTD) that combines the strengths of bottom-up and top-down methods. Specifically, we propose to use a bottom-up model as the detector, which in addition to an estimated bounding box provides a pose proposal that is fed as condition to an attention-based top-down model. We demonstrate the performance and efficiency of our approach on animal and human pose estimation benchmarks. On CrowdPose and OCHuman, we outperform previous state-of-the-art models by a significant margin. We achieve 78.5 AP on CrowdPose and 47.2 AP on OCHuman, an improvement of 8.6% and 4.9% over the prior art, respectively. Furthermore, we show that our method has excellent performance on non-crowded datasets such as COCO, and strongly improves the performance on multi-animal benchmarks involving mice, fish and monkeys.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative model training without sharing private data. However, privacy concerns regarding information exchanged during FL have received significant research attention. Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) have been proposed to reconstruct the private data retained by local clients from the exchanged gradients. While recovering private data, the data dimensions and the model complexity increase, which thwart data reconstruction by GIAs. Existing methods adopt prior knowledge about private data to overcome those challenges. In this paper, we first observe that GIAs with gradients from a single iteration fail to reconstruct private data due to insufficient dimensions of leaked gradients, complex model architectures, and invalid gradient information. We investigate a Temporal Gradient Inversion Attack with a Robust Optimization framework, called TGIAs-RO, which recovers private data without any prior knowledge by leveraging multiple temporal gradients. To eliminate the negative impacts of outliers, e.g., invalid gradients for collaborative optimization, robust statistics are proposed. Theoretical guarantees on the recovery performance and robustness of TGIAs-RO against invalid gradients are also provided. Extensive empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet and Reuters 21578 datasets show that the proposed TGIAs-RO with 10 temporal gradients improves reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, even for large batch sizes (up to 128), complex models like ResNet18, and large datasets like ImageNet (224*224 pixels). Furthermore, the proposed attack method inspires further exploration of privacy-preserving methods in the context of FL. ",

    "abstract": "Modern computer systems are highly-configurable, with hundreds of configuration options interacting, resulting in enormous configuration space. As a result, optimizing performance goals (e.g., latency) in such systems is challenging. Worse, owing to evolving application requirements and user specifications, these systems face frequent uncertainties in their environments (e.g., hardware and workload change), making performance optimization even more challenging. Recently, transfer learning has been applied to address this problem by reusing knowledge from the offline configuration measurements of an old environment, aka, source to a new environment, aka, target. These approaches typically rely on predictive machine learning (ML) models to guide the search for finding interventions to optimize performance. However, previous empirical research showed that statistical models might perform poorly when the deployment environment changes because the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption no longer holds. To address this issue, we propose Cameo -- a method that sidesteps these limitations by identifying invariant causal predictors under environmental changes, enabling the optimization process to operate on a reduced search space, leading to faster system performance optimization. We demonstrate significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art optimization methods on five highly configurable computer systems, including three MLperf deep learning benchmark systems, a video analytics pipeline, and a database system, and studied the effectiveness in design explorations with different varieties and severity of environmental changes and show the scalability of our approach to colossal configuration spaces.

We study the number of matches of the online algorithm closest, which matches any incoming point to its closest available neighbor. We show that its performances can be compared to its fluid limit, completely described as the solution of an explicit PDE. From the latter, we can compute the competitive ratio of closest. ",

This is important in many scientific applications to identify the underlying mechanisms of a treatment effect.

For example, we may want to identify how changes in brain activity or structure mediate an antidepressant's effect on behavior, but we may only have access to electrophysiological or imaging brain measurements. To date, most CMA methods assume that the mediator is one-dimensional and observable, which oversimplifies such real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a CMA framework that can handle complex and indirectly observed mediators based on the identifiable variational autoencoder (iVAE) architecture. We prove that the true joint distribution over observed and latent variables is identifiable with the proposed method. Additionally, our framework captures a disentangled representation of the indirectly observed mediator and yields accurate estimation of the direct and mediated effects in synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments, providing evidence of its potential utility in real-world applications.

As one of the most fundamental problems in graph mining, the densest subgraph discovery (DSD) problem has found a wide spectrum of real applications, such as discovery of filter bubbles in social media, finding groups of actors propagating misinformation in social media, social network community detection, graph index construction, regulatory motif discovery in DNA, fake follower detection, and so on. Theoretically, DSD closely relates to other fundamental graph problems, such as network flow and bipartite matching. Triggered by these applications and connections, DSD has garnered much attention from the database, data mining, theory, and network communities. In this survey, we first highlight the importance of DSD in various real-world applications and the unique challenges that need to be addressed. Subsequently, we classify existing DSD solutions into several groups, which cover around 50 research papers published in many well-known venues (e.g., SIGMOD, PVLDB, TODS, WWW), and conduct a thorough review of these solutions in each group. Afterwards, we analyze and compare the models and solutions in these works. Finally, we point out a list of promising future research directions. It is our hope that this survey not only helps researchers have a better understanding of existing densest subgraph models and solutions, but also provides insights and identifies directions for future study.

One principal challenge in this context is dealing with content that is considered harmful. Striking a balance between competing stakeholder interests, rather than block harmful content altogether, one approach is to minimize the exposure to such content that is induced specifically by algorithmic recommendations. Hence, modeling media items and recommendations as a directed graph, we study the problem of reducing the exposure to harmful content via edge rewiring. We formalize this problem using absorbing random walks, and prove that it is NP-hard and NP-hard to approximate to within an additive error, while under realistic assumptions, the greedy method yields a (1-1/e)-approximation. Thus, we introduce Gamine, a fast greedy algorithm that can reduce the exposure to harmful content with or without quality constraints on recommendations. By performing just 100 rewirings on YouTube graphs with several hundred thousand edges, Gamine reduces the initial exposure by 50%, while ensuring that its recommendations are at most 5% less relevant than the original recommendations. Through extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data from video recommendation and news feed applications, we confirm the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of Gamine in practice.

    "title": "Multi-modal Representation Learning for Social Post Location Inference",
    "abstract": "Inferring geographic locations via social posts is essential for many practical location-based applications such as product marketing, point-of-interest recommendation, and infector tracking for COVID-19. Unlike image-based location retrieval or social-post text embedding-based location inference, the combined effect of multi-modal information (i.e., post images, text, and hashtags) for social post positioning receives less attention. In this work, we collect real datasets of social posts with images, texts, and hashtags from Instagram and propose a novel Multi-modal Representation Learning Framework (MRLF) capable of fusing different modalities of social posts for location inference. MRLF integrates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance location-salient information extraction while significantly improving location inference compared with single domain-based methods. To overcome the noisy user-generated textual content, we introduce a novel attention-based character-aware module that considers the relative dependencies between characters of social post texts and hashtags for flexible multi-model information fusion. The experimental results show that MRLF can make accurate location predictions and open a new door to understanding the multi-modal data of social posts for online inference tasks. ",

Assuming knowledge of the network topology but not of the epidemic model, our goal is to estimate the complete propagation path of a disease spread. A data-driven approach is leveraged to overcome the lack of model awareness. To solve this inverse problem, DDmix is proposed as a graph conditional variational autoencoder that is trained from past epidemic spreads. DDmix seeks to capture key aspects of the underlying (unknown) spreading dynamics in its latent space. Using epidemic spreads simulated in synthetic and real-world networks, we demonstrate the accuracy of DDmix by comparing it with multiple (non-graph-aware) learning algorithms. The generalizability of DDmix is highlighted across different types of networks. Finally, we showcase that a simple post-processing extension of our proposed method can help identify super-spreaders in the reconstructed propagation path. ",

    "abstract": "News outlets are now more than ever incentivized to provide their audience with slanted news, while the intrinsic homophilic nature of online social media may exacerbate polarized opinions. Here, we propose a new dynamic latent space model for time-varying online audience-duplication networks, which exploits social media content to conduct inference on media bias and polarization of news outlets. Our model contributes to the literature in several directions: 1) we provide a model-embedded data-driven interpretation for the latent leaning of news outlets in terms of media bias; 2) we endow our model with Markov-switching dynamics to capture polarization regimes while maintaining a parsimonious specification; 3) we contribute to the literature on the statistical properties of latent space network models. The proposed model is applied to a set of data on the online activity of national and local news outlets from four European countries in the years 2015 and 2016. We find evidence of a strong positive correlation between our media slant measure and a well-grounded external source of media bias. In addition, we provide insight into the polarization regimes across the four countries considered. ",

Moreover, the need for uncertainty quantification and data privacy constraints are often particularly amplified for clients that have limited local data. This paper presents a unified FL framework to simultaneously address all these constraints and concerns, based on training customized local Bayesian models that learn well even in the absence of large local datasets. A Bayesian framework provides a natural way of incorporating supervision in the form of prior distributions. We use priors in the functional (output) space of the networks to facilitate collaboration across heterogeneous clients. Moreover, formal differential privacy guarantees are provided for this framework. Experiments on standard FL datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings and under strict privacy constraints, while also providing characterizations of model uncertainties.

The core challenges are twofold. First, different types of temporal changes, such as illumination and changes to the underlying scene itself (such as replacing one graffiti artwork with another) are entangled together in the imagery. Second, scene-level temporal changes are often discrete and sporadic over time, rather than continuous. To tackle these problems, we propose a new scene representation equipped with a novel temporal step function encoding method that can model discrete scene-level content changes as piece-wise constant functions over time. Specifically, we represent the scene as a space-time radiance field with a per-image illumination embedding, where temporally-varying scene changes are encoded using a set of learned step functions. To facilitate our task of chronology reconstruction from Internet imagery, we also collect a new dataset of four scenes that exhibit various changes over time. We demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art view synthesis results on this dataset, while achieving independent control of viewpoint, time, and illumination. ",

    "abstract": "Tropical Cyclones (TCs) are counted among the most destructive phenomena that can be found in nature. Every year, globally an average of 90 TCs occur over tropical waters, and global warming is making them stronger, larger and more destructive. The accurate detection and tracking of such phenomena have become a relevant and interesting area of research in weather and climate science. Traditionally, TCs have been identified in large climate datasets through the use of deterministic tracking schemes that rely on subjective thresholds. Machine Learning (ML) models can complement deterministic approaches due to their ability to capture the mapping between the input climatic drivers and the geographical position of the TC center from the available data. This study presents a ML ensemble approach for locating TC center coordinates, embedding both TC classification and localization in a single end-to-end learning task. The ensemble combines TC center estimates of different ML models that agree about the presence of a TC in input data. ERA5 reanalysis were used for model training and testing jointly with the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship records. Results showed that the ML approach is well-suited for TC detection providing good generalization capabilities on out of sample data. In particular, it was able to accurately detect lower TC categories than those used for training the models. On top of this, the ensemble approach was able to further improve TC localization performance with respect to single model TC center estimates, demonstrating the good capabilities of the proposed approach.

We introduce here a novel HSI missing pixel prediction algorithm, called Low Rank and Sparsity Constraint Plug-and-Play (LRS-PnP). It is shown that LRS-PnP is able to predict missing pixels and bands even when all spectral bands of the image are missing. The proposed LRS-PnP algorithm is further extended to a self-supervised model by combining the LRS-PnP with the Deep Image Prior (DIP), called LRS-PnP-DIP. In a series of experiments with real data, It is shown that the LRS-PnP-DIP either achieves state-of-the-art inpainting performance compared to other learning-based methods, or outperforms them. ",

However, QCNN requires a large number of measurements for data learning, limiting its practical applications for large-scale problems. To relieve this requirement, we propose a novel architecture called split-parallelizing QCNN (sp-QCNN), which exploits the prior knowledge of quantum data for designing efficient circuits. This architecture draws inspiration from geometric quantum machine learning and targets translationally symmetric quantum data commonly encountered in condensed matter physics. By splitting the quantum circuit based on translational symmetry, sp-QCNN substantially parallelizes conventional QCNN without increasing the number of qubits and further improves the measurement efficiency by an order of the number of qubits. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply sp-QCNN to a quantum phase recognition task and show that it can achieve similar performance to conventional QCNN while considerably reducing the measurement resources required. Due to its high measurement efficiency, sp-QCNN can mitigate statistical errors in estimating the gradient of the loss function, thereby accelerating the learning process. These results open up new possibilities for incorporating the prior knowledge of data into the efficient design of QML models, leading to practical quantum advantages. ",

By modeling the target speech as a non-stationary Laplacian distribution, a mask-based statistical beamforming algorithm is proposed to exploit both its output and masked input variance for robust estimation of the beamformer. In addition, we also present a method for steering vector estimation (SVE) based on a noise power ratio obtained from the target and noise outputs in independent component analysis (ICA). To update the beamformer in the same ICA framework, we derive ICA with distortionless and null constraints on target speech, which yields beamformed speech at the target output and noises at the other outputs, respectively. The demixing weights for the target output result in a statistical beamformer with the weighted spatial covariance matrix (wSCM) using a weighting function characterized by a source model. To enhance the SVE, the strict null constraints imposed by the Lagrange multiplier methods are relaxed by generalized penalties with weight parameters, while the strict distortionless constraints are maintained. Furthermore, we derive an online algorithm based on an optimization technique of recursive least squares (RLS) for practical applications. Experimental results on various environments using CHiME-4 and LibriCSS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithm compared to conventional beamforming and blind source extraction (BSE) based on ICA on both batch and online processing.

The labeled data distribution may substantially differ from the full population, especially when the historical decisions and the target outcome can be simultaneously affected by some unobserved factors. Consequently, learning with only the labeled data may lead to severely biased results when deployed to the full population. Our paper tackles this challenge by exploiting the fact that in many applications the historical decisions were made by a set of heterogeneous decision-makers. In particular, we analyze this setup in a principled instrumental variable (IV) framework. We establish conditions for the full-population risk of any given prediction rule to be point-identified from the observed data and provide sharp risk bounds when the point identification fails. We further propose a weighted learning approach that learns prediction rules robust to the label selection bias in both identification settings. Finally, we apply our proposed approach to a semi-synthetic financial dataset and demonstrate its superior performance in the presence of selection bias. ",

In electrostatic self-consistent low-temperature plasma (LTP) simulations, Poisson's equation is solved at each simulation time step, which can amount to a significant computational cost for the entire simulation. In this paper, we describe the development of a generic machine-learned Poisson solver specifically designed for the requirements of LTP simulations in complex 2D reactor geometries on structured Cartesian grids. Here, the reactor geometries can consist of inner electrodes and dielectric materials as often found in LTP simulations. The approach leverages a hybrid CNN-transformer network architecture in combination with a weighted multiterm loss function. We train the network using highly-randomized synthetic data to ensure the generalizability of the learned solver to unseen reactor geometries. The results demonstrate that the learned solver is able to produce quantitatively and qualitatively accurate solutions. Furthermore, it generalizes well on new reactor geometries such as reference geometries found in the literature. To increase the numerical accuracy of the solutions required in LTP simulations, we employ a conventional iterative solver to refine the raw predictions, especially to recover the high-frequency features not resolved by the initial prediction. With this, the proposed learned Poisson solver provides the required accuracy and is potentially faster than a pure GPU-based conventional iterative solver. This opens up new possibilities for developing a generic and high-performing learned Poisson solver for LTP systems in complex geometries. ",

In contrast to other adversarial attacks proposed recently, Malafide filters are optimised independently of the input utterance and duration, are tuned instead to the underlying spoofing attack, and require the optimisation of only a small number of filter coefficients. Even so, they degrade CM performance estimates by an order of magnitude, even in black-box settings, and can also be configured to overcome integrated CM and ASV subsystems. Integrated solutions that use self-supervised learning CMs, however, are more robust, under both black-box and white-box settings. ",

This study proposes a novel conjecture-refuting algorithm, referred to as the adaptive Monte Carlo search (AMCS) algorithm, obtained by modifying the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. Evaluated based on its success in finding counterexamples to several graph theory conjectures, AMCS outperforms existing conjecture-refuting algorithms. The algorithm is further utilized to refute six open conjectures, two of which were chemical graph theory conjectures formulated by Liu et al. in 2021 and four of which were formulated by the AutoGraphiX computer system in 2006. Finally, four of the open conjectures are strongly refuted by generalizing the counterexamples obtained by AMCS to produce a family of counterexamples. It is expected that the algorithm can help researchers test graph-theoretic conjectures more effectively. ",
