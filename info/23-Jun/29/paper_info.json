    "abstract": "Dataflow scheduling decisions are of vital importance to neural network (NN) accelerators. Recent scalable NN accelerators support a rich set of advanced dataflow techniques. The problems of comprehensively representing and quickly finding optimized dataflow schemes thus become significantly more complicated and challenging. In this work, we first propose comprehensive and pragmatic dataflow representations for temporal and spatial scheduling on scalable multi-node NN architectures. An informal hierarchical taxonomy highlights the tight coupling across different levels of the dataflow space as the major difficulty for fast design exploration. A set of formal tensor-centric directives accurately express various inter-layer and intra-layer schemes, and allow for quickly determining their validity and efficiency. We then build a generic, optimized, and fast dataflow solver, KAPLA, which makes use of the pragmatic directives to explore the design space with effective validity check and efficiency estimation. KAPLA decouples the upper inter-layer level for fast pruning, and solves the lower intra-layer schemes with a novel bottom-up cost descending method. KAPLA achieves within only 2.2% and 7.7% energy overheads on the result dataflow for training and inference, respectively, compared to the exhaustively searched optimal schemes. It also outperforms random and machine-learning-based approaches, with more optimized results and orders of magnitude faster search speedup. ",

    "title": "Solving the Identifying Code Set Problem with Grouped Independent  Support",
    "abstract": "An important problem in network science is finding an optimal placement of sensors in nodes in order to uniquely detect failures in the network. This problem can be modelled as an identifying code set (ICS) problem, introduced by Karpovsky et al. in 1998. The ICS problem aims to find a cover of a set $S$, s.t. the elements in the cover define a unique signature for each of the elements of $S$, and to minimise the cover's cardinality. In this work, we study a generalised identifying code set (GICS) problem, where a unique signature must be found for each subset of $S$ that has a cardinality of at most $k$ (instead of just each element of $S$). The concept of an independent support of a Boolean formula was introduced by Chakraborty et al. in 2014 to speed up propositional model counting, by identifying a subset of variables whose truth assignments uniquely define those of the other variables. In this work, we introduce an extended version of independent support, grouped independent support (GIS), and show how to reduce the GICS problem to the GIS problem. We then propose a new solving method for finding a GICS, based on finding a GIS. We show that the prior state-of-the-art approaches yield integer-linear programming (ILP) models whose sizes grow exponentially with the problem size and $k$, while our GIS encoding only grows polynomially with the problem size and $k$. While the ILP approach can solve the GICS problem on networks of at most 494 nodes, the GIS-based method can handle networks of up to 21363 nodes; a $\\sim 40\\times$ improvement. The GIS-based method shows up to a $520\\times$ improvement on the ILP-based method in terms of median solving time. For the majority of the instances that can be encoded and solved by both methods, the cardinality of the solution returned by the GIS-based method is less than $10\\%$ larger than the cardinality of the solution found by the ILP method.

The goal of the algorithm is to find each agent's update rule from several candidate rules and to learn the underlying network. At each iteration, the algorithm assumes that each agent has one of the updated rules and then modifies network estimates to reduce validation error. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm improves initial estimates of the network and update rules, decreases prediction error, and performs better than other methods such as sparse linear regression and Gaussian process regression.

In this work, we validate that the adversarial sample generated by attack algorithms is strongly related to a specific vector in the high-dimensional inputs. Such vectors, namely UAPs (Universal Adversarial Perturbations), can be calculated without original training data. Based on this discovery, we propose a data-agnostic adversarial detection framework, which induces different responses between normal and adversarial samples to UAPs. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive detection performance on various text classification tasks, and maintains an equivalent time consumption to normal inference. ",

    "abstract": "Modern multi-layer networks are commonly stored and analyzed in a local and distributed fashion because of the privacy, ownership, and communication costs. The literature on the model-based statistical methods for community detection based on these data is still limited. This paper proposes a new method for consensus community detection and estimation in a multi-layer stochastic block model using locally stored and computed network data with privacy protection. A novel algorithm named privacy-preserving Distributed Spectral Clustering (ppDSC) is developed. To preserve the edges' privacy, we adopt the randomized response (RR) mechanism to perturb the network edges, which satisfies the strong notion of differential privacy. The ppDSC algorithm is performed on the squared RR-perturbed adjacency matrices to prevent possible cancellation of communities among different layers. To remove the bias incurred by RR and the squared network matrices, we develop a two-step bias-adjustment procedure. Then we perform eigen-decomposition on the debiased matrices, aggregation of the local eigenvectors using an orthogonal Procrustes transformation, and k-means clustering. We provide theoretical analysis on the statistical errors of ppDSC in terms of eigen-vector estimation. In addition, the blessings and curses of network heterogeneity are well-explained by our bounds. ",

    "abstract": "Recent deep learning models can efficiently combine inputs from different modalities (e.g., images and text) and learn to align their latent representations, or to translate signals from one domain to another (as in image captioning, or text-to-image generation). However, current approaches mainly rely on brute-force supervised training over large multimodal datasets. In contrast, humans (and other animals) can learn useful multimodal representations from only sparse experience with matched cross-modal data. Here we evaluate the capabilities of a neural network architecture inspired by the cognitive notion of a \"Global Workspace\": a shared representation for two (or more) input modalities. Each modality is processed by a specialized system (pretrained on unimodal data, and subsequently frozen). The corresponding latent representations are then encoded to and decoded from a single shared workspace. Importantly, this architecture is amenable to self-supervised training via cycle-consistency: encoding-decoding sequences should approximate the identity function. For various pairings of vision-language modalities and across two datasets of varying complexity, we show that such an architecture can be trained to align and translate between two modalities with very little need for matched data (from 4 to 7 times less than a fully supervised approach). The global workspace representation can be used advantageously for downstream classification tasks and for robust transfer learning. Ablation studies reveal that both the shared workspace and the self-supervised cycle-consistency training are critical to the system's performance. ",

    "abstract": "Morphed face images have recently become a growing concern for existing face verification systems, as they are relatively easy to generate and can be used to impersonate someone's identity for various malicious purposes. Efficient Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) that generalizes well across different morphing techniques is, therefore, of paramount importance. Existing MAD techniques predominantly rely on discriminative models that learn from examples of bona fide and morphed images and, as a result, often exhibit sub-optimal generalization performance when confronted with unknown types of morphing attacks. To address this problem, we propose a novel, diffusion-based MAD method in this paper that learns only from the characteristics of bona fide images. Various forms of morphing attacks are then detected by our model as out-of-distribution samples. We perform rigorous experiments over four different datasets (CASIA-WebFace, FRLL-Morphs, FERET-Morphs and FRGC-Morphs) and compare the proposed solution to both discriminatively-trained and once-class MAD models. The experimental results show that our MAD model achieves highly competitive results on all considered datasets. ",

DMNER exhibits applicability across multiple NER scenarios: 1) In supervised NER, we observe that DMNER effectively rectifies the output of baseline NER models, thereby further enhancing performance. 2) In distantly supervised NER, combining MRC and AutoNER as span boundary detectors enables DMNER to achieve satisfactory results. 3) For training NER by merging multiple datasets, we adopt a framework similar to DS-NER but additionally leverage ChatGPT to obtain high-quality phrases in the training. Through extensive experiments conducted on 10 benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of DMNER. ",

However, to maintain a competitive QoE, infrastructure, and service providers must adapt to users' different mobility patterns, which can be challenging, especially for location-based services (LBS). Another issue that needs to be tackled is the increasing demand for user privacy protection. With less (accurate) information regarding user location, preferences, and usage patterns, forecasting the performance of offloading mechanisms becomes even more challenging. This work discusses the impacts of users' privacy and mobility when offloading to the edge. Different privacy and mobility scenarios are simulated and discussed to shed light on the trade-offs (e.g., privacy protection at the cost of increased latency) among privacy protection, mobility, and offloading performance.

    "abstract": "We introduce the Condorcet attack, a new threat to fair transaction ordering. Specifically, the attack undermines batch-order-fairness, the strongest notion of transaction fair ordering proposed to date. The batch-order-fairness guarantees that a transaction tx is ordered before tx' if a majority of nodes in the system receive tx before tx'; the only exception (due to an impossibility result) is when tx and tx' fall into a so-called \"Condorcet cycle\". When this happens, tx and tx' along with other transactions within the cycle are placed in a batch, and any unfairness inside a batch is ignored. In the Condorcet attack, an adversary attempts to undermine the system's fairness by imposing Condorcet cycles to the system. In this work, we show that the adversary can indeed impose a Condorcet cycle by submitting as few as two otherwise legitimate transactions to the system. Remarkably, the adversary (e.g., a malicious client) can achieve this even when all the nodes in the system behave honestly. A notable feature of the attack is that it is capable of \"trapping\" transactions that do not naturally fall inside a cycle, i.e. those that are transmitted at significantly different times (with respect to the network latency). To mitigate the attack, we propose three methods based on three different complementary approaches. We show the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation methods through simulations, and explain their limitations. ",

Instead, the attack leverages a realistic scenario from the training data as a trigger to manipulate the model's output during inference. This type of attack is particularly dangerous as it is stealthy and difficult to detect. The paper focuses on the application of this attack in the context of Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, specifically targeting the trajectory prediction module. To implement the attack, we design a trigger mechanism that mimics a set of cloned behaviors in the driving scene, resulting in a scenario that triggers the attack. The experimental results demonstrate that IMPOSITION is effective in attacking trajectory prediction models while maintaining high performance in untargeted scenarios. Our proposed method highlights the growing importance of research on the trustworthiness of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, particularly in safety-critical applications. Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the safety and reliability of DNN models, and this paper presents a new perspective on backdooring DNNs. The proposed IMPOSITION paradigm and the demonstration of its severity in the context of AD systems are significant contributions of this paper. We highlight the impact of the proposed attacks via empirical studies showing how IMPOSITION can easily compromise the safety of AD systems. ",

Although automated batch refactoring techniques are known to significantly improve overall software quality and maintainability, their impact on resource utilization is not well studied. This paper aims to bridge the gap between batch refactoring code smells and consumption of resources. It determines the relationship between software code smell batch refactoring, and resource consumption. Next, it aims to design algorithms to predict the impact of code smell refactoring on resource consumption. This paper investigates 16 code smell types and their joint effect on resource utilization for 31 open source applications. It provides a detailed empirical analysis of the change in application CPU and memory utilization after refactoring specific code smells in isolation and in batches. This analysis is then used to train regression algorithms to predict the impact of batch refactoring on CPU and memory utilization before making any refactoring decisions. Experimental results also show that our ANN-based regression model provides highly accurate predictions for the impact of batch refactoring on resource consumption. It allows the software developers to intelligently decide which code smells they should refactor jointly to achieve high code quality and maintainability without increasing the application resource utilization. This paper responds to the important and urgent need of software engineers across a broad range of software applications, who are looking to refactor code smells and at the same time improve resource consumption. Finally, it brings forward the concept of resource aware code smell refactoring to the most crucial software applications. ",

In this paper, we first formulate a new and practical anti-UAV problem featuring the UAVs perception in complex scenes without prior UAVs information. To benchmark such a challenging task, we propose the largest UAV dataset dubbed AntiUAV600 and a new evaluation metric. The AntiUAV600 comprises 600 video sequences of challenging scenes with random, fast, and small-scale UAVs, with over 723K thermal infrared frames densely annotated with bounding boxes. Finally, we develop a novel anti-UAV approach via an evidential collaboration of global UAVs detection and local UAVs tracking, which effectively tackles the proposed problem and can serve as a strong baseline for future research. Extensive experiments show our method outperforms SOTA approaches and validate the ability of AntiUAV600 to enhance UAV perception performance due to its large scale and complexity.

Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art on this dataset.

We connect this coverage metric to what has been established in the literature and use it to rank the privacy of individual samples from the training set in what we call a privacy profile. We additionally show that the privacy profile can be used to probe an observed transition to indistinguishability that takes place in the neighboring distributions as $\\epsilon$ decreases, which we suggest is a tool that can enable the selection of $\\epsilon$ by the ML practitioner wishing to make use of DP.

    "abstract": "Cloud applications are moving away from monolithic model towards loosely-coupled microservices designs. Service meshes are widely used for implementing microservices applications mainly because they provide a modular architecture for modern applications by separating operational features from application business logic. Sidecar proxies in service meshes enable this modularity by applying security, networking, and monitoring policies on the traffic to and from services. To implement these policies, sidecars often execute complex chains of logic that vary across associated applications and end up unevenly impacting the performance of the overall application. Lack of understanding of how the sidecars impact the performance of microservice-based applications stands in the way of building performant and resource-efficient applications. To this end, we bring sidecar proxies in focus and argue that we need to deeply study their impact on the system performance and resource utilization. We identify and describe challenges in characterizing sidecars, namely the need for microarchitectural metrics and comprehensive methodologies, and discuss research directions where such characterization will help in building efficient service mesh infrastructure for microservice applications.

Our aim is to leverage computational neuroscience methodologies to understanding the population-level activity of robust robot locomotion controllers. Our investigation begins by analyzing topological structure, discovering that fragile controllers have a higher number of fixed points with unstable directions, resulting in poorer balance when instructed to stand in place. Next, we analyze the forced response of the system by applying targeted neural perturbations along directions of dominant population-level activity. We find evidence that recurrent state dynamics are structured and low-dimensional during walking, which aligns with primate studies. Additionally, when recurrent states are perturbed to zero, fragile agents continue to walk, which is indicative of a stronger reliance on sensory input and weaker recurrence. ",

Prior studies on infant sleep/wake classification have been largely limited to reliance on expensive and burdensome polysomnography (PSG) tests in the laboratory or wearable devices that collect single-modality data. To facilitate data collection and accuracy of detection, we aimed to advance this field of study by using a multi-modal wearable device, LittleBeats (LB), to collect audio, electrocardiogram (ECG), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data among a cohort of 28 infants. We employed a 3-branch (audio/ECG/IMU) large scale transformer-based neural network (NN) to demonstrate the potential of such multi-modal data. We pretrained each branch independently with its respective modality, then finetuned the model by fusing the pretrained transformer layers with cross-attention. We show that multi-modal data significantly improves sleep/wake classification (accuracy = 0.880), compared with use of a single modality (accuracy = 0.732). Our approach to multi-modal mid-level fusion may be adaptable to a diverse range of architectures and tasks, expanding future directions of infant behavioral research. ",

Despite many major breakthroughs and minor improvements, the conjecture remains open even for planar graphs. In this paper, we prove that planar graphs are acyclically edge $(\\Delta + 5)$-colorable. Our proof has two main steps: Using discharging methods, we first show that every non-trivial planar graph must have one of the eight groups of well characterized local structures; and then acyclically edge color the graph using no more than $\\Delta + 5$ colors by an induction on the number of edges.

However, from the perspective of game theory, such utilizations of adversarial training correspond to pure-strategy games, which are inherently limited in terms of the scope of their strategies, thereby still having room for improvement. In order to push the performance boundaries, we propose a novel Mixed-strategy Adversarial Training algorithm (MAT). Methodologically, we derive the Nash equilibrium of a mixed-strategy game for adversarial training using Entropy Mirror Descent to establish MAT by sampling method. To verify the effectiveness of MAT, we conducted extensive benchmark experiments on large-scale pre-trained models, such as BERT and RoBERTa.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing data has been widely used for various Earth Observation (EO) missions such as land use and cover classification, weather forecasting, agricultural management, and environmental monitoring. Most existing remote sensing data-based models are based on supervised learning that requires large and representative human-labelled data for model training, which is costly and time-consuming. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) enables the models to learn a representation from orders of magnitude more unlabelled data. This representation has been proven to boost the performance of downstream tasks and has potential for remote sensing applications. The success of SSL is heavily dependent on a pre-designed pretext task, which introduces an inductive bias into the model from a large amount of unlabelled data. Since remote sensing imagery has rich spectral information beyond the standard RGB colour space, the pretext tasks established in computer vision based on RGB images may not be straightforward to be extended to the multi/hyperspectral domain. To address this challenge, this work has designed a novel SSL framework that is capable of learning representation from both spectra-spatial information of unlabelled data. The framework contains two novel pretext tasks for object-based and pixel-based remote sensing data analysis methods, respectively. Through two typical downstream tasks evaluation (a multi-label land cover classification task on Sentienl-2 multispectral datasets and a ground soil parameter retrieval task on hyperspectral datasets), the results demonstrate that the representation obtained through the proposed SSL achieved a significant improvement in model performance.

We further triangulated and extended our mining results by performing a survey with 168 software developers. We observed that, between 2013 and 2022, the number of posts containing image data on Bugzilla and Stack Overflow doubled. Furthermore, we found that sharing images makes other developers engage more and faster with the content. In the majority of cases in which an image is included in a developer's post, the information in that image is complementary to the text provided. Finally, our results showed that when an image is shared, understanding the content without the information in the image is unlikely for 86.9\\% of the cases. Based on these observations, we discuss the importance of considering visual content when analyzing developers and designing automation tools. ",

To tackle this challenge, we introduce GoalieNet, a multi-stage deep neural network for jointly estimating the pose of the goalie, their equipment, and the net. Experimental results using NHL benchmark data demonstrate that the proposed GoalieNet can achieve an average of 84\\% accuracy across all keypoints, where 22 out of 29 keypoints are detected with more than 80\\% accuracy.

    "abstract": "Robotic manipulation, in particular in-hand object manipulation, often requires an accurate estimate of the object's 6D pose. To improve the accuracy of the estimated pose, state-of-the-art approaches in 6D object pose estimation use observational data from one or more modalities, e.g., RGB images, depth, and tactile readings. However, existing approaches make limited use of the underlying geometric structure of the object captured by these modalities, thereby, increasing their reliance on visual features. This results in poor performance when presented with objects that lack such visual features or when visual features are simply occluded. Furthermore, current approaches do not take advantage of the proprioceptive information embedded in the position of the fingers. To address these limitations, in this paper: (1) we introduce a hierarchical graph neural network architecture for combining multimodal (vision and touch) data that allows for a geometrically informed 6D object pose estimation, (2) we introduce a hierarchical message passing operation that flows the information within and across modalities to learn a graph-based object representation, and (3) we introduce a method that accounts for the proprioceptive information for in-hand object representation. We evaluate our model on a diverse subset of objects from the YCB Object and Model Set, and show that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art work in accuracy and robustness to occlusion. We also deploy our proposed framework on a real robot and qualitatively demonstrate successful transfer to real settings. ",

    "abstract": "Training control policies in simulation is more appealing than on real robots directly, as it allows for exploring diverse states in a safe and efficient manner. Yet, robot simulators inevitably exhibit disparities from the real world, yielding inaccuracies that manifest as the simulation-to-real gap. Existing literature has proposed to close this gap by actively modifying specific simulator parameters to align the simulated data with real-world observations. However, the set of tunable parameters is usually manually selected to reduce the search space in a case-by-case manner, which is hard to scale up for complex systems and requires extensive domain knowledge. To address the scalability issue and automate the parameter-tuning process, we introduce an approach that aligns the simulator with the real world by discovering the causal relationship between the environment parameters and the sim-to-real gap. Concretely, our method learns a differentiable mapping from the environment parameters to the differences between simulated and real-world robot-object trajectories. This mapping is governed by a simultaneously-learned causal graph to help prune the search space of parameters, provide better interpretability, and improve generalization. We perform experiments to achieve both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer, and show that our method has significant improvements in trajectory alignment and task success rate over strong baselines in a challenging manipulation task.

However, backdoor attacks present a new security threat to it, particularly with untrustworthy third-party platforms, as pre-defined triggers set by the attacker can activate the backdoor. Most of the triggers in existing speech backdoor attacks are sample-agnostic, and even if the triggers are designed to be unnoticeable, they can still be audible. This work explores a backdoor attack that utilizes sample-specific triggers based on voice conversion. Specifically, we adopt a pre-trained voice conversion model to generate the trigger, ensuring that the poisoned samples does not introduce any additional audible noise. Extensive experiments on two speech classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. Furthermore, we analyzed the specific scenarios that activated the proposed backdoor and verified its resistance against fine-tuning. ",

More specifically, the encoder focuses on generating multiple features by estimating the influence probability between two users, and the decoder distinguishes the importance of prediction sources in different timestamps by a designed temporal attention mechanism. It's worth mentioning that the inductive learning idea ensures that TGASI can detect the sources in new scenarios without knowing other prior knowledge, which proves the scalability of TGASI.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) graph generalization are critical for many real-world applications. Existing methods neglect to discard spurious or noisy features of inputs, which are irrelevant to the label. Besides, they mainly conduct instance-level class-invariant graph learning and fail to utilize the structural class relationships between graph instances. In this work, we endeavor to address these issues in a unified framework, dubbed Individual and Structural Graph Information Bottlenecks (IS-GIB). To remove class spurious feature caused by distribution shifts, we propose Individual Graph Information Bottleneck (I-GIB) which discards irrelevant information by minimizing the mutual information between the input graph and its embeddings. To leverage the structural intra- and inter-domain correlations, we propose Structural Graph Information Bottleneck (S-GIB). Specifically for a batch of graphs with multiple domains, S-GIB first computes the pair-wise input-input, embedding-embedding, and label-label correlations. Then it minimizes the mutual information between input graph and embedding pairs while maximizing the mutual information between embedding and label pairs. The critical insight of S-GIB is to simultaneously discard spurious features and learn invariant features from a high-order perspective by maintaining class relationships under multiple distributional shifts. Notably, we unify the proposed I-GIB and S-GIB to form our complementary framework IS-GIB. Extensive experiments conducted on both node- and graph-level tasks consistently demonstrate the superior generalization ability of IS-GIB.

We then define a notion of unique information that an individual sample provides to the training of a deep network, shedding some light on the behavior of neural networks on examples that are atypical, ambiguous, or belong to underrepresented subpopulations. We relate example informativeness to generalization by deriving nonvacuous generalization gap bounds.

    "title": "Boosting Adversarial Transferability with Learnable Patch-wise Masks",
    "abstract": "Adversarial examples have raised widespread attention in security-critical applications because of their transferability across different models. Although many methods have been proposed to boost adversarial transferability, a gap still exists in the practical demand. In this paper, we argue that the model-specific discriminative regions are a key factor to cause the over-fitting to the source model, and thus reduce the transferability to the target model. For that, a patch-wise mask is utilized to prune the model-specific regions when calculating adversarial perturbations. To accurately localize these regions, we present a learnable approach to optimize the mask automatically. Specifically, we simulate the target models in our framework, and adjust the patch-wise mask according to the feedback of simulated models. To improve the efficiency, Differential Evolutionary (DE) algorithm is utilized to search for patch-wise masks for a specific image. During iterative attacks, the learned masks are applied to the image to drop out the patches related to model-specific regions, thus making the gradients more generic and improving the adversarial transferability. The proposed approach is a pre-processing method and can be integrated with existing gradient-based methods to further boost the transfer attack success rate. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We incorporate the proposed approach with existing methods in the ensemble attacks and achieve an average success rate of 93.01% against seven advanced defense methods, which can effectively enhance the state-of-the-art transfer-based attack performance.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning, has been rapidly applied in wireless communication networks. FL enables Internet of Things (IoT) clients to obtain well-trained models while preventing privacy leakage. Person detection can be deployed on edge devices with limited computing power if combined with FL to process the video data directly at the edge. However, due to the different hardware and deployment scenarios of different cameras, the data collected by the camera present non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), and the global model derived from FL aggregation is less effective. Meanwhile, existing research lacks public data set for real-world FL object detection, which is not conducive to studying the non-IID problem on IoT cameras. Therefore, we open source a non-IID IoT person detection (NIPD) data set, which is collected from five different cameras. To our knowledge, this is the first true device-based non-IID person detection data set. Based on this data set, we explain how to establish a FL experimental platform and provide a benchmark for non-IID person detection. NIPD is expected to promote the application of FL and the security of smart city. ",

Existing studies have made significant contributions to cross-modal information interaction and fusion, but they fail to fully explore hierarchical and complex semantic correlation across different modality content, severely limiting their performance on detecting multi-modal rumor. In this work, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced hierarchical information correlation learning approach (KhiCL) for multi-modal rumor detection by jointly modeling the basic semantic correlation and high-order knowledge-enhanced entity correlation. Specifically, KhiCL exploits cross-modal joint dictionary to transfer the heterogeneous unimodality features into the common feature space and captures the basic cross-modal semantic consistency and inconsistency by a cross-modal fusion layer. Moreover, considering the description of multi-modal content is narrated around entities, KhiCL extracts visual and textual entities from images and text, and designs a knowledge relevance reasoning strategy to find the shortest semantic relevant path between each pair of entities in external knowledge graph, and absorbs all complementary contextual knowledge of other connected entities in this path for learning knowledge-enhanced entity representations. Furthermore, KhiCL utilizes a signed attention mechanism to model the knowledge-enhanced entity consistency and inconsistency of intra-modality and inter-modality entity pairs by measuring their corresponding semantic relevant distance.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks rely on parallel processors for acceleration. To design operators for them, it requires not only good algorithm to reduce complexity, but also sufficient utilization of hardwares. Convolutional layers mainly contain 3 kinds of operators: convolution in forward propagation, deconvolution and dilated-convolution in backward propagation. When executing these operators, 0s are always added to tensors, causing redundant calculations. This paper gives C-K-S algorithm (ConvV2, KS-deconv, Sk-dilated), which skips these 0s in two ways: trim the filters to exclude padded 0s; transform sparse tensors to dense tensors, to avoid inserted 0s in deconvolution and dilated-convolution. In contrast to regular convolution, deconvolution is hard to accelerate due to its complicacy. This paper provides high-performance GPU implementations of C-K-S, and verifies their effectiveness with comparison to PyTorch. According to the experiments, C-K-S has advantages over PyTorch in certain cases, especially in deconvolution on small feature-maps. Further enhancement of C-K-S can be done by making full optimizations oriented at specific GPU architectures. ",

To address this problem, we propose Neural Collapse based Prompt Tuning (NPT), a novel method that optimizes prompts so that both text and image features satisfy the same simplex ETF structure. NPT incorporates two regularization terms, geometric de-biasing and multi-modal isomorphism, to enhance the robustness of V-L models under class imbalance conditions while maintaining their generalization capabilities.

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as promising data-driven PDE solvers showing encouraging results on various PDEs. However, there is a fundamental limitation of training PINNs to solve multi-dimensional PDEs and approximate highly complex solution functions. The number of training points (collocation points) required on these challenging PDEs grows substantially, but it is severely limited due to the expensive computational costs and heavy memory overhead. To overcome this issue, we propose a network architecture and training algorithm for PINNs. The proposed method, separable PINN (SPINN), operates on a per-axis basis to significantly reduce the number of network propagations in multi-dimensional PDEs unlike point-wise processing in conventional PINNs. We also propose using forward-mode automatic differentiation to reduce the computational cost of computing PDE residuals, enabling a large number of collocation points (>10^7) on a single commodity GPU. The experimental results show drastically reduced computational costs (62x in wall-clock time, 1,394x in FLOPs given the same number of collocation points) in multi-dimensional PDEs while achieving better accuracy. Furthermore, we present that SPINN can solve a chaotic (2+1)-d Navier-Stokes equation significantly faster than the best-performing prior method (9 minutes vs 10 hours in a single GPU), maintaining accuracy. Finally, we showcase that SPINN can accurately obtain the solution of a highly nonlinear and multi-dimensional PDE, a (3+1)-d Navier-Stokes equation. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-scale features are of great importance in encoding objects with scale variance in object detection tasks. A common strategy for multi-scale feature extraction is adopting the classic top-down and bottom-up feature pyramid networks. However, these approaches suffer from the loss or degradation of feature information, impairing the fusion effect of non-adjacent levels. This paper proposes an asymptotic feature pyramid network (AFPN) to support direct interaction at non-adjacent levels. AFPN is initiated by fusing two adjacent low-level features and asymptotically incorporates higher-level features into the fusion process. In this way, the larger semantic gap between non-adjacent levels can be avoided. Given the potential for multi-object information conflicts to arise during feature fusion at each spatial location, adaptive spatial fusion operation is further utilized to mitigate these inconsistencies. We incorporate the proposed AFPN into both two-stage and one-stage object detection frameworks and evaluate with the MS-COCO 2017 validation and test datasets. Experimental evaluation shows that our method achieves more competitive results than other state-of-the-art feature pyramid networks.

A typical SRS consists of three stages, i.e., training, enrollment, and recognition. Previous work has revealed that SRSs can be bypassed by backdoor attacks at the training stage or by adversarial example attacks at the recognition stage. In this paper, we propose TUNER, a new type of backdoor attack against the enrollment stage of SRS via adversarial ultrasound modulation, which is inaudible, synchronization-free, content-independent, and black-box. Our key idea is to first inject the backdoor into the SRS with modulated ultrasound when a legitimate user initiates the enrollment, and afterward, the polluted SRS will grant access to both the legitimate user and the adversary with high confidence. Our attack faces a major challenge of unpredictable user articulation at the enrollment stage. To overcome this challenge, we generate the ultrasonic backdoor by augmenting the optimization process with random speech content, vocalizing time, and volume of the user. Furthermore, to achieve real-world robustness, we improve the ultrasonic signal over traditional methods using sparse frequency points, pre-compensation, and single-sideband (SSB) modulation. We extensively evaluate TUNER on two common datasets and seven representative SRS models.

However, limited by the way of centralized processing, the model performance is greatly affected by factors like the silos problems of the models and data in reality. Therefore, the emergence of distributed artificial intelligence such as federated learning (FL) makes it possible for the dynamic aggregation among models. However, the integration process of FL is still server-dependent, which may cause a great risk to the overall model. Also, it only allows collaboration between homogeneous models, and does not have a good solution for the interaction between heterogeneous models. Therefore, we propose a Distributed Computation Model (DCM) based on the consortium blockchain network to improve the credibility of the overall model and effective coordination among heterogeneous models. In addition, a Distributed Hierarchical Integration (DHI) algorithm is also designed for the global solution process. Within a group, permissioned nodes collect the local models' results from different permissionless nodes and then sends the aggregated results back to all the permissionless nodes to regularize the processing of the local models. After the iteration is completed, the secondary integration of the local results will be performed between permission nodes to obtain the global results. In the experiments, we verify the efficiency of DCM, where the results show that the proposed model outperforms many state-of-the-art models based on a federated learning framework. ",

Salient terms in each category were then identified through qualitative comparative analysis based on scaled f-scores aggregated into hand-coded categories. To exemplify this approach, we conducted a case study on the first wave of the coronavirus in Italy. We used our proposed methodology to explore existing psychological observations which claimed that physical distance from events affects what is communicated about them. We confirmed these findings by showing that the epicentre of the disease and peripheral regions correspond to clear time-series clusters and that those living in the epicentre of the SARS CoV2 outbreak were more focused on solidarity and policy than those from more peripheral regions. Furthermore, we also found that temporal categories corresponded closely to policy changes during the handling of the pandemic. ",

However, DNNs inevitably show vulnerability, which is the weak robustness in the face of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we find some similitudes between existing deep image denoising methods, as they are consistently fooled by adversarial attacks. First, denoising-PGD is proposed which is a denoising model full adversarial method. The current mainstream non-blind denoising models (DnCNN, FFDNet, ECNDNet, BRDNet), blind denoising models (DnCNN-B, Noise2Noise, RDDCNN-B, FAN), and plug-and-play (DPIR, CurvPnP) and unfolding denoising models (DeamNet) applied to grayscale and color images can be attacked by the same set of methods. Second, since the transferability of denoising-PGD is prominent in the image denoising task, we design experiments to explore the characteristic of the latent under the transferability. We correlate transferability with similitude and conclude that the deep image denoising models have high similitude. Third, we investigate the characteristic of the adversarial space and use adversarial training to complement the vulnerability of deep image denoising to adversarial attacks on image denoising.

Moreover, the model-driven image denoising BM3D shows some resistance in the face of adversarial attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Deep unfolding network (DUN) that unfolds the optimization algorithm into a deep neural network has achieved great success in compressive sensing (CS) due to its good interpretability and high performance. Each stage in DUN corresponds to one iteration in optimization. At the test time, all the sampling images generally need to be processed by all stages, which comes at a price of computation burden and is also unnecessary for the images whose contents are easier to restore. In this paper, we focus on CS reconstruction and propose a novel Dynamic Path-Controllable Deep Unfolding Network (DPC-DUN). DPC-DUN with our designed path-controllable selector can dynamically select a rapid and appropriate route for each image and is slimmable by regulating different performance-complexity tradeoffs. Extensive experiments show that our DPC-DUN is highly flexible and can provide excellent performance and dynamic adjustment to get a suitable tradeoff, thus addressing the main requirements to become appealing in practice.

Based on Hindsight Experience Replay (HER), model-based relabeling methods have been proposed to relabel goals using virtual trajectories obtained by interacting with the trained model, which can effectively enhance the sample efficiency in accurately modelable sparse-reward environments. However, they are ineffective in robot manipulation environment. In our paper, we design a robust framework called Robust Model-based Hindsight Experience Replay (RoMo-HER) which can effectively utilize the dynamical model in robot manipulation environments to enhance the sample efficiency. RoMo-HER is built upon a dynamics model and a novel goal relabeling technique called Foresight relabeling (FR), which selects the prediction starting state with a specific strategy, predicts the future trajectory of the starting state, and then relabels the goal using the dynamics model and the latest policy to train the agent. Experimental results show that RoMo-HER has higher sample efficiency than HER and Model-based Hindsight Experience Replay in several simulated robot manipulation environments. Furthermore, we integrate RoMo-HER and Relay Hindsight Experience Replay (RHER), which currently exhibits the highest sampling efficiency in most benchmark environments, resulting in a novel approach called Robust Model-based Relay Hindsight Experience Replay (RoMo-RHER). Our experimental results demonstrate that RoMo-RHER achieves higher sample efficiency over RHER, outperforming RHER by 25% and 26% in FetchPush-v1 and FetchPickandPlace-v1, respectively. ",

However, existing solutions, such as software-based seat reservations and sensors-based occupancy detection, have proven to be inadequate in effectively addressing this problem. In this study, we propose a novel approach: a serial dual-channel object detection model based on Faster RCNN. Furthermore, we develop a user-friendly Web interface and mobile APP to create a computer vision-based platform for library seat occupancy detection. To construct our dataset, we combine real-world data collec-tion with UE5 virtual reality. The results of our tests also demonstrate that the utilization of per-sonalized virtual dataset significantly enhances the performance of the convolutional neural net-work (CNN) in dedicated scenarios. The serial dual-channel detection model comprises three es-sential steps. Firstly, we employ Faster RCNN algorithm to determine whether a seat is occupied by an individual. Subsequently, we utilize an object classification algorithm based on transfer learning, to classify and identify images of unoccupied seats. This eliminates the need for manual judgment regarding whether a person is suspected of occupying a seat. Lastly, the Web interface and APP provide seat information to librarians and students respectively, enabling comprehensive services. By leveraging deep learning methodologies, this research effectively addresses the issue of seat occupancy in library systems. It significantly enhances the accuracy of seat occupancy recognition, reduces the computational resources required for training CNNs, and greatly improves the effi-ciency of library seat management.

To improve the naturalness and aggressiveness of existing adversarial patches, location-aware patches are proposed, where the patch's location on the target object is integrated into the optimization process to perform attacks. Although it is effective, efficiently finding the optimal location for placing the patches is challenging, especially under the black-box attack settings. In this paper, we propose the Distribution-Optimized Adversarial Patch (DOPatch), a novel method that optimizes a multimodal distribution of adversarial locations instead of individual ones. DOPatch has several benefits: Firstly, we find that the locations' distributions across different models are pretty similar, and thus we can achieve efficient query-based attacks to unseen models using a distributional prior optimized on a surrogate model. Secondly, DOPatch can generate diverse adversarial samples by characterizing the distribution of adversarial locations. Thus we can improve the model's robustness to location-aware patches via carefully designed Distributional-Modeling Adversarial Training (DOP-DMAT). We evaluate DOPatch on various face recognition and image recognition tasks and demonstrate its superiority and efficiency over existing methods. We also conduct extensive ablation studies and analyses to validate the effectiveness of our method and provide insights into the distribution of adversarial locations. ",

It is also dependent on the size and complexity of the scene being rendered.

We propose a novel approach to address these issues: P2P Overlay Domains with Sovereignty (PODS), which allows nodes in a single overlay to belong to multiple heterogeneous groups, called domains. Each domain features its own set of protocols, tailored to the characteristics and needs of its nodes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PODS, we design and implement two novel node discovery protocols: FedKad and SovKad. Using a custom simulator, we show that node discovery using PODS (SovKad) architecture outperforms both single overlay (Kademlia) and multi-overlay (FedKad) architectures in terms of hop count and success rate, though FedKad requires slightly less bandwidth.

Although bringing reliable robustness, the performance toward clean examples is negatively affected after adversarial training, which means a trade-off exists between accuracy and robustness. Recently, some studies have tried to use knowledge distillation methods in adversarial training, achieving competitive performance in improving the robustness but the accuracy for clean samples is still limited. In this paper, to mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off, we introduce the Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robustness Distillation (MTARD) to guide the model's adversarial training process by applying a strong clean teacher and a strong robust teacher to handle the clean examples and adversarial examples, respectively. During the optimization process, to ensure that different teachers show similar knowledge scales, we design the Entropy-Based Balance algorithm to adjust the teacher's temperature and keep the teachers' information entropy consistent. Besides, to ensure that the student has a relatively consistent learning speed from multiple teachers, we propose the Normalization Loss Balance algorithm to adjust the learning weights of different types of knowledge. A series of experiments conducted on public datasets demonstrate that MTARD outperforms the state-of-the-art adversarial training and distillation methods against various adversarial attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Object detection on visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images, as an emerging solution to facilitate robust detection for around-the-clock applications, has received extensive attention in recent years. With the help of IR images, object detectors have been more reliable and robust in practical applications by using RGB-IR combined information. However, existing methods still suffer from modality miscalibration and fusion imprecision problems. Since transformer has the powerful capability to model the pairwise correlations between different features, in this paper, we propose a novel Calibrated and Complementary Transformer called $\\mathrm{C}^2$Former to address these two problems simultaneously. In $\\mathrm{C}^2$Former, we design an Inter-modality Cross-Attention (ICA) module to obtain the calibrated and complementary features by learning the cross-attention relationship between the RGB and IR modality. To reduce the computational cost caused by computing the global attention in ICA, an Adaptive Feature Sampling (AFS) module is introduced to decrease the dimension of feature maps. Because $\\mathrm{C}^2$Former performs in the feature domain, it can be embedded into existed RGB-IR object detectors via the backbone network. Thus, one single-stage and one two-stage object detector both incorporating our $\\mathrm{C}^2$Former are constructed to evaluate its effectiveness and versatility. With extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle and KAIST RGB-IR datasets, we verify that our method can fully utilize the RGB-IR complementary information and achieve robust detection results.

    "abstract": "Given the special situation of modeling gigapixel images, multiple instance learning (MIL) has become one of the most important frameworks for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. In current practice, most MIL networks often face two unavoidable problems in training: i) insufficient WSI data, and ii) the data memorization nature inherent in neural networks. These problems may hinder MIL models from adequate and efficient training, suppressing the continuous performance promotion of classification models on WSIs. Inspired by the basic idea of Mixup, this paper proposes a Pseudo-bag Mixup (PseMix) data augmentation scheme to improve the training of MIL models. This scheme generalizes the Mixup strategy for general images to special WSIs via pseudo-bags so as to be applied in MIL-based WSI classification. Cooperated by pseudo-bags, our PseMix fulfills the critical size alignment and semantic alignment in Mixup strategy. Moreover, it is designed as an efficient and decoupled method adaptive to MIL, neither involving time-consuming operations nor relying on MIL model predictions. Comparative experiments and ablation studies are specially designed to evaluate the effectiveness and advantages of our PseMix. Test results show that PseMix could often improve the performance of MIL networks in WSI classification. Besides, it could also boost the generalization capacity of MIL models, and promote their robustness to patch occlusion and noisy labels.

However, in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs), message passing on a graph is independent from text, resulting in the graph representation hidden space differing from that of the text. This training regime of existing models therefore leads to a semantic gap between graph knowledge and text. In this study, we propose a novel framework for knowledge graph enhanced dialogue generation. We dynamically construct a multi-hop knowledge graph with pseudo nodes to involve the language model in feature aggregation within the graph at all steps. To avoid the semantic biases caused by learning on vanilla subgraphs, the proposed framework applies hierarchical graph attention to aggregate graph features on pseudo nodes and then attains a global feature. Therefore, the framework can better utilise the heterogeneous features from both the post and external graph knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on dialogue generation. Further analysis also shows that our representation learning framework can fill the semantic gap by coagulating representations of both text and graph knowledge. Moreover, the language model also learns how to better select knowledge triples for a more informative response via exploiting subgraph patterns within our feature aggregation process.

In this paper, we propose a novel Low-confidence Samples Mining (LSM) method to utilize low-confidence pseudo-labels efficiently. Specifically, we develop an additional pseudo information mining (PIM) branch on account of low-resolution feature maps to extract reliable large-area instances, the IoUs of which are higher than small-area ones. Owing to the complementary predictions between PIM and the main branch, we further design self-distillation (SD) to compensate for both in a mutually-learning manner. Meanwhile, the extensibility of the above approaches enables our LSM to apply to Faster-RCNN and Deformable-DETR respectively.

    "abstract": "The Uncanny Valley phenomenon refers to the feeling of unease that arises when interacting with characters that appear almost, but not quite, human-like. First theorised by Masahiro Mori in 1970, it has since been widely observed in different contexts from humanoid robots to video games, in which it can result in players feeling uncomfortable or disconnected from the game, leading to a lack of immersion and potentially reducing the overall enjoyment. The phenomenon has been observed and described mostly through behavioural studies based on self-reported scales of uncanny feeling: however, there is still no consensus on its cognitive and perceptual origins, which limits our understanding of its impact on player experience. In this paper, we present a study aimed at identifying the mechanisms that trigger the uncanny response by collecting and analysing both self-reported feedback and EEG data. ",

Nevertheless, there is still a lack of high-quality, real-world datasets to conduct large-scale experiments and evaluate models for personalized search. This paper contributes to filling this gap by introducing SE-PQA (StackExchange - Personalized Question Answering), a new curated resource to design and evaluate personalized models related to the task of community Question Answering (cQA). The contributed dataset includes more than 1 million queries and 2 million answers, annotated with a rich set of features modeling the social interactions among the users of a popular cQA platform. We describe the characteristics of SE-PQA and detail the features associated with questions and answers. We also provide reproducible baseline methods for the cQA task based on the resource, including deep learning models and personalization approaches. The results of the preliminary experiments conducted show the appropriateness of SE-PQA to train effective cQA models; they also show that personalization remarkably improves the effectiveness of all the methods tested. Furthermore, we show the benefits in terms of robustness and generalization of combining data from multiple communities for personalization purposes. ",

Recently, various MIMO signal detectors based on deep learning techniques and quantum(-inspired) algorithms have been proposed to improve the detection performance compared with conventional detectors. This paper focuses on the simulated bifurcation (SB) algorithm, a quantum-inspired algorithm. This paper proposes two techniques to improve its detection performance. The first is modifying the algorithm inspired by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to eliminate local minima of maximum likelihood detection. The second is the use of deep unfolding, a deep learning technique to train the internal parameters of an iterative algorithm. We propose a deep-unfolded SB by making the update rule of SB differentiable. The numerical results show that these proposed detectors significantly improve the signal detection performance in massive MIMO systems. ",

We propose an analogy-based approach that starts from seed entities of interest in a generic KG, and keeps or prunes their neighboring entities. We evaluate our approach on Wikidata through two manually labeled datasets that contain either domain-homogeneous or -heterogeneous seed entities. We empirically show that our analogy-based approach outperforms LSTM, Random Forest, SVM, and MLP, with a drastically lower number of parameters.

    "abstract": "Social world knowledge is a key ingredient in effective communication and information processing by humans and machines alike. As of today, there exist many knowledge bases that represent factual world knowledge. Yet, there is no resource that is designed to capture social aspects of world knowledge. We believe that this work makes an important step towards the formulation and construction of such a resource. We introduce SocialVec, a general framework for eliciting low-dimensional entity embeddings from the social contexts in which they occur in social networks. In this framework, entities correspond to highly popular accounts which invoke general interest. We assume that entities that individual users tend to co-follow are socially related, and use this definition of social context to learn the entity embeddings. Similar to word embeddings which facilitate tasks that involve text semantics, we expect the learned social entity embeddings to benefit multiple tasks of social flavor. In this work, we elicited the social embeddings of roughly 200K entities from a sample of 1.3M Twitter users and the accounts that they follow. We employ and gauge the resulting embeddings on two tasks of social importance. First, we assess the political bias of news sources in terms of entity similarity in the social embedding space. Second, we predict the personal traits of individual Twitter users based on the social embeddings of entities that they follow. In both cases, we show advantageous or competitive performance using our approach compared with task-specific baselines. We further show that existing entity embedding schemes, which are fact-based, fail to capture social aspects of knowledge. We make the learned social entity embeddings available to the research community to support further exploration of social world knowledge and its applications. ",

Conventional methods for addressing this issue involve converting raw point clouds to intermediate representations such as 3D voxel grids or range images.

Approaches that do learn on raw point clouds either have trouble in resolving neighborhood relationships between points or are too complicated in their formulation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to representing point clouds as a locality preserving 1D ordering induced by the Hilbert space-filling curve. We also introduce Point2Point, a neural architecture that can effectively learn on Hilbert-sorted point clouds. We show that Point2Point shows competitive performance on point cloud segmentation and generation tasks.

VBN provides better modeling for long-tail entities via two complementary mechanisms: First, VBN employs informative hierarchical priors that enable information propagation between entities sharing common ancestors. Additionally, VBN models explicit relations between entities that enforce complementary structure and consistency, guiding the learned representations towards a more meaningful arrangement in space. Second, VBN represents entities by densities (rather than vectors), hence modeling uncertainty that plays a complementary role in coping with data scarcity. Finally, we propose a scalable Variational Bayes optimization algorithm that enables fast approximate Bayesian inference. We evaluate the effectiveness of VBN on linguistic, recommendations, and medical inference tasks. Our findings show that VBN outperforms other existing methods across multiple datasets, and especially in the long-tail. ",

Identifiability provides the theoretical grounding for disentanglement to be well-founded. Unfortunately, unsupervised identifiability of independent latent factors is a theoretically proven impossibility in the i.i.d. setting under a general nonlinear smooth map from factors to observations. In this work, we show that, remarkably, it is possible to recover discretized latent coordinates under a highly generic nonlinear smooth mapping (a diffeomorphism) without any additional inductive bias on the mapping. This is, assuming that latent density has axis-aligned discontinuity landmarks, but without making the unrealistic assumption of statistical independence of the factors. We introduce this novel form of identifiability, termed quantized coordinate identifiability, and provide a comprehensive proof of the recovery of discretized coordinates. ",

The detection of Sybil attacks is essential to ensure trusted communication in FANET. Nevertheless, the conventional methods only utilize the untrusted information that UAV nodes passively ``heard'' from the ``auditory\" domain (AD), resulting in severe communication disruptions and even collision accidents. In this paper, we present a novel VA-matching solution that matches the neighbors observed from both the AD and the ``visual'' domain (VD), which is the first solution that enables UAVs to accurately correlate what they ``see'' from VD and ``hear'' from AD to detect the Sybil attacks. Relative entropy is utilized to describe the similarity of observed characteristics from dual domains. The dynamic weight algorithm is proposed to distinguish neighbors according to the characteristics' popularity. The matching model of neighbors observed from AD and VD is established and solved by the vampire bat optimizer. Experiment results show that the proposed VA-matching solution removes the unreliability of individual characteristics and single domains. It significantly outperforms the conventional RSSI-based method in detecting Sybil attacks. Furthermore, it has strong robustness and achieves high precision and recall rates. ",

We selected the NTU-RGBD human action benchmark as the source domain and used our collected dataset as the target domain. We analyzed the transferability of the pre-trained models and proposed two configurations to apply and adapt the transfer learning technique to the diversity between the source and target domains. The use of transfer learning helped to improve the performance of the human action system within the context of theatre.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as a powerful tool for learning from graph-structured data and performing sophisticated inference tasks in various application domains. Although GNNs have been shown to be effective on modest-sized graphs, training them on large-scale graphs remains a significant challenge due to lack of efficient data access and data movement methods. Existing frameworks for training GNNs use CPUs for graph sampling and feature aggregation, while the training and updating of model weights are executed on GPUs. However, our in-depth profiling shows the CPUs cannot achieve the throughput required to saturate GNN model training throughput, causing gross under-utilization of expensive GPU resources. Furthermore, when the graph and its embeddings do not fit in the CPU memory, the overhead introduced by the operating system, say for handling page-faults, comes in the critical path of execution. To address these issues, we propose the GPU Initiated Direct Storage Access (GIDS) dataloader, to enable GPU-oriented GNN training for large-scale graphs while efficiently utilizing all hardware resources, such as CPU memory, storage, and GPU memory with a hybrid data placement strategy. By enabling GPU threads to fetch feature vectors directly from storage, GIDS dataloader solves the memory capacity problem for GPU-oriented GNN training. Moreover, GIDS dataloader leverages GPU parallelism to tolerate storage latency and eliminates expensive page-fault overhead. Doing so enables us to design novel optimizations for exploiting locality and increasing effective bandwidth for GNN training. Our evaluation using a single GPU on terabyte-scale GNN datasets shows that GIDS dataloader accelerates the overall DGL GNN training pipeline by up to 392X when compared to the current, state-of-the-art DGL dataloader.

In this paper, we develop a quantitative framework to evaluate whose opinions model-generated responses are more similar to. We first build a dataset, GlobalOpinionQA, comprised of questions and answers from cross-national surveys designed to capture diverse opinions on global issues across different countries. Next, we define a metric that quantifies the similarity between LLM-generated survey responses and human responses, conditioned on country. With our framework, we run three experiments on an LLM trained to be helpful, honest, and harmless with Constitutional AI. By default, LLM responses tend to be more similar to the opinions of certain populations, such as those from the USA, and some European and South American countries, highlighting the potential for biases. When we prompt the model to consider a particular country's perspective, responses shift to be more similar to the opinions of the prompted populations, but can reflect harmful cultural stereotypes. When we translate GlobalOpinionQA questions to a target language, the model's responses do not necessarily become the most similar to the opinions of speakers of those languages.

We present an approach using perturbations of adjacency matrix of a graph. We check wether the graph is connected or not by comparing the solutions of the two systems of linear algebraic equations (SLAE): the first SLAE with a perturbed adjacency matrix of the graph and the second SLAE with~unperturbed matrix. This approach makes it possible to use effective numerical implementations of SLAE solution methods to solve connectivity problems on graphs. Iterations of iterative numerical methods for solving such SLAE can be considered as carrying out a graph traversal. Generally speaking, the traversal is not equivalent to the traversal that is carried out with breadth-first search. An algorithm for finding the connected components of a graph using such a traversal is presented. For any instance of the problem, this algorithm has no greater computational complexity than breadth-first search, and for~most individual problems it has less complexity. ",

Such attacks are known as data poisoning. Recent advances in defense strategies against data poisoning have highlighted the effectiveness of aggregation schemes in achieving state-of-the-art results in certified poisoning robustness. However, the practical implications of these approaches remain unclear. Here we focus on Deep Partition Aggregation, a representative aggregation defense, and assess its practical aspects, including efficiency, performance, and robustness. For evaluations, we use ImageNet resized to a resolution of 64 by 64 to enable evaluations at a larger scale than previous ones. Firstly, we demonstrate a simple yet practical approach to scaling base models, which improves the efficiency of training and inference for aggregation defenses. Secondly, we provide empirical evidence supporting the data-to-complexity ratio, i.e. the ratio between the data set size and sample complexity, as a practical estimation of the maximum number of base models that can be deployed while preserving accuracy. Last but not least, we point out how aggregation defenses boost poisoning robustness empirically through the poisoning overfitting phenomenon, which is the key underlying mechanism for the empirical poisoning robustness of aggregations. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights for practical implementations of aggregation defenses to mitigate the threat of data poisoning. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel method for gravitational wave detection that combines: 1) hybrid dilated convolution neural networks to accurately model both short- and long-range temporal sequential information of gravitational wave signals; and 2) graph neural networks to capture spatial correlations among gravitational wave observatories to consistently describe and identify the presence of a signal in a detector network. These spatiotemporal-graph AI models are tested for signal detection of gravitational waves emitted by quasi-circular, non-spinning and quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary black hole mergers. For the latter case, we needed a dataset of 1.2 million modeled waveforms to densely sample this signal manifold. Thus, we reduced time-to-solution by training several AI models in the Polaris supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Supercomputing Facility within 1.7 hours by distributing the training over 256 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving optimal classification performance. This approach also exhibits strong scaling up to 512 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We then created ensembles of AI models to process data from a three detector network, namely, the advanced LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors, and the advanced Virgo detector. An ensemble of 2 AI models achieves state-of-the-art performance for signal detection, and reports seven misclassifications per decade of searched data, whereas an ensemble of 4 AI models achieves optimal performance for signal detection with two misclassifications for every decade of searched data. Finally, when we distributed AI inference over 128 GPUs in the Polaris supercomputer and 128 nodes in the Theta supercomputer, our AI ensemble is capable of processing a decade of gravitational wave data from a three detector network within 3.5 hours.

This equation extends the Jansen and Rit neural mass model, which has been introduced to describe human electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms, in particular signals with epileptic activity. Our contributions are threefold: First, we introduce this stochastic N-population model and construct a reliable and efficient numerical method for its simulation, extending a splitting procedure for one neural population. Second, we present a modified Sequential Monte Carlo Approximate Bayesian Computation (SMC-ABC) algorithm to infer both the continuous and the discrete model parameters, the latter describing the coupling directions within the network. The proposed algorithm further develops a previous reference-table acceptance rejection ABC method, initially proposed for the inference of one neural population. On the one hand, the considered SMC-ABC approach reduces the computational cost due to the basic acceptance-rejection scheme. On the other hand, it is designed to account for both marginal and coupled interacting dynamics, allowing to identify the directed connectivity structure. Third, we illustrate the derived algorithm on both simulated data and real multi-channel EEG data, aiming to infer the brain's connectivity structure during epileptic seizure. The proposed algorithm may be used for parameter and network estimation in other multi-dimensional coupled SDEs for which a suitable numerical simulation method can be derived. ",

We define three kinds of leaders, junior (10-15), mid (15-20), and senior (20+) based on career age. By considering the combinations of any two leaders, we distinguish shared leadership as heterogeneous when leaders are in different age cohorts and homogeneous when leaders are in the same age cohort. Drawing on 1,845,351 CS, 254,039 Sociology, and 193,338 Business teams with two leaders in the OpenAlex dataset, we identify that heterogeneous shared leadership brings higher citation impact for teams than homogeneous shared leadership. Specifically, when junior leaders are paired with senior leaders, it significantly increases team citation ranking by 1-2%, in comparison with two leaders of similar age. We explore the patterns between homogeneous leaders and heterogeneous leaders from team scale, expertise composition, and knowledge recency perspectives. Compared with homogeneous leaders, heterogeneous leaders are more adaptive in large teams, have more diverse expertise, and trace both the newest and oldest references. ",

However, we are seeing a rapidly increasing fraction of floating point computing power in leadership-class computing facilities and traditional data centers coming from new accelerator architectures, such as GPUs. HEP experiments are now faced with the untenable prospect of rewriting millions of lines of x86 CPU code, for the increasingly dominant architectures found in these computational accelerators. This task is made more challenging by the architecture-specific languages and APIs promoted by manufacturers such as NVIDIA, Intel and AMD. Producing multiple, architecture-specific implementations is not a viable scenario, given the available person power and code maintenance issues. The Portable Parallelization Strategies team of the HEP Center for Computational Excellence is investigating the use of Kokkos, SYCL, OpenMP, std::execution::parallel and alpaka as potential portability solutions that promise to execute on multiple architectures from the same source code, using representative use cases from major HEP experiments, including the DUNE experiment of the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility, and the ATLAS and CMS experiments of the Large Hadron Collider. This cross-cutting evaluation of portability solutions using real applications will help inform and guide the HEP community when choosing their software and hardware suites for the next generation of experimental frameworks. We present the outcomes of our studies, including performance metrics, porting challenges, API evaluations, and build system integration. ",

By using bandwidth-variable transceivers, colorless flexible-grid reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADM), as well as a choice of different optical source types, operators can provide a range of service types and improve network efficiency. Implementation of the EON network requires careful consideration, especially in terms of the ROADM structure to achieve optimal performance. We propose a low-cost ROADM structure with an order-based connection method that includes a high degree with a blocking probability of less than 10-4. Then, we applied the new design of ROADM in EON that transported 1 Tb/s. In the final step, we conclude that our system accommodated 20 percent more traffic demand over an average of the low-rate wavelength approach. ",

    "abstract": "Liver cancer has high morbidity and mortality rates in the world. Multi-phase CT is a main medical imaging modality for detecting/identifying and diagnosing liver tumors. Automatically detecting and classifying liver lesions in CT images have the potential to improve the clinical workflow. This task remains challenging due to liver lesions' large variations in size, appearance, image contrast, and the complexities of tumor types or subtypes. In this work, we customize a multi-object labeling tool for multi-phase CT images, which is used to curate a large-scale dataset containing 1,631 patients with four-phase CT images, multi-organ masks, and multi-lesion (six major types of liver lesions confirmed by pathology) masks. We develop a two-stage liver lesion detection pipeline, where the high-sensitivity detecting algorithms in the first stage discover as many lesion proposals as possible, and the lesion-reclassification algorithms in the second stage remove as many false alarms as possible. The multi-sensitivity lesion detection algorithm maximizes the information utilization of the individual probability maps of segmentation, and the lesion-shuffle augmentation effectively explores the texture contrast between lesions and the liver. Independently tested on 331 patient cases, the proposed model achieves high sensitivity and specificity for malignancy classification in the multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT (99.2%, 97.1%, diagnosis setting) and in the noncontrast CT (97.3%, 95.7%, screening setting).

This mechanism allows to obtain a constraint on the segmentation based on the resolution of a PDE. The study of the results allows us to observe the spatial information retained by the neural network on the region of interest and obtains competitive results on the binary segmentation.

More than 16 Nobel Laureates have been awarded for their contribution to superconductivity research. Superconductors are valuable for sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as climate change mitigation, affordable and clean energy, industry, innovation and infrastructure, and so on. However, a unified physics theory explaining all superconductivity mechanism is still unknown. It is believed that superconductivity is microscopically due to not only molecular compositions but also the geometric crystal structure. Hence a new dataset, S2S, containing both crystal structures and superconducting critical temperature, is built upon SuperCon and Material Project. Based on this new dataset, we propose a novel model, S2SNet, which utilizes the attention mechanism for superconductivity prediction. To overcome the shortage of data, S2SNet is pre-trained on the whole Material Project dataset with Masked-Language Modeling (MLM). S2SNet makes a new state-of-the-art, with out-of-sample accuracy of 92% and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.92. To the best of our knowledge, S2SNet is the first work to predict superconductivity with only information of crystal structures.

This feature enables us to move beyond one dimensional interval-based index sets that were previously considered in the literature. Specializing our general result, we obtain the first bounds on the Gaussian random field approximation of wide random neural networks of any depth and Lipschitz activation functions at the random field level.

    "abstract": "Treatment planning is a critical component of the radiotherapy workflow, typically carried out by a medical physicist using a time-consuming trial-and-error manner. Previous studies have proposed knowledge-based or deep learning-based methods for predicting dose distribution maps to assist medical physicists in improving the efficiency of treatment planning. However, these dose prediction methods usuallylack the effective utilization of distance information between surrounding tissues andtargets or organs-at-risk (OARs). Moreover, they are poor in maintaining the distribution characteristics of ray paths in the predicted dose distribution maps, resulting in a loss of valuable information obtained by medical physicists. In this paper, we propose a distance-aware diffusion model (DoseDiff) for precise prediction of dose distribution. We define dose prediction as a sequence of denoising steps, wherein the predicted dose distribution map is generated with the conditions of the CT image and signed distance maps (SDMs). The SDMs are obtained by a distance transformation from the masks of targets or OARs, which provide the distance information from each pixel in the image to the outline of the targets or OARs. Besides, we propose a multiencoder and multi-scale fusion network (MMFNet) that incorporates a multi-scale fusion and a transformer-based fusion module to enhance information fusion between the CT image and SDMs at the feature level. Our model was evaluated on two datasets collected from patients with breast cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer, respectively. The results demonstrate that our DoseDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art dose prediction methods in terms of both quantitative and visual quality. ",

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a novel surrogate modelling approach to efficiently and accurately approximate the response of complex dynamical systems driven by time-varying exogenous excitations over extended time periods. Our approach, that we name \\emph{manifold nonlinear autoregressive modelling with exogenous input} (mNARX), involves constructing a problem-specific exogenous input manifold that is optimal for constructing autoregressive surrogates. The manifold, which forms the core of mNARX, is constructed incrementally by incorporating the physics of the system, as well as prior expert- and domain- knowledge. Because mNARX decomposes the full problem into a series of smaller sub-problems, each with a lower complexity than the original, it scales well with the complexity of the problem, both in terms of training and evaluation costs of the final surrogate. Furthermore, mNARX synergizes well with traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, making it highly suitable for modelling dynamical systems with high-dimensional exogenous inputs, a class of problems that is typically challenging to solve.Since domain knowledge is particularly abundant in physical systems, such as those found in engineering applications, mNARX is well suited for these applications. We demonstrate that mNARX outperforms traditional autoregressive surrogates in predicting the response of a classical coupled spring-mass system excited by a one-dimensional random excitation. Additionally, we show that mNARX is well suited for emulating very high-dimensional time- and state-dependent systems, even when affected by active controllers, by surrogating the dynamics of a realistic aero-servo-elastic onshore wind turbine simulator. In general, our results demonstrate that mNARX offers promising prospects for modelling complex dynamical systems, in terms of accuracy and efficiency. ",
