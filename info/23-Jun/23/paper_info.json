    "abstract": "Accurate epidemic forecasting plays a vital role for governments in developing effective prevention measures for suppressing epidemics. Most of the present spatio-temporal models cannot provide a general framework for stable, and accurate forecasting of epidemics with diverse evolution trends. Incorporating epidemiological domain knowledge ranging from single-patch to multi-patch into neural networks is expected to improve forecasting accuracy. However, relying solely on single-patch knowledge neglects inter-patch interactions, while constructing multi-patch knowledge is challenging without population mobility data. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel hybrid model called Metapopulation-based Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (MPSTAN). This model aims to improve the accuracy of epidemic forecasting by incorporating multi-patch epidemiological knowledge into a spatio-temporal model and adaptively defining inter-patch interactions. Moreover, we incorporate inter-patch epidemiological knowledge into both the model construction and loss function to help the model learn epidemic transmission dynamics. Extensive experiments conducted on two representative datasets with different epidemiological evolution trends demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the baselines and provides more accurate and stable short- and long-term forecasting. We confirm the effectiveness of domain knowledge in the learning model and investigate the impact of different ways of integrating domain knowledge on forecasting. We observe that using domain knowledge in both model construction and loss functions leads to more efficient forecasting, and selecting appropriate domain knowledge can improve accuracy further. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is a powerful technique for transferring knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model to a student model. However, the true potential of knowledge transfer has not been fully explored. Existing approaches primarily focus on distilling individual information or instance-level relationships, overlooking the valuable information embedded in token-level relationships, which may be particularly affected by the long-tail effects. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Distillation with Token-level Relationship Graph (TRG) that leverages the token-wise relational knowledge to enhance the performance of knowledge distillation. By employing TRG, the student model can effectively emulate higher-level semantic information from the teacher model, resulting in improved distillation results. To further enhance the learning process, we introduce a token-wise contextual loss called contextual loss, which encourages the student model to capture the inner-instance semantic contextual of the teacher model. We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method against several state-of-the-art approaches. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of TRG across various visual classification tasks, including those involving imbalanced data. Our method consistently outperforms the existing baselines, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in the field of knowledge distillation. ",

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental challenges in causal inference is to estimate the causal effect of a treatment on its outcome of interest from observational data. However, causal effect estimation often suffers from the impacts of confounding bias caused by unmeasured confounders that affect both the treatment and the outcome. The instrumental variable (IV) approach is a powerful way to eliminate the confounding bias from latent confounders. However, the existing IV-based estimators require a nominated IV, and for a conditional IV (CIV) the corresponding conditioning set too, for causal effect estimation. This limits the application of IV-based estimators. In this paper, by leveraging the advantage of disentangled representation learning, we propose a novel method, named DVAE.CIV, for learning and disentangling the representations of CIV and the representations of its conditioning set for causal effect estimations from data with latent confounders. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DVAE.CIV method against the existing causal effect estimators. ",

We study global specifications that - when satisfied - provide guarantees for all potential inputs. We introduce a hyperproperty formalism that allows for expressing global specifications such as monotonicity, Lipschitz continuity, global robustness, and dependency fairness. Our formalism enables verifying global specifications using existing neural network verification approaches by leveraging capabilities for verifying general computational graphs. Thereby, we extend the scope of guarantees that can be provided using existing methods. Recent success in verifying specific global specifications shows that attaining strong guarantees for all potential data points is feasible. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a set representation called polynomial logical zonotopes for performing exact and computationally efficient reachability analysis on logical systems. Polynomial logical zonotopes are a generalization of logical zonotopes, which are able to represent up to 2^n binary vectors using only n generators. Due to their construction, logical zonotopes are only able to support exact computations of some logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR), while other operations (AND, NAND, OR, NOR) result in over-approximations. In order to perform all fundamental logical operations exactly, we formulate a generalization of logical zonotopes that is constructed by additional dependent generators and exponent matrices. We prove that through this polynomial-like construction, we are able to perform all of the fundamental logical operations (XOR, NOT, XNOR, AND, NAND, OR, NOR) exactly. While we are able to perform all of the logical operations exactly, this comes with a slight increase in computational complexity compared to logical zonotopes. We show that we can use polynomial logical zonotopes to perform exact reachability analysis while retaining a low computational complexity. To illustrate and showcase the computational benefits of polynomial logical zonotopes, we present the results of performing reachability analysis on two use cases: (1) safety verification of an intersection crossing protocol, (2) and reachability analysis on a high-dimensional Boolean function. Moreover, to highlight the extensibility of logical zonotopes, we include an additional use case where we perform a computationally tractable exhaustive search for the key of a linear-feedback shift register.

Traditionally, technical experts like database administrators would manually prepare BI-models (e.g., in star or snowflake schemas) that join tables in data warehouses, before less-technical business users can run analytics using end-user dashboarding tools. However, the popularity of self-service BI (e.g., Tableau and Power-BI) in recent years creates a strong demand for less technical end-users to build BI-models themselves. We develop an Auto-BI system that can accurately predict BI models given a set of input tables, using a principled graph-based optimization problem we propose called \\textit{k-Min-Cost-Arborescence} (k-MCA), which holistically considers both local join prediction and global schema-graph structures, leveraging a graph-theoretical structure called \\textit{arborescence}. While we prove k-MCA is intractable and inapproximate in general, we develop novel algorithms that can solve k-MCA optimally, which is shown to be efficient in practice with sub-second latency and can scale to the largest BI-models we encounter (with close to 100 tables). Auto-BI is rigorously evaluated on a unique dataset with over 100K real BI models we harvested, as well as on 4 popular TPC benchmarks. It is shown to be both efficient and accurate, achieving over 0.9 F1-score on both real and synthetic benchmarks. ",

In contrast, our proposed method, named LPFormer, uses only LiDAR as its input along with its corresponding 3D annotations. LPFormer consists of two stages: the first stage detects the human bounding box and extracts multi-level feature representations, while the second stage employs a transformer-based network to regress the human keypoints using these features.

In this paper, we introduce DGC-GNN, a novel algorithm that employs a global-to-local Graph Neural Network (GNN) that progressively exploits geometric and color cues to represent keypoints, thereby improving matching robustness. Our global-to-local procedure encodes both Euclidean and angular relations at a coarse level, forming the geometric embedding to guide the local point matching. We evaluate DGC-GNN on both indoor and outdoor datasets, demonstrating that it not only doubles the accuracy of the state-of-the-art descriptor-free algorithm but, also, substantially narrows the performance gap between descriptor-based and descriptor-free methods.

Inspired by recent advances in transformer-based models, we train agents with an instruction prediction loss that encourages learning temporally extended representations that operate at a high level of abstraction. Concretely, we demonstrate that instruction modeling significantly improves performance in planning environments when training with a limited number of demonstrations on the BabyAI and Crafter benchmarks. In further analysis we find that instruction modeling is most important for tasks that require complex reasoning, while understandably offering smaller gains in environments that require simple plans.

In this work, we propose to model spectro-polarimetric fields, the spatial Stokes-vector distribution of any light ray at an arbitrary wavelength. We present Neural Spectro-polarimetric Fields (NeSpoF), a neural representation that models the physically-valid Stokes vector at given continuous variables of position, direction, and wavelength. NeSpoF manages inherently noisy raw measurements, showcases memory efficiency, and preserves physically vital signals, factors that are crucial for representing the high-dimensional signal of a spectro-polarimetric field. To validate NeSpoF, we introduce the first multi-view hyperspectral-polarimetric image dataset, comprised of both synthetic and real-world scenes. These were captured using our compact hyperspectral-polarimetric imaging system, which has been calibrated for robustness against system imperfections. We demonstrate the capabilities of NeSpoF on diverse scenes. ",

PatchCleanser arXiv:2108.09135 [cs.CV], the state-of-the-art certified defense, uses a double-masking strategy for robust classification. The success of this strategy relies heavily on the model's invariance to image pixel masking. In this paper, we take a closer look at model training schemes to improve this invariance. Instead of using Random Cutout arXiv:1708.04552v2 [cs.CV] augmentations like PatchCleanser, we introduce the notion of worst-case masking, i.e., selecting masked images which maximize classification loss. However, finding worst-case masks requires an exhaustive search, which might be prohibitively expensive to do on-the-fly during training. To solve this problem, we propose a two-round greedy masking strategy (Greedy Cutout) which finds an approximate worst-case mask location with much less compute. We show that the models trained with our Greedy Cutout improves certified robust accuracy over Random Cutout in PatchCleanser across a range of datasets and architectures. Certified robust accuracy on ImageNet with a ViT-B16-224 model increases from 58.1\\% to 62.3\\% against a 3\\% square patch applied anywhere on the image. ",

Given the tremendous information inside RGB-X networks, previous works typically apply naive fusion (e.g., average or max fusion) or only focus on the feature fusion at the same scale(s). While in this paper, we propose a novel method called RXFOOD for the fusion of features across different scales within the same modality branch and from different modality branches simultaneously in a unified attention mechanism. An Energy Exchange Module is designed for the interaction of each feature map's energy matrix, who reflects the inter-relationship of different positions and different channels inside a feature map. The RXFOOD method can be easily incorporated to any dual-branch encoder-decoder network as a plug-in module, and help the original backbone network better focus on important positions and channels for object of interest detection. Experimental results on RGB-NIR salient object detection, RGB-D salient object detection, and RGBFrequency image manipulation detection demonstrate the clear effectiveness of the proposed RXFOOD. ",

    "abstract": "Transfer-based attacks generate adversarial examples on the surrogate model, which can mislead other black-box models without any access, making it promising to attack real-world applications. Recently, several works have been proposed to boost adversarial transferability, in which the surrogate model is usually overlooked. In this work, we identify that non-linear layers (e.g., ReLU, max-pooling, etc.) truncate the gradient during backward propagation, making the gradient w.r.t.input image imprecise to the loss function. We hypothesize and empirically validate that such truncation undermines the transferability of adversarial examples. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method called Backward Propagation Attack (BPA) to increase the relevance between the gradient w.r.t. input image and loss function so as to generate adversarial examples with higher transferability. Specifically, BPA adopts a non-monotonic function as the derivative of ReLU and incorporates softmax with temperature to smooth the derivative of max-pooling, thereby mitigating the information loss during the backward propagation of gradients. Empirical results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that not only does our method substantially boost the adversarial transferability, but it also is general to existing transfer-based attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs represent real-world entities and their relations in a semantically-rich structure supported by ontologies. Exploring this data with machine learning methods often relies on knowledge graph embeddings, which produce latent representations of entities that preserve structural and local graph neighbourhood properties, but sacrifice explainability. However, in tasks such as link or relation prediction, understanding which specific features better explain a relation is crucial to support complex or critical applications. We propose SEEK, a novel approach for explainable representations to support relation prediction in knowledge graphs. It is based on identifying relevant shared semantic aspects (i.e., subgraphs) between entities and learning representations for each subgraph, producing a multi-faceted and explainable representation. We evaluate SEEK on two real-world highly complex relation prediction tasks: protein-protein interaction prediction and gene-disease association prediction. Our extensive analysis using established benchmarks demonstrates that SEEK achieves significantly better performance than standard learning representation methods while identifying both sufficient and necessary explanations based on shared semantic aspects.

    "abstract": "Vector embeddings have become ubiquitous tools for many language-related tasks. A leading embedding model is OpenAI's text-ada-002 which can embed approximately 6,000 words into a 1,536-dimensional vector. While powerful, text-ada-002 is not open source and is only available via API. We trained a simple neural network to convert open-source 768-dimensional MPNet embeddings into text-ada-002 embeddings. We compiled a subset of 50,000 online food reviews. We calculated MPNet and text-ada-002 embeddings for each review and trained a simple neural network to for 75 epochs. The neural network was designed to predict the corresponding text-ada-002 embedding for a given MPNET embedding. Our model achieved an average cosine similarity of 0.932 on 10,000 unseen reviews in our held-out test dataset. We manually assessed the quality of our predicted embeddings for vector search over text-ada-002-embedded reviews. While not as good as real text-ada-002 embeddings, predicted embeddings were able to retrieve highly relevant reviews. Our final model, Vec2Vec, is lightweight (<80 MB) and fast. Future steps include training a neural network with a more sophisticated architecture and a larger dataset of paired embeddings to achieve greater performance. The ability to convert between and align embedding spaces may be helpful for interoperability, limiting dependence on proprietary models, protecting data privacy, reducing costs, and offline operations.

All the models are evaluated using the BLEU score. In addition, the languages are classified under three groups namely East Indo- Aryan (EI), Dravidian (DR), and West Indo-Aryan (WI). The effect of language relatedness on MNMT model efficiency is studied. Owing to the presence of large corpora from English (EN) to ILs, MNMT IL-IL models using EN as a pivot are also built and examined. To achieve this, English- Indic (EN-IL) models are also developed, with and without the usage of related languages. Results reveal that using related languages is beneficial for the WI group only, while it is detrimental for the EI group and shows an inconclusive effect on the DR group, but it is useful for EN-IL models. Thus, related language groups are used to develop pivot MNMT models. Furthermore, the IL corpora are transliterated from the corresponding scripts to a modified ITRANS script, and the best MNMT models from the previous approaches are built on the transliterated corpus. It is observed that the usage of pivot models greatly improves MNMT baselines with AS-TA achieving the minimum BLEU score and PA-HI achieving the maximum score. Among languages, AS, ML, and TA achieve the lowest BLEU score, whereas HI, PA, and GU perform the best. Transliteration also helps the models with few exceptions. The best increment of scores is observed in ML, TA, and BN and the worst average increment is observed in KN, HI, and PA, across all languages. The best model obtained is the PA-HI language pair trained on PAWI transliterated corpus which gives 24.29 BLEU. ",

Unlike existing growing methods, which follow simple replication heuristics or utilize auxiliary gradient-based local optimization, we craft a parameterization scheme which dynamically stabilizes weight, activation, and gradient scaling as the architecture evolves, and maintains the inference functionality of the network. To address the optimization difficulty resulting from imbalanced training effort distributed to subnetworks fading in at different growth phases, we propose a learning rate adaption mechanism that rebalances the gradient contribution of these separate subcomponents. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable or better accuracy than training large fixed-size models, while saving a substantial portion of the original computation budget for training.

A variety of anomaly detection methods have been proposed, and a category based on the isolation forest mechanism stands out due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and efficiency, e.g., iForest is often employed as a state-of-the-art detector for real deployment. While the majority of isolation forests use the binary structure, a framework LSHiForest has demonstrated that the multi-fork isolation tree structure can lead to better detection performance. However, there is no theoretical work answering the fundamentally and practically important question on the optimal tree structure for an isolation forest with respect to the branching factor. In this paper, we establish a theory on isolation efficiency to answer the question and determine the optimal branching factor for an isolation tree. Based on the theoretical underpinning, we design a practical optimal isolation forest OptIForest incorporating clustering based learning to hash which enables more information to be learned from data for better isolation quality. The rationale of our approach relies on a better bias-variance trade-off achieved by bias reduction in OptIForest. Extensive experiments on a series of benchmarking datasets for comparative and ablation studies demonstrate that our approach can efficiently and robustly achieve better detection performance in general than the state-of-the-arts including the deep learning based methods.

These approaches work well even under the rich diversity of vocal and noisy samples owing to their representation ability.

In recent years, self-supervised learning models (SSL models) have been trained using large amounts of unlabeled data in the field of speech processing and music classification. By fine-tuning these models for the target tasks, comparable performance to conventional supervised learning can be achieved with limited training data. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SSL models for various singing voice recognition tasks. We report the results of experiments comparing SSL models for three different tasks (i.e., singer identification, singing voice transcription, and singing technique classification) as initial exploration and aim to discuss these findings. Experimental results show that each SSL model achieves comparable performance and sometimes outperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods on each task.

    "abstract": "A pooling operation is essential for effective graph-level representation learning, where the node drop pooling has become one mainstream graph pooling technology. However, current node drop pooling methods usually keep the top-k nodes according to their significance scores, which ignore the graph diversity in terms of the node features and the graph structures, thus resulting in suboptimal graph-level representations. To address the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel plug-and-play score scheme and refer to it as MID, which consists of a \\textbf{M}ultidimensional score space with two operations, \\textit{i.e.}, fl\\textbf{I}pscore and \\textbf{D}ropscore. Specifically, the multidimensional score space depicts the significance of nodes through multiple criteria; the flipscore encourages the maintenance of dissimilar node features; and the dropscore forces the model to notice diverse graph structures instead of being stuck in significant local structures. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed MID, we perform extensive experiments by applying it to a wide variety of recent node drop pooling methods, including TopKPool, SAGPool, GSAPool, and ASAP. Specifically, the proposed MID can efficiently and consistently achieve about 2.8\\% average improvements over the above four methods on seventeen real-world graph classification datasets, including four social datasets (IMDB-BINARY, IMDB-MULTI, REDDIT-BINARY, and COLLAB), and thirteen biochemical datasets (D\\&D, PROTEINS, NCI1, MUTAG, PTC-MR, NCI109, ENZYMES, MUTAGENICITY, FRANKENSTEIN, HIV, BBBP, TOXCAST, and TOX21).

So far, much effort has been devoted to developing effective generative retrieval models. There has been less attention paid to the robustness perspective. When a new retrieval paradigm enters into the real-world application, it is also critical to measure the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, i.e., how would generative retrieval models generalize to new distributions. To answer this question, firstly, we define OOD robustness from three perspectives in retrieval problems: 1) The query variations; 2) The unforeseen query types; and 3) The unforeseen tasks. Based on this taxonomy, we conduct empirical studies to analyze the OOD robustness of several representative generative retrieval models against dense retrieval models. The empirical results indicate that the OOD robustness of generative retrieval models requires enhancement. We hope studying the OOD robustness of generative retrieval models would be advantageous to the IR community. ",

Our method leverages a pretrained language-image model to steer the synthesis towards a user-provided text prompt or image patch, along with a 3D MLP model initialized on an existing NeRF scene to generate the object and blend it into a specified region in the original scene. We allow local editing by localizing a 3D ROI box in the input scene, and seamlessly blend the content synthesized inside the ROI with the existing scene using a novel volumetric blending technique. To obtain natural looking and view-consistent results, we leverage existing and new geometric priors and 3D augmentations for improving the visual fidelity of the final result. We test our framework both qualitatively and quantitatively on a variety of real 3D scenes and text prompts, demonstrating realistic multi-view consistent results with much flexibility and diversity compared to the baselines.

To this end, we propose DiffWA, a conditional diffusion model with distance guidance for watermark attack, which can restore the image while removing the embedded watermark. The core of our method is training an image-to-image conditional diffusion model on unwatermarked images and guiding the conditional model using a distance guidance when sampling so that the model will generate unwatermarked images which is similar to original images. We conducted experiments on CIFAR-10 using our proposed models. The results shows that the model can remove the watermark with good effect and make the bit error rate of watermark extraction higher than 0.4. At the same time, the attacked image will maintain good visual effect with PSNR more than 31 and SSIM more than 0.97 compared with the original image. ",

    "title": "HOFA: Twitter Bot Detection with Homophily-Oriented Augmentation and  Frequency Adaptive Attention",
    "abstract": "Twitter bot detection has become an increasingly important and challenging task to combat online misinformation, facilitate social content moderation, and safeguard the integrity of social platforms. Though existing graph-based Twitter bot detection methods achieved state-of-the-art performance, they are all based on the homophily assumption, which assumes users with the same label are more likely to be connected, making it easy for Twitter bots to disguise themselves by following a large number of genuine users. To address this issue, we proposed HOFA, a novel graph-based Twitter bot detection framework that combats the heterophilous disguise challenge with a homophily-oriented graph augmentation module (Homo-Aug) and a frequency adaptive attention module (FaAt). Specifically, the Homo-Aug extracts user representations and computes a k-NN graph using an MLP and improves Twitter's homophily by injecting the k-NN graph. For the FaAt, we propose an attention mechanism that adaptively serves as a low-pass filter along a homophilic edge and a high-pass filter along a heterophilic edge, preventing user features from being over-smoothed by their neighborhood. We also introduce a weight guidance loss to guide the frequency adaptive attention module. Our experiments demonstrate that HOFA achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-acknowledged Twitter bot detection benchmarks, which significantly outperforms vanilla graph-based bot detection techniques and strong heterophilic baselines. Furthermore, extensive studies confirm the effectiveness of our Homo-Aug and FaAt module, and HOFA's ability to demystify the heterophilous disguise challenge. ",

    "abstract": "Model compression techniques reduce the computational load and memory consumption of deep neural networks. After the compression operation, e.g. parameter pruning, the model is normally fine-tuned on the original training dataset to recover from the performance drop caused by compression. However, the training data is not always available due to privacy issues or other factors. In this work, we present a data-free fine-tuning approach for pruning the backbone of deep neural networks. In particular, the pruned network backbone is trained with synthetically generated images, and our proposed intermediate supervision to mimic the unpruned backbone's output feature map. Afterwards, the pruned backbone can be combined with the original network head to make predictions. We generate synthetic images by back-propagating gradients to noise images while relying on L1-pruning for the backbone pruning. In our experiments, we show that our approach is task-independent due to pruning only the backbone. By evaluating our approach on 2D human pose estimation, object detection, and image classification, we demonstrate promising performance compared to the unpruned model.

We present two different applications: (1) sensitivity analysis to detect the most promising generic basis hull shapes, and (2) multi-objective optimization to quantify the trade-off between optimal hull forms. DLPO framework allows for the evaluation of design iterations automatically in an end-to-end manner. We achieved these results by coupling Extrality's Deep Learning Physics (DLP) model to a CAD engine and an optimizer. Our proposed DLP model is trained on full 3D volume data coming from RANS simulations, and it can provide accurate and high-quality 3D flow predictions in real-time, which makes it a good evaluator to perform optimization of new container vessel designs w.r.t the hydrodynamic efficiency. In particular, it is able to recover the forces acting on the vessel by integration on the hull surface with a mean relative error of 3.84\\% \\pm 2.179\\% on the total resistance. Each iteration takes only 20 seconds, thus leading to a drastic saving of time and engineering efforts, while delivering valuable insight into the performance of the vessel, including RANS-like detailed flow information. We conclude that DLPO framework is a promising tool to accelerate the ship design process and lead to more efficient ships with better hydrodynamic performance. ",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has seen remarkable success in the control of single robots. However, applying DRL to robot swarms presents significant challenges. A critical challenge is non-stationarity, which occurs when two or more robots update individual or shared policies concurrently, thereby engaging in an interdependent training process with no guarantees of convergence. Circumventing non-stationarity typically involves training the robots with global information about other agents' states and/or actions. In contrast, in this paper we explore how to remove the need for global information. We pose our problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, due to the absence of global knowledge on other agents. Using collective transport as a testbed scenario, we study two approaches to multi-agent training. In the first, the robots exchange no messages, and are trained to rely on implicit communication through push-and-pull on the object to transport. In the second approach, we introduce Global State Prediction (GSP), a network trained to forma a belief over the swarm as a whole and predict its future states. We provide a comprehensive study over four well-known deep reinforcement learning algorithms in environments with obstacles, measuring performance as the successful transport of the object to the goal within a desired time-frame. Through an ablation study, we show that including GSP boosts performance and increases robustness when compared with methods that use global knowledge. ",

We show that attacking segmentation models presents task-specific challenges, for which we propose novel solutions. Our final evaluation protocol outperforms existing methods, and shows that those can overestimate the robustness of the models. Additionally, so far adversarial training, the most successful way for obtaining robust image classifiers, could not be successfully applied to semantic segmentation. We argue that this is because the task to be learned is more challenging, and requires significantly higher computational effort than for image classification. As a remedy, we show that by taking advantage of recent advances in robust ImageNet classifiers, one can train adversarially robust segmentation models at limited computational cost by fine-tuning robust backbones.

In this work, we propose Evolving Computation Graphs (ECGs), a novel method for enhancing GNNs on heterophilic datasets. Our approach builds on prior theoretical insights linking node degree, high homophily, and inter vs intra-class embedding similarity by rewiring the GNNs' computation graph towards adding edges that connect nodes that are likely to be in the same class. We utilise weaker classifiers to identify these edges, ultimately improving GNN performance on non-homophilic data as a result. We evaluate ECGs on a diverse set of recently-proposed heterophilous datasets and demonstrate improvements over the relevant baselines. ECG presents a simple, intuitive and elegant approach for improving GNN performance on heterophilic datasets without requiring prior domain knowledge. ",

    "abstract": "Collaborative robots must simultaneously be safe enough to operate in close proximity to human operators and powerful enough to assist users in industrial tasks such as lifting heavy equipment. The requirement for safety necessitates that collaborative robots are designed with low-powered actuators. However, some industrial tasks may require the robot to have high payload capacity and/or long reach. For collaborative robot designs to be successful, they must find ways of addressing these conflicting design requirements. One promising strategy for navigating this tradeoff is through the use of static balancing mechanisms to offset the robot's self weight, thus enabling the selection of lower-powered actuators. In this paper, we introduce a novel, 2 degree of freedom static balancing mechanism based on spring-loaded, wire-wrapped cams. We also present an optimization-based cam design method that guarantees the cams stay convex, ensures the springs stay below their extensions limits, and minimizes sensitivity to unmodeled deviations from the nominal spring constant. Additionally, we present a model of the effect of friction between the wire and the cam. Lastly, we show experimentally that the torque generated by the cam mechanism matches the torque predicted in our modeling approach. Our results also suggest that the effects of wire-cam friction are significant for non-circular cams. ",

Traditional clustering methods such as k-means provide only a single clustering for one data set. Deep clustering methods such as auto-encoder based clustering methods have shown a better performance, but still provide a single clustering. However, a given dataset might have multiple clustering structures and each represents a unique perspective of the data. Therefore, some multiple clustering methods have been developed to discover multiple independent structures hidden in data. Although deep multiple clustering methods provide better performance, how to efficiently capture the alternative perspectives in data is still a problem. In this paper, we propose AugDMC, a novel data Augmentation guided Deep Multiple Clustering method, to tackle the challenge. Specifically, AugDMC leverages data augmentations to automatically extract features related to a certain aspect of the data using a self-supervised prototype-based representation learning, where different aspects of the data can be preserved under different data augmentations. Moreover, a stable optimization strategy is proposed to alleviate the unstable problem from different augmentations. Thereafter, multiple clusterings based on different aspects of the data can be obtained.

TSCH constructs a communication schedule by combining frequency channel hopping with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA). In recent years, IETF designed several standards to define general mechanisms for the implementation of TSCH. However, the problem of updating the TSCH schedule according to the changes of the wireless link quality and node's traffic load left unresolved. In this paper, we use non-cooperative game theory to propose GT-TSCH, a distributed TSCH scheduler designed for low-power IoT applications. By considering selfish behavior of nodes in packet forwarding, GT-TSCH updates the TSCH schedule in a distributed approach with low control overhead by monitoring the queue length, the place of the node in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology, the quality of the wireless link, and the data packet generation rate. We prove the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium in our game model and we find the optimal number of TSCH Tx timeslots to update the TSCH slotframe. To examine the performance of our contribution, we implement GT-TSCH on Zolertia Firefly IoT motes and the Contiki-NG Operating System (OS). The evaluation results reveal that GT-TSCH improves performance in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay compared to the state-of-the-art method. ",

    "abstract": "To interconnect their growing number of servers, current supercomputers and data centers are starting to adopt low-diameter networks, such as HyperX, Dragonfly and Dragonfly+. These emergent topologies require balancing the load over their links and finding suitable non-minimal routing mechanisms for them becomes particularly challenging. The Valiant load balancing scheme is a very popular choice for non-minimal routing. Evolved adaptive routing mechanisms implemented in real systems are based on this Valiant scheme. All these low-diameter networks are deadlock-prone when non-minimal routing is employed. Routing deadlocks occur when packets cannot progress due to cyclic dependencies. Therefore, developing efficient deadlock-free packet routing mechanisms is critical for the progress of these emergent networks. The routing function includes the routing algorithm for path selection and the buffers management policy that dictates how packets allocate the buffers of the switches on their paths. For the same routing algorithm, a different buffer management mechanism can lead to a very different performance. Moreover, certain mechanisms considered efficient for avoiding deadlocks, may still suffer from hard to pinpoint instabilities that make erratic the network response. This paper focuses on exploring the impact of these buffers management policies on the performance of current interconnection networks, showing a 90\\% of performance drop if an incorrect buffers management policy is used. Moreover, this study not only characterizes some of these undesirable scenarios but also proposes practicable solutions. ",

    "abstract": "The Complementarity Determining Region (CDR) structure prediction of loops in antibody engineering has gained a lot of attraction by researchers. When designing antibodies, a main challenge is to predict the CDR structure of the H3 loop. Compared with the other CDR loops, that is the H1 and H2 loops, the CDR structure of the H3 loop is more challenging due to its varying length and flexible structure. In this paper, we propose a Multi-task learning model with Loop Specific Attention, namely MLSA. In particular, to the best of our knowledge we are the first to jointly learn the three CDR loops, via a novel multi-task learning strategy. In addition, to account for the structural and functional similarities and differences of the three CDR loops, we propose a loop specific attention mechanism to control the influence of each CDR loop on the training of MLSA. Our experimental evaluation on widely used benchmark data shows that the proposed MLSA method significantly reduces the prediction error of the CDR structure of the H3 loop, by at least 19%, when compared with other baseline strategies. Finally, for reproduction purposes we make the implementation of MLSA publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MLSA-2442/. ",

Despite the popularity of CF-based methods, their performance is often greatly limited by the sparsity of observed entries. In this study, we explore the data augmentation and refinement aspects of Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF), a widely accepted CF technique for the rating predictions, which have not been investigated before. We exploit the inherent characteristics of CF algorithms to assess the confidence level of individual ratings and propose a semi-supervised approach for rating augmentation based on self-training. We hypothesize that any CF algorithm's predictions with low confidence are due to some deficiency in the training data and hence, the performance of the algorithm can be improved by adopting a systematic data augmentation strategy. We iteratively use some of the ratings predicted with high confidence to augment the training data and remove low-confidence entries through a refinement process. By repeating this process, the system learns to improve prediction accuracy. Our method is experimentally evaluated on several state-of-the-art CF algorithms and leads to informative rating augmentation, improving the performance of the baseline approaches. ",

However, the reader may not know the channel states and RF source parameters and can experience interference. The traditional energy detector (TED) appears to be an ideal solution. However, it performs poorly under these conditions. To address this, we propose two new detectors: (1) A joint correlation-energy detector (JCED) based on the first-order correlation of the received samples and (2) An improved energy detector (IED) based on the p-th norm of the received signal vector. We compare the performance of the IED and TED under generalized noise modeled using the McLeish distribution and derive a general analytical formula for the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Based on our results, both detectors outperform TED. For example, the probability of detection with a false alarm rate of 1% for JCED and IED is 14% and 5% higher, respectively, compared to TED. These gains are even higher using the direct interference cancellation (DIC) technique, with increases of 16% and 7%, respectively. Overall, our proposed detectors offer better performance than the TED, making them useful tools for improving AmBC system performance. ",

    "abstract": "The ability of generative models to produce highly realistic synthetic face images has raised security and ethical concerns. As a first line of defense against such fake faces, deep learning based forensic classifiers have been developed. While these forensic models can detect whether a face image is synthetic or real with high accuracy, they are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although such attacks can be highly successful in evading detection by forensic classifiers, they introduce visible noise patterns that are detectable through careful human scrutiny. Additionally, these attacks assume access to the target model(s) which may not always be true. Attempts have been made to directly perturb the latent space of GANs to produce adversarial fake faces that can circumvent forensic classifiers. In this work, we go one step further and show that it is possible to successfully generate adversarial fake faces with a specified set of attributes (e.g., hair color, eye size, race, gender, etc.). To achieve this goal, we leverage the state-of-the-art generative model StyleGAN with disentangled representations, which enables a range of modifications without leaving the manifold of natural images. We propose a framework to search for adversarial latent codes within the feature space of StyleGAN, where the search can be guided either by a text prompt or a reference image. We also propose a meta-learning based optimization strategy to achieve transferable performance on unknown target models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can produce semantically manipulated adversarial fake faces, which are true to the specified attribute set and can successfully fool forensic face classifiers, while remaining undetectable by humans.

Specifically, our analysis involves computing the energy of the system during a quantum phase transition following a linear quench of the transverse magnetic field strength. The excitation energies satisfy a power-law relation to the quench rate, indicating a proportional relationship between the excitation energy and the kink numbers. Moreover, we establish a universal power-law relationship between the first three cumulants of the kink numbers and the quench rate, indicating a binomial distribution of the kinks. Finally, the normalized kink-kink correlations are also investigated and it is found that the numerical values are consistent with the analytic formula. ",

    "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) presents itself as a highly debilitating disorder. The disorder has common associations with the prefrontal cortex and the glutamate receptor known as Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 (mGluR5). This receptor has been observed to demonstrate higher levels of signaling from positron emission tomography scans measured by its distribution volume ratios in mice. Despite this evidence, studies are unable to fully verify the involvement of mGluR5 as more empirical data is needed. Computational modeling methods were used as a means of validation for previous hypotheses involving mGluR5. The inadequacies in relation to the causal factor of OCD were answered by utilizing T1 resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (TRS-MRI) scans of patients suffering from schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Because comorbid cases often occur within these disorders, cross-comparative abilities become necessary to find distinctive characteristics. Two-dimensional convolutional neural networks alongside ResNet50 and MobileNet models were constructed and evaluated for efficiency. Activation heatmaps of TRS-MRI scans were outputted, allowing for transcriptomics analysis. Though, a lack of ability to predict OCD cases prevented gene expression analysis. Across all models, there was an 88.75\\% validation accuracy for MDD, and 82.08\\% validation accuracy for SZD under the framework of ResNet50 as well as novel computation. OCD yielded an accuracy rate of ~54.4\\%. These results provided further evidence for the p factor theorem regarding mental disorders.

The technique employs two advanced deep learning architectures, namely U-Net and pretrained SAM, for tumor segmentation. The U-Net model is specifically designed for medical image segmentation and leverages its deep convolutional neural network framework to extract meaningful features from input images. On the other hand, the pretrained SAM architecture incorporates a mechanism to capture spatial dependencies and generate segmentation results. Evaluation is conducted on a diverse dataset containing annotated tumor regions in BUS and mammographic images, covering both benign and malignant tumors. This dataset enables a comprehensive assessment of the algorithm's performance across different tumor types. Results demonstrate that the U-Net model outperforms the pretrained SAM architecture in accurately identifying and segmenting tumor regions in both BUS and mammographic images. The U-Net exhibits superior performance in challenging cases involving irregular shapes, indistinct boundaries, and high tumor heterogeneity. In contrast, the pretrained SAM architecture exhibits limitations in accurately identifying tumor areas, particularly for malignant tumors and objects with weak boundaries or complex shapes. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate deep learning architectures tailored for medical image segmentation. The U-Net model showcases its potential as a robust and accurate tool for tumor detection, while the pretrained SAM architecture suggests the need for further improvements to enhance segmentation performance.

In quantum, encoding of position is more concerned which is the major difference from the classical. In this paper, a novel zero-discarded state connection novel enhance quantum representation (ZSCNEQR) approach is introduced to reduce complexity further by discarding '0' in the location representation information. In the control operational gate, only input '1' contribute to its output thus, discarding zero makes the proposed ZSCNEQR circuit more efficient.

One particular focus is on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which integrate physical principles into neural networks. This transforms the process of solving PDEs into optimization problems for neural networks. In order to address a collection of advection-diffusion equations (ADE) in a range of difficult circumstances, this paper proposes a novel network structure. This architecture integrates the solver, which is a multi-scale deep neural network (MscaleDNN) utilized in the PINN method, with a hard constraint technique known as HCPINN. This method introduces a revised formulation of the desired solution for advection-diffusion equations (ADE) by utilizing a loss function that incorporates the residuals of the governing equation and penalizes any deviations from the specified boundary and initial constraints. By surpassing the boundary constraints automatically, this method improves the accuracy and efficiency of the PINN technique. To address the ``spectral bias'' phenomenon in neural networks, a subnetwork structure of MscaleDNN and a Fourier-induced activation function are incorporated into the HCPINN, resulting in a hybrid approach called SFHCPINN. The effectiveness of SFHCPINN is demonstrated through various numerical experiments involving advection-diffusion equations (ADE) in different dimensions. The numerical results indicate that SFHCPINN outperforms both standard PINN and its subnetwork version with Fourier feature embedding. It achieves remarkable accuracy and efficiency while effectively handling complex boundary conditions and high-frequency scenarios in ADE. ",

We derive a (regularized) statistical test for our proposed generalized stochastic dominance (GSD) order, operationalize it by linear optimization, and robustify it by imprecise probability models. Our findings are illustrated with data from multidimensional poverty measurement, finance, and medicine. ",

    "abstract": "Limit order books are a fundamental and widespread market mechanism. This paper investigates the use of conditional generative models for order book simulation. For developing a trading agent, this approach has drawn recent attention as an alternative to traditional backtesting due to its ability to react to the presence of the trading agent. Using a state-of-the-art CGAN (from Coletta et al. (2022)), we explore its dependence upon input features, which highlights both strengths and weaknesses. To do this, we use \"adversarial attacks\" on the model's features and its mechanism. We then show how these insights can be used to improve the CGAN, both in terms of its realism and robustness. We finish by laying out a roadmap for future work. ",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting the elastic properties of crystalline solids is vital for computational materials science. However, traditional atomistic scale ab initio approaches are computationally intensive, especially for studying complex materials with a large number of atoms in a unit cell. We introduce a novel data-driven approach to efficiently predict the elastic properties of crystal structures using SE(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). This approach yields important scalar elastic moduli with the accuracy comparable to recent data-driven studies. Importantly, our symmetry-aware GNNs model also enables the prediction of the strain energy density (SED) and the associated elastic constants, the fundamental tensorial quantities that are significantly influenced by a material's crystallographic group. The model consistently distinguishes independent elements of SED tensors, in accordance with the symmetry of the crystal structures. Finally, our deep learning model possesses meaningful latent features, offering an interpretable prediction of the elastic properties. ",

Neural networks possess unsurpassed abilities in identifying underlying patterns in chaotic, non-linear, and seemingly random data, thus providing a mechanism to predict stock price movements much more precisely than many current techniques. Contemporary methods for stock analysis, including fundamental, technical, and regression techniques, are conversed and paralleled with the performance of neural networks. Also, the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is presented and contrasted with Chaos theory using neural networks. This paper will refute the EMH and support Chaos theory.

    "title": "Toward Automated Detection of Microbleeds with Anatomical Scale  Localization: A Complete Clinical Diagnosis Support Using Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "Cerebral Microbleeds (CMBs) are chronic deposits of small blood products in the brain tissues, which have explicit relation to various cerebrovascular diseases depending on their anatomical location, including cognitive decline, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral infarction. However, manual detection of CMBs is a time-consuming and error-prone process because of their sparse and tiny structural properties. The detection of CMBs is commonly affected by the presence of many CMB mimics that cause a high false-positive rate (FPR), such as calcification and pial vessels. This paper proposes a novel 3D deep learning framework that does not only detect CMBs but also inform their anatomical location in the brain (i.e., lobar, deep, and infratentorial regions). For the CMB detection task, we propose a single end-to-end model by leveraging the U-Net as a backbone with Region Proposal Network (RPN). To significantly reduce the FPs within the same single model, we develop a new scheme, containing Feature Fusion Module (FFM) that detects small candidates utilizing contextual information and Hard Sample Prototype Learning (HSPL) that mines CMB mimics and generates additional loss term called concentration loss using Convolutional Prototype Learning (CPL). The anatomical localization task does not only tell to which region the CMBs belong but also eliminate some FPs from the detection task by utilizing anatomical information. The results show that the proposed RPN that utilizes the FFM and HSPL outperforms the vanilla RPN and achieves a sensitivity of 94.66% vs. 93.33% and an average number of false positives per subject (FPavg) of 0.86 vs. 14.73. Also, the anatomical localization task further improves the detection performance by reducing the FPavg to 0.56 while maintaining the sensitivity of 94.66%. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a versatile privacy framework for quantum systems, termed quantum pufferfish privacy (QPP). Inspired by classical pufferfish privacy, our formulation generalizes and addresses limitations of quantum differential privacy by offering flexibility in specifying private information, feasible measurements, and domain knowledge. We show that QPP can be equivalently formulated in terms of the Datta-Leditzky information spectrum divergence, thus providing the first operational interpretation thereof. We reformulate this divergence as a semi-definite program and derive several properties of it, which are then used to prove convexity, composability, and post-processing of QPP mechanisms. Parameters that guarantee QPP of the depolarization mechanism are also derived. We analyze the privacy-utility tradeoff of general QPP mechanisms and, again, study the depolarization mechanism as an explicit instance. The QPP framework is then applied to privacy auditing for identifying privacy violations via a hypothesis testing pipeline that leverages quantum algorithms. Connections to quantum fairness and other quantum divergences are also explored and several variants of QPP are examined. ",
