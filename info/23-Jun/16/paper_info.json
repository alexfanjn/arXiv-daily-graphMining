Nevertheless, prior research has shown that collaborative inference still results in the exposure of data and predictions from edge devices. To enhance the privacy of collaborative inference, we introduce a defense strategy called PrivaScissors, which is designed to reduce the mutual information between a model's intermediate outcomes and the device's data and predictions. We evaluate PrivaScissors's performance on several datasets in the context of diverse attacks and offer a theoretical robustness guarantee. ",

    "abstract": "The rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which enable transactions with a degree of pseudonymity, has led to a surge in various illicit activities, including ransomware payments and transactions on darknet markets. These illegal activities often utilize Bitcoin as the preferred payment method. However, current tools for detecting illicit behavior either rely on a few heuristics and laborious data collection processes or employ computationally inefficient graph neural network (GNN) models that are challenging to interpret. To overcome the computational and interpretability limitations of existing techniques, we introduce an effective solution called Chainlet Orbits. This approach embeds Bitcoin addresses by leveraging their topological characteristics in transactions. By employing our innovative address embedding, we investigate e-crime in Bitcoin networks by focusing on distinctive substructures that arise from illicit behavior. The results of our node classification experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, including both topological and GNN-based approaches. Moreover, our approach enables the use of interpretable and explainable machine learning models in as little as 15 minutes for most days on the Bitcoin transaction network. ",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of social media such as Twitter and Weibo, detecting keywords from a huge volume of text data streams in real-time has become a critical problem. The keyword detection problem aims at searching important information from massive text data to reflect the most important events or topics. However, social media data usually has unique features: the documents are usually short, the language is colloquial, and the data is likely to have significant temporal patterns. Therefore, it could be challenging to discover critical information from these text streams. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address the keyword detection problem in social media. Our model combines the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models to better cope with the distinct attributes of social media data, such as the number of likes, comments, and retweets. By weighting the importance of each document based on these attributes, our method can effectively detect more representative keywords over time. Comprehensive experiments conducted under various conditions on Weibo data illustrate that our approach outperforms the baselines in various evaluation metrics, including precision and recall for multiple problem settings.

Every year, more and more software flaws are discovered, either internally in proprietary code or publicly disclosed. These flaws are highly likely to be exploited and can lead to system compromise, data leakage, or denial of service. To create a large-scale machine learning system for function level vulnerability identification, we utilized a sizable dataset of C and C++ open-source code containing millions of functions with potential buffer overflow exploits. We have developed an efficient and scalable vulnerability detection method based on neural network models that learn features extracted from the source codes. The source code is first converted into an intermediate representation to remove unnecessary components and shorten dependencies. We maintain the semantic and syntactic information using state of the art word embedding algorithms such as GloVe and fastText. The embedded vectors are subsequently fed into neural networks such as LSTM, BiLSTM, LSTM Autoencoder, word2vec, BERT, and GPT2 to classify the possible vulnerabilities.

    "abstract": "With rich visual data, such as images, becoming readily associated with items, visually-aware recommendation systems (VARS) have been widely used in different applications. Recent studies have shown that VARS are vulnerable to item-image adversarial attacks, which add human-imperceptible perturbations to the clean images associated with those items. Attacks on VARS pose new security challenges to a wide range of applications such as e-Commerce and social networks where VARS are widely used. How to secure VARS from such adversarial attacks becomes a critical problem. Currently, there is still a lack of systematic study on how to design secure defense strategies against visual attacks on VARS. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by proposing an adversarial image reconstruction and detection framework to secure VARS. Our proposed method can simultaneously (1) secure VARS from adversarial attacks characterized by local perturbations by image reconstruction based on global vision transformers; and (2) accurately detect adversarial examples using a novel contrastive learning approach. Meanwhile, our framework is designed to be used as both a filter and a detector so that they can be jointly trained to improve the flexibility of our defense strategy to a variety of attacks and VARS models. We have conducted extensive experimental studies with two popular attack methods (FGSM and PGD). Our experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our defense strategy against visual attacks is effective and outperforms existing methods on different attacks. Moreover, our method can detect adversarial examples with high accuracy. ",

Our proposed method addresses this issue by assigning individual style vector to each token in a text, allowing for fine-grained control and manipulation of the style strength. Additionally, an adversarial training framework integrated with teacher-student learning is introduced to enhance training stability and reduce the complexity of high-dimensional optimization.

    "abstract": "Recently, neural networks have spread into numerous fields including many safety-critical systems. Neural networks are built (and trained) by programming in frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Developers apply a rich set of pre-defined layers to manually program neural networks or to automatically generate them (e.g., through AutoML). Composing neural networks with different layers is error-prone due to the non-trivial constraints that must be satisfied in order to use those layers. In this work, we propose an approach to automatically repair erroneous neural networks. The challenge is in identifying a minimal modification to the network so that it becomes valid. Modifying a layer might have cascading effects on subsequent layers and thus our approach must search recursively to identify a \"globally\" minimal modification. Our approach is based on an executable semantics of deep learning layers and focuses on four kinds of errors which are common in practice. We evaluate our approach for two usage scenarios, i.e., repairing automatically generated neural networks and manually written ones suffering from common model bugs. The results show that we are able to repair 100% of a set of randomly generated neural networks (which are produced with an existing AI framework testing approach) effectively and efficiently (with an average repair time of 21.08s) and 93.75% of a collection of real neural network bugs (with an average time of 3min 40s).

To overcome the scarce amount of supervised data, we design a random data synthesis procedure that aims to simulate bends, fractures, and inking variations induced by the early printing process. Our method successfully improves downstream damaged type-imprint matching among printed works from this period, as validated by in-domain human experts. The results of our approach on two important philosophical works from the Early Modern period demonstrate potential to extend the extant historical research about the origins and content of these books.

To solve this problem of detection, data based approaches have been proposed in the literature.However, these previous solutions consider only specific behavior of one or few faults. Most of these approaches can be qualified as supervised, requiring an enormous labelling effort (fault types clearly identified in each technology). In addition, most of them are validated in PV cells or one PV module. That is hardly applicable in large-scale PV plants considering their complexity. Alternatively, some unsupervised well-known approaches based on data try to detect anomalies but are not able to identify precisely the type of fault. The most performant of these methods do manage to efficiently group healthy panels and separate them from faulty panels. In that way, this article presents an unsupervised approach called DTW K-means. This approach takes advantages of both the dynamic time warping (DWT) metric and the Kmeans clustering algorithm as a data-driven approach. The results of this mixed method in a PV string are compared to diagnostic labels established by visual inspection of the panels. ",

    "abstract": "Motion retargeting is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and computer vision. Existing approaches usually have many strict requirements, such as the source-target skeletons needing to have the same number of joints or share the same topology. To tackle this problem, we note that skeletons with different structure may have some common body parts despite the differences in joint numbers. Following this observation, we propose a novel, flexible motion retargeting framework. The key idea of our method is to regard the body part as the basic retargeting unit rather than directly retargeting the whole body motion. To enhance the spatial modeling capability of the motion encoder, we introduce a pose-aware attention network (PAN) in the motion encoding phase. The PAN is pose-aware since it can dynamically predict the joint weights within each body part based on the input pose, and then construct a shared latent space for each body part by feature pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach can generate better motion retargeting results both qualitatively and quantitatively than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we also show that our framework can generate reasonable results even for a more challenging retargeting scenario, like retargeting between bipedal and quadrupedal skeletons because of the body part retargeting strategy and PAN.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have emerged as an urgent threat to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), where victim DNNs are furtively implanted with malicious neurons that could be triggered by the adversary. To defend against backdoor attacks, many works establish a staged pipeline to remove backdoors from victim DNNs: inspecting, locating, and erasing. However, in a scenario where a few clean data can be accessible, such pipeline is fragile and cannot erase backdoors completely without sacrificing model accuracy. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel data-free holistic backdoor erasing (DHBE) framework. Instead of the staged pipeline, the DHBE treats the backdoor erasing task as a unified adversarial procedure, which seeks equilibrium between two different competing processes: distillation and backdoor regularization. In distillation, the backdoored DNN is distilled into a proxy model, transferring its knowledge about clean data, yet backdoors are simultaneously transferred. In backdoor regularization, the proxy model is holistically regularized to prevent from infecting any possible backdoor transferred from distillation. These two processes jointly proceed with data-free adversarial optimization until a clean, high-accuracy proxy model is obtained. With the novel adversarial design, our framework demonstrates its superiority in three aspects: 1) minimal detriment to model accuracy, 2) high tolerance for hyperparameters, and 3) no demand for clean data. Extensive experiments on various backdoor attacks and datasets are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/yanzhicong/DHBE} ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) naturally faces the problem of data heterogeneity in real-world scenarios, but this is often overlooked by studies on FL security and privacy. On the one hand, the effectiveness of backdoor attacks on FL may drop significantly under non-IID scenarios. On the other hand, malicious clients may steal private data through privacy inference attacks. Therefore, it is necessary to have a comprehensive perspective of data heterogeneity, backdoor, and privacy inference. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy inference-empowered stealthy backdoor attack (PI-SBA) scheme for FL under non-IID scenarios. Firstly, a diverse data reconstruction mechanism based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) is proposed to produce a supplementary dataset, which can improve the attacker's local data distribution and support more sophisticated strategies for backdoor attacks. Based on this, we design a source-specified backdoor learning (SSBL) strategy as a demonstration, allowing the adversary to arbitrarily specify which classes are susceptible to the backdoor trigger. Since the PI-SBA has an independent poisoned data synthesis process, it can be integrated into existing backdoor attacks to improve their effectiveness and stealthiness in non-IID scenarios. Extensive experiments based on MNIST, CIFAR10 and Youtube Aligned Face datasets demonstrate that the proposed PI-SBA scheme is effective in non-IID FL and stealthy against state-of-the-art defense methods.

However, the reliability of their estimation has not been seriously discussed (and overlooked) even though the quality of the evaluation entirely depends on it.

This not only makes TopP\\&R strong for noisy features, but also provides statistical consistency. Our theoretical and experimental results show that TopP\\&R is robust to outliers and non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) perturbations, while accurately capturing the true trend of change in samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evaluation metric focused on the robust estimation of the support and provides its statistical consistency under noise. ",

We also measure the execution time to check the efficiency of both models. The demonstration result indicates that execution time for QNN is slower than NN with a higher percentage of datasets.

The research thereof has resulted in many breakthroughs in 3D object and scene understanding. Previous methods typically utilized hierarchical architectures for feature representation. However, the commonly used sampling and grouping methods in hierarchical networks are only based on point-wise three-dimensional coordinates, ignoring local semantic homogeneity of point clusters. Additionally, the prevalent Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) method is often a computational bottleneck. To address these issues, we propose a novel 3D point cloud representation network, called Dynamic Clustering Transformer Network (DCTNet). It has an encoder-decoder architecture, allowing for both local and global feature learning. Specifically, we propose novel semantic feature-based dynamic sampling and clustering methods in the encoder, which enables the model to be aware of local semantic homogeneity for local feature aggregation. Furthermore, in the decoder, we propose an efficient semantic feature-guided upsampling method. Our method was evaluated on an object-based dataset (ShapeNet), an urban navigation dataset (Toronto-3D), and a multispectral LiDAR dataset, verifying the performance of DCTNet across a wide variety of practical engineering applications. The inference speed of DCTNet is 3.8-16.8$\\times$ faster than existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models on the ShapeNet dataset, while achieving an instance-wise mIoU of $86.6\\%$, the current top score. Our method similarly outperforms previous methods on the other datasets, verifying it as the new State-of-the-Art in point cloud segmentation. ",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization deals with the prevalent learning scenario where test distribution shifts from training distribution. With rising application demands and inherent complexity, graph OOD problems call for specialized solutions. While data-centric methods exhibit performance enhancements on many generic machine learning tasks, there is a notable absence of data augmentation methods tailored for graph OOD generalization. In this work, we propose to achieve graph OOD generalization with the novel design of non-Euclidean-space linear extrapolation. The proposed augmentation strategy extrapolates both structure and feature spaces to generate OOD graph data. Our design tailors OOD samples for specific shifts without corrupting underlying causal mechanisms. Theoretical analysis and empirical results evidence the effectiveness of our method in solving target shifts, showing substantial and constant improvements across various graph OOD tasks. ",

In this work, we consider a new class of objective functions, where only a subset of the parameters satisfies strong convexity, and show Nesterov's momentum achieves acceleration in theory for this objective class. We provide two realizations of the problem class, one of which is deep ReLU networks, which --to the best of our knowledge--constitutes this work the first that proves accelerated convergence rate for non-trivial neural network architectures.

Next, we conduct a longitudinal study of DSS to explore how the reported practices evolve over time, and find that the developers are still adjusting their practices. To contextualize these findings, we conduct a developer study, uncovering the process that app developers undergo when working with DSS. We highlight the challenges faced and strategies employed by developers for DSS submission, and the factors contributing to changes in the DSS. Our research contributes valuable insights into the complexities of implementing and maintaining privacy labels, underlining the need for better resources, tools, and guidelines to aid developers.

    "title": "Neural Mixed Effects for Nonlinear Personalized Predictions",
    "abstract": "Personalized prediction is a machine learning approach that predicts a person's future observations based on their past labeled observations and is typically used for sequential tasks, e.g., to predict daily mood ratings. When making personalized predictions, a model can combine two types of trends: (a) trends shared across people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happier on weekends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specific trends, such as a stressful weekly meeting. Mixed effect models are popular statistical models to study both trends by combining person-generic and person-specific parameters. Though linear mixed effect models are gaining popularity in machine learning by integrating them with neural networks, these integrations are currently limited to linear person-specific parameters: ruling out nonlinear person-specific trends. In this paper, we propose Neural Mixed Effect (NME) models to optimize nonlinear person-specific parameters anywhere in a neural network in a scalable manner. NME combines the efficiency of neural network optimization with nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Empirically, we observe that NME improves performance across six unimodal and multimodal datasets, including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and a mother-adolescent dataset to predict affective state sequences where half the mothers experience at least moderate symptoms of depression. Furthermore, we evaluate NME for two model architectures, including for neural conditional random fields (CRF) to predict affective state sequences where the CRF learns nonlinear person-specific temporal transitions between affective states. Analysis of these person-specific transitions on the mother-adolescent dataset shows interpretable trends related to the mother's depression symptoms. ",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity across various sectors, especially in finance and investment. The popularity is partly due to their unique specifications originating from blockchain-related characteristics such as privacy, decentralisation, and untraceability. Despite their growing popularity, cryptocurrencies remain a high-risk investment due to their price volatility and uncertainty. The inherent volatility in cryptocurrency prices, coupled with internal cryptocurrency-related factors and external influential global economic factors makes predicting their prices and price movement directions challenging. Nevertheless, the knowledge obtained from predicting the direction of cryptocurrency prices can provide valuable guidance for investors in making informed investment decisions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) approach, which can model complex systems in multivariate settings, to predict the price movement direction of five popular altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) in the next trading day. The efficacy of the proposed model in predicting cryptocurrency price directions is evaluated from two perspectives. Firstly, our proposed approach is compared to two baseline models, namely an auto-regressive integrated moving average and support vector regression. Secondly, from a feature engineering point of view, the impact of twenty-three different features, grouped into four categories, on the DBN's prediction performance is investigated. The experimental results demonstrate that the DBN significantly outperforms the baseline models. In addition, among the groups of features, technical indicators are found to be the most effective predictors of cryptocurrency price directions. ",

Unfortunately, the relatively low tolerance of users to added latency places an upper bound on the deployment of this technique in most applications. In this paper, we present a multi-factor credential hashing function (MFCHF) that incorporates the additional entropy of multi-factor authentication into password hashes to provide asymmetric resistance to brute-force attacks. MFCHF provides full backward compatibility with existing authentication software (e.g., Google Authenticator) and hardware (e.g., YubiKeys), with support for common usability features like factor recovery. The result is a 10^6 to 10^48 times increase in the difficulty of cracking hashed credentials, with little added latency or usability impact. ",

    "abstract": "With the recent hype around the Metaverse and NFTs, Web3 is getting more and more popular. The goal of Web3 is to decentralize the web via decentralized applications. Wallets play a crucial role as they act as an interface between these applications and the user. Wallets such as MetaMask are being used by millions of users nowadays. Unfortunately, Web3 is often advertised as more secure and private. However, decentralized applications as well as wallets are based on traditional technologies, which are not designed with privacy of users in mind. In this paper, we analyze the privacy implications that Web3 technologies such as decentralized applications and wallets have on users. To this end, we build a framework that measures exposure of wallet information. First, we study whether information about installed wallets is being used to track users online. We analyze the top 100K websites and find evidence of 1,325 websites running scripts that probe whether users have wallets installed in their browser. Second, we measure whether decentralized applications and wallets leak the user's unique wallet address to third-parties. We intercept the traffic of 616 decentralized applications and 100 wallets and find over 2000 leaks across 211 applications and more than 300 leaks across 13 wallets. Our study shows that Web3 poses a threat to users' privacy and requires new designs towards more privacy-aware wallet architectures. ",

We propose that a convolutional neural network (CNN) can be trained on small windows of signals, but evaluated on arbitrarily large signals with little to no performance degradation, and provide a theoretical bound on the resulting generalization error. Our proof leverages shift-equivariance of CNNs, a property that is underexploited in transfer learning.

The proposed approach is able to tackle MID at large scales with hundreds of agents, which was computationally intractable prior to this work. ",

The project of operationalising a philosophically-informed notion of representation should be of interest to both philosophers of science and NLP practitioners. It affords philosophers a novel testing-ground for claims about the nature of representation, and helps NLPers organise the large literature on probing experiments, suggesting novel avenues for empirical research.

Even though graph neural networks (GNNs) have produced promising results on this task, current techniques often presume that label information of nodes is accurate, which may not be the case in real-world applications. To tackle this issue, we investigate the problem of learning on graphs with label noise and develop a novel approach dubbed Consistent Graph Neural Network (CGNN) to solve it. Specifically, we employ graph contrastive learning as a regularization term, which promotes two views of augmented nodes to have consistent representations. Since this regularization term cannot utilize label information, it can enhance the robustness of node representations to label noise. Moreover, to detect noisy labels on the graph, we present a sample selection technique based on the homophily assumption, which identifies noisy nodes by measuring the consistency between the labels with their neighbors. Finally, we purify these confident noisy labels to permit efficient semantic graph learning. Extensive experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our CGNN over competing approaches. ",

However, their effectiveness can be hindered by the challenges arising from the widespread existence of noisy measurements associated with the topological or nodal information present in real-world graphs. These inaccuracies in observations can corrupt the crucial patterns within the graph data, ultimately resulting in undesirable performance in practical applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel uncertainty-aware graph learning framework motivated by distributionally robust optimization. Specifically, we use a graph neural network-based encoder to embed the node features and find the optimal node embeddings by minimizing the worst-case risk through a minimax formulation. Such an uncertainty-aware learning process leads to improved node representations and a more robust graph predictive model that effectively mitigates the impact of uncertainty arising from data noise.

Higher-order link prediction has gained especially significant attention since higher-order networks provide a more accurate description of real-world complex systems. However, higher-order networks contain more complex information than traditional pairwise networks, making the prediction of higher-order links a formidable challenging task. Recently, researchers have discovered that local features have advantages over long-range features in higher-order link prediction. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more efficient and concise higher-order link prediction algorithms based on local features. In this paper, we proposed two similarity metrics via local information, simplicial decomposition weight (SDW) and closed ratio weight (CRW), to predict possible future higher-order interactions (simplices) in simplicial networks. These two algorithms capture local higher-order information at two aspects: simplex decomposition and cliques' state (closed or open). We tested their performance in eight empirical simplicial networks, and the results show that our proposed metrics outperform other benchmarks in predicting third-order and fourth-order interactions (simplices) in most cases. In addition, we explore the robustness of the proposed algorithms, and the results suggest that the performance of these novel algorithms is advanced under different sizes of training sets. ",

As a result, the general public utilize them as an influential tool for boosting their productivity while natural language processing researchers endeavor to employ them in solving existing or new research problems. Unfortunately, individuals can only access such powerful AIs through APIs, which ultimately leads to the transmission of raw data to the models' providers and increases the possibility of privacy data leakage. Current privacy-preserving methods for cloud-deployed language models aim to protect privacy information in the pre-training dataset or during the model training phase. However, they do not meet the specific challenges presented by the remote access approach of new large-scale language models. This paper introduces a novel task, \"User Privacy Protection for Dialogue Models,\" which aims to safeguard sensitive user information from any possible disclosure while conversing with chatbots. We also present an evaluation scheme for this task, which covers evaluation metrics for privacy protection, data availability, and resistance to simulation attacks. Moreover, we propose the first framework for this task, namely privacy protection through text sanitization. Before sending the input to remote large models, it filters out the sensitive information, using several rounds of text sanitization based on privacy types that users define. Upon receiving responses from the larger model, our framework automatically restores privacy to ensure that the conversation goes smoothly, without intervention from the privacy filter. Experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our privacy-preserving approach against eavesdropping from potential attackers. ",

This can well eliminate mode collapse in the generated models. 2) The OT map can be calculated straightly by the proposed algorithm when new target samples are added, which greatly improves the efficiency and reusability of the map.

This paper discusses a graph data structure for dynamic graph processing on GPUs. Unlike static graphs, dynamic graphs mutate over their lifetime through vertex and/or edge batch updates. The proposed work aims to provide fast batch updates and graph querying without consuming too much GPU memory. Experimental results show improved initialization timings by 1968-1269024%, improved batch edge insert timings by 30-30047%, and improved batch edge delete timings by 50-25262% while consuming less memory when the batch size is large.

While a wide variety of robustness metrics have been proposed, they have their respective limitations. In this paper, we propose to use the forest index as a measure of network robustness, which overcomes the deficiencies of existing metrics. Using such a measure as an optimization criterion, we propose and study the problem of breaking down a network by attacking some key edges. We show that the objective function of the problem is monotonic but not submodular, which impose more challenging on the problem. We thus resort to greedy algorithms extended for non-submodular functions by iteratively deleting the most promising edges. We first propose a simple greedy algorithm with a proved bound for the approximation ratio and cubic-time complexity. To confront the computation challenge for large networks, we further propose an improved nearly-linear time greedy algorithm, which significantly speeds up the process for edge selection but sacrifices little accuracy. Extensive experimental results for a large set of real-world networks verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms, demonstrating that our algorithms outperform several baseline schemes.

Therefore, in this paper, we aim to analyze the robustness of latent diffusion models more thoroughly. We first study the influence of the components inside latent diffusion models on their white-box robustness. In addition to white-box scenarios, we evaluate the black-box robustness of latent diffusion models via transfer attacks, where we consider both prompt-transfer and model-transfer settings and possible defense mechanisms. However, all these explorations need a comprehensive benchmark dataset, which is missing in the literature. Therefore, to facilitate the research of the robustness of latent diffusion models, we propose two automatic dataset construction pipelines for two kinds of image editing models and release the whole dataset.

Its probabilistic approximatively correct (PAC) version substitutes an equivalence query by numerous random membership queries to get a high level confidence to the answer. Thus it can be applied to any kind of device and may be viewed as an algorithm for synthesizing an automaton abstracting the behavior of the device based on observations. Here we are interested on how Angluin's PAC learning algorithm behaves for devices which are obtained from a DFA by introducing some noise. More precisely we study whether Angluin's algorithm reduces the noise and produces a DFA closer to the original one than the noisy device. We propose several ways to introduce the noise: (1) the noisy device inverts the classification of words w.r.t. the DFA with a small probability, (2) the noisy device modifies with a small probability the letters of the word before asking its classification w.r.t. the DFA, (3) the noisy device combines the classification of a word w.r.t. the DFA and its classification w.r.t. a counter automaton, and (4) the noisy DFA is obtained by a random process from two DFA such that the language of the first one is included in the second one. Then when a word is accepted (resp. rejected) by the first (resp. second) one, it is also accepted (resp. rejected) and in the remaining cases, it is accepted with probability 0.5. Our main experimental contributions consist in showing that: (1) Angluin's algorithm behaves well whenever the noisy device is produced by a random process, (2) but poorly with a structured noise, and, that (3) is able to eliminate pathological behaviours specified in a regular way. Theoretically, we show that randomness almost surely yields systems with non-recursively enumerable languages. ",

Most of the existing attempts for improving DNN calibration are limited to classification tasks and restricted to calibrating in-domain predictions. Surprisingly, very little to no attempts have been made in studying the calibration of object detection methods, which occupy a pivotal space in vision-based security-sensitive, and safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose a new train-time technique for calibrating modern object detection methods. It is capable of jointly calibrating multiclass confidence and box localization by leveraging their predictive uncertainties. We perform extensive experiments on several in-domain and out-of-domain detection benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Modelling spatio-temporal processes on road networks is a task of growing importance. While significant progress has been made on developing spatio-temporal graph neural networks (Gnns), existing works are built upon three assumptions that are not practical on real-world road networks. First, they assume sensing on every node of a road network. In reality, due to budget-constraints or sensor failures, all locations (nodes) may not be equipped with sensors. Second, they assume that sensing history is available at all installed sensors. This is unrealistic as well due to sensor failures, loss of packets during communication, etc. Finally, there is an assumption of static road networks. Connectivity within networks change due to road closures, constructions of new roads, etc. In this work, we develop FRIGATE to address all these shortcomings. FRIGATE is powered by a spatio-temporal Gnn that integrates positional, topological, and temporal information into rich inductive node representations. The joint fusion of this diverse information is made feasible through a novel combination of gated Lipschitz embeddings with Lstms. We prove that the proposed Gnn architecture is provably more expressive than message-passing Gnns used in state-of-the-art algorithms. The higher expressivity of FRIGATE naturally translates to superior empirical performance conducted on real-world network-constrained traffic data. In addition, FRIGATE is robust to frugal sensor deployment, changes in road network connectivity, and temporal irregularity in sensing. ",

Efficient triggers have significantly improved poisoning efficiency, but there is still room for improvement. Recently, selecting efficient samples has shown promise, but it requires a proxy backdoor injection task to find an efficient poisoned sample set, which can lead to performance degradation if the proxy attack settings are different from the actual settings used by the victims. In this paper, we propose a novel Proxy-Free Strategy (PFS) that selects efficient poisoned samples based on individual similarity and set diversity, effectively addressing this issue. We evaluate the proposed strategy on several datasets, triggers, poisoning ratios, architectures, and training hyperparameters. Our experimental results demonstrate that PFS achieves higher backdoor attack strength while x500 faster than previous proxy-based selection approaches. ",

However, the task of directly mitigating the distribution shift in the unseen testing set is rarely investigated, due to the unavailability of the testing distribution during the training phase and thus the impossibility of training a distribution translator mapping between the training and testing distribution. In this paper, we explore how to bypass the requirement of testing distribution for distribution translator training and make the distribution translation useful for OoD prediction. We propose a portable Distribution Shift Inversion algorithm, in which, before being fed into the prediction model, the OoD testing samples are first linearly combined with additional Gaussian noise and then transferred back towards the training distribution using a diffusion model trained only on the source distribution. Theoretical analysis reveals the feasibility of our method. Experimental results, on both multiple-domain generalization datasets and single-domain generalization datasets, show that our method provides a general performance gain when plugged into a wide range of commonly used OoD algorithms.

Despite the progress in joint learning from pathology and genomics, existing methods still suffer from challenging issues: 1) Due to the large size of pathological images, it is difficult to effectively represent the gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). 2) Interactions within tumor microenvironment (TME) in histology are essential for survival analysis. Although current approaches attempt to model these interactions via co-attention between histology and genomic data, they focus on only dense local similarity across modalities, which fails to capture global consistency between potential structures, i.e. TME-related interactions of histology and co-expression of genomic data. To address these challenges, we propose a Multimodal Optimal Transport-based Co-Attention Transformer framework with global structure consistency, in which optimal transport (OT) is applied to match patches of a WSI and genes embeddings for selecting informative patches to represent the gigapixel WSI. More importantly, OT-based co-attention provides a global awareness to effectively capture structural interactions within TME for survival prediction. To overcome high computational complexity of OT, we propose a robust and efficient implementation over micro-batch of WSI patches by approximating the original OT with unbalanced mini-batch OT. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method on five benchmark datasets compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The code is released. ",

Recently it has been investigated that CNNs are highly biased toward local features and fail to detect the global aspects of their input. Nevertheless, the literature offers limited clues on this problem. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective solution inspired by the unconscious behavior of the human pupil. We devise a simple module called Global Advantage Stream (GAS) to learn and capture the holistic features of input samples (i.e., the global features). Then, the GAS features were combined with a CNN network as a plug-and-play component called the Global/Local Processing (GLP) model. The experimental results confirm that this stream improves the accuracy with an insignificant additional computational/temporal load and makes the network more robust to adversarial attacks.

However, the launch of 5G networks also exacerbates the misalignment between cellular traffic and energy consumption, which reduces carbon efficiency - the amount of network traffic that can be delivered for each unit of carbon emission. In this study, we develop a large-scale data-driven framework to estimate the carbon emissions induced by mobile networks. We show that the decline in carbon efficiency leads to a carbon efficiency trap, estimated to cause additional carbon emissions of 23.82 +- 1.07 megatons in China. To mitigate the misalignment and improve energy efficiency, we propose DeepEnergy, an energy-saving method leveraging collaborative deep reinforcement learning and graph neural networks. DeepEnergy models complex collaboration among cells, making it possible to effectively coordinate the working state of tens of thousands of cells, which could help over 71% of Chinese provinces avoid carbon efficiency traps. In addition, applying DeepEnergy is estimated to reduce 20.90 +- 0.98 megatons of carbon emissions at the national level in 2023. We further assess the effects of adopting renewable energy and discover that the mobile network could accomplish more than 50% of its net-zero goal by integrating DeepEnergy and solar energy systems. Our study provides insight into carbon emission mitigation in 5G network infrastructure launching in China and overworld, paving the way towards achieving sustainable development goals and future net-zero mobile networks.

Although much progress has been made, these methods still exist two issues: (1) There exists a significant region-wise quality difference in a single underwater image due to the underwater imaging process, especially in regions with different scene depths. However, existing methods neglect this internal characteristic of underwater images, resulting in inferior performance; (2) Due to the uniqueness of the acquisition approach, underwater image acquisition tools usually capture multiple images in the same or similar scenes. Thus, the underwater images to be enhanced in practical usage are highly correlated. However, when processing a single image, existing methods do not consider the rich external information provided by the related images. There is still room for improvement in their performance. Motivated by these two aspects, we propose a novel internal-external representation learning (UIERL) network to better perform UIE tasks with internal and external information, simultaneously. In the internal representation learning stage, a new depth-based region feature guidance network is designed, including a region segmentation based on scene depth to sense regions with different quality levels, followed by a region-wise space encoder module. With performing region-wise feature learning for regions with different quality separately, the network provides an effective guidance for global features and thus guides intra-image differentiated enhancement. In the external representation learning stage, we first propose an external information extraction network to mine the rich external information in the related images.

The framework has a two-layer hierarchical structure, comprising a hybrid module with a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning and meta-controller at the higher level, and a MARL-based interactive module at the lower level. The HTN module and meta-controller use Hierarchical Domain Definition Language (HDDL) and the option framework to formalize symbolic knowledge and obtain domain knowledge and a symbolic option set, respectively. Moreover, the HTN module leverages domain knowledge to guide low-level agent exploration by assisting the meta-controller in selecting symbolic options. The meta-controller further computes intrinsic rewards of symbolic options to limit exploration behavior and adjust HTN planning solutions as needed. We evaluate SOMARL on two benchmarks, FindTreasure and MoveBox, and report superior performance over state-of-the-art MARL and subgoal-based baselines for MARL environments significantly. ",

    "abstract": "Open-set fine-grained anomaly detection is a challenging task that requires learning discriminative fine-grained features to detect anomalies that were even unseen during training. As a cheap yet effective approach, data augmentation has been widely used to create pseudo anomalies for better training of such models. Recent wisdom of augmentation methods focuses on generating random pseudo instances that may lead to a mixture of augmented instances with seen anomalies, or out of the typical range of anomalies. To address this issue, we propose a novel saliency-guided data augmentation method, SaliencyCut, to produce pseudo but more common anomalies which tend to stay in the plausible range of anomalies. Furthermore, we deploy a two-head learning strategy consisting of normal and anomaly learning heads, to learn the anomaly score of each sample. Theoretical analyses show that this mechanism offers a more tractable and tighter lower bound of the data log-likelihood. We then design a novel patch-wise residual module in the anomaly learning head to extract and assess the fine-grained anomaly features from each sample, facilitating the learning of discriminative representations of anomaly instances. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world anomaly detection datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method to the baseline and other state-of-the-art methods under various settings. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) classification and object detection techniques have gained significant attention due to their vital role in image content analysis, interpretation, and wider HSI applications. However, current hyperspectral object detection approaches predominantly emphasize either spectral or spatial information, overlooking the valuable complementary relationship between these two aspects. In this study, we present a novel \\textbf{S}pectral-\\textbf{S}patial \\textbf{A}ggregation (S2ADet) object detector that effectively harnesses the rich spectral and spatial complementary information inherent in hyperspectral images. S2ADet comprises a hyperspectral information decoupling (HID) module, a two-stream feature extraction network, and a one-stage detection head. The HID module processes hyperspectral images by aggregating spectral and spatial information via band selection and principal components analysis, consequently reducing redundancy. Based on the acquired spatial and spectral aggregation information, we propose a feature aggregation two-stream network for interacting spectral-spatial features. Furthermore, to address the limitations of existing databases, we annotate an extensive dataset, designated as HOD3K, containing 3,242 hyperspectral images captured across diverse real-world scenes and encompassing three object classes. These images possess a resolution of 512x256 pixels and cover 16 bands ranging from 470 nm to 620 nm. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that S2ADet surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust and reliable results.

In this paper, we aim to clarify if speech SSL techniques can well capture linguistic knowledge. For this purpose, we introduce SpeechGLUE, a speech version of the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark. Since GLUE comprises a variety of natural language understanding tasks, SpeechGLUE can elucidate the degree of linguistic ability of speech SSL models.

Despite this, recent evidence has revealed GNNs' deficiencies related to over-squashing, heterophily, handling long-range dependencies, edge incompleteness and particularly, the absence of graphs altogether. While a plausible solution is to learn new adaptive topology for message passing, issues concerning quadratic complexity hinder simultaneous guarantees for scalability and precision in large networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel all-pair message passing scheme for efficiently propagating node signals between arbitrary nodes, as an important building block for a pioneering Transformer-style network for node classification on large graphs, dubbed as \\textsc{NodeFormer}. Specifically, the efficient computation is enabled by a kernerlized Gumbel-Softmax operator that reduces the algorithmic complexity to linearity w.r.t. node numbers for learning latent graph structures from large, potentially fully-connected graphs in a differentiable manner. We also provide accompanying theory as justification for our design. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promising efficacy of the method in various tasks including node classification on graphs (with up to 2M nodes) and graph-enhanced applications (e.g., image classification) where input graphs are missing.

    "abstract": "Recent deep neural networks (DNNs) have come to rely on vast amounts of training data, providing an opportunity for malicious attackers to exploit and contaminate the data to carry out backdoor attacks. These attacks significantly undermine the reliability of DNNs. However, existing backdoor attack methods make unrealistic assumptions, assuming that all training data comes from a single source and that attackers have full access to the training data. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic attack scenario where victims collect data from multiple sources, and attackers cannot access the complete training data. We refer to this scenario as data-constrained backdoor attacks. In such cases, previous attack methods suffer from severe efficiency degradation due to the entanglement between benign and poisoning features during the backdoor injection process. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach that leverages the pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model. We introduce three CLIP-based technologies from two distinct streams: Clean Feature Suppression, which aims to suppress the influence of clean features to enhance the prominence of poisoning features, and Poisoning Feature Augmentation, which focuses on augmenting the presence and impact of poisoning features to effectively manipulate the model's behavior. To evaluate the effectiveness, harmlessness to benign accuracy, and stealthiness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 target models, 3 datasets, and over 15 different settings. The results demonstrate remarkable improvements, with some settings achieving over 100% improvement compared to existing attacks in data-constrained scenarios. Our research contributes to addressing the limitations of existing methods and provides a practical and effective solution for data-constrained backdoor attacks. ",

WeChat, the leading app-in-app platform, provides millions of sub-apps that can be used for online shopping, financing, social networking, etc. However, privacy issues in this new ecosystem have not been well understood. This paper performs the first systematic study of privacy over-collection in sub-apps (denoted as SPO), where sub-apps actually collect more privacy data than they claim in their privacy policies. We propose a taxonomy of privacy for this ecosystem and a framework named SPOChecker to automatically detect SPO in real-world sub-apps. Based on SPOChecker, we collect 5,521 popular and representative WeChat sub-apps and conduct a measurement study to understand SPO from three aspects: its landscape, accountability, and defense methods. The result is worrisome, that more than half of all studied sub-apps do not provide users with privacy policies. Among 2,511 sub-apps that provide privacy policies, 489 (19.47%) of them contain SPO. We look into the detailed characteristics of SPO, figure out possible reasons and the responsibilities of stakeholders in the ecosystem, and rethink current defense methods. The measurement leads to several insightful findings that can help the community to better understand SPO and protect privacy in sub-apps. ",

In such a setting, we show that using i) a simple thresholding-based clustering algorithm, and ii) local client gradients obtains optimal convergence guarantees. In fact, our rates asymptotically match those obtained if we knew the true underlying clustering of the clients.

We present X-Detect, a novel adversarial patch detector that can: i) detect adversarial samples in real time, allowing the defender to take preventive action; ii) provide explanations for the alerts raised to support the defender's decision-making process, and iii) handle unfamiliar threats in the form of new attacks. Given a new scene, X-Detect uses an ensemble of explainable-by-design detectors that utilize object extraction, scene manipulation, and feature transformation techniques to determine whether an alert needs to be raised. X-Detect was evaluated in both the physical and digital space using five different attack scenarios (including adaptive attacks) and the COCO dataset and our new Superstore dataset. The physical evaluation was performed using a smart shopping cart setup in real-world settings and included 17 adversarial patch attacks recorded in 1,700 adversarial videos. The results showed that X-Detect outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in distinguishing between benign and adversarial scenes for all attack scenarios while maintaining a 0% FPR (no false alarms) and providing actionable explanations for the alerts raised.

Existing schemes solve it by enhancing the mutual-exclusivity or diversity of training samples, but these data manipulation strategies are data-dependent and insufficiently flexible. This work alleviates overfitting in meta-learning from the perspective of gradient regularization and proposes a data-independent \\textbf{M}eta-\\textbf{G}radient \\textbf{Aug}mentation (\\textbf{MGAug}) method. The key idea is to first break the rote memories by network pruning to address memorization overfitting in the inner loop, and then the gradients of pruned sub-networks naturally form the high-quality augmentation of the meta-gradient to alleviate learner overfitting in the outer loop. Specifically, we explore three pruning strategies, including \\textit{random width pruning}, \\textit{random parameter pruning}, and a newly proposed \\textit{catfish pruning} that measures a Meta-Memorization Carrying Amount (MMCA) score for each parameter and prunes high-score ones to break rote memories as much as possible. The proposed MGAug is theoretically guaranteed by the generalization bound from the PAC-Bayes framework. In addition, we extend a lightweight version, called MGAug-MaxUp, as a trade-off between performance gains and resource overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple few-shot learning benchmarks validate MGAug's effectiveness and significant improvement over various meta-baselines.

Moreover, the entries of the ROM contain localised information about the coefficients of the wave equation. We solve the inverse problem by embedding the ROM in physical space. Such an approach is also followed in the theory of ``optimal grids,'' where the ROMs are interpreted as two-point finite-difference discretisations of an underlying set of equations of a first-order continuous system on this special grid. Here, we extend this line of work to wave equations and introduce a new embedding technique, which we call Krein embedding, since it is inspired by Krein's seminal work on vibrations of a string. In this embedding approach, an adaptive grid and a set of medium parameters can be directly extracted from a ROM and we show that several limitations of optimal grid embeddings can be avoided. Furthermore, we show how Krein embedding is connected to classical optimal grid embedding and that convergence results for optimal grids can be extended to this novel embedding approach.

When dealing with space structures, a reduction of the spacecraft mass is paramount to minimize the mission cost and maximize the propellant availability. However, a lighter design comes with a bigger structural flexibility and the resulting impact on control performance. Two optimization architectures (distributed and monolithic) are proposed in order to face this issue. In particular the Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) framework is exploited to formally set the two optimization problems by including parametric uncertainties. Large sets of uncertainties have to be indeed taken into account in spacecraft control design due to the impossibility to completely validate structural models in micro-gravity conditions with on-ground experiments and to the evolution of spacecraft dynamics during the mission (structure degradation and fuel consumption). In particular the Two-Input Two-Output Port (TITOP) multi-body approach is used to build the flexible dynamics in a minimal LFT form. The two proposed optimization algorithms are detailed and their performance are compared on an ESA future exploration mission, the ENVISION benchmark. With both approaches, an important reduction of the mass is obtained by coping with the mission's control performance/stability requirements and a large set of uncertainties. ",

Recently, the Knowledge Graph (KG) has been proven as an effective scheme for handling the zero-shot task with large-scale and non-attribute data. Prior studies always embed relationships of seen and unseen objects into visual information from existing knowledge graphs to promote the cognitive ability of the unseen data. Actually, real-world knowledge is naturally formed by multimodal facts. Compared with ordinary structural knowledge from a graph perspective, multimodal KG can provide cognitive systems with fine-grained knowledge. For example, the text description and visual content can depict more critical details of a fact than only depending on knowledge triplets. Unfortunately, this multimodal fine-grained knowledge is largely unexploited due to the bottleneck of feature alignment between different modalities. To that end, we propose a multimodal intensive ZSL framework that matches regions of images with corresponding semantic embeddings via a designed dense attention module and self-calibration loss. It makes the semantic transfer process of our ZSL framework learns more differentiated knowledge between entities. Our model also gets rid of the performance limitation of only using rough global features. We conduct extensive experiments and evaluate our model on large-scale real-world data. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in standard zero-shot classification tasks. ",

Experimental results show that our attack significantly degrades the translation quality of multiple NMT models while maintaining the semantic similarity between the original and adversarial sentences. Furthermore, our attack outperforms the baselines in terms of success rate, similarity preservation, effect on translation quality, and token error rate.

Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the data collected by these devices is crucial for reliable decision-making and maintaining trust in the system. Traditional authentication methods are often vulnerable to attacks or can be easily duplicated, posing challenges to securing crowdsensing applications. Besides, current solutions leveraging device behavior are mostly focused on device identification, which is a simpler task than authentication. To address these issues, an individual IoT device authentication framework based on hardware behavior fingerprinting and Transformer autoencoders is proposed in this work. This solution leverages the inherent imperfections and variations in IoT device hardware to differentiate between devices with identical specifications. By monitoring and analyzing the behavior of key hardware components, such as the CPU, GPU, RAM, and Storage on devices, unique fingerprints for each device are created. The performance samples are considered as time series data and used to train anomaly detection transformer models, one per device. Then, the framework is validated within a spectrum crowdsensing system leveraging Raspberry Pi devices. After a pool of experiments, the model from each device is able to individually authenticate it between the 45 devices employed for validation.

    "abstract": "Recent camera-based 3D object detection methods have introduced sequential frames to improve the detection performance hoping that multiple frames would mitigate the large depth estimation error. Despite improved detection performance, prior works rely on naive fusion methods (e.g., concatenation) or are limited to static scenes (e.g., temporal stereo), neglecting the importance of the motion cue of objects. These approaches do not fully exploit the potential of sequential images and show limited performance improvements. To address this limitation, we propose a novel 3D object detection model, P2D (Predict to Detect), that integrates a prediction scheme into a detection framework to explicitly extract and leverage motion features. P2D predicts object information in the current frame using solely past frames to learn temporal motion features. We then introduce a novel temporal feature aggregation method that attentively exploits Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features based on predicted object information, resulting in accurate 3D object detection. Experimental results demonstrate that P2D improves mAP and NDS by 3.0% and 3.7% compared to the sequential image-based baseline, illustrating that incorporating a prediction scheme can significantly improve detection accuracy.

    "abstract": "Mobile robots require knowledge of the environment, especially of humans located in its vicinity. While the most common approaches for detecting humans involve computer vision, an often overlooked hardware feature of robots for people detection are their 2D range finders. These were originally intended for obstacle avoidance and mapping/SLAM tasks. In most robots, they are conveniently located at a height approximately between the ankle and the knee, so they can be used for detecting people too, and with a larger field of view and depth resolution compared to cameras. In this paper, we present a new dataset for people detection using knee-high 2D range finders called FROG. This dataset has greater laser resolution, scanning frequency, and more complete annotation data compared to existing datasets such as DROW. Particularly, the FROG dataset contains annotations for 100% of its laser scans (unlike DROW which only annotates 5%), 17x more annotated scans, 100x more people annotations, and over twice the distance traveled by the robot. We propose a benchmark based on the FROG dataset, and analyze a collection of state-of-the-art people detectors based on 2D range finder data. We also propose and evaluate a new end-to-end deep learning approach for people detection. Our solution works with the raw sensor data directly (not needing hand-crafted input data features), thus avoiding CPU preprocessing and releasing the developer of understanding specific domain heuristics. Experimental results show how the proposed people detector attains results comparable to the state of the art, while an optimized implementation for ROS can operate at more than 500 Hz. ",

The challenge with this design is that MLaaS requires the client to reveal their potentially sensitive queries to the company hosting the model. Multi-party computation (MPC) protects the client's data by allowing encrypted inferences. However, current approaches suffer prohibitively large inference times. The inference time bottleneck in MPC is the evaluation of non-linear layers such as ReLU activation functions. Motivated by the success of previous work co-designing machine learning and MPC aspects, we develop an activation function co-design. We replace all ReLUs with a polynomial approximation and evaluate them with single-round MPC protocols, which give state-of-the-art inference times in wide-area networks. Furthermore, to address the accuracy issues previously encountered with polynomial activations, we propose a novel training algorithm that gives accuracy competitive with plaintext models. Our evaluation shows between $4$ and $90\\times$ speedups in inference time on large models with up to $23$ million parameters while maintaining competitive inference accuracy. ",

Over the last few years, the transferability of AEs has garnered significant attention as it is a crucial property for facilitating black-box attacks. Many approaches have been proposed to improve adversarial transferability. However, they are mainly verified across different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, which is not a reliable evaluation since all CNNs share some similar architectural biases. In this work, we re-evaluate 12 representative transferability-enhancing attack methods where we test on 18 popular models from 4 types of neural networks. Our reevaluation revealed that the adversarial transferability is often overestimated, and there is no single AE that can be transferred to all popular models. The transferability rank of previous attacking methods changes when under our comprehensive evaluation. Based on our analysis, we propose a reliable benchmark including three evaluation protocols. Adversarial transferability on our new benchmark is extremely low, which further confirms the overestimation of adversarial transferability.

Therefore, achieving a cyberattack-defense scheme in the IoV system with faulty data saturation is necessary. This paper proposes a Federated Learning-based Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Algorithm against Cyberattacks (FL-TP) to address the above problems. The FL-TP is intensively trained and tested using a publicly available Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi) dataset with five types of cyberattacks: constant, constant offset, random, random offset, and eventual stop. The results show that the proposed FL-TP algorithm can improve cyberattack detection and trajectory prediction by up to 6.99% and 54.86%, respectively, under the maximum cyberattack permeability scenarios compared with benchmark methods.

However, such annotation sources may increase the risk of including noisy labels in training data, leading to inaccurate RS image representation learning (IRL). To address this issue, in this paper we propose a label noise robust IRL method that aims to prevent the interference of noisy labels on IRL, independently from the learning task being considered in RS. To this end, the proposed method combines a supervised variational autoencoder (SVAE) with any kind of DNN. This is achieved by defining variational generative process based on image features. This allows us to define the importance of each training sample for IRL based on the loss values acquired from the SVAE and the task head of the considered DNN. Then, the proposed method imposes lower importance to images with noisy labels, while giving higher importance to those with correct labels during IRL. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared to well-known label noise robust IRL methods applied to RS images.

To remove this dependency, we extend the concept of learnable cross-lingual mappings for end-to-end speech recognition. Furthermore, mapping models are employed to transliterate the source languages to the target language without using parallel data. Finally, the source audio and its transliteration is used for data augmentation to retrain the target language ASR. The results show that any source language ASR model can be used for a low-resource target language recognition followed by proposed mapping model.

Data augmentation is a common and effective practice for these two scenarios.

To mitigate these potential issues, we propose a novel data augmentation method by applying the text-based speech editing model.

To address this limitation, we propose Heterogeneous Continual Learning (HCL), where a wide range of evolving network architectures emerge continually together with novel data/tasks. As a solution, we build on top of the distillation family of techniques and modify it to a new setting where a weaker model takes the role of a teacher; meanwhile, a new stronger architecture acts as a student. Furthermore, we consider a setup of limited access to previous data and propose Quick Deep Inversion (QDI) to recover prior task visual features to support knowledge transfer. QDI significantly reduces computational costs compared to previous solutions and improves overall performance. In summary, we propose a new setup for CL with a modified knowledge distillation paradigm and design a quick data inversion method to enhance distillation.

However, recent works show that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which can fool the GNN model to make desired predictions of the attacker. In addition, training data of GNNs can be leaked under membership inference attacks. This largely hinders the adoption of GNNs in high-stake domains such as e-commerce, finance and bioinformatics. Though investigations have been made in conducting robust predictions and protecting membership privacy, they generally fail to simultaneously consider the robustness and membership privacy. Therefore, in this work, we study a novel problem of developing robust and membership privacy-preserving GNNs. Our analysis shows that Information Bottleneck (IB) can help filter out noisy information and regularize the predictions on labeled samples, which can benefit robustness and membership privacy. However, structural noises and lack of labels in node classification challenge the deployment of IB on graph-structured data. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel graph information bottleneck framework that can alleviate structural noises with neighbor bottleneck. Pseudo labels are also incorporated in the optimization to minimize the gap between the predictions on the labeled set and unlabeled set for membership privacy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can give robust predictions and simultaneously preserve membership privacy. ",

Spectral methods based on the graph Laplacian and its generalization to the graph $p$-Laplacian have been a backbone of non-euclidean clustering techniques. The advantage of the $p$-Laplacian is that the parameter $p$ induces a controllable bias on cluster structure. The drawback of $p$-Laplacian eigenvector based methods is that the third and higher eigenvectors are difficult to compute. Thus, instead, we are motivated to use the $p$-resistance induced by the $p$-Laplacian for clustering. For $p$-resistance, small $p$ biases towards clusters with high internal connectivity while large $p$ biases towards clusters of small ``extent,'' that is a preference for smaller shortest-path distances between vertices in the cluster. However, the $p$-resistance is expensive to compute. We overcome this by developing an approximation to the $p$-resistance. We prove upper and lower bounds on this approximation and observe that it is exact when the graph is a tree. We also provide theoretical justification for the use of $p$-resistance for clustering. Finally, we provide experiments comparing our approximated $p$-resistance clustering to other $p$-Laplacian based methods. ",

A human may recognize that it is not socially appropriate to disassemble the sports car and put it away as part of the \"tidying\". How can a robot reach that conclusion? Although large language models (LLMs) have recently been used to enable social reasoning, grounding this reasoning in the real world has been challenging. To reason in the real world, robots must go beyond passively querying LLMs and *actively gather information from the environment* that is required to make the right decision. For instance, after detecting that there is an occluded car, the robot may need to actively perceive the car to know whether it is an advanced model car made out of Legos or a toy car built by a toddler. We propose an approach that leverages an LLM and vision language model (VLM) to help a robot actively perceive its environment to perform grounded social reasoning. To evaluate our framework at scale, we release the MessySurfaces dataset which contains images of 70 real-world surfaces that need to be cleaned.

    "abstract": "Predicting the number of defects in a project is critical for project test managers to allocate budget, resources, and schedule for testing, support and maintenance efforts. Software Defect Prediction models predict the number of defects in given projects after training the model with historical defect related information. The majority of defect prediction studies focused on predicting defect-prone modules from methods, and class-level static information, whereas this study predicts defects from project-level information based on a cross-company project dataset. This study utilizes software sizing metrics, effort metrics, and defect density information, and focuses on developing defect prediction models that apply various machine learning algorithms. One notable issue in existing defect prediction studies is the lack of transparency in the developed models. Consequently, the explain-ability of the developed model has been demonstrated using the state-of-the-art post-hoc model-agnostic method called Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Finally, important features for predicting defects from cross-company project information were identified. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are susceptible to a variety of attacks that can erode trust in their deployment. These threats include attacks against the privacy of training data and adversarial examples that jeopardize model accuracy. Differential privacy and randomized smoothing are effective defenses that provide certifiable guarantees for each of these threats, however, it is not well understood how implementing either defense impacts the other. In this work, we argue that it is possible to achieve both privacy guarantees and certified robustness simultaneously. We provide a framework called DP-CERT for integrating certified robustness through randomized smoothing into differentially private model training. For instance, compared to differentially private stochastic gradient descent on CIFAR10, DP-CERT leads to a 12-fold increase in certified accuracy and a 10-fold increase in the average certified radius at the expense of a drop in accuracy of 1.2%. Through in-depth per-sample metric analysis, we show that the certified radius correlates with the local Lipschitz constant and smoothness of the loss surface. This provides a new way to diagnose when private models will fail to be robust. ",

One form of trustworthiness is a model's robustness across different subgroups: while existing models may exhibit expert-level performance on aggregate metrics, they often rely on non-causal features, leading to errors in hidden subgroups. To take a step closer towards trustworthy seizure onset detection from EEG, we propose to leverage annotations that are produced by healthcare personnel in routine clinical workflows -- which we refer to as workflow notes -- that include multiple event descriptions beyond seizures. Using workflow notes, we first show that by scaling training data to an unprecedented level of 68,920 EEG hours, seizure onset detection performance significantly improves (+12.3 AUROC points) compared to relying on smaller training sets with expensive manual gold-standard labels. Second, we reveal that our binary seizure onset detection model underperforms on clinically relevant subgroups (e.g., up to a margin of 6.5 AUROC points between pediatrics and adults), while having significantly higher false positives on EEG clips showing non-epileptiform abnormalities compared to any EEG clip (+19 FPR points). To improve model robustness to hidden subgroups, we train a multilabel model that classifies 26 attributes other than seizures, such as spikes, slowing, and movement artifacts. We find that our multilabel model significantly improves overall seizure onset detection performance (+5.9 AUROC points) while greatly improving performance among subgroups (up to +8.3 AUROC points), and decreases false positives on non-epileptiform abnormalities by 8 FPR points. Finally, we propose a clinical utility metric based on false positives per 24 EEG hours and find that our multilabel model improves this clinical utility metric by a factor of 2x across different clinical settings.

Following image processing techniques, we are able to make scale and spatial information simultaneously accessible to the network without increasing the size of the data vector.

    "abstract": "Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the target instance referred by a given text expression in a video clip. The text expression normally contains sophisticated descriptions of the instance's appearance, actions, and relations with others. It is therefore rather difficult for an RVOS model to capture all these attributes correspondingly in the video; in fact, the model often favours more on the action- and relation-related visual attribute of the instance. This can end up with incomplete or even incorrect mask prediction of the target instance. In this paper, we tackle this problem by taking a subject-centric short text expression from the original long text expression. The short one retains only the appearance-related information of the target instance so that we can use it to focus the model's attention on the instance's appearance. We let the model make joint predictions using both long and short text expressions and introduce a long-short predictions intersection loss to align the joint predictions. Besides the improvement on the linguistic part, we also introduce a forward-backward visual consistency loss, which utilizes optical flows to warp visual features between the annotated frames and their temporal neighbors for consistency. We build our method on top of two state of the art transformer-based pipelines for end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on A2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences datasets show impressive improvements of our method. ",

    "abstract": "Communication by binary and sparse spikes is a key factor for the energy efficiency of biological brains. However, training deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) with backpropagation is harder than with artificial neural networks (ANNs), which is puzzling given that recent theoretical results provide exact mapping algorithms from ReLU to time-to-first-spike (TTFS) SNNs. Building upon these results, we analyze in theory and in simulation the learning dynamics of TTFS-SNNs. Our analysis highlights that even when an SNN can be mapped exactly to a ReLU network, it cannot always be robustly trained by gradient descent. The reason for that is the emergence of a specific instance of the vanishing-or-exploding gradient problem leading to a bias in the gradient descent trajectory in comparison with the equivalent ANN. After identifying this issue we derive a generic solution for the network initialization and SNN parameterization which guarantees that the SNN can be trained as robustly as its ANN counterpart. Our theoretical findings are illustrated in practice on image classification datasets. Our method achieves the same accuracy as deep ConvNets on CIFAR10 and enables fine-tuning on the much larger PLACES365 dataset without loss of accuracy compared to the ANN. We argue that the combined perspective of conversion and fine-tuning with robust gradient descent in SNN will be decisive to optimize SNNs for hardware implementations needing low latency and resilience to noise and quantization.

Recently, a hybrid method (Assaad et al, 2021) that combines these two approaches, proved to be robust to assumption violation. However, this method assumes that the summary causal graph is acyclic, but cycles are common in many applications. For example, in ecological communities, there may be cyclic relationships between predator and prey populations, creating feedback loops. Therefore, this paper presents two new frameworks for hybrids of constraint-based and noise-based methods that can discover summary causal graphs that may or may not contain cycles. For each framework, we provide two hybrid algorithms which are experimentally tested on simulated data, realistic ecological data, and real data from various applications.

At the core of our method are three branches that produce three tri-planes representing the coarse 3D geometry, detailed appearance of a source image, as well as the expression of a target image. By applying volumetric rendering to the combination of the three tri-planes followed by a super-resolution module, our method yields a high fidelity image of the desired identity, expression and pose. Once trained, our model enables efficient 3D head avatar reconstruction and animation via a single forward pass through a network.

However, the density of vehicles on roads often varies spatially and temporally primarily due to mobility and traffic situations in a geographical area, making it difficult to provide ubiquitous service. Moreover, as energy-constrained UAVs hover in the sky while serving mobile users, they may be faced with interference from nearby UAV cells or other access points sharing the same frequency band, thereby impacting the system's energy efficiency (EE). Recent multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches applied to optimise the users' coverage worked well in reasonably even densities but might not perform as well in uneven users' distribution, i.e., in urban road networks with uneven concentration of vehicles. In this work, we propose a density-aware communication-enabled multi-agent decentralised double deep Q-network (DACEMAD-DDQN) approach that maximises the total system's EE by jointly optimising the trajectory of each UAV, the number of connected users, and the UAVs' energy consumption while keeping track of dense and uneven users' distribution.

After obtaining retrieved examples, re-ranking is a widely adopted post-processing step to reorder and improve the initial retrieval results by making use of the contextual information from semantically neighboring samples. Prevailing re-ranking approaches update distance metrics and mostly rely on inefficient crosscheck set comparison operations while computing expanded neighbors based distances. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method which refines initial retrieval results by updating features. Specifically, we reformulate re-ranking based on Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) and propose a novel Graph Convolution based Re-ranking (GCR) for visual retrieval tasks via feature propagation. To accelerate computation for large-scale retrieval, a decentralized and synchronous feature propagation algorithm which supports parallel or distributed computing is introduced. In particular, the plain GCR is extended for cross-camera retrieval and an improved feature propagation formulation is presented to leverage affinity relationships across different cameras. It is also extended for video-based retrieval, and Graph Convolution based Re-ranking for Video (GCRV) is proposed by mathematically deriving a novel profile vector generation method for the tracklet. Without bells and whistles, the proposed approaches achieve state-of-the-art performances on seven benchmark datasets from three different tasks, i.e., image retrieval, person Re-ID and video-based person Re-ID.

Our contribution is a new realtime bi-level optimization algorithm, in which the top-level optimization consists of computing a fair and collision-free ordering followed by the bottom-level optimization which plans optimal trajectories conditioned on the ordering. We show that, given such a priority order, we can impose simple kinodynamic constraints on each robot that are sufficient for it to plan collision-free trajectories with minimal deviation from their preferred velocities, similar to how humans navigate in these scenarios.

    "title": "Description-Enhanced Label Embedding Contrastive Learning for Text  Classification",
    "abstract": "Text Classification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing, which requires an agent to determine the most appropriate category for input sentences. Recently, deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance in this area, especially Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Usually, these methods concentrate on input sentences and corresponding semantic embedding generation. However, for another essential component: labels, most existing works either treat them as meaningless one-hot vectors or use vanilla embedding methods to learn label representations along with model training, underestimating the semantic information and guidance that these labels reveal. To alleviate this problem and better exploit label information, in this paper, we employ Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in model learning process and design a novel self-supervised Relation of Relation (R2) classification task for label utilization from a one-hot manner perspective. Then, we propose a novel Relation of Relation Learning Network (R2-Net) for text classification, in which text classification and R2 classification are treated as optimization targets. Meanwhile, triplet loss is employed to enhance the analysis of differences and connections among labels. Moreover, considering that one-hot usage is still short of exploiting label information, we incorporate external knowledge from WordNet to obtain multi-aspect descriptions for label semantic learning and extend R2-Net to a novel Description-Enhanced Label Embedding network (DELE) from a label embedding perspective. ...

This study introduces PINNacle, a benchmarking tool designed to fill this gap. PINNacle provides a diverse dataset, comprising over 20 distinct PDEs from various domains including heat conduction, fluid dynamics, biology, and electromagnetics. These PDEs encapsulate key challenges inherent to real-world problems, such as complex geometry, multi-scale phenomena, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality. PINNacle also offers a user-friendly toolbox, incorporating about 10 state-of-the-art PINN methods for systematic evaluation and comparison. We have conducted extensive experiments with these methods, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses. In addition to providing a standardized means of assessing performance, PINNacle also offers an in-depth analysis to guide future research, particularly in areas such as domain decomposition methods and loss reweighting for handling multi-scale problems and complex geometry. While PINNacle does not guarantee success in all real-world scenarios, it represents a significant contribution to the field by offering a robust, diverse, and comprehensive benchmark suite that will undoubtedly foster further research and development in PINNs.

Although face forgery detection has made promising progress, most current methods are designed manually by human experts, which is labor-consuming. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end framework based on neural architecture search (NAS) for deepfake detection, which can automatically design network architectures without human intervention. First, a forgery-oriented search space is created to choose appropriate operations for this task. Second, we propose a novel performance estimation metric, which guides the search process to select more general models. The cross-dataset search is also considered to develop more general architectures. Eventually, we connect the cells in a cascaded pyramid way for final forgery classification.

Automated answer-aware reading comprehension question generation has significant potential to scale up learner support in educational activities. One key technical challenge in this setting is that there can be multiple questions, sometimes very different from each other, with the same answer; a trained question generation method may not necessarily know which question human educators would prefer. To address this challenge, we propose 1) a data augmentation method that enriches the training dataset with diverse questions given the same context and answer and 2) an overgenerate-and-rank method to select the best question from a pool of candidates. We evaluate our method on the FairytaleQA dataset, showing a 5% absolute improvement in ROUGE-L over the best existing method. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating harder, \"implicit\" questions, where the answers are not contained in the context as text spans. ",

The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed bi-encoder-based detectors outperform other methods, both those that require OOD labels in training and those that do not, across all datasets, showing great potential for OOD detection in NLP. The simplicity of the training process and the superior detection performance make them applicable to real-world scenarios. The presented methods and benchmarking metrics serve as a valuable resource for future research in OOD detection, enabling further advancements in this field.

    "abstract": "The remarkable success of the use of machine learning-based solutions for network security problems has been impeded by the developed ML models' inability to maintain efficacy when used in different network environments exhibiting different network behaviors. This issue is commonly referred to as the generalizability problem of ML models. The community has recognized the critical role that training datasets play in this context and has developed various techniques to improve dataset curation to overcome this problem. Unfortunately, these methods are generally ill-suited or even counterproductive in the network security domain, where they often result in unrealistic or poor-quality datasets. To address this issue, we propose an augmented ML pipeline that leverages explainable ML tools to guide the network data collection in an iterative fashion. To ensure the data's realism and quality, we require that the new datasets should be endogenously collected in this iterative process, thus advocating for a gradual removal of data-related problems to improve model generalizability. To realize this capability, we develop a data-collection platform, netUnicorn, that takes inspiration from the classic \"hourglass\" model and is implemented as its \"thin waist\" to simplify data collection for different learning problems from diverse network environments. The proposed system decouples data-collection intents from the deployment mechanisms and disaggregates these high-level intents into smaller reusable, self-contained tasks. We demonstrate how netUnicorn simplifies collecting data for different learning problems from multiple network environments and how the proposed iterative data collection improves a model's generalizability.

It has a long history in scientific computing and has recently gained popularity in machine learning, particularly in methods that preserve the graph spectrum. This work studies graph coarsening from a different perspective, developing a theory for preserving graph distances and proposing a method to achieve this. The geometric approach is useful when working with a collection of graphs, such as in graph classification and regression. In this study, we consider a graph as an element on a metric space equipped with the Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance, and bound the difference between the distance of two graphs and their coarsened versions. Minimizing this difference can be done using the popular weighted kernel $K$-means method, which improves existing spectrum-preserving methods with the proper choice of the kernel. The study includes a set of experiments to support the theory and method, including approximating the GW distance, preserving the graph spectrum, classifying graphs using spectral information, and performing regression using graph convolutional networks.

Utilizing temporal information is crucial for surgical phase recognition, hence various recent approaches extract frame-level features to conduct full video temporal modeling. For better temporal modeling, we propose SlowFast Temporal Modeling Network (SF-TMN) for surgical phase recognition that can not only achieve frame-level full video temporal modeling but also achieve segment-level full video temporal modeling. We employ a feature extraction network, pre-trained on the target dataset, to extract features from video frames as the training data for SF-TMN. The Slow Path in SF-TMN utilizes all frame features for frame temporal modeling. The Fast Path in SF-TMN utilizes segment-level features summarized from frame features for segment temporal modeling. The proposed paradigm is flexible regarding the choice of temporal modeling networks. We explore MS-TCN and ASFormer models as temporal modeling networks and experiment with multiple combination strategies for Slow and Fast Paths. We evaluate SF-TMN on Cholec80 surgical phase recognition task and demonstrate that SF-TMN can achieve state-of-the-art results on all considered metrics. SF-TMN with ASFormer backbone outperforms the state-of-the-art Not End-to-End(TCN) method by 2.6% in accuracy and 7.4% in the Jaccard score. We also evaluate SF-TMN on action segmentation datasets including 50salads, GTEA, and Breakfast, and achieve state-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising method for robot collision avoidance. However, such DRL models often come with limitations, such as adapting effectively to structured environments containing various pedestrians. In order to solve this difficulty, previous research has attempted a few approaches, including training an end-to-end solution by integrating a waypoint planner with DRL and developing a multimodal solution to mitigate the drawbacks of the DRL model. However, these approaches have encountered several issues, including slow training times, scalability challenges, and poor coordination among different models. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach called evolutionary curriculum training to tackle these challenges. The primary goal of evolutionary curriculum training is to evaluate the collision avoidance model's competency in various scenarios and create curricula to enhance its insufficient skills. The paper introduces an innovative evaluation technique to assess the DRL model's performance in navigating structured maps and avoiding dynamic obstacles. Additionally, an evolutionary training environment generates all the curriculum to improve the DRL model's inadequate skills tested in the previous evaluation. We benchmark the performance of our model across five structured environments to validate the hypothesis that this evolutionary training environment leads to a higher success rate and a lower average number of collisions.

    "abstract": "Factual consistency is one of the most important requirements when editing high quality documents. It is extremely important for automatic text generation systems like summarization, question answering, dialog modeling, and language modeling. Still, automated factual inconsistency detection is rather under-studied. Existing work has focused on (a) finding fake news keeping a knowledge base in context, or (b) detecting broad contradiction (as part of natural language inference literature). However, there has been no work on detecting and explaining types of factual inconsistencies in text, without any knowledge base in context. In this paper, we leverage existing work in linguistics to formally define five types of factual inconsistencies. Based on this categorization, we contribute a novel dataset, FICLE (Factual Inconsistency CLassification with Explanation), with ~8K samples where each sample consists of two sentences (claim and context) annotated with type and span of inconsistency. When the inconsistency relates to an entity type, it is labeled as well at two levels (coarse and fine-grained). Further, we leverage this dataset to train a pipeline of four neural models to predict inconsistency type with explanations, given a (claim, context) sentence pair. Explanations include inconsistent claim fact triple, inconsistent context span, inconsistent claim component, coarse and fine-grained inconsistent entity types. The proposed system first predicts inconsistent spans from claim and context; and then uses them to predict inconsistency types and inconsistent entity types (when inconsistency is due to entities). We experiment with multiple Transformer-based natural language classification as well as generative models, and find that DeBERTa performs the best. Our proposed methods provide a weighted F1 of ~87% for inconsistency type classification across the five classes. ",

We first define a system model which considers both satellite movement over time and inter-satellite links. We next formulate the optimal entanglement distribution (OED) problem under this system model and show how to convert the OED problem in a dynamic physical network to one in a static logical graph which can be used to solve the OED problem in the dynamic physical network. We then propose a polynomial time greedy algorithm for computing satellite-assisted multi-hop entanglement paths. We also design an integer linear programming (ILP)-based algorithm to compute optimal solutions as a baseline to study the performance of our greedy algorithm.

Despite the widespread use of image augmentations across computer vision applications, their potential remains underexplored when learning neural rendering methods (NRMs) for 3D scenes. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the use of image augmentations in NRMs, where we explore different augmentation strategies. We found that introducing image augmentations during training presents challenges such as geometric and photometric inconsistencies for learning NRMs from images. Specifically, geometric inconsistencies arise from alterations in shapes, positions, and orientations from the augmentations, disrupting spatial cues necessary for accurate 3D reconstruction. On the other hand, photometric inconsistencies arise from changes in pixel intensities introduced by the augmentations, affecting the ability to capture the underlying 3D structures of the scene. We alleviate these issues by focusing on color manipulations and introducing learnable appearance embeddings that allow NRMs to explain away photometric variations. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of incorporating augmentations when learning NRMs, including improved photometric quality and surface reconstruction, as well as enhanced robustness against data quality issues, such as reduced training data and image degradations.

As quantum networks are emerging as a means of providing true connectivity between quantum computers, it is imperative and crucial to exploit game theory for addressing challenges like entanglement distribution and access, routing, topology extraction and inference for quantum networks. Quantum networks provide the promising opportunity of employing quantum games owing to their inherent capability of generating and sharing quantum states. Besides, quantum games offer enhanced payoffs and winning probabilities, new strategies and equilibria, which are unimaginable in classical games. Employing quantum game theory to solve fundamental challenges in quantum networks opens a new fundamental research direction necessitating inter-disciplinary efforts.

We compare the quantum strategies with classical ones by showing the quantum advantages in terms of link fidelity improvement and latency decrease in communication. In future, we will generalize our game framework to optimize entanglement distribution and access over any quantum network topology.

In these systems, users participate in the training of a recommender system while keeping their history of consumed items on their devices. While these solutions seemed appealing for preserving the privacy of the participants at a first glance, recent studies have shown that collaborative learning can be vulnerable to a variety of privacy attacks. In this paper we propose a novel privacy attack called Community Detection Attack (CDA), which allows an adversary to discover the members of a community based on a set of items of her choice (e.g., discovering users interested in LGBT content). Through experiments on three real recommendation datasets and by using two state-of-the-art recommendation models, we assess the sensitivity of an FL-based recommender system as well as two flavors of Gossip Learning-based recommender systems to CDA. Results show that on all models and all datasets, the FL setting is more vulnerable to CDA than Gossip settings. We further evaluated two off-the-shelf mitigation strategies, namely differential privacy (DP) and a share less policy, which consists in sharing a subset of model parameters. Results show a better privacy-utility trade-off for the share less policy compared to DP especially in the Gossip setting. ",

    "abstract": "In energy-constrained scenarios such as IoT applications, the primary requirement for System-on-Chips (SoCs) is to increase battery life. However, when performing sub/near-threshold operations, the relatively large leakage current hinders Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) from normal read/write functionalities at the lowest possible voltage (VDDMIN). In this work, we propose an Ultra8T SRAM to aggressively reduce VDDMIN by using a leakage detection strategy where the safety sensing time on bitlines is quantified without any additional hardware overhead. We validate the proposed Ultra8T using a 256x64 array in 28nm CMOS technology. Post-simulations show successful read operation at 0.25V with 1.11{\\mu}s read delay, and the minimum energy required is 1.69pJ at 0.4V. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been successfully adopted in mobile edge computing (MEC) to optimize task offloading and resource allocation. However, the dynamics of edge networks raise two challenges in neural network (NN)-based optimization methods: low scalability and high training costs. Although conventional node-output graph neural networks (GNN) can extract features of edge nodes when the network scales, they fail to handle a new scalability issue whereas the dimension of the decision space may change as the network scales. To address the issue, in this paper, a novel link-output GNN (LOGNN)-based resource management approach is proposed to flexibly optimize the resource allocation in MEC for an arbitrary number of edge nodes with extremely low algorithm inference delay. Moreover, a label-free unsupervised method is applied to train the LOGNN efficiently, where the gradient of edge tasks processing delay with respect to the LOGNN parameters is derived explicitly. In addition, a theoretical analysis of the scalability of the node-output GNN and link-output GNN is performed. Simulation results show that the proposed LOGNN can efficiently optimize the MEC resource allocation problem in a scalable way, with an arbitrary number of servers and users. In addition, the proposed unsupervised training method has better convergence performance and speed than supervised learning and reinforcement learning-based training methods.

    "abstract": "Representation learning based on multi-task pretraining has become a powerful approach in many domains. In particular, task-aware representation learning aims to learn an optimal representation for a specific target task by sampling data from a set of source tasks, while task-agnostic representation learning seeks to learn a universal representation for a class of tasks. In this paper, we propose a general and versatile algorithmic and theoretic framework for \\textit{active representation learning}, where the learner optimally chooses which source tasks to sample from. This framework, along with a tractable meta algorithm, allows most arbitrary target and source task spaces (from discrete to continuous), covers both task-aware and task-agnostic settings, and is compatible with deep representation learning practices. We provide several instantiations under this framework, from bilinear and feature-based nonlinear to general nonlinear cases. In the bilinear case, by leveraging the non-uniform spectrum of the task representation and the calibrated source-target relevance, we prove that the sample complexity to achieve $\\varepsilon$-excess risk on target scales with $ (k^*)^2 \\|v^*\\|_2^2 \\varepsilon^{-2}$ where $k^*$ is the effective dimension of the target and $\\|v^*\\|_2^2 \\in (0,1]$ represents the connection between source and target space. Compared to the passive one, this can save up to $\\frac{1}{d_W}$ of sample complexity, where $d_W$ is the task space dimension. Finally, we demonstrate different instantiations of our meta algorithm in synthetic datasets and robotics problems, from pendulum simulations to real-world drone flight datasets. On average, our algorithms outperform baselines by $20\\%-70\\%$. ",

The constraints can be specified as a linear operator applied to the neural field and its derivatives. We also design specific model representations and training strategies for problems where standard models may encounter difficulties, such as conditioning of the system, memory consumption, and capacity of the network when being constrained. Our approaches are demonstrated in a wide range of real-world applications. Additionally, we develop a framework that enables highly efficient model and constraint specification, which can be readily applied to any downstream task where hard constraints need to be explicitly satisfied during optimization.

We use self-attention modules to exploit the long-time information, where the intra-chunk self-attentions are used to model the spectrum pattern and the inter-chunk self-attention are used to model the dependence between consecutive frames. Compared to DPRNN, axial self-attention greatly reduces the need for memory and computation, which is more suitable for long sequences of speech signals.

In this paper, we propose Automatic Prune Binarization (APB), a novel compression technique combining quantization with pruning.

Our technique jointly maximizes the accuracy of the network while minimizing its memory impact by deciding whether each weight should be binarized or kept in full precision. We show how to efficiently perform a forward pass through layers compressed using APB by decomposing it into a binary and a sparse-dense matrix multiplication. Moreover, we design two novel efficient algorithms for extremely quantized matrix multiplication on CPU, leveraging highly efficient bitwise operations. The proposed algorithms are 6.9x and 1.5x faster than available state-of-the-art solutions. We perform an extensive evaluation of APB on two widely adopted model compression datasets, namely CIFAR10 and ImageNet. APB shows to deliver better accuracy/memory trade-off compared to state-of-the-art methods based on i) quantization, ii) pruning, and iii) combination of pruning and quantization. APB outperforms quantization also in the accuracy/efficiency trade-off, being up to 2x faster than the 2-bits quantized model with no loss in accuracy. ",

Existing research is mainly based on node-by-node embedding modifications, which falls into the dilemma of efficient calculation and accuracy. Observing that the embedding dimensions are usually much smaller than the number of nodes, we break this dilemma with a novel dynamic network embedding paradigm that rotates and scales the axes of embedding space instead of a node-by-node update. Specifically, we propose the Dynamic Adjacency Matrix Factorization (DAMF) algorithm, which achieves an efficient and accurate dynamic network embedding by rotating and scaling the coordinate system where the network embedding resides with no more than the number of edge modifications changes of node embeddings. Moreover, a dynamic Personalized PageRank is applied to the obtained network embeddings to enhance node embeddings and capture higher-order neighbor information dynamically. Experiments of node classification, link prediction, and graph reconstruction on different-sized dynamic graphs suggest that DAMF advances dynamic network embedding. Further, we unprecedentedly expand dynamic network embedding experiments to billion-edge graphs, where DAMF updates billion-level parameters in less than 10ms. ",

Although reported by qualitative studies, our understanding of the capability of code review as a communication network is still limited. Objective: In this article, we report on a first step towards evaluating the capability of code review as a communication network by quantifying how fast and how far information can spread through code review: the upper bound of information diffusion in code review. Method: In an in-silico experiment, we simulate an artificial information diffusion within large (Microsoft), mid-sized (Spotify), and small code review systems (Trivago) modelled as communication networks. We then measure the minimal topological and temporal distances between the participants to quantify how far and how fast information can spread in code review. Results: An average code review participants in the small and mid-sized code review systems can spread information to between 72% and 85% of all code review participants within four weeks independently of network size and tooling; for the large code review systems, we found an absolute boundary of about 11000 reachable participants. On average (median), information can spread between two participants in code review in less than five hops and less than five days. Conclusion: We found evidence that the communication network emerging from code review scales well and spreads information fast and broadly, corroborating the findings of prior qualitative work. The study lays the foundation for understanding and improving code review as a communication network. ",

    "abstract": "By default neural networks are not robust to changes in data distribution. This has been demonstrated with simple image corruptions, such as blurring or adding noise, degrading image classification performance. Many methods have been proposed to mitigate these issues but for the most part models are evaluated on single corruptions. In reality, visual space is compositional in nature, that is, that as well as robustness to elemental corruptions, robustness to compositions of corruptions is also needed. In this work we develop a compositional image classification task where, given a few elemental corruptions, models are asked to generalize to compositions of these corruptions. That is, to achieve compositional robustness. We experimentally compare empirical risk minimization with an invariance building pairwise contrastive loss and, counter to common intuitions in domain generalization, achieve only marginal improvements in compositional robustness by encouraging invariance. To move beyond invariance, following previously proposed inductive biases that model architectures should reflect data structure, we introduce a modular architecture whose structure replicates the compositional nature of the task. We then show that this modular approach consistently achieves better compositional robustness than non-modular approaches. We additionally find empirical evidence that the degree of invariance between representations of 'in-distribution' elemental corruptions fails to correlate with robustness to 'out-of-distribution' compositions of corruptions.

In reliance with these state augmentations, delay-resolved reinforcement learning algorithms train policies to learn optimal interactions with environments featured with observation or action delays. Although such methods can directly be trained on the real robots, due to sample inefficiency, limited resources or safety constraints, a common approach is to transfer models trained in simulation to the physical robot. However, robotic simulations rely on approximated models of the physical systems, which hinders the sim2real transfer. In this work, we consider various uncertainties in the modelling of the robot's dynamics as unknown intrinsic disturbances applied on the system input. We introduce a disturbance-augmented Markov decision process in delayed settings as a novel representation to incorporate disturbance estimation in training on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed method is validated across several metrics on learning a robotic reaching task and compared with disturbance-unaware baselines. The results show that the disturbance-augmented models can achieve higher stabilization and robustness in the control response, which in turn improves the prospects of successful sim2real transfer.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimation of the node cardinality of each node type in a heterogeneous wireless network with $T$ types of nodes deployed over a large region, where $T \\ge 2$ is an integer. A mobile base station (MBS), such as that mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle, is used in such cases since a single static base station is not sufficient to cover such a large region. The MBS moves around in the region and makes multiple stops, and at the last stop, it is able to estimate the node cardinalities for the entire region. In this paper, we propose two schemes, viz., HSRC-M1 and HSRC-M2, to rapidly estimate the number of nodes of each type. Both schemes have two phases, and they are performed at each stop. We prove that the node cardinality estimates computed using our proposed schemes are equal to, and hence as accurate as, the estimates that would have been obtained if a well-known estimation protocol designed for homogeneous networks in prior work were separately executed $T$ times. We compute closed-form expressions for the expected number of slots required by HSRC-M1 to execute and the expected energy consumption of a node under HSRC-M1. We formulate the problem of finding the optimal tour of the MBS around the region, which covers all the nodes and minimizes the travel cost of the MBS, show that it is NP-complete, and provide a greedy algorithm to solve it. Using simulations, we show that the numbers of slots required by the proposed schemes, HSRC-M1 and HSRC-M2, for computing node cardinality estimates are significantly less than the number of slots required for $T$ separate executions of the above estimation protocol for homogeneous networks.

We show that similar results can be easily obtained using such methods even if the data are generated by a null model lacking the intended bias. Consequently, we argue that this approach generates false confidence. To address this issue, we propose a Bayesian alternative: hierarchical Bayesian modeling, which enables a more uncertainty-sensitive inspection of bias in word embeddings at different levels of granularity. To showcase our method, we apply it to Religion, Gender, and Race word lists from the original research, together with our control neutral word lists. We deploy the method using Google, Glove, and Reddit embeddings. Further, we utilize our approach to evaluate a debiasing technique applied to Reddit word embedding.

These systems are hard to design and reason about, mainly because we desire a particular class of behaviors to emerge from the interplay of heterogeneous individual agents. Nevertheless, mission-critical operations like manufacturing process orchestration in factories use such systems due to their uncompromising availability and resilience of computing services. This paper presents a set of TypeScript libraries to model peer-to-peer workflows as state machines, execute them using the Actyx middleware, and check the shape of these machines for conformance to a swarm protocol. The swarm protocol describes an idealized global view of the cooperation of machines of different roles. It directly corresponds to a diagram a product manager would sketch on a whiteboard; this allows for verifying that the coded state machines correctly implement the product specification. A well-formed swarm protocol also guarantees that conforming machines will achieve eventual consensus on the overall state progression even in the absence of further coordination.

The current standard for calibrating event cameras relies on either blinking patterns or event-based image reconstruction algorithms. These approaches are difficult to deploy in factory settings and are affected by noise and artifacts degrading the calibration performance. To bridge these limitations, we present E-Calib, a novel, fast, robust, and accurate calibration toolbox for event cameras utilizing the asymmetric circle grid, for its robustness to out-of-focus scenes. The proposed method is tested in a variety of rigorous experiments for different event camera models, on circle grids with different geometric properties, and under challenging illumination conditions. The results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in detection success rate, reprojection error, and estimation accuracy of extrinsic parameters. ",

    "abstract": "Although powerful graph neural networks (GNNs) have boosted numerous real-world applications, the potential privacy risk is still underexplored. To close this gap, we perform the first comprehensive study of graph reconstruction attack that aims to reconstruct the adjacency of nodes. We show that a range of factors in GNNs can lead to the surprising leakage of private links. Especially by taking GNNs as a Markov chain and attacking GNNs via a flexible chain approximation, we systematically explore the underneath principles of graph reconstruction attack, and propose two information theory-guided mechanisms: (1) the chain-based attack method with adaptive designs for extracting more private information; (2) the chain-based defense method that sharply reduces the attack fidelity with moderate accuracy loss. Such two objectives disclose a critical belief that to recover better in attack, you must extract more multi-aspect knowledge from the trained GNN; while to learn safer for defense, you must forget more link-sensitive information in training GNNs. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art results on six datasets and three common GNNs. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/MC-GRA. ",

    "abstract": "Dual-task dialog language understanding aims to tackle two correlative dialog language understanding tasks simultaneously via leveraging their inherent correlations. In this paper, we put forward a new framework, whose core is relational temporal graph reasoning.We propose a speaker-aware temporal graph (SATG) and a dual-task relational temporal graph (DRTG) to facilitate relational temporal modeling in dialog understanding and dual-task reasoning. Besides, different from previous works that only achieve implicit semantics-level interactions, we propose to model the explicit dependencies via integrating prediction-level interactions. To implement our framework, we first propose a novel model Dual-tAsk temporal Relational rEcurrent Reasoning network (DARER), which first generates the context-, speaker- and temporal-sensitive utterance representations through relational temporal modeling of SATG, then conducts recurrent dual-task relational temporal graph reasoning on DRTG, in which process the estimated label distributions act as key clues in prediction-level interactions. And the relational temporal modeling in DARER is achieved by relational convolutional networks (RGCNs). Then we further propose Relational Temporal Transformer (ReTeFormer), which achieves fine-grained relational temporal modeling via Relation- and Structure-aware Disentangled Multi-head Attention. Accordingly, we propose DARER with ReTeFormer (DARER2), which adopts two variants of ReTeFormer to achieve the relational temporal modeling of SATG and DTRG, respectively. The extensive experiments on different scenarios verify that our models outperform state-of-the-art models by a large margin. Remarkably, on the dialog sentiment classification task in the Mastodon dataset, DARER and DARER2 gain relative improvements of about 28% and 34% over the previous best model in terms of F1. ",

Existing methods for occupancy prediction primarily focus on optimizing projected features on 3D volume space using 3D occupancy labels. However, the generation process of these labels is complex and expensive (relying on 3D semantic annotations), and limited by voxel resolution, they cannot provide fine-grained spatial semantics. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Unifying Occupancy (UniOcc) prediction method, explicitly imposing spatial geometry constraint and complementing fine-grained semantic supervision through volume ray rendering. Our method significantly enhances model performance and demonstrates promising potential in reducing human annotation costs. Given the laborious nature of annotating 3D occupancy, we further introduce a Depth-aware Teacher Student (DTS) framework to enhance prediction accuracy using unlabeled data. Our solution achieves 51.27\\% mIoU on the official leaderboard with single model, placing 3rd in this challenge. ",

Current endeavors in hyperbolic representation largely presuppose that the underlying hierarchies can be automatically inferred and preserved through the adaptive optimization process. This assumption, however, is questionable and requires further validation. In this work, we first introduce a position-tracking mechanism to scrutinize existing prevalent \\hlms, revealing that the learned representations are sub-optimal and unsatisfactory. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, hyperbolic informed embedding (HIE), by incorporating cost-free hierarchical information deduced from the hyperbolic distance of the node to origin (i.e., induced hyperbolic norm) to advance existing \\hlms. The proposed method HIE is both task-agnostic and model-agnostic, enabling its seamless integration with a broad spectrum of models and tasks. Extensive experiments across various models and different tasks demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of the proposed method.

Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks is crucial for real-world applications, yet current research in this area is severely lacking. In this paper, we propose DIFFender, a novel defense method that leverages the pre-trained diffusion model to perform both localization and defense against potential adversarial patch attacks. DIFFender is designed as a pipeline consisting of two main stages: patch localization and restoration. In the localization stage, we exploit the intriguing properties of a diffusion model to effectively identify the locations of adversarial patches. In the restoration stage, we employ a text-guided diffusion model to eliminate adversarial regions in the image while preserving the integrity of the visual content. Additionally, we design a few-shot prompt-tuning algorithm to facilitate simple and efficient tuning, enabling the learned representations to easily transfer to downstream tasks, which optimize two stages jointly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification and face recognition to demonstrate that DIFFender exhibits superior robustness under strong adaptive attacks and generalizes well across various scenarios, diverse classifiers, and multiple attack methods.

In this study we examine worldwide adoption of AI technology within 333 fields of research during 1960-2021. We do this by using bibliometric analysis with 137 million peer-reviewed publications captured in The Lens database. We define AI using a list of 214 phrases developed by expert working groups at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We found that 3.1 million of the 137 million peer-reviewed research publications during the entire period were AI-related, with a surge in AI adoption across practically all research fields (physical science, natural science, life science, social science and the arts and humanities) in recent years. The diffusion of AI beyond computer science was early, rapid and widespread. In 1960 14% of 333 research fields were related to AI (many in computer science), but this increased to cover over half of all research fields by 1972, over 80% by 1986 and over 98% in current times. We note AI has experienced boom-bust cycles historically: the AI \"springs\" and \"winters\". We conclude that the context of the current surge appears different, and that interdisciplinary AI application is likely to be sustained. ",

While both problems have received significant research attention lately, they have been pursued independently. This may not be surprising, since the two tasks have seemingly conflicting goals. This paper provides a new unified approach that is capable of simultaneously generalizing to covariate shifts while robustly detecting semantic shifts. We propose a margin-based learning framework that exploits freely available unlabeled data in the wild that captures the environmental test-time OOD distributions under both covariate and semantic shifts. We show both empirically and theoretically that the proposed margin constraint is the key to achieving both OOD generalization and detection. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our framework, outperforming competitive baselines that specialize in either OOD generalization or OOD detection.

Toward the convergence of applications and networks, a network architectures with cross-domain joint processing capability is further proposed for 6G mobile communications and beyond. Both designs are able to provide more accurate information of the quality of experience (QoE) and quality of service (QoS), thus paving the path for the joint optimization of applications and networks. The benefits of the QoE assisted scheduling are further investigated via simulations. A new QoE-oriented fairness metric is further proposed, which is capable of ensuring better fairness when different services are scheduled. Future research directions and their standardization impacts are also identified. Toward optimized end-to-end service provision, the paradigm shift from loosely coupled to converged design of applications and wireless communication networks is indispensable. ",

DEYOv2, similar to its predecessor, DEYOv2 employs a progressive reasoning approach to accelerate model training and enhance performance.

This approach enables the third stage of DEYOv2 to maximize information acquisition from the first and second stages without needing NMS, achieving end-to-end optimization. By combining dense queries, sparse queries, one-to-many matching, and one-to-one matching, DEYOv2 leverages the advantages of each method. It outperforms all existing query-based end-to-end detectors under the same settings. When using ResNet-50 as the backbone and multi-scale features on the COCO dataset, DEYOv2 achieves 51.1 AP and 51.8 AP in 12 and 24 epochs, respectively. Compared to the end-to-end model DINO, DEYOv2 provides significant performance gains of 2.1 AP and 1.4 AP in the two epoch settings.

Their world model allows them to anticipate what might happen next and act accordingly with respect to an underlying objective. Such world models hold strong promises for planning in complex environments like in autonomous driving. A human driver, or a self-driving system, perceives their surroundings with their eyes or their cameras. They infer an internal representation of the world which should: (i) have spatial memory (e.g. occlusions), (ii) fill partially observable or noisy inputs (e.g. when blinded by sunlight), and (iii) be able to reason about unobservable events probabilistically (e.g. predict different possible futures). They are embodied intelligent agents that can predict, plan, and act in the physical world through their world model. In this thesis we present a general framework to train a world model and a policy, parameterised by deep neural networks, from camera observations and expert demonstrations. We leverage important computer vision concepts such as geometry, semantics, and motion to scale world models to complex urban driving scenes. First, we propose a model that predicts important quantities in computer vision: depth, semantic segmentation, and optical flow. We then use 3D geometry as an inductive bias to operate in the bird's-eye view space. We present for the first time a model that can predict probabilistic future trajectories of dynamic agents in bird's-eye view from 360{\\deg} surround monocular cameras only. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of learning a world model in closed-loop driving. Our model can jointly predict static scene, dynamic scene, and ego-behaviour in an urban driving environment. ",

In this work, we address the problem of efficiently learning robust world models in the reward-free setting. As a measure of robustness, we consider the minimax regret objective. We show that the minimax regret objective can be connected to minimising the maximum error in the world model across environments. This informs our algorithm, WAKER: Weighted Acquisition of Knowledge across Environments for Robustness. WAKER selects environments for data collection based on the estimated error of the world model for each environment.

Automotive Electronic Control Units (ECUs) implement predictable scheduling decisions based on task level response time estimation. Such levels of determinism exposes timing information about task executions and therefore corresponding message transmissions via the network buses (that connect the ECUs and actuators). With proper analysis, such timing side channels can be utilized to launch several schedule-based attacks that can lead to eventual denial-of-service or man-in-the-middle-type attacks. To eliminate this determinism, we propose a novel schedule obfuscation strategy by skipping certain control task executions and related data transmissions along with random shifting of the victim task instance. While doing this, our strategy contemplates the performance of the control task as well by bounding the number of control execution skips. We analytically demonstrate how the attack success probability (ASP) is reduced under this proposed attack-aware skipping and randomization. We also demonstrate the efficacy and real-time applicability of our attack-aware schedule obfuscation strategy Hide-n-Seek by applying it to synthesized automotive task sets in a real-time Hardware-in-loop (HIL) setup.

    "abstract": "The existence of redundant sensors in sensor networks is a common occurrence, yet their true significance remains elusive. This paper comprehensively investigates the effects and optimal design of redundant sensors in sensor networks that use Kalman filtering to estimate the state of a random process. The paper presents two main results: a theoretical analysis of the effects of redundant sensors and an engineering-oriented optimal design of redundant sensors. In the theoretical analysis, the paper leverages Riccati equations and Symplectic matrix theory to unveil the explicit role of redundant sensors in cooperative state estimation. The results unequivocally demonstrate that the addition of redundant sensors enhances the estimation performance of the sensor network, aligning with the principle of ``more is better\". Moreover, the paper establishes a precise sufficient and necessary condition to assess whether the inclusion of redundant sensors improves the estimation performance for all state elements simultaneously. Moving towards engineering-oriented design optimization, the paper proposes a novel algorithm to tackle the optimal design problem of redundant sensors. By employing linear matrix inequalities and iterative semi-definite programming techniques, the algorithm effectively handles the nonlinear constraints inherent in the optimization problem. Importantly, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate and validate the results. ",

Sound event detection systems are no longer simple variations of the baselines provided: multiple few-shot learning methodologies are still strong contenders for the task. ",

    "abstract": "Privacy policies are long, complex documents that end-users seldom read. Privacy labels aim to ameliorate these issues by providing succinct summaries of salient data practices. In December 2020, Apple began requiring that app developers submit privacy labels describing their apps' data practices. Yet, research suggests that app developers often struggle to do so. In this paper, we automatically identify possible discrepancies between mobile app privacy policies and their privacy labels. Such discrepancies could be indicators of potential privacy compliance issues. We introduce the Automated Privacy Label Analysis System (ATLAS). ATLAS includes three components: a pipeline to systematically retrieve iOS App Store listings and privacy policies; an ensemble-based classifier capable of predicting privacy labels from the text of privacy policies with 91.3% accuracy using state-of-the-art NLP techniques; and a discrepancy analysis mechanism that enables a large-scale privacy analysis of the iOS App Store. Our system has enabled us to analyze 354,725 iOS apps. We find several interesting trends. For example, only 40.3% of apps in the App Store provide easily accessible privacy policies, and only 29.6% of apps provide both accessible privacy policies and privacy labels. Among apps that provide both, 88.0% have at least one possible discrepancy between the text of their privacy policy and their privacy label, which could be indicative of a potential compliance issue. We find that, on average, apps have 5.32 such potential compliance issues. We hope that ATLAS will help app developers, researchers, regulators, and mobile app stores alike. For example, app developers could use our classifier to check for discrepancies between their privacy policies and privacy labels, and regulators could use our system to help review apps at scale for potential compliance issues.

    "abstract": "With the ever-growing concern for internet security, the field of quantum cryptography emerges as a promising solution for enhancing the security of networking systems. In this paper, 20 notable papers from leading conferences and journals are reviewed and categorized based on their focus on various aspects of quantum cryptography, including key distribution, quantum bit commitment, post quantum cryptography, and counterfactual quantum key distribution. The paper explores the motivations and challenges of employing quantum cryptography, addressing security and privacy concerns along with existing solutions. Secure key distribution, a critical component in ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information over a network, is emphasized in the discussion. The survey examines the potential of quantum cryptography to enable secure key exchange between parties, even when faced with eavesdropping, and other applications of quantum cryptography. Additionally, the paper analyzes the methodologies, findings, and limitations of each reviewed study, pinpointing trends such as the increasing focus on practical implementation of quantum cryptography protocols and the growing interest in postquantum cryptography research. Furthermore, the survey identifies challenges and open research questions, including the need for more efficient quantum repeater networks, improved security proofs for continuous variable quantum key distribution, and the development of quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms.

    "abstract": "While much progress has been achieved over the last decades in neuro-inspired machine learning, there are still fundamental theoretical problems in gradient-based learning using combinations of neurons. These problems, such as saddle points and suboptimal plateaus of the cost function, can lead in theory and practice to failures of learning. In addition, the discrete step size selection of the gradient is problematic since too large steps can lead to instability and too small steps slow down the learning. This paper describes an alternative discrete MinMax learning approach for continuous piece-wise linear functions. Global exponential convergence of the algorithm is established using Contraction Theory with Inequality Constraints, which is extended from the continuous to the discrete case in this paper: The parametrization of each linear function piece is, in contrast to deep learning, linear in the proposed MinMax network. This allows a linear regression stability proof as long as measurements do not transit from one linear region to its neighbouring linear region. The step size of the discrete gradient descent is Lagrangian limited orthogonal to the edge of two neighbouring linear functions. It will be shown that this Lagrangian step limitation does not decrease the convergence of the unconstrained system dynamics in contrast to a step size limitation in the direction of the gradient. We show that the convergence rate of a constrained piece-wise linear function learning is equivalent to the exponential convergence rates of the individual local linear regions. ",

Although deep learning-based models have shown promise in this field, they often fail to capture the causal relationship between dependent variables, leading to less accurate forecasts. Additionally, these models cannot handle the cold-start problem in time series data, where certain variables lack historical data, posing challenges in identifying dependencies among variables. To address these limitations, we introduce the Cold Causal Demand Forecasting (CDF-cold) framework that integrates causal inference with deep learning-based models to enhance the forecasting accuracy of multivariate time series data affected by the cold-start problem. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we collect 15 multivariate time-series datasets containing the network traffic of different Google data centers. Our experiments demonstrate that the CDF-cold framework outperforms state-of-the-art forecasting models in predicting future values of multivariate time series data. ",

    "abstract": "The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advancements in computer vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot access substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly in relation to decision-making algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the Deep Q-Learning algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and Q-values. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluate our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully recovering all information from the data across all 120 room layouts. ",

These \"foundation\" models are often adapted to a variety of downstream tasks like classification, object detection, and segmentation with little-to-no training on the target dataset. In this work, we perform a robustness analysis of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for segmentation tasks and compare them to supervised models of smaller scale. We focus on robustness against real-world distribution shift perturbations.We benchmark four state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 2 different datasets, COCO and ADE20K, with 17 different perturbations with 5 severity levels each. We find interesting insights that include (1) VFMs are not robust to compression-based corruptions, (2) while the selected VFMs do not significantly outperform or exhibit more robustness compared to non-VFM models, they remain competitively robust in zero-shot evaluations, particularly when non-VFM are under supervision and (3) selected VFMs demonstrate greater resilience to specific categories of objects, likely due to their open-vocabulary training paradigm, a feature that non-VFM models typically lack. We posit that the suggested robustness evaluation introduces new requirements for foundational models, thus sparking further research to enhance their performance. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are superior to shallow networks in learning complex representations. As such, there is a fast-growing interest in utilizing them in large-scale settings. The training process of neural networks is already known to be time-consuming, and having a deep architecture only aggravates the issue. This process consists mostly of matrix operations, among which matrix multiplication is the bottleneck. Several sampling-based techniques have been proposed for speeding up the training time of deep neural networks by approximating the matrix products. These techniques fall under two categories: (i) sampling a subset of nodes in every hidden layer as active at every iteration and (ii) sampling a subset of nodes from the previous layer to approximate the current layer's activations using the edges from the sampled nodes. In both cases, the matrix products are computed using only the selected samples. In this paper, we evaluate the scalability of these approaches on CPU machines with limited computational resources. Making a connection between the two research directions as special cases of approximating matrix multiplications in the context of neural networks, we provide a negative theoretical analysis that shows feedforward approximation is an obstacle against scalability. We conduct comprehensive experimental evaluations that demonstrate the most pressing challenges and limitations associated with the studied approaches. We observe that the hashing-based node selection method is not scalable to a large number of layers, confirming our theoretical analysis. Finally, we identify directions for future research. ",

Nevertheless, soil is called a complex, living medium due to the complex interaction of different soil processes that limit our understanding of soil. Process-based models and analyzing observed data provide two avenues for improving our understanding of soil processes. Collecting observed data is cost-prohibitive but reflects real-world behavior, while process-based models can be used to generate ample synthetic data which may not be representative of reality. We propose a framework, knowledge-guided representation learning, and causal structure learning (KGRCL), to accelerate scientific discoveries in soil science. The framework improves representation learning for simulated soil processes via conditional distribution matching with observed soil processes. Simultaneously, the framework leverages both observed and simulated data to learn a causal structure among the soil processes. The learned causal graph is more representative of ground truth than other graphs generated from other causal discovery methods. Furthermore, the learned causal graph is leveraged in a supervised learning setup to predict the impact of fertilizer use and changing weather on soil carbon.

The way individuals position themselves in relation to others, also known as proxemics, conveys social cues and affects the dynamics of social interaction. We present a novel approach that learns a 3D proxemics prior of two people in close social interaction. Since collecting a large 3D dataset of interacting people is a challenge, we rely on 2D image collections where social interactions are abundant. We achieve this by reconstructing pseudo-ground truth 3D meshes of interacting people from images with an optimization approach using existing ground-truth contact maps. We then model the proxemics using a novel denoising diffusion model called BUDDI that learns the joint distribution of two people in close social interaction directly in the SMPL-X parameter space. Sampling from our generative proxemics model produces realistic 3D human interactions, which we validate through a user study. Additionally, we introduce a new optimization method that uses the diffusion prior to reconstruct two people in close proximity from a single image without any contact annotation. Our approach recovers more accurate and plausible 3D social interactions from noisy initial estimates and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in zero-shot learning have enabled the use of paired image-text data to replace structured labels, replacing the need for expert annotated datasets. Models such as CLIP-based CheXzero utilize these advancements in the domain of chest X-ray interpretation. We hypothesize that domain pre-trained models such as CXR-BERT, BlueBERT, and ClinicalBERT offer the potential to improve the performance of CLIP-like models with specific domain knowledge by replacing BERT weights at the cost of breaking the original model's alignment. We evaluate the performance of zero-shot classification models with domain-specific pre-training for detecting low-prevalence pathologies. Even though replacing the weights of the original CLIP-BERT degrades model performance on commonly found pathologies, we show that pre-trained text towers perform exceptionally better on low-prevalence diseases. This motivates future ensemble models with a combination of differently trained language models for maximal performance. ",

Such structures are composed of many sections each of which generally contain weighting operations and activation function evaluations. The safe use comes from methods employing number based codes that can detect arithmetic errors in the network's processing steps. Each set of operations generates parity values dictated by a code in two ways. One set of parities is obtained from a section's outputs while a second comparable set is developed directly from the original inputs. The parity values protecting the activation functions involve a Taylor series approximation to the activation functions. We focus on using long numerically based convolutional codes because of the large size of data sets. The codes are based on Discrete Fourier Transform kernels and there are many design options available. Mathematical program simulations show our error-detecting techniques are effective and efficient. ",

In this paper, we analyze stock crowding using network analysis of fund holdings, which is used to compute crowding scores for stocks. These scores are used to construct costless long-short portfolios, computed in a distribution-free (model-free) way and without using any numerical optimization, with desirable properties of hedge portfolios. More specifically, these long-short portfolios provide protection for both small and large market price fluctuations, due to their negative correlation with the market and positive convexity as a function of market returns. By adding our long-short portfolio to a baseline portfolio such as a traditional 60/40 portfolio, our method provides an alternative way to hedge portfolio risk including tail risk, which does not require costly option-based strategies or complex numerical optimization. The total cost of such hedging amounts to the total cost of rebalancing the hedge portfolio. ",

    "abstract": "Neural network compression has been an increasingly important subject, due to its practical implications in terms of reducing the computational requirements and its theoretical implications, as there is an explicit connection between compressibility and the generalization error. Recent studies have shown that the choice of the hyperparameters of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can have an effect on the compressibility of the learned parameter vector. Even though these results have shed some light on the role of the training dynamics over compressibility, they relied on unverifiable assumptions and the resulting theory does not provide a practical guideline due to its implicitness. In this study, we propose a simple modification for SGD, such that the outputs of the algorithm will be provably compressible without making any nontrivial assumptions. We consider a one-hidden-layer neural network trained with SGD and we inject additive heavy-tailed noise to the iterates at each iteration. We then show that, for any compression rate, there exists a level of overparametrization (i.e., the number of hidden units), such that the output of the algorithm will be compressible with high probability. To achieve this result, we make two main technical contributions: (i) we build on a recent study on stochastic analysis and prove a 'propagation of chaos' result with improved rates for a class of heavy-tailed stochastic differential equations, and (ii) we derive strong-error estimates for their Euler discretization. We finally illustrate our approach on experiments, where the results suggest that the proposed approach achieves compressibility with a slight compromise from the training and test error. ",

    "abstract": "Objective: Seizure prediction is of great importance to improve the life of patients. The focal point is to distinguish preictal states from interictal ones. With the development of machine learning, seizure prediction methods have achieved significant progress. However, the severe imbalance problem between preictal and interictal data still poses a great challenge, restricting the performance of classifiers. Data augmentation is an intuitive way to solve this problem. Existing data augmentation methods generate samples by overlapping or recombining data. The distribution of generated samples is limited by original data, because such transformations cannot fully explore the feature space and offer new information. As the epileptic EEG representation varies among seizures, these generated samples cannot provide enough diversity to achieve high performance on a new seizure. As a consequence, we propose a novel data augmentation method with diffusion model called DiffEEG. Methods: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that consist of two processes. Specifically, in the diffusion process, the model adds noise to the input EEG sample step by step and converts the noisy sample into output random noise, exploring the distribution of data by minimizing the loss between the output and the noise added. In the denoised process, the model samples the synthetic data by removing the noise gradually, diffusing the data distribution to outward areas and narrowing the distance between different clusters. Results: We compared DiffEEG with existing methods, and integrated them into three representative classifiers. The experiments indicate that DiffEEG could further improve the performance and shows superiority to existing methods. Conclusion: This paper proposes a novel and effective method to solve the imbalanced problem and demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of our method. ",

However, this approach results in the information from all the sources being contained in a single ordered vector, which is not optimal for permutation-invariant problems such as multi-source tracking. In this paper, we present a new recurrent architecture that uses unordered sets to represent both its input and its state and that is invariant to the permutations of the input set and equivariant to the permutations of the state set. Hence, the information of every sound source is represented in an individual embedding and the new estimates are assigned to the tracked trajectories regardless of their order. ",

As the interior of exoplanets is inaccessible to observations, an inverse problem must be solved, where numerical structure models need to conform to observable parameters such as mass and radius. This is a highly degenerate problem whose solution often relies on computationally-expensive and time-consuming inference methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We present ExoMDN, a machine-learning model for the interior characterization of exoplanets based on Mixture Density Networks (MDN). The model is trained on a large dataset of more than 5.6 million synthetic planets below 25 Earth masses consisting of an iron core, a silicate mantle, a water and high-pressure ice layer, and a H/He atmosphere. We employ log-ratio transformations to convert the interior structure data into a form that the MDN can easily handle. Given mass, radius, and equilibrium temperature, we show that ExoMDN can deliver a full posterior distribution of mass fractions and thicknesses of each planetary layer in under a second on a standard Intel i5 CPU. Observational uncertainties can be easily accounted for through repeated predictions from within the uncertainties. We use ExoMDN to characterize the interior of 22 confirmed exoplanets with mass and radius uncertainties below 10% and 5% respectively, including the well studied GJ 1214 b, GJ 486 b, and the TRAPPIST-1 planets. We discuss the inclusion of the fluid Love number $k_2$ as an additional (potential) observable, showing how it can significantly reduce the degeneracy of interior structures. Utilizing the fast predictions of ExoMDN, we show that measuring $k_2$ with an accuracy of 10% can constrain the thickness of core and mantle of an Earth analog to $\\approx13\\%$ of the true values.

Various variance reduction techniques have demonstrated their superior performance in accelerating simulation processes. Nevertheless, they often use a single input model and further assume that the input model is exactly known and fixed. We consider more general cases in which it is necessary to assess a simulation's response to a variety of input models, such as when evaluating the reliability of wind turbines under nonstationary wind conditions or the operation of a service system when the distribution of customer inter-arrival time is heterogeneous at different times. Moreover, the estimation variance may be considerably impacted by uncertainty in input models. To address such nonstationary and uncertain input models, we offer a distributionally robust (DR) stratified sampling approach with the goal of minimizing the maximum of worst-case estimator variances among plausible but uncertain input models. Specifically, we devise a bi-level optimization framework for formulating DR stochastic problems with different ambiguity set designs, based on the $L_2$-norm, 1-Wasserstein distance, parametric family of distributions, and distribution moments. In order to cope with the non-convexity of objective function, we present a solution approach that uses Bayesian optimization.

Prompted by MolCAP, even basic graph neural networks are capable of achieving surprising performance that outperforms previous models, indicating the promising prospect of applying reactivity information for MRL. In addition, manual designed molecular templets are potential to uncover the dataset bias. All in all, we expect our MolCAP to gain more chemical meaningful insights for the entire process of drug discovery. ",

    "title": "Exploiting the Brain's Network Structure for Automatic Identification of  ADHD Subjects",
    "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioral problem affecting children. In this work, we investigate the automatic classification of ADHD subjects using the resting state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) sequences of the brain. We show that the brain can be modeled as a functional network, and certain properties of the networks differ in ADHD subjects from control subjects. We compute the pairwise correlation of brain voxels' activity over the time frame of the experimental protocol which helps to model the function of a brain as a network. Different network features are computed for each of the voxels constructing the network. The concatenation of the network features of all the voxels in a brain serves as the feature vector. Feature vectors from a set of subjects are then used to train a PCA-LDA (principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis) based classifier. We hypothesized that ADHD-related differences lie in some specific regions of the brain and using features only from those regions is sufficient to discriminate ADHD and control subjects. We propose a method to create a brain mask that includes the useful regions only and demonstrate that using the feature from the masked regions improves classification accuracy on the test data set. We train our classifier with 776 subjects and test on 171 subjects provided by The Neuro Bureau for the ADHD-200 challenge. We demonstrate the utility of graph-motif features, specifically the maps that represent the frequency of participation of voxels in network cycles of length 3. The best classification performance (69.59%) is achieved using 3-cycle map features with masking. Our proposed approach holds promise in being able to diagnose and understand the disorder. ",

    "title": "Class-Conditional Conformal Prediction With Many Classes",
    "abstract": "Standard conformal prediction methods provide a marginal coverage guarantee, which means that for a random test point, the conformal prediction set contains the true label with a user-chosen probability. In many classification problems, we would like to obtain a stronger guarantee -- that for test points of a specific class, the prediction set contains the true label with the same user-chosen probability. Existing conformal prediction methods do not work well when there is a limited amount of labeled data per class, as is often the case in real applications where the number of classes is large. We propose a method called clustered conformal prediction, which clusters together classes that have \"similar\" conformal scores and then performs conformal prediction at the cluster level. Based on empirical evaluation across four image data sets with many (up to 1000) classes, we find that clustered conformal typically outperforms existing methods in terms of class-conditional coverage and set size metrics.
