    "abstract": "The use of third-party packages is becoming increasingly popular and has led to the emergence of large software package ecosystems with a maze of inter-dependencies. Since the reliance on these ecosystems enables developers to reduce development effort and increase productivity, it has attracted the interest of researchers: understanding the infrastructure and dynamics of package ecosystems has given rise to approaches for better code reuse, automated updates, and the avoidance of vulnerabilities, to name a few examples. But the reality of these ecosystems also poses challenges to software engineering researchers, such as: How do we obtain the complete network of dependencies along with the corresponding versioning information? What are the boundaries of these package ecosystems? How do we consistently detect dependencies that are declared but not used? How do we consistently identify developers within a package ecosystem? How much of the ecosystem do we need to understand to analyse a single component? How well do our approaches generalise across different programming languages and package ecosystems? In this chapter, we review promises and perils of mining the rich data related to software package ecosystems available to software engineering researchers. ",

    "abstract": "With the continuous maturation and expansion of neural network technology, deep neural networks have been widely utilized as the fundamental building blocks of deep learning in a variety of applications, including speech recognition, machine translation, image processing, and the creation of recommendation systems. Therefore, many real-world complex problems can be solved by the deep learning techniques. As is known, traditional news recommendation systems mostly employ techniques based on collaborative filtering and deep learning, but the performance of these algorithms is constrained by the sparsity of the data and the scalability of the approaches. In this paper, we propose a recommendation model using granular neural network model to recommend news to appropriate channels by analyzing the properties of news. Specifically, a specified neural network serves as the foundation for the granular neural network that the model is considered to be build. Different information granularities are attributed to various types of news material, and different information granularities are released between networks in various ways. When processing data, granular output is created, which is compared to the interval values pre-set on various platforms and used to quantify the analysis's effectiveness. The analysis results could help the media to match the proper news in depth, maximize the public attention of the news and the utilization of media resources. ",

    "abstract": "Patch-based relaxation refers to a family of methods for solving linear systems which partitions the matrix into smaller pieces often corresponding to groups of adjacent degrees of freedom residing within patches of the computational domain. The two most common families of patch-based methods are block-Jacobi and Schwarz methods, where the former typically corresponds to non-overlapping domains and the later implies some overlap. We focus on cases where each patch consists of the degrees of freedom within a finite element method mesh cell. Patch methods often capture complex local physics much more effectively than simpler point-smoothers such as Jacobi; however, forming, inverting, and applying each patch can be prohibitively expensive in terms of both storage and computation time. To this end, we propose several approaches for performing analysis on these patches and constructing a reduced representation. The compression techniques rely on either matrix norm comparisons or unsupervised learning via a clustering approach. We illustrate how it is frequently possible to retain/factor less than 5% of all patches and still develop a method that converges with the same number of iterations or slightly more than when all patches are stored/factored.

    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction aims to predict the probability that the user will click an item, which has been one of the key tasks in online recommender and advertising systems. In such systems, rich user behavior (viz. long- and short-term) has been proved to be of great value in capturing user interests. Both industry and academy have paid much attention to this topic and propose different approaches to modeling with long-term and short-term user behavior data. But there are still some unresolved issues. More specially, (1) rule and truncation based methods to extract information from long-term behavior are easy to cause information loss, and (2) single feedback behavior regardless of scenario to extract information from short-term behavior lead to information confusion and noise. To fill this gap, we propose a Graph based Long-term and Short-term interest Model, termed GLSM. It consists of a multi-interest graph structure for capturing long-term user behavior, a multi-scenario heterogeneous sequence model for modeling short-term information, then an adaptive fusion mechanism to fused information from long-term and short-term behaviors. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets, GLSM achieved SOTA score on offline metrics. At the same time, the GLSM algorithm has been deployed in our industrial application, bringing 4.9% CTR and 4.3% GMV lift, which is significant to the business. ",

Because most recommendation methods assume that all data are assigned a user ID, they cannot be applied to the data without user IDs. Recently, session-based recommendation (SBR) based on session information, which is short-term behavioral information of users, has been studied. A general SBR uses only information about the item of interest to make a recommendation (e.g., item ID for an EC site). Particularly in the case of EC sites, the data recorded include the name of the item being purchased, the price of the item, the category hierarchy, and the gender and region of the user. In this study, we define a pseudo--session for the purchase history data of an EC site without user IDs and session IDs. Finally, we propose an SBR with a co-guided heterogeneous hypergraph and globalgraph network plus, called CoHHGN+. The results show that our CoHHGN+ can recommend items with higher performance than other methods. ",

    "abstract": "Negative sampling plays a crucial role in training successful sequential recommendation models. Instead of merely employing random negative sample selection, numerous strategies have been proposed to mine informative negative samples to enhance training and performance. However, few of these approaches utilize structural information. In this work, we observe that as training progresses, the distributions of node-pair similarities in different groups with varying degrees of neighborhood overlap change significantly, suggesting that item pairs in distinct groups may possess different negative relationships. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Graph-based Negative sampling approach based on Neighborhood Overlap (GNNO) to exploit structural information hidden in user behaviors for negative mining. GNNO first constructs a global weighted item transition graph using training sequences. Subsequently, it mines hard negative samples based on the degree of overlap with the target item on the graph. Furthermore, GNNO employs curriculum learning to control the hardness of negative samples, progressing from easy to difficult. Extensive experiments on three Amazon benchmarks demonstrate GNNO's effectiveness in consistently enhancing the performance of various state-of-the-art models and surpassing existing negative sampling strategies.

Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) pricing mechanism is used in many modern power markets, where the traditional approach utilizes optimal power flow (OPF) solvers. However, for large electricity grids this process becomes prohibitively time-consuming and computationally intensive. Machine learning solutions could provide an efficient tool for LMP prediction, especially in energy markets with intermittent sources like renewable energy. The study evaluates the performance of popular machine learning and deep learning models in predicting LMP on multiple electricity grids. The accuracy and robustness of these models in predicting LMP is assessed considering multiple scenarios. The results show that machine learning models can predict LMP 4-5 orders of magnitude faster than traditional OPF solvers with 5-6\\% error rate, highlighting the potential of machine learning models in LMP prediction for large-scale power models with the help of hardware solutions like multi-core CPUs and GPUs in modern HPC clusters.

When the class values are ordinal, classifiers that take this into account can perform better than nominal classifiers. Time Series Ordinal Classification (TSOC) is the field covering this gap, yet unexplored in the literature. There are a wide range of time series problems showing an ordered label structure, and TSC techniques that ignore the order relationship discard useful information. Hence, this paper presents a first benchmarking of TSOC methodologies, exploiting the ordering of the target labels to boost the performance of current TSC state-of-the-art. Both convolutional- and deep learning-based methodologies (among the best performing alternatives for nominal TSC) are adapted for TSOC. For the experiments, a selection of 18 ordinal problems from two well-known archives has been made. In this way, this paper contributes to the establishment of the state-of-the-art in TSOC. The results obtained by ordinal versions are found to be significantly better than current nominal TSC techniques in terms of ordinal performance metrics, outlining the importance of considering the ordering of the labels when dealing with this kind of problems.

Recognizing the predicate between subject and object pairs is imbalanced and multi-label in nature, ranging from ubiquitous interactions such as spatial relationships (\\eg \\emph{in front of}) to rare interactions such as \\emph{twisting}. In widely-used benchmarks such as Action Genome and VidOR, the imbalance ratio between the most and least frequent predicates reaches 3,218 and 3,408, respectively, surpassing even benchmarks specifically designed for long-tailed recognition. Due to the long-tailed distributions and label co-occurrences, recent state-of-the-art methods predominantly focus on the most frequently occurring predicate classes, ignoring those in the long tail. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of current approaches for scene graph generation in videos and identify a one-to-one correspondence between predicate frequency and recall performance. To make the step towards unbiased scene graph generation in videos, we introduce a multi-label meta-learning framework to deal with the biased predicate distribution. Our meta-learning framework learns a meta-weight network for each training sample over all possible label losses. We evaluate our approach on the Action Genome and VidOR benchmarks by building upon two current state-of-the-art methods for each benchmark.

Furthermore, standard deep learning models are often unsuitable for such datasets, as signals are typically sampled at different rates. To address these issues, we introduce MultiWave, a novel framework that enhances deep learning time series models by incorporating components that operate at the intrinsic frequencies of signals. MultiWave uses wavelets to decompose each signal into subsignals of varying frequencies and groups them into frequency bands. Each frequency band is handled by a different component of our model. A gating mechanism combines the output of the components to produce sparse models that use only specific signals at specific frequencies. Our experiments demonstrate that MultiWave accurately identifies informative frequency bands and improves the performance of various deep learning models, including LSTM, Transformer, and CNN-based models, for a wide range of applications. It attains top performance in stress and affect detection from wearables.

    "abstract": "Recently, machine learning systems have gained prominence in real-time, critical decision-making domains, such as autonomous driving and industrial automation. Their implementations should avoid overconfident predictions through uncertainty estimation. Bayesian Neural Networks (BayNNs) are principled methods for estimating predictive uncertainty. However, their computational costs and power consumption hinder their widespread deployment in edge AI. Utilizing Dropout as an approximation of the posterior distribution, binarizing the parameters of BayNNs, and further to that implementing them in spintronics-based computation-in-memory (CiM) hardware arrays provide can be a viable solution. However, designing hardware Dropout modules for convolutional neural network (CNN) topologies is challenging and expensive, as they may require numerous Dropout modules and need to use spatial information to drop certain elements. In this paper, we introduce MC-SpatialDropout, a spatial dropout-based approximate BayNNs with spintronics emerging devices. Our method utilizes the inherent stochasticity of spintronic devices for efficient implementation of the spatial dropout module compared to existing implementations. Furthermore, the number of dropout modules per network layer is reduced by a factor of $9\\times$ and energy consumption by a factor of $94.11\\times$, while still achieving comparable predictive performance and uncertainty estimates compared to related works.

However, existing task offloading methods often fall short of adequately modeling the dependency topology relationships between offloaded tasks, which limits their effectiveness in capturing the complex interdependencies of task features. To address this limitation, we propose a task offloading mechanism based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Our modeling approach takes into account factors such as task characteristics, network conditions, and available resources at the edge, and embeds these captured features into the graph structure. By utilizing GNNs, our mechanism can capture and analyze the intricate relationships between task features, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying dependency topology. Through extensive evaluations in heterogeneous networks, our proposed algorithm improves 18.6\\%-53.8\\% over greedy and approximate algorithms in optimizing system throughput and resource utilization.

Since certain anomalies cannot be detected by analyzing temporal or spatial information alone, the interaction between two types of information is considered crucial for VAD. However, current dual-stream architectures either limit interaction between the two types of information to the bottleneck of autoencoder or incorporate background pixels irrelevant to anomalies into the interaction. To this end, we propose a multi-scale spatial-temporal interaction network (MSTI-Net) for VAD. First, to pay particular attention to objects and reconcile the significant semantic differences between the two information, we propose an attention-based spatial-temporal fusion module (ASTM) as a substitute for the conventional direct fusion. Furthermore, we inject multi ASTM-based connections between the appearance and motion pathways of a dual stream network to facilitate spatial-temporal interaction at all possible scales. Finally, the regular information learned from multiple scales is recorded in memory to enhance the differentiation between anomalies and normal events during the testing phase. Solid experimental results on three standard datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieve AUCs of 96.8% for UCSD Ped2, 87.6% for CUHK Avenue, and 73.9% for the ShanghaiTech dataset.

For this purpose, amortized variational inference (AVI) has been used for directly solving the inverse problem of BSS with full-rank spatial covariance analysis (FCA). Although this unsupervised technique called neural FCA is in principle free from the domain mismatch problem, it is computationally demanding due to the full rankness of the spatial model in exchange for robustness against relatively short reverberations. To reduce the model complexity without sacrificing performance, we propose neural FastFCA based on the jointly-diagonalizable yet full-rank spatial model. Our neural separation model introduced for AVI alternately performs neural network blocks and single steps of an efficient iterative algorithm called iterative source steering. This alternating architecture enables the separation model to quickly separate the mixture spectrogram by leveraging both the deep neural network and the multichannel optimization algorithm. The training objective with AVI is derived to maximize the marginalized likelihood of the observed mixtures. The experiment using mixture signals of two to four sound sources shows that neural FastFCA outperforms conventional BSS methods and reduces the computational time to about 2% of that for the neural FCA.

Nevertheless, existing CKGs are typically oriented to English, limiting the research in non-English languages. Meanwhile, the emergence of foundation models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 has shown promising intelligence with the help of reinforcement learning from human feedback. Under the background, in this paper, we utilize foundation models to construct a Chinese CKG, named Snowman. Specifically, we distill different types of commonsense head items from ChatGPT, and continue to use it to collect tail items with respect to the head items and pre-defined relations. Based on the preliminary analysis, we find the negative commonsense knowledge distilled by ChatGPT achieves lower human acceptance compared to other knowledge. Therefore, we design a simple yet effective self-instruct filtering strategy to filter out invalid negative commonsense. Overall, the constructed Snowman covers more than ten million Chinese commonsense triples, making it the largest Chinese CKG. Moreover, human studies show the acceptance of Snowman achieves 90.6\\%, indicating the high-quality triples distilled by the cutting-edge foundation model. We also conduct experiments on commonsense knowledge models to show the usability and effectiveness of our Snowman. ",

However, the inherent suboptimal nature of node connections, resulting from the complex and contingent formation process of graphs, presents significant challenges in modeling them effectively. To tackle this issue, Graph Structure Learning (GSL), a family of data-centric learning approaches, has garnered substantial attention in recent years. The core concept behind GSL is to jointly optimize the graph structure and the corresponding GNN models. Despite the proposal of numerous GSL methods, the progress in this field remains unclear due to inconsistent experimental protocols, including variations in datasets, data processing techniques, and splitting strategies. In this paper, we introduce OpenGSL, the first comprehensive benchmark for GSL, aimed at addressing this gap. OpenGSL enables a fair comparison among state-of-the-art GSL methods by evaluating them across various popular datasets using uniform data processing and splitting strategies. Through extensive experiments, we observe that existing GSL methods do not consistently outperform vanilla GNN counterparts. However, we do observe that the learned graph structure demonstrates a strong generalization ability across different GNN backbones, despite its high computational and space requirements. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid and equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in the field of GSL.

Those are associated with quadratic relationships for the component-wise product in the dual of the code used in the cryptosystem. Depending on the characteristic of the code field, this space of matrices consists only of symmetric matrices or skew-symmetric matrices. This matrix space is shown to contain unusually low-rank matrices (rank $2$ or $3$ depending on the characteristic) which reveal the secret polynomial structure of the code. Finding such matrices can then be used to recover the secret key of the scheme. We devise a dedicated approach in characteristic $2$ consisting in using a Gr\\\"obner basis modeling that a skew-symmetric matrix is of rank $2$. This allows to analyze the complexity of solving the corresponding algebraic system with Gr\\\"obner bases techniques. This computation behaves differently when applied to the skew-symmetric matrix space associated with a random code rather than with a Goppa or an alternant code. This gives a distinguisher of the latter code family. We give a bound on its complexity which turns out to interpolate nicely between polynomial and exponential depending on the code parameters. A distinguisher for alternant/Goppa codes was already known [FGO+11]. It is of polynomial complexity but works only in a narrow parameter regime. This new distinguisher is also polynomial for the parameter regime necessary for [FGO+11] but contrarily to the previous one is able to operate for virtually all code parameters relevant to cryptography. Moreover, we use this matrix space to find a polynomial time attack of the McEliece cryptosystem provided that the Goppa code is distinguishable by the method of [FGO+11] and its degree is less than $q-1$, where $q$ is the alphabet size of the code.

To address this problem, we employ the class-specific mutual information to evaluate the causal information carried by each state of the class attribute, and theoretically analyze the unique relationship between each state and the causal features. Based on this, a Fair Causal Feature Selection algorithm (FairCFS) is proposed to fairly identifies the causal features for each state of the class variable.

In recent years, multi-hop multi-modal knowledge graph reasoning (MMKGR) based on reinforcement learning (RL) has received extensive attention because it addresses the intrinsic incompleteness of MKG in an interpretable manner. However, its performance is limited by empirically designed rewards and sparse relations. In addition, this method has been designed for the transductive setting where test entities have been seen during training, and it works poorly in the inductive setting where test entities do not appear in the training set. To overcome these issues, we propose TMR (Topology-aware Multi-hop Reasoning), which can conduct MKG reasoning under inductive and transductive settings. Specifically, TMR mainly consists of two components. (1) The topology-aware inductive representation captures information from the directed relations of unseen entities, and aggregates query-related topology features in an attentive manner to generate the fine-grained entity-independent features. (2) After completing multi-modal feature fusion, the relation-augment adaptive RL conducts multi-hop reasoning by eliminating manual rewards and dynamically adding actions. Finally, we construct new MKG datasets with different scales for inductive reasoning evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that TMP outperforms state-of-the-art MKGR methods under both inductive and transductive settings. ",

The former adopts the fast Fourier convolutions to enlarge the receptive field, such that the missing areas (occlusion) with complex geometric structures are filled by the inpainter. The latter employs the stacked Fourier transform inception module to learn the temporal evolution by group convolutions and the spatial movement by channel-wise Fourier convolutions, which captures both the local and the global spatiotemporal features. This encourages generating more realistic and high-quality future frames. To optimize the model, the recovery loss is imposed to the objective, \\ie, minimizing the mean square error between the ground-truth frame and the recovery frame. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results on five benchmarks, including Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ, Human3.6M, Caltech Pedestrian, and KTH, have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approach.

    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection is critical for a wide range of applications. It aims to identify deviant samples from the normal sample distribution in time series. The most fundamental challenge for this task is to learn a representation map that enables effective discrimination of anomalies. Reconstruction-based methods still dominate, but the representation learning with anomalies might hurt the performance with its large abnormal loss. On the other hand, contrastive learning aims to find a representation that can clearly distinguish any instance from the others, which can bring a more natural and promising representation for time series anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose DCdetector, a multi-scale dual attention contrastive representation learning model. DCdetector utilizes a novel dual attention asymmetric design to create the permutated environment and pure contrastive loss to guide the learning process, thus learning a permutation invariant representation with superior discrimination abilities. Extensive experiments show that DCdetector achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple time series anomaly detection benchmark datasets.

Despite its advantages, the distributed nature of FedGNN introduces additional vulnerabilities, particularly backdoor attacks stemming from malicious participants. Although graph backdoor attacks have been explored, the compounded complexity introduced by the combination of GNNs and federated learning has hindered a comprehensive understanding of these attacks, as existing research lacks extensive benchmark coverage and in-depth analysis of critical factors. To address these limitations, we propose Bkd-FedGNN, a benchmark for backdoor attacks on FedGNN. Specifically, Bkd-FedGNN decomposes the graph backdoor attack into trigger generation and injection steps, and extending the attack to the node-level federated setting, resulting in a unified framework that covers both node-level and graph-level classification tasks. Moreover, we thoroughly investigate the impact of multiple critical factors in backdoor attacks on FedGNN. These factors are categorized into global-level and local-level factors, including data distribution, the number of malicious attackers, attack time, overlapping rate, trigger size, trigger type, trigger position, and poisoning rate. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on 13 benchmark datasets and 13 critical factors, comprising 1,725 experimental configurations for node-level and graph-level tasks from six domains. These experiments encompass over 8,000 individual tests, allowing us to provide a thorough evaluation and insightful observations that advance our understanding of backdoor attacks on FedGNN.The Bkd-FedGNN benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/BkdFedGCN.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation plays an important role in widespread applications such as autonomous driving and robotic sensing. Traditional methods mostly use RGB images which are heavily affected by lighting conditions, \\eg, darkness. Recent studies show thermal images are robust to the night scenario as a compensating modality for segmentation. However, existing works either simply fuse RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) images or adopt the encoder with the same structure for both the RGB stream and the thermal stream, which neglects the modality difference in segmentation under varying lighting conditions. Therefore, this work proposes a Residual Spatial Fusion Network (RSFNet) for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Specifically, we employ an asymmetric encoder to learn the compensating features of the RGB and the thermal images. To effectively fuse the dual-modality features, we generate the pseudo-labels by saliency detection to supervise the feature learning, and develop the Residual Spatial Fusion (RSF) module with structural re-parameterization to learn more promising features by spatially fusing the cross-modality features. RSF employs a hierarchical feature fusion to aggregate multi-level features, and applies the spatial weights with the residual connection to adaptively control the multi-spectral feature fusion by the confidence gate. Extensive experiments were carried out on two benchmarks, \\ie, MFNet database and PST900 database. The results have shown the state-of-the-art segmentation performance of our method, which achieves a good balance between accuracy and speed. ",

    "abstract": "Logical query answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a fundamental yet complex task. A promising approach to achieve this is to embed queries and entities jointly into the same embedding space. Research along this line suggests that using multi-modal distribution to represent answer entities is more suitable than uni-modal distribution, as a single query may contain multiple disjoint answer subsets due to the compositional nature of multi-hop queries and the varying latent semantics of relations. However, existing methods based on multi-modal distribution roughly represent each subset without capturing its accurate cardinality, or even degenerate into uni-modal distribution learning during the reasoning process due to the lack of an effective similarity measure. To better model queries with diversified answers, we propose Query2GMM for answering logical queries over knowledge graphs. In Query2GMM, we present the GMM embedding to represent each query using a univariate Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Each subset of a query is encoded by its cardinality, semantic center and dispersion degree, allowing for precise representation of multiple subsets. Then we design specific neural networks for each operator to handle the inherent complexity that comes with multi-modal distribution while alleviating the cascading errors. Last, we define a new similarity measure to assess the relationships between an entity and a query's multi-answer subsets, enabling effective multi-modal distribution learning for reasoning. Comprehensive experimental results show that Query2GMM outperforms the best competitor by an absolute average of $5.5\\%$.

To simplify OD application process, we developed Ladder - a software that provides users with a friendly graphic user interface (GUI) that allows for efficient labelling of training datasets, training OD models, and deploying the trained model.

We used Ladder to develop a deep learning model to access wheat stripe rust in RGB (red, green, blue) images taken by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Ladder employs OD to directly evaluate different severity levels of wheat stripe rust in field images, eliminating the need for photo stitching process for UAVs-based images. The accuracy for low, medium and high severity scores were 72%, 50% and 80%, respectively. This case demonstrates how Ladder empowers OD in precision agriculture and crop breeding. ",

    "abstract": "Cyber attacks deceive machines into believing something that does not exist in the first place. However, there are some to which even humans fall prey. One such famous attack that attackers have used over the years to exploit the vulnerability of vision is known to be a Homoglyph attack. It employs a primary yet effective mechanism to create illegitimate domains that are hard to differentiate from legit ones. Moreover, as the difference is pretty indistinguishable for a user to notice, they cannot stop themselves from clicking on these homoglyph domain names. In many cases, that results in either information theft or malware attack on their systems. Existing approaches use simple, string-based comparison techniques applied in primary language-based tasks. Although they are impactful to some extent, they usually fail because they are not robust to different types of homoglyphs and are computationally not feasible because of their time requirement proportional to the string length. Similarly, neural network-based approaches are employed to determine real domain strings from fake ones. Nevertheless, the problem with both methods is that they require paired sequences of real and fake domain strings to work with, which is often not the case in the real world, as the attacker only sends the illegitimate or homoglyph domain to the vulnerable user. Therefore, existing approaches are not suitable for practical scenarios in the real world. In our work, we created GlyphNet, an image dataset that contains 4M domains, both real and homoglyphs. Additionally, we introduce a baseline method for a homoglyph attack detection system using an attention-based convolutional Neural Network. We show that our model can reach state-of-the-art accuracy in detecting homoglyph attacks with a 0.93 AUC on our dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Our paper focuses on making use of deep neural network models to accurately predict the range of human emotions experienced during watching movies. In this certain setup, there exist three clear-cut input modalities that considerably influence the experienced emotions: visual cues derived from RGB video frames, auditory components encompassing sounds, speech, and music, and linguistic elements encompassing actors' dialogues. Emotions are commonly described using a two-factor model including valence (ranging from happy to sad) and arousal (indicating the intensity of the emotion). In this regard, a Plethora of works have presented a multitude of models aiming to predict valence and arousal from video content. However, non of these models contain all three modalities, with language being consistently eliminated across all of them. In this study, we comprehensively combine all modalities and conduct an analysis to ascertain the importance of each in predicting valence and arousal. Making use of pre-trained neural networks, we represent each input modality in our study. In order to process visual input, we employ pre-trained convolutional neural networks to recognize scenes[1], objects[2], and actions[3,4]. For audio processing, we utilize a specialized neural network designed for handling sound-related tasks, namely SoundNet[5]. Finally, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models are used to extract linguistic features[6] in our analysis. We report results on the COGNIMUSE dataset[7], where our proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that language significantly influences the experienced arousal, while sound emerges as the primary determinant for predicting valence. In contrast, the visual modality exhibits the least impact among all modalities in predicting emotions. ",

Our ``Batched Order By Attachment'' (BOBA) algorithm is linear in the number of edges in terms of reads and linear in the number of vertices for writes through to main memory. It is highly parallelizable on GPUs\\@. We show that, compared to a randomized baseline, the ordering produced gives improved locality of reference in sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) as well as other graph algorithms. Moreover, it can substantially speed up the conversion from a COO representation to the compressed format CSR, a very common workflow. Thus, it can give \\emph{end-to-end} speedups even in SpMV\\@. Unlike other lightweight approaches, this reordering does not rely on explicitly knowing the degrees of the vertices, and indeed its runtime is comparable to that of computing degrees. Instead, it uses the structure and edge distribution inherent in the input edge list, making it a candidate for default use in a pragmatic graph creation pipeline. This algorithm is suitable for road-type networks as well as scale-free. It improves cache locality on both CPUs and GPUs, achieving hit rates similar to the heavyweight techniques (e.g., for SpMV, 7--52\\% and 11--67\\% in the L1 and L2 caches, respectively). Compared to randomly labeled graphs, BOBA-reordered graphs achieve end-to-end speedups of up to 3.45. The reordering time is approximately one order of magnitude faster than existing lightweight techniques and up to 2.5 orders of magnitude faster than heavyweight techniques. ",

False data injection attack (FDIA) is one of the classes of those attacks that target the smart measurement devices by injecting malicious data. The employment of machine learning techniques in the detection and localization of FDIA is proven to provide effective results. Training of such models requires centralized processing of sensitive user data that may not be plausible in a practical scenario. By employing federated learning for the detection of FDIA attacks, it is possible to train a model for the detection and localization of the attacks while preserving the privacy of sensitive user data. However, federated learning introduces new problems such as the personalization of the detectors in each node. In this paper, we propose a federated learning-based scheme combined with a hybrid deep neural network architecture that exploits the local correlations between the connected power buses by employing graph neural networks as well as the temporal patterns in the data by using LSTM layers. The proposed mechanism offers flexible and efficient training of an FDIA detector in a distributed setup while preserving the privacy of the clients.

To gain insights about the model mechanism for interpretable graph learning, previous efforts focus on post-hoc local interpretation by extracting the data pattern that a pre-trained GNN model uses to make an individual prediction. However, recent works show that post-hoc methods are highly sensitive to model initialization and local interpretation can only explain the model prediction specific to a particular instance. In this work, we address these limitations by answering an important question that is not yet studied: how to provide global interpretation of the model training procedure? We formulate this problem as in-process global interpretation, which targets on distilling high-level and human-intelligible patterns that dominate the training procedure of GNNs. We further propose Graph Distribution Matching (GDM) to synthesize interpretive graphs by matching the distribution of the original and interpretive graphs in the feature space of the GNN as its training proceeds. These few interpretive graphs demonstrate the most informative patterns the model captures during training.

The complexity of thin-walled structures mainly comes from flexible geometries and the variation of thickness. On the one hand, the geometric complexity of thin-walled structures leads to the difficulty in automatically describing material distribution (e.g., reinforced ribs). On the other hand, thin-walled structures with different thicknesses require various hypotheses (e.g., Kirchhoff-Love shell theory and Reissner-Mindlin shell theory) to ensure the precision of structural responses. Whereas for cases that do not fit the shell hypothesis, the precision loss of response solutions is nonnegligible in the optimization process since the accumulation of errors will cause entirely different designs. Hence, the current article proposes a novel embedded solid component to tackle these challenges. The geometric constraints that make the components fit to the curved thin-walled structure are whereby satisfied. Compared with traditional strategies, the proposed method is free from the limit of shell assumptions of structural analysis and can achieve optimized designs with clear load transmission paths at the cost of few design variables and degrees of freedom for finite element analysis (FEA). Finally, we apply the proposed method to several representative examples to demonstrate its effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and potential to handle complex industrial structures. ",

Motivated by the recent intriguing phenomenon of model soups, which suggest that fine-tuned weights of multiple large-language pre-trained models can be merged to a better minima, we argue to exploit the fundamentals of model soups to mitigate the aforementioned issues of memory bottleneck and trainability during GNNs scaling. More specifically, we propose not to deepen or widen current GNNs, but instead present a data-centric perspective of model soups tailored for GNNs, i.e., to build powerful GNNs by dividing giant graph data to build independently and parallelly trained multiple comparatively weaker GNNs without any intermediate communication, and combining their strength using a greedy interpolation soup procedure to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we provide a wide variety of model soup preparation techniques by leveraging state-of-the-art graph sampling and graph partitioning approaches that can handle large graph data structures. Our extensive experiments across many real-world small and large graphs, illustrate the effectiveness of our approach and point towards a promising orthogonal direction for GNN scaling.

Recent works have shown that implicit neural representations of 3D scenes can produce remarkable results, but they are limited to small scenes and lack real-time performance. To address these limitations, we propose a real-time scalable mapping method using robot-centric implicit representation. We train implicit features with a multi-resolution local map and decode them as signed distance values through a shallow neural network. We maintain the learned features in a scalable manner using a global map that consists of a hash table and a submap set. We exploit the characteristics of the local map to achieve highly efficient training and mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem in incremental implicit mapping.

To this end, we present Semantic-Geometric Representation (SGR), a universal perception module for robotics that leverages the rich semantic information of large-scale pre-trained 2D models and inherits the merits of 3D spatial reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that SGR empowers the agent to successfully complete a diverse range of simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods significantly in both single-task and multi-task settings.

However, achieving path-finding in non-convex complex environments without maps as well as enabling multiple robots to follow social rules for obstacle avoidance remains challenging problems. In this letter, we propose a socially aware robot mapless navigation algorithm, namely Safe Reinforcement Learning-Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (SRL-ORCA). This is a multi-agent safe reinforcement learning algorithm by using ORCA as an external knowledge to provide a safety guarantee. This algorithm further introduces traffic norms of human society to improve social comfort and achieve cooperative avoidance by following human social customs. The result of experiments shows that SRL-ORCA learns strategies to obey specific traffic rules. Compared to DRL, SRL-ORCA shows a significant improvement in navigation success rate in different complex scenarios mixed with the application of the same training network. SRL-ORCA is able to cope with non-convex obstacle environments without falling into local minimal regions and has a 14.1\\% improvement in path quality (i.e., the average time to target) compared to ORCA.

    "abstract": "User reporting is an essential component of content moderation on many online platforms -- in particular, on end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging platforms where platform operators cannot proactively inspect message contents. However, users' privacy concerns when considering reporting may impede the effectiveness of this strategy in regulating online harassment. In this paper, we conduct interviews with 16 users of E2EE platforms to understand users' mental models of how reporting works and their resultant privacy concerns and considerations surrounding reporting. We find that users expect platforms to store rich longitudinal reporting datasets, recognizing both their promise for better abuse mitigation and the privacy risk that platforms may exploit or fail to protect them. We also find that users have preconceptions about the respective capabilities and risks of moderators at the platform versus community level -- for instance, users trust platform moderators more to not abuse their power but think community moderators have more time to attend to reports. These considerations, along with perceived effectiveness of reporting and how to provide sufficient evidence while maintaining privacy, shape how users decide whether, to whom, and how much to report. We conclude with design implications for a more privacy-preserving reporting system on E2EE messaging platforms. ",

Motivated by the characteristics of neural networks, in which information is stored in weights on connections, we investigated how to design an Innately Forgetting-Free Network (IF2Net) for continual learning context. This study proposed a straightforward yet effective learning paradigm by ingeniously keeping the weights relative to each seen task untouched before and after learning a new task. We first presented the novel representation-level learning on task sequences with random weights. This technique refers to tweaking the drifted representations caused by randomization back to their separate task-optimal working states, but the involved weights are frozen and reused (opposite to well-known layer-wise updates of weights). Then, sequential decision-making without forgetting can be achieved by projecting the output weight updates into the parsimonious orthogonal space, making the adaptations not disturb old knowledge while maintaining model plasticity. IF2Net allows a single network to inherently learn unlimited mapping rules without telling task identities at test time by integrating the respective strengths of randomization and orthogonalization. We validated the effectiveness of our approach in the extensive theoretical analysis and empirical study. ",

We propose a balanced energy regularization loss that is simple but generally effective for a variety of tasks. Our balanced energy regularization loss utilizes class-wise different prior probabilities for auxiliary data to address the class imbalance in OOD data. The main concept is to regularize auxiliary samples from majority classes, more heavily than those from minority classes. Our approach performs better for OOD detection in semantic segmentation, long-tailed image classification, and image classification than the prior energy regularization loss.

Such an annotation approach requires a lot of manpower and is also time-consuming. MOS prediction model for automatic evaluation can significantly reduce labor cost. In previous works, it is difficult to accurately rank the quality of speech when the MOS scores are close. However, in practical applications, it is more important to correctly rank the quality of synthesis systems or sentences than simply predicting MOS scores. Meanwhile, as each annotator scores multiple audios during annotation, the score is probably a relative value based on the first or the first few speech scores given by the annotator. Motivated by the above two points, we propose a general framework for MOS prediction based on pair comparison (MOSPC), and we utilize C-Mixup algorithm to enhance the generalization performance of MOSPC. The experiments on BVCC and VCC2018 show that our framework outperforms the baselines on most of the correlation coefficient metrics, especially on the metric KTAU related to quality ranking. And our framework also surpasses the strong baseline in ranking accuracy on each fine-grained segment.

In particular, for the adaptation, the Bernoulli sampling is introduced to adjust substructures of base graph keys according to each input, which increases the expression capacity of the base dictionary tremendously. To make cross-graph measurement sensitive as well as stable, multi-sensitivity Wasserstein encoding is proposed to produce the embeddings by designing multi-scale attention on optimal transport. To optimize the framework, we introduce mutual information as the objective, which further deduces to variational inference of the adapted graph dictionary. We perform our SS-GDE on multiple datasets of graph classification, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority over the state-of-the-art methods. ",

These invariance properties not only enable accurate multi-agent forecasting fundamentally but also empower the encoder with the capability of streaming processing. Second, we propose a multi-agent DETR-like decoder, which facilitates joint multi-agent trajectory prediction by modeling agents' interactions at future time steps. For the first time, we show that a joint prediction model can outperform marginal prediction models even on the marginal metrics, which opens up new research opportunities in trajectory prediction.

Toward this issue, we propose to address the cross-domain few-shot learning problem where only extremely few samples are available in target domains. Under this realistic setting, we focus on the fast adaptation capability of meta-learners by proposing an effective dual adaptive representation alignment approach. In our approach, a prototypical feature alignment is first proposed to recalibrate support instances as prototypes and reproject these prototypes with a differentiable closed-form solution. Therefore feature spaces of learned knowledge can be adaptively transformed to query spaces by the cross-instance and cross-prototype relations. Besides the feature alignment, we further present a normalized distribution alignment module, which exploits prior statistics of query samples for solving the covariant shifts among the support and query samples. With these two modules, a progressive meta-learning framework is constructed to perform the fast adaptation with extremely few-shot samples while maintaining its generalization capabilities. Experimental evidence demonstrates our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on 4 CDFSL benchmarks and 4 fine-grained cross-domain benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "To address privacy concerns and reduce network latency, there has been a recent trend of compressing cumbersome recommendation models trained on the cloud and deploying compact recommender models to resource-limited devices for real-time recommendation. Existing solutions generally overlook device heterogeneity and user heterogeneity. They either require all devices to share the same compressed model or the devices with the same resource budget to share the same model. However, even users with the same devices may have different preferences. In addition, they assume the available resources (e.g., memory) for the recommender on a device are constant, which is not reflective of reality. In light of device and user heterogeneities as well as dynamic resource constraints, this paper proposes a Personalized Elastic Embedding Learning framework (PEEL) for on-device recommendation, which generates personalized embeddings for devices with various memory budgets in once-for-all manner, efficiently adapting to new or dynamic budgets, and effectively addressing user preference diversity by assigning personalized embeddings for different groups of users. Specifically, it pretrains using user-item interaction instances to generate the global embedding table and cluster users into groups. Then, it refines the embedding tables with local interaction instances within each group. Personalized elastic embedding is generated from the group-wise embedding blocks and their weights that indicate the contribution of each embedding block to the local recommendation performance. PEEL efficiently generates personalized elastic embeddings by selecting embedding blocks with the largest weights, making it adaptable to dynamic memory budgets. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets, and the results show that PEEL yields superior performance on devices with heterogeneous and dynamic memory budgets. ",

Recent semi-supervised GAD methods, which can effectively leverage the available labels as prior knowledge, have achieved superior performances than unsupervised methods. In practice, people usually need to identify anomalies on new (sub)graphs to secure their business, but they may lack labels to train an effective detection model. One natural idea is to directly adopt a trained GAD model to the new (sub)graph for testing. However, we find that existing semi-supervised GAD methods suffer from poor generalization issue, i.e., well-trained models could not perform well on an unseen area (i.e., not accessible in training) of the same graph. It may cause great troubles. In this paper, we base on the phenomenon and propose a general and novel research problem of generalized graph anomaly detection that aims to effectively identify anomalies on both the training-domain graph and unseen testing graph to eliminate potential dangers. Nevertheless, it is a challenging task since only limited labels are available, and the normal background may differ between training and testing data. Accordingly, we propose a data augmentation method named \\textit{AugAN} (\\uline{Aug}mentation for \\uline{A}nomaly and \\uline{N}ormal distributions) to enrich training data and boost the generalizability of GAD models.

In sharp contrast to ReLU which cuts off the negative neurons and suffers from the issue of ''dying ReLU'', LENI enjoys the capacity to reconstruct the dead neurons and reduce the information loss. Compared to improved ReLUs, LENI introduces a learnable approach to process the negative phase information more properly. In this way, LENI can enhance the model representational capacity significantly while maintaining the original advantages of ReLU. As a generic activation mechanism, LENI possesses the property of portability and can be easily utilized in any CNN models through simply replacing the activation layers with LENI block. Extensive experiments validate that LENI can improve the performance of various baseline models on various benchmark datasets by a clear margin (up to 1.24% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k) with negligible extra parameters. Further experiments show that LENI can act as a channel compensation mechanism, offering competitive or even better performance but with fewer learned parameters than baseline models. In addition, LENI introduces the asymmetry to the model structure which contributes to the enhancement of representational capacity. Through visualization experiments, we validate that LENI can retain more information and learn more representations. ",

    "abstract": "In the era of extensive intersection between art and Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as image generation and fiction co-creation, AI for music remains relatively nascent, particularly in music understanding. This is evident in the limited work on deep music representations, the scarcity of large-scale datasets, and the absence of a universal and community-driven benchmark. To address this issue, we introduce the Music Audio Representation Benchmark for universaL Evaluation, termed MARBLE. It aims to provide a benchmark for various Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks by defining a comprehensive taxonomy with four hierarchy levels, including acoustic, performance, score, and high-level description. We then establish a unified protocol based on 14 tasks on 8 public-available datasets, providing a fair and standard assessment of representations of all open-sourced pre-trained models developed on music recordings as baselines. Besides, MARBLE offers an easy-to-use, extendable, and reproducible suite for the community, with a clear statement on copyright issues on datasets. Results suggest recently proposed large-scale pre-trained musical language models perform the best in most tasks, with room for further improvement. The leaderboard and toolkit repository are published at https://marble-bm.shef.ac.uk to promote future music AI research. ",

    "abstract": "Academic literature does not give much guidance on how to build the best possible customer-facing summarization system from existing research components. Here we present analyses to inform the selection of a system backbone from popular models; we find that in both automatic and human evaluation, BART performs better than PEGASUS and T5. We also find that when applied cross-domain, summarizers exhibit considerably worse performance. At the same time, a system fine-tuned on heterogeneous domains performs well on all domains and will be most suitable for a broad-domain summarizer. Our work highlights the need for heterogeneous domain summarization benchmarks. We find considerable variation in system output that can be captured only with human evaluation and are thus unlikely to be reflected in standard leaderboards with only automatic evaluation. ",

The dominant methods for large scale DNN training are synchronous (e.g. All-Reduce), but these require waiting for all workers in each step. Thus, these methods are limited by the delays caused by straggling workers. Results: We study a typical scenario in which workers are straggling due to variability in compute time. We find an analytical relation between compute time properties and scalability limitations, caused by such straggling workers. With these findings, we propose a simple yet effective decentralized method to reduce the variation among workers and thus improve the robustness of synchronous training. This method can be integrated with the widely used All-Reduce. Our findings are validated on large-scale training tasks using 200 Gaudi Accelerators. ",

Failure to correct for the effect of this measurement error can lead to biased causal effect estimates. Previous research has not studied methods that address this issue from a causal viewpoint while allowing for complex nonlinear dependencies and without assuming access to side information. For such as scenario, this paper proposes a model that assumes a continuous treatment variable which is inaccurately measured. Building on existing results for measurement error models, we prove that our model's causal effect estimates are identifiable, even without knowledge of the measurement error variance or other side information. Our method relies on a deep latent variable model where Gaussian conditionals are parameterized by neural networks, and we develop an amortized importance-weighted variational objective for training the model. Empirical results demonstrate the method's good performance with unknown measurement error. More broadly, our work extends the range of applications where reliable causal inference can be conducted.

    "abstract": "Neural operators have proven to be a promising approach for modeling spatiotemporal systems in the physical sciences. However, training these models for large systems can be quite challenging as they incur significant computational and memory expense -- these systems are often forced to rely on autoregressive time-stepping of the neural network to predict future temporal states. While this is effective in managing costs, it can lead to uncontrolled error growth over time and eventual instability. We analyze the sources of this autoregressive error growth using prototypical neural operator models for physical systems and explore ways to mitigate it. We introduce architectural and application-specific improvements that allow for careful control of instability-inducing operations within these models without inflating the compute/memory expense. We present results on several scientific systems that include Navier-Stokes fluid flow, rotating shallow water, and a high-resolution global weather forecasting system. We demonstrate that applying our design principles to prototypical neural networks leads to significantly lower errors in long-range forecasts with 800\\% longer forecasts without qualitative signs of divergence compared to the original models for these systems.

However, solving PDEs remains still a challenge, as commonly used traditional numerical solvers often require high computational costs. As a result, data-driven methods leveraging machine learning (more particularly Deep Learning) algorithms have been increasingly proposed to learn models that can predict solutions to complex PDEs, such as those arising in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, these methods are known to suffer from poor generalization performance on out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, highlighting the need for more efficient approaches. To this end, we present a meta-learning approach to enhance the performance of learned models on OoD samples. Specifically, we set the airflow simulation in CFD over various airfoils as a meta-learning problem, where each set of examples defined on a single airfoil shape is treated as a separate task. Through the use of model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), we learn a meta-learner capable of adapting to new tasks, i.e., previously unseen airfoil shapes, using only a small amount of task-specific data. We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach for improving the OoD generalization performance of learned models while maintaining efficiency. ",

We present a case study with a simple system that enables mixed-turn chatbot interactions and we discuss the insights and preliminary guidelines obtained from initial tests. We examine ChatGPT's ability to pursue multiple interconnected learning objectives, adapt the educational activity to users' characteristics, such as culture, age, and level of education, and its ability to use diverse educational strategies and conversational styles. Although the results are encouraging, challenges are posed by the limited history maintained for the conversation and the highly structured form of responses by ChatGPT, as well as their variability, which can lead to an unexpected switch of the chatbot's role from a teacher to a therapist.

Discourse markers are natural representations of discourse in our daily language. One challenge is that the markers as well as pre-defined and human-labeled discourse relations can be ambiguous when describing the semantics between sentences. We believe that a better approach is to use a contextual-dependent distribution over the markers to express discourse information. In this work, we propose to learn a Distributed Marker Representation (DMR) by utilizing the (potentially) unlimited discourse marker data with a latent discourse sense, thereby bridging markers with sentence pairs. Such representations can be learned automatically from data without supervision, and in turn provide insights into the data itself. Experiments show the SOTA performance of our DMR on the implicit discourse relation recognition task and strong interpretability. Our method also offers a valuable tool to understand complex ambiguity and entanglement among discourse markers and manually defined discourse relations. ",

However, previous methods mostly learn features from the two views independently, which violates the clinical knowledge and ignores the importance of dual-view correlation. In this paper, we propose a dual-view correlation hybrid attention network (DCHA-Net) for robust holistic mammogram classification. Specifically, DCHA-Net is carefully designed to extract and reinvent deep features for the two views, and meanwhile to maximize the underlying correlations between them. A hybrid attention module, consisting of local relation and non-local attention blocks, is proposed to alleviate the spatial misalignment of the paired views in the correlation maximization. A dual-view correlation loss is introduced to maximize the feature similarity between corresponding strip-like regions with equal distance to the chest wall, motivated by the fact that their features represent the same breast tissues, and thus should be highly-correlated. Experimental results on two public datasets, i.e., INbreast and CBIS-DDSM, demonstrate that DCHA-Net can well preserve and maximize feature correlations across views, and thus outperforms the state-of-the-arts for classifying a whole mammogram as malignant or not.

Multi-behavior Recommendation (MBR) is a method that seeks to learn user preferences, represented as vector embeddings, from auxiliary information. By leveraging these preferences for target behavior recommendations, MBR addresses the sparsity problem and improves the accuracy of recommendations. In this paper, we propose MB-HGCN, a novel multi-behavior recommendation model that uses a hierarchical graph convolutional network to learn user and item embeddings from coarse-grained on the global level to fine-grained on the behavior-specific level. Our model learns global embeddings from a unified homogeneous graph constructed by the interactions of all behaviors, which are then used as initialized embeddings for behavior-specific embedding learning in each behavior graph. We also emphasize the distinct of the user and item behaviorspecific embeddings and design two simple-yet-effective strategies to aggregate the behavior-specific embeddings for users and items, respectively. Finally, we adopt multi-task learning for optimization. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the baselines, achieving a relative improvement of 73.93% and 74.21% for HR@10 and NDCG@10, respectively, on the Tmall datasets.

The ubiquitous spatial-temporal data noise and incompleteness in real-life scenarios pose challenges in generating high-quality region representations. To address this challenge, we propose a new spatial-temporal graph learning model (GraphST) for enabling effective self-supervised learning. Our proposed model is an adversarial contrastive learning paradigm that automates the distillation of crucial multi-view self-supervised information for robust spatial-temporal graph augmentation. We empower GraphST to adaptively identify hard samples for better self-supervision, enhancing the representation discrimination ability and robustness. In addition, we introduce a cross-view contrastive learning paradigm to model the inter-dependencies across view-specific region representations and preserve underlying relation heterogeneity.

    "abstract": "The success of reinforcement learning heavily relies on the function approximation of policy, value or models, where misspecification (a mismatch between the ground-truth and best function approximators) naturally occurs especially when the ground-truth is complex. As misspecification error does not vanish even with infinite number of samples, designing algorithms that are robust under misspecification is of paramount importance. Recently, it is shown that policy-based approaches can be robust even when the policy function approximation is under a large locally-bounded misspecification error, with which the function class may have $\\Omega(1)$ approximation error in certain states and actions but is only small on average under a policy-induced state-distribution; whereas it is only known that value-based approach can effectively learn under globally-bounded misspecification error, i.e., the approximation errors to value functions have a uniform upper bound on all state-actions. Yet it remains an open question whether similar robustness can be achieved with value-based approaches. In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively by showing that the algorithm, Least-Square-Value-Iteration [Jin et al, 2020], with carefully designed exploration bonus can achieve robustness under local misspecification error bound. In particular, we show that algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\sqrt{d^3KH^4} + dKH^2\\zeta \\right)$, where $d$ is the dimension of linear features, $H$ is the length of the episode, $K$ is the total number of episodes, and $\\zeta$ is the local bound of the misspecification error. Moreover, we show that the algorithm can achieve the same regret bound without knowing $\\zeta$ and can be used as robust policy evaluation oracle that can be applied to improve sample complexity in policy-based approaches.

In FrameFusion, we ''forward'' history frames to the current frame and apply weighted Non-Maximum-Suppression on dense bounding boxes to obtain a fused frame with merged boxes. To ''forward'' frames, we use vehicle motion models to estimate the future pose of the bounding boxes. However, the commonly used constant velocity model fails naturally on turning vehicles, so we explore two vehicle motion models to address this issue. On Waymo Open Dataset, our FrameFusion method consistently improves the performance of various 3D detectors by about $2$ vehicle level 2 APH with negligible latency and slightly enhances the performance of the temporal fusion method MPPNet.

We show that: (1) Deep time series forecasting with only fine-grained local feature maps of input sequence is feasible upon theoretical basis.

Typically, this analysis examines specific locations on road networks during set time periods to pinpoint areas with a higher concentration of accidents, known as black spots. By evaluating these problem areas, researchers can uncover the underlying causes and reasons for increased collision rates, such as road design, traffic volume, driver behavior, weather, and infrastructure. However, challenges in identifying black spots include limited data availability, data quality, and assessing contributing factors. Additionally, evolving road design, infrastructure, and vehicle safety technology can affect black spot analysis and determination. This study focused on traffic accidents in Greek road networks to recognize black spots, utilizing data from police and government-issued car crash reports.

    "abstract": "This work proposes a real-time anomaly detection scheme that leverages the multi-step ahead prediction capabilities of encoder-decoder (ED) deep learning models with recurrent units. Specifically, an encoder-decoder is used to model soft-failure evolution over a long future horizon (i.e., for several days ahead) by analyzing past quality-of-transmission (QoT) observations. This information is subsequently used for real-time anomaly detection (e.g., of attack incidents), as the knowledge of how the QoT is expected to evolve allows capturing unexpected network behavior. Specifically, for anomaly detection, a statistical hypothesis testing scheme is used, alleviating the limitations of supervised (SL) and unsupervised learning (UL) schemes, usually applied for this purpose. Indicatively, the proposed scheme eliminates the need for labeled anomalies, required when SL is applied, and the need for on-line analyzing entire datasets to identify abnormal instances (i.e., UL). Overall, it is shown that by utilizing QoT evolution information, the proposed approach can effectively detect abnormal deviations in real-time. Importantly, it is shown that the information concerning soft-failure evolution (i.e., QoT predictions) is essential to accurately detect anomalies. ",

The framework is based on an interpretation of BNNs as stochastic dynamical systems, which enables the use of Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms to bound the prediction range along the layers of the network. Specifically, the method uses bound propagation techniques and convex relaxations to derive a backward recursion procedure to over-approximate the prediction range of the BNN with piecewise affine functions. The algorithm is general and can handle both regression and classification tasks. On a set of experiments on various regression and classification tasks and BNN architectures, we show that BNN-DP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to four orders of magnitude in both tightness of the bounds and computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL), which aims to facilitate data collaboration across multiple organizations without exposing data privacy, encounters potential security risks. One serious threat is backdoor attacks, where an attacker injects a specific trigger into the training dataset to manipulate the model's prediction. Most existing FL backdoor attacks are based on horizontal federated learning (HFL), where the data owned by different parties have the same features. However, compared to HFL, backdoor attacks on vertical federated learning (VFL), where each party only holds a disjoint subset of features and the labels are only owned by one party, are rarely studied. The main challenge of this attack is to allow an attacker without access to the data labels, to perform an effective attack. To this end, we propose BadVFL, a novel and practical approach to inject backdoor triggers into victim models without label information. BadVFL mainly consists of two key steps. First, to address the challenge of attackers having no knowledge of labels, we introduce a SDD module that can trace data categories based on gradients. Second, we propose a SDP module that can improve the attack's effectiveness by enhancing the decision dependency between the trigger and attack target. Extensive experiments show that BadVFL supports diverse datasets and models, and achieves over 93% attack success rate with only 1% poisoning rate. ",

    "abstract": "Accurately perceiving instances and predicting their future motion are key tasks for autonomous vehicles, enabling them to navigate safely in complex urban traffic. While bird's-eye view (BEV) representations are commonplace in perception for autonomous driving, their potential in a motion prediction setting is less explored. Existing approaches for BEV instance prediction from surround cameras rely on a multi-task auto-regressive setup coupled with complex post-processing to predict future instances in a spatio-temporally consistent manner. In this paper, we depart from this paradigm and propose an efficient novel end-to-end framework named POWERBEV, which differs in several design choices aimed at reducing the inherent redundancy in previous methods. First, rather than predicting the future in an auto-regressive fashion, POWERBEV uses a parallel, multi-scale module built from lightweight 2D convolutional networks. Second, we show that segmentation and centripetal backward flow are sufficient for prediction, simplifying previous multi-task objectives by eliminating redundant output modalities. Building on this output representation, we propose a simple, flow warping-based post-processing approach which produces more stable instance associations across time. Through this lightweight yet powerful design, POWERBEV outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the NuScenes Dataset and poses an alternative paradigm for BEV instance prediction.

    "abstract": "Language models of code (LMs) work well when the surrounding code in the vicinity of generation provides sufficient context. This is not true when it becomes necessary to use types or functionality defined in another module or library, especially those not seen during training. LMs suffer from limited awareness of such global context and end up hallucinating, e.g., using types defined in other files incorrectly. Recent work tries to overcome this issue by retrieving global information to augment the local context. However, this bloats the prompt or requires architecture modifications and additional training. Integrated development environments (IDEs) assist developers by bringing the global context at their fingertips using static analysis. We extend this assistance, enjoyed by developers, to the LMs. We propose a notion of monitors that use static analysis in the background to guide the decoding. Unlike a priori retrieval, static analysis is invoked iteratively during the entire decoding process, providing the most relevant suggestions on demand. We demonstrate the usefulness of our proposal by monitoring for type-consistent use of identifiers whenever an LM generates code for object dereference. To evaluate our approach, we curate PragmaticCode, a dataset of open-source projects with their development environments. On models of varying parameter scale, we show that monitor-guided decoding consistently improves the ability of an LM to not only generate identifiers that match the ground truth but also improves compilation rates and agreement with ground truth. We find that LMs with fewer parameters, when guided with our monitor, can outperform larger LMs. With monitor-guided decoding, SantaCoder-1.1B achieves better compilation rate and next-identifier match than the much larger text-davinci-003 model.

Embeddings can have various aims like capturing the underlying graph topology and structure, node-to-node relationship, or other relevant information about the graph, its subgraphs or nodes themselves. A practical challenge with using embeddings is that there are many available variants to choose from. Selecting a small set of most promising embeddings from the long list of possible options for a given task is challenging and often requires domain expertise. Embeddings can be categorized into two main types: classical embeddings and structural embeddings. Classical embeddings focus on learning both local and global proximity of nodes, while structural embeddings learn information specifically about the local structure of nodes' neighbourhood. For classical node embeddings there exists a framework which helps data scientists to identify (in an unsupervised way) a few embeddings that are worth further investigation. Unfortunately, no such framework exists for structural embeddings. In this paper we propose a framework for unsupervised ranking of structural graph embeddings. The proposed framework, apart from assigning an aggregate quality score for a structural embedding, additionally gives a data scientist insights into properties of this embedding. It produces information which predefined node features the embedding learns, how well it learns them, and which dimensions in the embedded space represent the predefined node features. Using this information the user gets a level of explainability to an otherwise complex black-box embedding algorithm. ",

Regrettably, model-based methods are often difficult to employ for such devices due to their high computational complexity, as well as the difficulty of appropriately selecting the user-determined parameters. As an alternative, one may use deep network-based methods, but these are often difficult to generalize, nor can they generate the desired beamforming map directly. In this paper, a computationally efficient acoustic beamforming algorithm is proposed, which may be unrolled to form a model-based deep learning network for real-time imaging, here termed the DAMAS-FISTA-Net. By exploiting the natural structure of an acoustic beamformer, the proposed network inherits the physical knowledge of the acoustic system, and thus learns the underlying physical properties of the propagation. As a result, all the network parameters may be learned end-to-end, guided by a model-based prior using back-propagation. Notably, the proposed network enables an excellent interpretability and the ability of being able to process the raw data directly. Extensive numerical experiments using both simulated and real-world data illustrate the preferable performance of the DAMAS-FISTA-Net as compared to alternative approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of colonoscopic polyps is considered a fundamental step in medical image analysis and surgical interventions. Many recent studies have made improvements based on the encoder-decoder framework, which can effectively segment diverse polyps. Such improvements mainly aim to enhance local features by using global features and applying attention methods. However, relying only on the global information of the final encoder block can result in losing local regional features in the intermediate layer. In addition, determining the edges between benign regions and polyps could be a challenging task. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel separated edge-guidance transformer (SegT) network that aims to build an effective polyp segmentation model. A transformer encoder that learns a more robust representation than existing CNN-based approaches was specifically applied. To determine the precise segmentation of polyps, we utilize a separated edge-guidance module consisting of separator and edge-guidance blocks. The separator block is a two-stream operator to highlight edges between the background and foreground, whereas the edge-guidance block lies behind both streams to strengthen the understanding of the edge. Lastly, an innovative cascade fusion module was used and fused the refined multi-level features. To evaluate the effectiveness of SegT, we conducted experiments with five challenging public datasets, and the proposed model achieved state-of-the-art performance. ",

To circumvent the associated capacity limitations, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of different levels of network constraints and different dynamic tariffs, including a dynamic network tariff. A detailed optimisation model is first developed for public charging electric vehicles in a representative Dutch low voltage (LV) distribution network, susceptible to congestion and voltage problems by 2050 without smart charging of EVs. Later, a detailed reflection is made to assess the influence of the modelled features on the distribution system operator (DSO), charge point operator (CPO) costs, and the EVs' final state-of-charge (SOC) for both mono- (V1G) and bi-directional (V2G) charging. Results show that the dynamic network tariff outperforms other flat tariffs by increasing valley-filling. Consequently, compared to regular day-ahead pricing, a {significant} reduction in the frequency of congestion in the lines is achieved. In addition, V2G ensures the joint optimum for different stakeholders causing adequate EV user satisfaction, decreased CPO costs compared to conventional charging and fewer violations of grid constraints for the DSOs.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning has been proven to be a simple and effective technique to transfer the learned knowledge of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks. However, vanilla fine-tuning easily overfits the target data and degrades the generalization ability. Most existing studies attribute it to catastrophic forgetting, and they retain the pre-trained knowledge indiscriminately without identifying what knowledge is transferable. Motivated by this, we frame fine-tuning into a causal graph and discover that the crux of catastrophic forgetting lies in the missing causal effects from the pretrained data. Based on the causal view, we propose a unified objective for fine-tuning to retrieve the causality back. Intriguingly, the unified objective can be seen as the sum of the vanilla fine-tuning objective, which learns new knowledge from target data, and the causal objective, which preserves old knowledge from PLMs. Therefore, our method is flexible and can mitigate negative transfer while preserving knowledge. Since endowing models with commonsense is a long-standing challenge, we implement our method on commonsense QA with a proposed heuristic estimation to verify its effectiveness. In the experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods on all six commonsense QA datasets and can be implemented as a plug-in module to inflate the performance of existing QA models.

An efficient representation can be used to predict target attributes of networks without the need for actual training and deployment procedures, facilitating efficient network deployment and design. Recently, inspired by the success of Transformer, some Transformer-based representation learning frameworks have been proposed and achieved promising performance in handling cell-structured models. However, graph neural network (GNN) based approaches still dominate the field of learning representation for the entire network. In this paper, we revisit Transformer and compare it with GNN to analyse their different architecture characteristics. We then propose a modified Transformer-based universal neural network representation learning model NAR-Former V2. It can learn efficient representations from both cell-structured networks and entire networks. Specifically, we first take the network as a graph and design a straightforward tokenizer to encode the network into a sequence. Then, we incorporate the inductive representation learning capability of GNN into Transformer, enabling Transformer to generalize better when encountering unseen architecture. Additionally, we introduce a series of simple yet effective modifications to enhance the ability of the Transformer in learning representation from graph structures. Our proposed method surpasses the GNN-based method NNLP by a significant margin in latency estimation on the NNLQP dataset.

We demonstrate that the ESN, as an autonomous dynamical system, is capable of making short-term predictions up to a few Lyapunov times. However, the prediction horizon has high variability depending on the initial condition -- an aspect that we explore in detail. Further, using a variety of statistical metrics to compare the long-term dynamics of the ESN predictions with numerically simulated or experimental dynamics and observed similar results, we show that the ESN can effectively learn the system's dynamics even when trained with noisy numerical or experimental datasets. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of ESNs to serve as a cheap surrogate model for predicting the dynamics of systems where complete observations are unavailable. ",

The proposed framework leverages the knowledge learned from the lip-reading interpreter to generate more plausible lip shapes.

    "title": "Female mosquito detection by means of AI techniques inside release  containers in the context of a Sterile Insect Technique program",
    "abstract": "The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a biological pest control technique based on the release into the environment of sterile males of the insect species whose population is to be controlled. The entire SIT process involves mass-rearing within a biofactory, sorting of the specimens by sex, sterilization, and subsequent release of the sterile males into the environment. The reason for avoiding the release of female specimens is because, unlike males, females bite, with the subsequent risk of disease transmission. In the case of Aedes mosquito biofactories for SIT, the key point of the whole process is sex separation. This process is nowadays performed by a combination of mechanical devices and AI-based vision systems. However, there is still a possibility of false negatives, so a last stage of verification is necessary before releasing them into the environment. It is known that the sound produced by the flapping of adult male mosquitoes is different from that produced by females, so this feature can be used to detect the presence of females in containers prior to environmental release. This paper presents a study for the detection of females in Aedes mosquito release vessels for SIT programs. The containers used consist of PVC a tubular design of 8.8cm diameter and 12.5cm height. The containers were placed in an experimental setup that allowed the recording of the sound of mosquito flight inside of them. Each container was filled with 250 specimens considering the cases of (i) only male mosquitoes, (ii) only female mosquitoes, and (iii) 75% males and 25% females. Case (i) was used for training and testing, whereas cases (ii) and (iii) were used only for testing. Two algorithms were implemented for the detection of female mosquitoes: an unsupervised outlier detection algorithm (iForest) and a one-class SVM trained with male-only recordings. ",

    "title": "Detection of Sensor-To-Sensor Variations using Explainable AI",
    "abstract": "With the growing concern for air quality and its impact on human health, interest in environmental gas monitoring has increased. However, chemi-resistive gas sensing devices are plagued by issues of sensor reproducibility during manufacturing. This study proposes a novel approach for detecting sensor-to-sensor variations in sensing devices using the explainable AI (XAI) method of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This is achieved by identifying sensors that contribute the most to environmental gas concentration estimation via machine learning, and measuring the similarity of feature rankings between sensors to flag deviations or outliers. The methodology is tested using artificial and realistic Ozone concentration profiles to train a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. Two applications were explored in the study: the detection of wrong behaviors of sensors in the train dataset, and the detection of deviations in the test dataset. By training the GRU with the pruned train dataset, we could reduce computational costs while improving the model performance. Overall, the results show that our approach improves the understanding of sensor behavior, successfully detects sensor deviations down to 5-10% from the normal behavior, and leads to more efficient model preparation and calibration. Our method provides a novel solution for identifying deviating sensors, linking inconsistencies in hardware to sensor-to-sensor variations in the manufacturing process on an AI model-level. ",

    "title": "Pattern Mining for Anomaly Detection in Graphs: Application to Fraud in  Public Procurement",
    "abstract": "In the context of public procurement, several indicators called red flags are used to estimate fraud risk. They are computed according to certain contract attributes and are therefore dependent on the proper filling of the contract and award notices. However, these attributes are very often missing in practice, which prohibits red flags computation. Traditional fraud detection approaches focus on tabular data only, considering each contract separately, and are therefore very sensitive to this issue. In this work, we adopt a graph-based method allowing leveraging relations between contracts, to compensate for the missing attributes. We propose PANG (Pattern-Based Anomaly Detection in Graphs), a general supervised framework relying on pattern extraction to detect anomalous graphs in a collection of attributed graphs. Notably, it is able to identify induced subgraphs, a type of pattern widely overlooked in the literature. When benchmarked on standard datasets, its predictive performance is on par with state-of-the-art methods, with the additional advantage of being explainable. These experiments also reveal that induced patterns are more discriminative on certain datasets. When applying PANG to public procurement data, the prediction is superior to other methods, and it identifies subgraph patterns that are characteristic of fraud-prone situations, thereby making it possible to better understand fraudulent behavior.

Existing work primarily focuses on interference cancellation using all the degrees of freedom (DoF). This leads to low service quality for some users with poor channel quality to its serving base station. This work investigates the multi-cell beamforming design for enhancing the downlink signal strength and mitigating interference simultaneously. We first consider the ideal case when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available for determining the beamforming vectors and then extend the problem to the case with imperfect CSI. For both cases, the beamforming optimization problems are non-convex. Assuming perfect CSI, we obtain the optimal JT beamforming vectors based on the uplink-downlink duality. In the presence of unknown CSI errors, we use the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) with Bernstein-type inequality to derive the robust JT beamforming. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed JT beamforming schemes. ",

    "title": "Early Jamming Detection in Mobile Indoor Scenarios via Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "The current state of the art on jamming detection relies on link-layer metrics. A few examples are the bit-error rate, the packet delivery ratio, the throughput, and the increase of the signal-to-noise ratio. As a result, these techniques can only detect jamming ex-post, i.e., once the attack has already taken down the communication link. These solutions are unfit in mobile scenarios, e.g., drones, which might lose the link to the remote controller, being unable to predict the attack. Our solution is rooted in the idea that a drone flying against a jammed area is experiencing an increasing effect of the jamming. Therefore, drones might use this phenomenon to detect jamming early, i.e., before it completely disrupts the communication link. Such an approach would allow drones and possibly their pilots to make an informed decision and maintain full control of the navigation, providing security and safety. In this paper, we propose Bloodhound+, a solution for early jamming detection on mobile devices. Our approach analyzes raw physical-layer information (I-Q samples) acquired from the channel. We assemble this information into grayscale images, and we use sparse autoencoders to detect image anomalies caused by jamming attacks. To test our solution against a wide set of configurations, we acquired a large dataset of indoor measurements using multiple hardware, jamming strategies, and communication parameters. Our results indicate that Bloodhound+ can detect indoor jamming up to 20 meters away from the jamming source at the minimum available relative jamming power, with a minimum accuracy of 99.7%. Our solution is also robust to various sampling rates adopted by the jammer, as well as to the type of signal used for jamming. ",

    "title": "Understanding Depth Map Progressively: Adaptive Distance Interval  Separation for Monocular 3d Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection aims to locate objects in different scenes with just a single image. Due to the absence of depth information, several monocular 3D detection techniques have emerged that rely on auxiliary depth maps from the depth estimation task. There are multiple approaches to understanding the representation of depth maps, including treating them as pseudo-LiDAR point clouds, leveraging implicit end-to-end learning of depth information, or considering them as an image input. However, these methods have certain drawbacks, such as their reliance on the accuracy of estimated depth maps and suboptimal utilization of depth maps due to their image-based nature. While LiDAR-based methods and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be utilized for pseudo point clouds and depth maps, respectively, it is always an alternative. In this paper, we propose a framework named the Adaptive Distance Interval Separation Network (ADISN) that adopts a novel perspective on understanding depth maps, as a form that lies between LiDAR and images. We utilize an adaptive separation approach that partitions the depth map into various subgraphs based on distance and treats each of these subgraphs as an individual image for feature extraction. After adaptive separations, each subgraph solely contains pixels within a learned interval range. If there is a truncated object within this range, an evident curved edge will appear, which we can leverage for texture extraction using CNNs to obtain rich depth information in pixels. Meanwhile, to mitigate the inaccuracy of depth estimation, we designed an uncertainty module. To take advantage of both images and depth maps, we use different branches to learn localization detection tasks and appearance tasks separately. ",

We also analyse the inconsistencies between ground truth and curated privacy nutrition labels on the market, and our framework can detect 90.1% under-claim issues.

We define the specific neuron ensemble required for generating oscillations in the reservoir and demonstrate how adjustments to the leaking rate, spectral radius, topology, and population size can increase the probability of reproducing these oscillations. The results of the experiments, conducted on the time series simulation tasks, demonstrate that the ESN is able to generate the desired waveform without any input. This approach offers a promising solution for the development of bio-inspired controllers for robotic systems. ",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems play a vital role in various online services. However, the insulated nature of training and deploying separately within a specific domain limits their access to open-world knowledge. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in bridging this gap by encoding extensive world knowledge and demonstrating reasoning capability. Nevertheless, previous attempts to directly use LLMs as recommenders have not achieved satisfactory results. In this work, we propose an Open-World Knowledge Augmented Recommendation Framework with Large Language Models, dubbed KAR, to acquire two types of external knowledge from LLMs -- the reasoning knowledge on user preferences and the factual knowledge on items. We introduce factorization prompting to elicit accurate reasoning on user preferences. The generated reasoning and factual knowledge are effectively transformed and condensed into augmented vectors by a hybrid-expert adaptor in order to be compatible with the recommendation task. The obtained vectors can then be directly used to enhance the performance of any recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from the LLM. Extensive experiments show that KAR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with a wide range of recommendation algorithms. ",

Under this setting, traffic flow is highly influenced by traffic signals and the correlation between traffic nodes is dynamic. As a result, the traffic data is non-smooth between nodes, and hard to utilize previous methods which focus on smooth traffic data. To address this problem, we propose Fine-grained Deep Traffic Inference, termed as FDTI. Specifically, we construct a fine-grained traffic graph based on traffic signals to model the inter-road relations. Then, a physically-interpretable dynamic mobility convolution module is proposed to capture vehicle moving dynamics controlled by the traffic signals. Furthermore, traffic flow conservation is introduced to accurately infer future volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and learned traffic dynamics with good properties.

    "abstract": "Big time series are increasingly available from an ever wider range of IoT-enabled sensors deployed in various environments. Significant insights can be gained by mining temporal patterns from these time series. Temporal pattern mining (TPM) extends traditional pattern mining by adding event time intervals into extracted patterns, making them more expressive at the expense of increased time and space complexities. Besides frequent temporal patterns (FTPs), which occur frequently in the entire dataset, another useful type of temporal patterns are so-called rare temporal patterns (RTPs), which appear rarely but with high confidence. Mining rare temporal patterns yields additional challenges. For FTP mining, the temporal information and complex relations between events already create an exponential search space. For RTP mining, the support measure is set very low, leading to a further combinatorial explosion and potentially producing too many uninteresting patterns. Thus, there is a need for a generalized approach which can mine both frequent and rare temporal patterns. This paper presents our Generalized Temporal Pattern Mining from Time Series (GTPMfTS) approach with the following specific contributions: (1) The end-to-end GTPMfTS process taking time series as input and producing frequent/rare temporal patterns as output. (2) The efficient Generalized Temporal Pattern Mining (GTPM) algorithm mines frequent and rare temporal patterns using efficient data structures for fast retrieval of events and patterns during the mining process, and employs effective pruning techniques for significantly faster mining.

    "abstract": "Despite the huge success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, these models struggle to understand the context present in the repository (e.g., imports, parent classes, files with similar names, etc.), thereby producing inaccurate code completions. This effect is more pronounced when using these assistants for repositories that the model has not seen during training, such as proprietary software or work-in-progress code projects. Recent work has shown the promise of using context from the repository during inference. In this work, we extend this idea and propose RepoFusion, a framework to train models to incorporate relevant repository context. Experiments on single-line code completion show that our models trained with repository context significantly outperform much larger code models as CodeGen-16B-multi ($\\sim73\\times$ larger) and closely match the performance of the $\\sim 70\\times$ larger StarCoderBase model that was trained with the Fill-in-the-Middle objective. We find these results to be a novel and compelling demonstration of the gains that training with repository context can bring. We carry out extensive ablation studies to investigate the impact of design choices such as context type, number of contexts, context length, and initialization within our framework. Lastly, we release Stack-Repo, a dataset of 200 Java repositories with permissive licenses and near-deduplicated files that are augmented with three types of repository contexts.

    "abstract": "IoT Servers that receive and process packets from IoT devices should meet the QoS needs of incoming packets, and support Attack Detection software that analyzes the incoming traffic to identify and discard packets that may be part of a Cyberattack. Since UDP Flood Attacks can overwhelm IoT Servers by creating congestion that paralyzes their operation and limits their ability to conduct timely Attack Detection, this paper proposes and evaluates a simple architecture to protect a Server that is connected to a Local Area Network, using a Quasi Deterministic Transmission Policy Forwarder (SQF) at its input port. This Forwarder shapes the incoming traffic, sends it to the Server in a manner which does not modify the overall delay of the packets, and avoids congestion inside the Server. The relevant theoretical background is briefly reviewed, and measurements during a UDP Flood Attack are provided to compare the Server performance, with and without the Forwarder. It is seen that during a UDP Flood Attack, the Forwarder protects the Server from congestion allowing it to effectively identify Attack Packets. On the other hand, the resulting Forwarder congestion can also be eliminated at the Forwarder with \"drop\" commands generated by the Forwarder itself, or sent by the Server to the Forwarder. ",

    "abstract": "Causal effect estimation from data typically requires assumptions about the cause-effect relations either explicitly in the form of a causal graph structure within the Pearlian framework, or implicitly in terms of (conditional) independence statements between counterfactual variables within the potential outcomes framework. When the treatment variable and the outcome variable are confounded, front-door adjustment is an important special case where, given the graph, causal effect of the treatment on the target can be estimated using post-treatment variables. However, the exact formula for front-door adjustment depends on the structure of the graph, which is difficult to learn in practice. In this work, we provide testable conditional independence statements to compute the causal effect using front-door-like adjustment without knowing the graph under limited structural side information. We show that our method is applicable in scenarios where knowing the Markov equivalence class is not sufficient for causal effect estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a class of random graphs as well as real causal fairness benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "One prominent approach toward resolving the adversarial vulnerability of deep neural networks is the two-player zero-sum paradigm of adversarial training, in which predictors are trained against adversarially-chosen perturbations of data. Despite the promise of this approach, algorithms based on this paradigm have not engendered sufficient levels of robustness, and suffer from pathological behavior like robust overfitting. To understand this shortcoming, we first show that the commonly used surrogate-based relaxation used in adversarial training algorithms voids all guarantees on the robustness of trained classifiers. The identification of this pitfall informs a novel non-zero-sum bilevel formulation of adversarial training, wherein each player optimizes a different objective function. Our formulation naturally yields a simple algorithmic framework that matches and in some cases outperforms state-of-the-art attacks, attains comparable levels of robustness to standard adversarial training algorithms, and does not suffer from robust overfitting.

We further discuss the advantages of the uncertainty learning for the case of multi-sensor input. Extensive analysis, experimentation, and ablations show that our proposed modeling paradigm improves both mapping and tracking accuracy and often performs better than alternatives that require ground truth depth or 3D. Our experiments show that we achieve a 38% and 27% lower absolute trajectory tracking error (ATE) on the 7-Scenes and TUM-RGBD datasets respectively. On the popular Replica dataset on two types of depth sensors we report an 11% F1-score improvement on RGBD SLAM compared to the recent state-of-the-art neural implicit approaches.

The encoder processes individual frames whilst the decoder processes a temporal batch of adjacent frames. The proposed decoder can be used on top of any segmentation encoder to improve temporal consistency.

    "abstract": "The robustness of multimodal deep learning models to realistic changes in the input text is critical for their applicability to important tasks such as text-to-image retrieval and cross-modal entailment. To measure robustness, several existing approaches edit the text data, but do so without leveraging the cross-modal information present in multimodal data. Information from the visual modality, such as color, size, and shape, provide additional attributes that users can include in their inputs. Thus, we propose cross-modal attribute insertions as a realistic perturbation strategy for vision-and-language data that inserts visual attributes of the objects in the image into the corresponding text (e.g., \"girl on a chair\" to \"little girl on a wooden chair\"). Our proposed approach for cross-modal attribute insertions is modular, controllable, and task-agnostic. We find that augmenting input text using cross-modal insertions causes state-of-the-art approaches for text-to-image retrieval and cross-modal entailment to perform poorly, resulting in relative drops of 15% in MRR and 20% in $F_1$ score, respectively. Crowd-sourced annotations demonstrate that cross-modal insertions lead to higher quality augmentations for multimodal data than augmentations using text-only data, and are equivalent in quality to original examples.

While much of the prior FSL methods focus on improving downstream task performance, there is a limited understanding of the adversarial robustness of such methods. In this work, we conduct an extensive study of several state-of-the-art FSL methods to assess their robustness to adversarial perturbations. To better understand the impact of various factors towards robustness (or the lack of it), we evaluate prompt-based FSL methods against fully fine-tuned models for aspects such as the use of unlabeled data, multiple prompts, number of few-shot examples, model size and type. Our results on six GLUE tasks indicate that compared to fully fine-tuned models, vanilla FSL methods lead to a notable relative drop in task performance (i.e., are less robust) in the face of adversarial perturbations. However, using (i) unlabeled data for prompt-based FSL and (ii) multiple prompts flip the trend. We further demonstrate that increasing the number of few-shot examples and model size lead to increased adversarial robustness of vanilla FSL methods. Broadly, our work sheds light on the adversarial robustness evaluation of prompt-based FSL methods for NLU tasks. ",

    "abstract": "In many classification datasets, the task labels are spuriously correlated with some input attributes. Classifiers trained on such datasets often rely on these attributes for prediction, especially when the spurious correlation is high, and thus fail to generalize whenever there is a shift in the attributes' correlation at deployment. If we assume that the spurious attributes are known a priori, several methods have been proposed to learn a classifier that is invariant to the specified attributes. However, in real-world data, information about spurious attributes is typically unavailable. Therefore, we propose a method to automatically identify spurious attributes by estimating their causal effect on the label and then use a regularization objective to mitigate the classifier's reliance on them. Compared to a recent method for identifying spurious attributes, we find that our method is more accurate in removing the attribute from the learned model, especially when spurious correlation is high. Specifically, across synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets, our method shows significant improvement in a metric used to quantify the dependence of a classifier on spurious attributes ($\\Delta$Prob), while obtaining better or similar accuracy. In addition, our method mitigates the reliance on spurious attributes even under noisy estimation of causal effects. To explain the empirical robustness of our method, we create a simple linear classification task with two sets of attributes: causal and spurious. We prove that our method only requires that the ranking of estimated causal effects is correct across attributes to select the correct classifier. ",

Standard methods for reducing the reliance on spurious features typically assume that we know what the spurious feature is, which is rarely true in the real world. Methods that attempt to alleviate this limitation are complex, hard to tune, and lead to a significant computational overhead compared to standard training. In this paper, we propose Automatic Feature Reweighting (AFR), an extremely simple and fast method for updating the model to reduce the reliance on spurious features. AFR retrains the last layer of a standard ERM-trained base model with a weighted loss that emphasizes the examples where the ERM model predicts poorly, automatically upweighting the minority group without group labels. With this simple procedure, we improve upon the best reported results among competing methods trained without spurious attributes on several vision and natural language classification benchmarks, using only a fraction of their compute.

This substantially increases the amount of target training data and leverages the use of deep learning (DL) for semi-supervised regression modelling. We use prediction maps constructed from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to provide accurate pseudo-targets and free data from Sentinel-1's C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as regressors. A modified U-Net architecture is adapted with a selection of different training objectives. We demonstrate that when a judicious combination of loss functions is used, the semi-supervised imputation strategy produces results that surpass traditional ALS-based regression models, even though \\sen data are considered as inferior for forest monitoring. These results are consistent for experiments on above-ground biomass prediction in Tanzania and stem volume prediction in Norway, representing a diversity in parameters and forest types that emphasises the robustness of the approach.

Experiments demonstrate that the resulting model can be efficiently inverted to make accurate subject-level predictions, while at the same time offering intuitive causal explanations of its inner workings.

To fill the gap, we propose a novel fairness-aware message passing framework GMMD, which is derived from an optimization problem that considers both graph smoothness and representation fairness. GMMD can be intuitively interpreted as encouraging a node to aggregate representations of other nodes from different sensitive groups while subtracting representations of other nodes from the same sensitive group, resulting in fair representations. We also provide a theoretical analysis to justify that GMMD can guarantee fairness, which leads to a simpler and theory-guided variant GMMD-S. Extensive experiments on graph benchmarks show that our proposed framework can significantly improve the fairness of various backbone GNN models while maintaining high accuracy. ",

State-of-the-art methods were used primarily to train machine learning models on individual RE datasets, such as protein-protein interaction and chemical-induced disease relation. Manual dataset annotation, however, is highly expensive and time-consuming, as it requires domain knowledge. Existing RE datasets are usually domain-specific or small, which limits the development of generalized and high-performing RE models. In this work, we present a novel framework for systematically addressing the data heterogeneity of individual datasets and combining them into a large dataset. Based on the framework and dataset, we report on BioREx, a data-centric approach for extracting relations. Our evaluation shows that BioREx achieves significantly higher performance than the benchmark system trained on the individual dataset, setting a new SOTA from 74.4% to 79.6% in F-1 measure on the recently released BioRED corpus. We further demonstrate that the combined dataset can improve performance for five different RE tasks. In addition, we show that on average BioREx compares favorably to current best-performing methods such as transfer learning and multi-task learning. Finally, we demonstrate BioREx's robustness and generalizability in two independent RE tasks not previously seen in training data: drug-drug N-ary combination and document-level gene-disease RE.

More recently, temporal motifs are used to generate temporal networks with better success. However, existing models are often restricted to a small set of predefined motif patterns due to the high computational cost of counting temporal motifs. In this work, we develop a practical temporal graph generator, Motif Transition Model (MTM), to generate synthetic temporal networks with realistic global and local features. Our key idea is modeling the arrival of new events as temporal motif transition processes. We first calculate the transition properties from the input graph and then simulate the motif transition processes based on the transition probabilities and transition rates.

In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and study how to estimate counterfactual outcomes in multi-agent dynamical systems. Causal inference in a multi-agent dynamical system has unique challenges: 1) Confounders are time-varying and are present in both individual unit covariates and those of other units; 2) Units are affected by not only their own but also others' treatments; 3) The treatments are naturally dynamic, such as receiving vaccines and boosters in a seasonal manner. We model a multi-agent dynamical system as a graph and propose CounterFactual GraphODE (CF-GODE), a causal model that estimates continuous-time counterfactual outcomes in the presence of inter-dependencies between units. To facilitate continuous-time estimation, we propose Treatment-Induced GraphODE, a novel ordinary differential equation based on GNN, which incorporates dynamical treatments as additional inputs to predict potential outcomes over time. To remove confounding bias, we propose two domain adversarial learning based objectives that learn balanced continuous representation trajectories, which are not predictive of treatments and interference. We further provide theoretical justification to prove their effectiveness. Experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets confirm that CF-GODE outperforms baselines on counterfactual estimation. We also provide extensive analyses to understand how our model works. ",

    "abstract": "Cuckoo hashing is a powerful primitive that enables storing items using small space with efficient querying. At a high level, cuckoo hashing maps $n$ items into $b$ entries storing at most $\\ell$ items such that each item is placed into one of $k$ randomly chosen entries. Additionally, there is an overflow stash that can store at most $s$ items. Many cryptographic primitives rely upon cuckoo hashing to privately embed and query data where it is integral to ensure small failure probability when constructing cuckoo hashing tables as it directly relates to the privacy guarantees. As our main result, we present a more query-efficient cuckoo hashing construction using more hash functions. For construction failure probability $\\epsilon$, the query overhead of our scheme is $O(1 + \\sqrt{\\log(1/\\epsilon)/\\log n})$. Our scheme has quadratically smaller query overhead than prior works for any target failure probability $\\epsilon$. We also prove lower bounds matching our construction. Our improvements come from a new understanding of the locality of cuckoo hashing failures for small sets of items. We also initiate the study of robust cuckoo hashing where the input set may be chosen with knowledge of the hash functions. We present a cuckoo hashing scheme using more hash functions with query overhead $\\tilde{O}(\\log \\lambda)$ that is robust against poly$(\\lambda)$ adversaries. Furthermore, we present lower bounds showing that this construction is tight and that extending previous approaches of large stashes or entries cannot obtain robustness except with $\\Omega(n)$ query overhead. As applications of our results, we obtain improved constructions for batch codes and PIR. In particular, we present the most efficient explicit batch code and blackbox reduction from single-query PIR to batch PIR. ",

    "abstract": "Inventory management offers unique opportunities for reliably evaluating and applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Rather than evaluate DRL algorithms by comparing against one another or against human experts, we can compare to the optimum itself in several problem classes with hidden structure. Our DRL methods consistently recover near-optimal policies in such settings, despite being applied with up to 600-dimensional raw state vectors. In others, they can vastly outperform problem-specific heuristics. To reliably apply DRL, we leverage two insights. First, one can directly optimize the hindsight performance of any policy using stochastic gradient descent. This uses (i) an ability to backtest any policy's performance on a subsample of historical demand observations, and (ii) the differentiability of the total cost incurred on any subsample with respect to policy parameters. Second, we propose a natural neural network architecture to address problems with weak (or aggregate) coupling constraints between locations in an inventory network. This architecture employs weight duplication for ``sibling'' locations in the network, and state summarization. We justify this architecture through an asymptotic guarantee, and empirically affirm its value in handling large-scale problems. ",

Furthermore, recent studies have unveiled the existence of universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) that are image-agnostic and highly transferable across different CNN models. In this survey, our primary focus revolves around the recent advancements in UAPs specifically within the image classification task. We categorize UAPs into two distinct categories, i.e., noise-based attacks and generator-based attacks, thereby providing a comprehensive overview of representative methods within each category. By presenting the computational details of these methods, we summarize various loss functions employed for learning UAPs. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different loss functions within consistent training frameworks, including noise-based and generator-based. The evaluation covers a wide range of attack settings, including black-box and white-box attacks, targeted and untargeted attacks, as well as the examination of defense mechanisms. Our quantitative evaluation results yield several important findings pertaining to the effectiveness of different loss functions, the selection of surrogate CNN models, the impact of training data and data size, and the training frameworks involved in crafting universal attackers. Finally, to further promote future research on universal adversarial attacks, we provide some visualizations of the perturbations and discuss the potential research directions. ",

    "abstract": "Graph structure learning is a well-established problem that aims at optimizing graph structures adaptive to specific graph datasets to help message passing neural networks (i.e., GNNs) to yield effective and robust node embeddings. However, the common limitation of existing models lies in the underlying \\textit{closed-world assumption}: the testing graph is the same as the training graph. This premise requires independently training the structure learning model from scratch for each graph dataset, which leads to prohibitive computation costs and potential risks for serious over-fitting. To mitigate these issues, this paper explores a new direction that moves forward to learn a universal structure learning model that can generalize across graph datasets in an open world. We first introduce the mathematical definition of this novel problem setting, and describe the model formulation from a probabilistic data-generative aspect. Then we devise a general framework that coordinates a single graph-shared structure learner and multiple graph-specific GNNs to capture the generalizable patterns of optimal message-passing topology across datasets. The well-trained structure learner can directly produce adaptive structures for unseen target graphs without any fine-tuning. Across diverse datasets and various challenging cross-graph generalization protocols, our experiments show that even without training on target graphs, the proposed model i) significantly outperforms expressive GNNs trained on input (non-optimized) topology, and ii) surprisingly performs on par with state-of-the-art models that independently optimize adaptive structures for specific target graphs, with notably orders-of-magnitude acceleration for training on the target graph.

This technique has shown particular strength in improving the performance of modestly sized LLMs, sometimes inducing performance competitive with much larger model variants. In this paper we ask two questions: (1) How sensitive are instruction-tuned models to the particular phrasings of instructions, and, (2) How can we make them more robust to such natural language variation? To answer the former, we collect a set of 319 instructions manually written by NLP practitioners for over 80 unique tasks included in widely used benchmarks, and we evaluate the variance and average performance of these instructions as compared to instruction phrasings observed during instruction fine-tuning. We find that using novel (unobserved) but appropriate instruction phrasings consistently degrades model performance, sometimes substantially so. Further, such natural instructions yield a wide variance in downstream performance, despite their semantic equivalence. Put another way, instruction-tuned models are not especially robust to instruction re-phrasings. We propose a simple method to mitigate this issue by introducing ``soft prompt'' embedding parameters and optimizing these to maximize the similarity between representations of semantically equivalent instructions. We show that this method consistently improves the robustness of instruction-tuned models. ",

To achieve comparable SED performance with computationally efficient methods to enhance practicality, we explore on lighter alternative attention methods. In addition, we focus of attention methods on frequency and channel dimensions as those are shown to be critical in SED. Joint application of SE modules on both frequency and channel dimension shows comparable performance to frequency dynamic convolution with only 2.7% increase in the model size compared to the baseline model.

    "abstract": "Learning latent causal models from data has many important applications such as robustness, model extrapolation, and counterfactuals. Most prior theoretic work has focused on full causal discovery (i.e., recovering the true latent variables) but requires strong assumptions such as linearity or fails to have any analysis of the equivalence class of solutions (e.g., IRM). Instead of full causal discovery, we focus on a specific type of causal query called the domain counterfactual, which hypothesizes what a sample would have looked like if it had been generated in a different domain (or environment). Concretely, we assume domain-specific invertible latent structural causal models and a shared invertible observation function, both of which are less restrictive assumptions than prior theoretic works. Under these assumptions, we define domain counterfactually equivalent models and prove that any model can be transformed into an equivalent model via two invertible functions. This constructive property provides a tight characterization of the domain counterfactual equivalence classes. Building upon this result, we prove that every equivalence class contains a model where all intervened variables are at the end when topologically sorted by the causal DAG, i.e., all non-intervened variables have non-intervened ancestors. This surprising result suggests that an algorithm that only allows intervention in the last $k$ latent variables may improve model estimation for counterfactuals. In experiments, we enforce the sparse intervention hypothesis via this theoretic result by constraining that the latent SCMs can only differ in the last few causal mechanisms and demonstrate the feasibility of this algorithm in simulated and image-based experiments.

Many models are designed in time domain due to the advantage of waveform processing, such as being able to avoid the phase problem. However, in prior works it is shown that Time-Domain Convolutional Neural Network (TD-CNN) approaches tend to produce annoying artifacts in their output. In order to confirm the source of the artifact, we conduct an AB listening test and found phase to be the cause. We further propose Time-Domain Phase Repair (TD-PR) to improve TD-CNNs' performance by repairing the phase of the TD-CNNs' output. In this paper, we focus on the music SR task, which is challenging due to the wide frequency response and dynamic range of music. Our proposed method can handle various narrow-bandwidth from 2.5kHz to 4kHz with a target bandwidth of 8kHz. We conduct both objective and subjective evaluation to assess the proposed method. The objective evaluation result indicates the proposed method achieves the SR task effectively. Moreover, the proposed TD-PR obtains the much higher mean opinion scores than all TD-CNN baselines, which indicates that the proposed TD-PR significantly improves perceptual quality.

In this research, two problems are addressed: how the eye blinking detection model can learn efficiently from different resolutions of eye pictures in diverse conditions; and how to reduce the size of the detection model for faster inference time. We propose to utilize upsampling and downsampling the input eye images to the same resolution as one potential solution for the first problem, then find out which interpolation method can result in the highest performance of the detection model. For the second problem, although a recent spatiotemporal convolutional neural network used for eye blinking detection has a strong capacity to extract both spatial and temporal characteristics, it remains having a high number of network parameters, leading to high inference time. Therefore, using Depth-wise Separable Convolution rather than conventional convolution layers inside each branch is considered in this paper as a feasible solution. ",

In this work, we present SpecControl, a novel hardware/software co-design, that enables new levels of security while reducing the performance overhead that has been demonstrated by state-of-the-art methodologies. SpecControl introduces a communication interface that allows compilers and application developers to inform the hardware about true branch dependencies, confidential control-flow instructions, and fine-grained instruction constraints in order to apply restrictions only when necessary. We evaluate SpecControl against known speculative execution attacks and in addition, present a new speculative fetch attack variant on the Pattern History Table (PHT) in branch predictors that shows how similar previously reported vulnerabilities are more dangerous by enabling unprivileged attacks, especially with the state-of-the-art branch predictors. SpecControl provides stronger security guarantees compared to the existing defenses while reducing the performance overhead of two state-of-the-art defenses from 51% and 43% to just 23%. ",

Unlike explicit representations, which require storing and manipulating individual data points, implicit representations capture information through a learned mapping function without explicitly representing the data points themselves. They often prune or quantize neural networks after training to accelerate encoding/decoding speed, yet we find that conventional methods fail to transfer learned representations to new videos. This work studies the continuous expansion of implicit video representations as videos arrive sequentially over time, where the model can only access the videos from the current session. We propose a novel neural video representation, Progressive Neural Representation (PNR), that finds an adaptive substructure from the supernet for a given video based on Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. At each training session, our PNR transfers the learned knowledge of the previously obtained subnetworks to learn the representation of the current video while keeping the past subnetwork weights intact. Therefore it can almost perfectly preserve the decoding ability (i.e., catastrophic forgetting) of the NIR on previous videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PNR on the neural sequential video representation compilation on the novel UVG8/17 video sequence benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is an influential methodology, enabling a more profound understanding of graph-structured data and aiding graph clustering, a critical task across various domains. The recent incursion of attention mechanisms, originally an artifact of Natural Language Processing (NLP), into the realm of graph learning has spearheaded a notable shift in research trends. Consequently, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Attention Auto-Encoders have emerged as preferred tools for graph clustering tasks. Yet, these methods primarily employ a local attention mechanism, thereby curbing their capacity to apprehend the intricate global dependencies between nodes within graphs. Addressing these impediments, this study introduces an innovative method known as the Graph Transformer Auto-Encoder for Graph Clustering (GTAGC). By melding the Graph Auto-Encoder with the Graph Transformer, GTAGC is adept at capturing global dependencies between nodes. This integration amplifies the graph representation and surmounts the constraints posed by the local attention mechanism. The architecture of GTAGC encompasses graph embedding, integration of the Graph Transformer within the autoencoder structure, and a clustering component. It strategically alternates between graph embedding and clustering, thereby tailoring the Graph Transformer for clustering tasks, whilst preserving the graph's global structural information. Through extensive experimentation on diverse benchmark datasets, GTAGC has exhibited superior performance against existing state-of-the-art graph clustering methodologies. This pioneering approach represents a novel contribution to the field of graph clustering, paving the way for promising avenues in future research. ",

    "title": "Variational Disentangled Graph Auto-Encoders for Link Prediction",
    "abstract": "With the explosion of graph-structured data, link prediction has emerged as an increasingly important task. Embedding methods for link prediction utilize neural networks to generate node embeddings, which are subsequently employed to predict links between nodes. However, the existing embedding methods typically take a holistic strategy to learn node embeddings and ignore the entanglement of latent factors. As a result, entangled embeddings fail to effectively capture the underlying information and are vulnerable to irrelevant information, leading to unconvincing and uninterpretable link prediction results. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework with two variants, the disentangled graph auto-encoder (DGAE) and the variational disentangled graph auto-encoder (VDGAE). Our work provides a pioneering effort to apply the disentanglement strategy to link prediction. The proposed framework infers the latent factors that cause edges in the graph and disentangles the representation into multiple channels corresponding to unique latent factors, which contributes to improving the performance of link prediction. To further encourage the embeddings to capture mutually exclusive latent factors, we introduce mutual information regularization to enhance the independence among different channels. Extensive experiments on various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results compared to a variety of strong baselines on link prediction tasks. Qualitative analysis on the synthetic dataset also illustrates that the proposed methods can capture distinct latent factors that cause links, providing empirical evidence that our models are able to explain the results of link prediction to some extent. All code will be made publicly available upon publication of the paper. ",

This RAE uses beam search to evaluate the adversarial gain of historical perturbations and guide adversarial perturbations. After the adversarial examples are generated, the framework RDH-GI embeds the secret data that can be recovered losslessly. Experimental results show that our method can achieve an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of at least 40dB compared to source images with limited query budgets. Our method can also achieve a targeted black-box reversible adversarial attack for the first time. ",

Coherent optical technologies are the competitive solutions for the future beyond 100G PON but also face challenges such as the high computational complexity of digital signal processing (DSP). A high oversampling rate in coherent optical technologies results in the high computational complexity of DSP. Therefore, DSP running in a non-integer-oversampling below 2 samples-per-symbol (sps) is preferred, which can not only reduce computational complexity but also obviously lower the requirement for the analog-to-digital converter. In this paper, we propose a non-integer-oversampling DSP for meeting the requirements of coherent PON. The proposed DSP working at 9/8-sps and 5/4-sps oversampling rates can be reduced by 44.04% and 40.78% computational complexity compared to that working at the 2-sps oversampling rate, respectively. Moreover, a 400-Gb/s-net-rate coherent PON based on digital subcarrier multiplexing was demonstrated to verify the feasibility of the non-integer-oversampling DSP. There is almost no penalty on the receiver sensitivity when the non-integer-oversampling DSP is adopted. In conclusion, the non-integer-oversampling DSP shows great potential in the future coherent PON. ",

Moreover, to overcome the heavy reliance on labels, we design two self-supervision signals, namely node specificity and channel independence, which capture informative knowledge without the need for labeled data, thereby guiding the automatic disentanglement of nodes. Finally, we perform node classification tasks on three citation networks by using the disentangled node embeddings, and the relevant analysis is provided.

Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) are usually utilized as the backbone model to extract features in these instance segmentation based STD algorithms. FCNs naturally come with high computational complexity. Furthermore, to keep up with the growing variety of models, flexible architectures are needed. In order to accelerate various STD algorithms efficiently, a versatility-performance balanced hardware architecture is proposed, together with a simple but efficient way of configuration. This architecture is able to compute different FCN models without hardware redesign. The optimization is focused on hardware with finely designed computing modules, while the versatility of different network reconfigurations is achieved by microcodes instead of a strenuously designed compiler. Multiple parallel techniques at different levels and several complexity-reduction methods are explored to speed up the FCN computation. Results from implementation show that, given the same tasks, the proposed system achieves a better throughput compared with the studied GPU. Particularly, our system reduces the comprehensive Operation Expense (OpEx) at GPU by 46\\%, while the power efficiency is enhanced by 32\\%.

To simplify the problem, RoMe decomposes a 3D road surface into a triangle-mesh and a multilayer perception network to model the road elevation implicitly. To retain fine surface details, each mesh vertex has two extra attributes, namely color and semantics. To improve the efficiency of RoMe in large-scale environments, a novel waypoint sampling method is introduced. As such, RoMe can properly preserve road surface details, with only linear computational complexity to road areas. In addition, to improve the accuracy of RoMe, extrinsics optimization is proposed to mitigate inaccurate extrinsic calibrations. Experimental results on popular public datasets also demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of RoMe. ",

Existing state-of-the-art KD methods for object detection are mostly based on feature imitation, which is generally observed to be better than prediction mimicking. In this paper, we show that the inconsistency of the optimization objectives between the ground-truth signals and distillation targets is the key reason for the inefficiency of prediction mimicking. To alleviate this issue, we present a simple yet effective distillation scheme, termed CrossKD, which delivers the intermediate features of the student's detection head to the teacher's detection head. The resulting cross-head predictions are then forced to mimic the teacher's predictions. Such a distillation manner relieves the student's head from receiving contradictory supervision signals from the ground-truth annotations and the teacher's predictions, greatly improving the student's detection performance. On MS COCO, with only prediction mimicking losses applied, our CrossKD boosts the average precision of GFL ResNet-50 with 1x training schedule from 40.2 to 43.7, outperforming all existing KD methods for object detection.

    "abstract": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) provides accurate estimates of the brain's structural organization and learning invariant brain representations from sMRI is an enduring issue in neuroscience. Previous deep representation learning models ignore the fact that the brain, as the core of human cognitive activity, is distinct from other organs whose primary attribute is anatomy. Therefore, capturing the semantic structure that dominates interindividual cognitive variability is key to accurately representing the brain. Given that this high-level semantic information is subtle, distributed, and interdependently latent in the brain structure, sMRI-based models need to capture fine-grained details and understand how they relate to the overall global structure. However, existing models are optimized by simple objectives, making features collapse into homogeneity and worsening simultaneous representation of fine-grained information and holistic semantics, causing a lack of biological plausibility and interpretation of cognition. Here, we propose MCIAT, a unified framework that combines Multi-task Collaborative pre-training and Individual-Adaptive-Tokens fine-tuning. Specifically, we first synthesize restorative learning, age prediction auxiliary learning and adversarial learning as a joint proxy task for deep semantic representation learning. Then, a mutual-attention-based token selection method is proposed to highlight discriminative features. The proposed MCIAT achieves state-of-the-art diagnosis performance on the ADHD-200 dataset compared with several sMRI-based approaches and shows superior generalization on the MCIC and OASIS datasets. Moreover, we studied 12 behavioral tasks and found significant associations between cognitive functions and MCIAT-established representations, which verifies the interpretability of our proposed framework.

Conversely less costly rule-based methods struggle to reproduce complex structures. We propose HIGGS (Hierarchical Generation of Graphs) as a model-agnostic framework of producing large graphs with realistic local structures. HIGGS uses GNN models with conditional generation capabilities to sample graphs in hierarchies of resolution. As a result HIGGS has the capacity to extend the scale of generated graphs from a given GNN model by quadratic order. As a demonstration we implement HIGGS using DiGress, a recent graph-diffusion model, including a novel edge-predictive-diffusion variant edge-DiGress. We use this implementation to generate categorically attributed graphs with tens of thousands of nodes. These HIGGS generated graphs are far larger than any previously produced using GNNs.

We demonstrate this approach on several systems, namely, linear spring, linear spring with binary particle types, and non-linear spring systems, all following Brownian dynamics at finite temperatures. We show that BROGNET significantly outperforms proposed baselines across all the benchmarked Brownian systems. In addition, we demonstrate zero-shot generalizability of BROGNET to simulate unseen system sizes that are two orders of magnitude larger and to different temperatures than those used during training.

As an emerging building block, multi-sourced urban data are usually integrated as urban knowledge graphs (UrbanKGs) to provide critical knowledge for urban spatiotemporal prediction models.

This paper presents UUKG, the unified urban knowledge graph dataset for knowledge-enhanced urban spatiotemporal predictions. Specifically, we first construct UrbanKGs consisting of millions of triplets for two metropolises by connecting heterogeneous urban entities such as administrative boroughs, POIs, and road segments. Moreover, we conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis on constructed UrbanKGs and uncover diverse high-order structural patterns, such as hierarchies and cycles, that can be leveraged to benefit downstream USTP tasks. To validate and facilitate the use of UrbanKGs, we implement and evaluate 15 KG embedding methods on the KG completion task and integrate the learned KG embeddings into 9 spatiotemporal models for five different USTP tasks. The extensive experimental results not only provide benchmarks of knowledge-enhanced USTP models under different task settings but also highlight the potential of state-of-the-art high-order structure-aware UrbanKG embedding methods.

We try to recreate this tendency to rule-based generalization. When exposed to tests of analytic intelligence, for example, the visual RAVEN IQ test, human problem-solvers identify the relevant objects in the picture and their relevant attributes and reason based on rules applied to these objects and attributes. Based on the induced rules, they are able to provide a solution to the test. We propose a task that translates this IQ task into language.

In such instances, the existing RL methods may fail miserably due to frequent statistical outliers. In this work, we establish that temporal difference (TD) learning with a dynamic gradient clipping mechanism, and correspondingly operated natural actor-critic (NAC), can be provably robustified against heavy-tailed reward distributions. It is shown in the framework of linear function approximation that a favorable tradeoff between bias and variability of the stochastic gradients can be achieved with this dynamic gradient clipping mechanism. In particular, we prove that robust versions of TD learning achieve sample complexities of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{1}{p}})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1-\\frac{1}{p}})$ with and without the full-rank assumption on the feature matrix, respectively, under heavy-tailed rewards with finite moments of order $(1+p)$ for some $p\\in(0,1]$, both in expectation and with high probability. We show that a robust variant of NAC based on Robust TD learning achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-4-\\frac{2}{p}})$ sample complexity. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical experiments. ",

We propose a syntax-guided generation schema, which generates the sequence guided by a constituency parse tree in a top-down direction. The decoding process can be decomposed into two parts: (1) predicting the infilling texts for each constituent in the lexicalized syntax context given the source sentence; (2) mapping and expanding each constituent to construct the next-level syntax context. Accordingly, we propose a structural beam search method to find possible syntax structures hierarchically. Experiments on paraphrase generation and machine translation show that the proposed method outperforms autoregressive baselines, while also demonstrating effectiveness in terms of interpretability, controllability, and diversity.

    "abstract": "Recently, ChatGPT, a representative large language model (LLM), has gained considerable attention due to its powerful emergent abilities. Some researchers suggest that LLMs could potentially replace structured knowledge bases like knowledge graphs (KGs) and function as parameterized knowledge bases. However, while LLMs are proficient at learning probabilistic language patterns based on large corpus and engaging in conversations with humans, they, like previous smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs), still have difficulty in recalling facts while generating knowledge-grounded contents. To overcome these limitations, researchers have proposed enhancing data-driven PLMs with knowledge-based KGs to incorporate explicit factual knowledge into PLMs, thus improving their performance to generate texts requiring factual knowledge and providing more informed responses to user queries. This paper reviews the studies on enhancing PLMs with KGs, detailing existing knowledge graph enhanced pre-trained language models (KGPLMs) as well as their applications. Inspired by existing studies on KGPLM, this paper proposes to enhance LLMs with KGs by developing knowledge graph-enhanced large language models (KGLLMs). KGLLM provides a solution to enhance LLMs' factual reasoning ability, opening up new avenues for LLM research. ",

To address this, we have designed two specialized views of a codebase to help code reviewers in prioritizing their work related to personal data: one view displays the types of personal data representation, while the other provides an abstract depiction of personal data processing, complemented by an optional detailed exploration of specific code snippets. Leveraging static analysis, our method identifies personal data-related code segments, thereby expediting the review process. Our approach, evaluated on four open-source GitHub applications, demonstrated a precision rate of 0.87 in identifying personal data flows. Additionally, we fact-checked the privacy statements of 15 Android applications. This solution, designed to augment the efficiency of GDPR-related privacy analysis tasks such as the Record of Processing Activities (ROPA), aims to conserve resources, thereby saving time and enhancing productivity for code reviewers.

    "abstract": "Image inpainting for completing complicated semantic environments and diverse hole patterns of corrupted images is challenging even for state-of-the-art learning-based inpainting methods trained on large-scale data. A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

Previous works have demonstrated promising results for keypoint prediction through direct coordinate regression or heatmap-based inference. However, these methods are commonly studied for specific subjects, such as human bodies and faces, which possess fixed keypoint structures. They also suffer in several practical scenarios where explicit or complete geometry is not given, including images and partial point clouds. Inspired by the recent success of advanced implicit representation in reconstruction tasks, we explore the idea of using an implicit field to represent keypoints. Specifically, our key idea is employing spheres to represent 3D keypoints, thereby enabling the learnability of the corresponding signed distance field. Explicit keypoints can be extracted subsequently by our algorithm based on the Hough transform. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations also show the superiority of our representation in terms of prediction accuracy. ",

The framework utilises a multi-buffer system instead of using a single shared replay buffer. The multi-buffer system allows for the Evolutionary Strategy to search freely in the search space of policies, without running the risk of overpopulating the replay buffer with poorly performing trajectories which limit the number of desirable policy behaviour examples thus negatively impacting the potential of the Deep Reinforcement Learning within the shared framework. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated to perform competitively with current Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning algorithms on MuJoCo control tasks, outperforming the well known state-of-the-art CEM-RL on 3 of the 4 environments tested.

Despite their potential, the adoption of foundation models in these domains has been hampered by the lack of suitable tools for model construction and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Event Stream GPT (ESGPT), an open-source library designed to streamline the end-to-end process for building GPTs for continuous-time event sequences. ESGPT allows users to (1) build flexible, foundation-model scale input datasets by specifying only a minimal configuration file, (2) leverage a Hugging Face compatible modeling API for GPTs over this modality that incorporates intra-event causal dependency structures and autoregressive generation capabilities, and (3) evaluate models via standardized processes that can assess few and even zero-shot performance of pre-trained models on user-specified fine-tuning tasks.

Therefore, in this work, we propose a trivially simple recipe to serve as a baseline method for boosting the efficiency of DE retrievers leveraging an asymmetric architecture. Our results demonstrate that even a 2-layer, BERT-based query encoder can still retain 92.5% of the full DE performance on the BEIR benchmark via unsupervised distillation and proper student initialization.

    "abstract": "Network slicing enables operators to efficiently support diverse applications on a common physical infrastructure. The ever-increasing densification of network deployment leads to complex and non-trivial inter-cell interference, which requires more than inaccurate analytic models to dynamically optimize resource management for network slices. In this paper, we develop a DIRP algorithm with multiple deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to cooperatively optimize resource partition in individual cells to fulfill the requirements of each slice, based on two alternative reward functions. Nevertheless, existing DRL approaches usually tie the pretrained model parameters to specific network environments with poor transferability, which raises practical deployment concerns in large-scale mobile networks. Hence, we design a novel transfer learning-aided DIRP (TL-DIRP) algorithm to ease the transfer of DIRP agents across different network environments in terms of sample efficiency, model reproducibility, and algorithm scalability. The TL-DIRP algorithm first centrally trains a generalized model and then transfers the \"generalist\" to each local agent as \"specialist\" with distributed finetuning and execution. TL-DIRP consists of two steps: 1) centralized training of a generalized distributed model, 2) transferring the \"generalist\" to each \"specialist\" with distributed finetuning and execution. The numerical results show that not only DIRP outperforms existing baseline approaches in terms of faster convergence and higher reward, but more importantly, TL-DIRP significantly improves the service performance, with reduced exploration cost, accelerated convergence rate, and enhanced model reproducibility. As compared to a traffic-aware baseline, TL-DIRP provides about 15% less violation ratio of the quality of service (QoS) for the worst slice service and 8.8% less violation on the average service QoS.

To that end, healthcare organizations mention how they collect/process/store/share this data (i.e., data practices) via their privacy policies. Thus there is a need to audit these policies and check compliance with respective laws. This paper addresses this need and presents a large-scale data-driven study to audit privacy policies from healthcare organizations in three countries -- USA, UK, and India. We developed a three-stage novel \\textit{workflow} for our audit. First, we collected the privacy policies of thousands of healthcare organizations in these countries and cleaned this privacy policy data using a clustering-based mixed-method technique. We identified data practices regarding users' private medical data (medical history) and site privacy (cookie, logs) in these policies. Second, we adopted a summarization-based technique to uncover exact broad data practices across countries and notice important differences. Finally, we evaluated the cross-country data practices using the lens of legal compliance (with legal expert feedback) and grounded in the theory of Contextual Integrity (CI). Alarmingly, we identified six themes of non-alignment (observed in 21.8\\% of data practices studied in India) pointed out by our legal experts. Furthermore, there are four \\textit{potential violations} according to case verdicts from Indian Courts as pointed out by our legal experts.

Thus, it is critical to continue assessing the security of LWE and specific parameter choices. For example, HE uses small secrets, and the HE community has considered standardizing small sparse secrets to improve efficiency and functionality. However, prior work, SALSA and PICANTE, showed that ML attacks can recover sparse binary secrets.

Automatic vulnerability identification is important because it can evaluate large codebases more efficiently than manual code auditing. Many Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based models for detecting vulnerabilities in source code have been presented in recent years. However, a survey that summarises, classifies, and analyses the application of ML/DL models for vulnerability detection is missing. It may be difficult to discover gaps in existing research and potential for future improvement without a comprehensive survey. This could result in essential areas of research being overlooked or under-represented, leading to a skewed understanding of the state of the art in vulnerability detection. This work address that gap by presenting a systematic survey to characterize various features of ML/DL-based source code level software vulnerability detection approaches via five primary research questions (RQs). Specifically, our RQ1 examines the trend of publications that leverage ML/DL for vulnerability detection, including the evolution of research and the distribution of publication venues. RQ2 describes vulnerability datasets used by existing ML/DL-based models, including their sources, types, and representations, as well as analyses of the embedding techniques used by these approaches. RQ3 explores the model architectures and design assumptions of ML/DL-based vulnerability detection approaches. RQ4 summarises the type and frequency of vulnerabilities that are covered by existing studies.

In this context, the feasibility of utilizing analog circuits based on memristors as efficient alternatives in neural network inference is being considered. Memristors stand out for their configurability and low power consumption. To study the feasibility of using these circuits, a physical model has been adapted to accurately simulate the behavior of commercial memristors from KNOWM.

This distinguishes linear models with batch normalization from those without batch normalization in terms of both the type of implicit bias and the convergence rate. We further extend our result to a class of two-layer, single-filter linear convolutional neural networks, and show that batch normalization has an implicit bias towards a patch-wise uniform margin. Based on two examples, we demonstrate that patch-wise uniform margin classifiers can outperform the maximum margin classifiers in certain learning problems.

    "abstract": "We study property prediction for crystal materials. A crystal structure consists of a minimal unit cell that is repeated infinitely in 3D space. How to accurately represent such repetitive structures in machine learning models remains unresolved. Current methods construct graphs by establishing edges only between nearby nodes, thereby failing to faithfully capture infinite repeating patterns and distant interatomic interactions. In this work, we propose several innovations to overcome these limitations. First, we propose to model physics-principled interatomic potentials directly instead of only using distances as in many existing methods. These potentials include the Coulomb potential, London dispersion potential, and Pauli repulsion potential. Second, we model the complete set of potentials among all atoms, instead of only between nearby atoms as in existing methods. This is enabled by our approximations of infinite potential summations with provable error bounds. We further develop efficient algorithms to compute the approximations. Finally, we propose to incorporate our computations of complete interatomic potentials into message passing neural networks for representation learning. We perform experiments on the JARVIS and Materials Project benchmarks for evaluation. Results show that the use of interatomic potentials and complete interatomic potentials leads to consistent performance improvements with reasonable computational costs.

To address this issue, uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods can be used to improve the models' calibration of predictions. Although many UQ approaches exist, not all of them lead to improved performance. While some studies have used UQ to improve molecular pre-trained models, the process of selecting suitable backbone and UQ methods for reliable molecular uncertainty estimation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present MUBen, which evaluates different combinations of backbone and UQ models to quantify their performance for both property prediction and uncertainty estimation. By fine-tuning various backbone molecular representation models using different molecular descriptors as inputs with UQ methods from different categories, we critically assess the influence of architectural decisions and training strategies. Our study offers insights for selecting UQ and backbone models, which can facilitate research on uncertainty-critical applications in fields such as materials science and drug discovery. ",

Thus, there is a need to select small training subsets from large pools of unlabelled data points and to develop reliable ML methods that can effectively learn from small training sets. This work focuses on predicting the molecules atomization energy in the QM9 dataset. We investigate the advantages of employing domain knowledge-based data sampling methods for an efficient training set selection combined with informed ML techniques. In particular, we show how maximizing molecular diversity in the training set selection process increases the robustness of linear and nonlinear regression techniques such as kernel methods and graph neural networks.

In contrast to elaborate augmentation methods proposed in the literature, we use simple stationary noises for data augmentation. Our extension is easy to implement and adds almost no computational overhead during training and inference. Using only two hours of training data, our approach was rated by human listeners to be on par with the baseline Tacotron-2 trained with 23.5 hours of LJSpeech data.

    "abstract": "How can we tell whether two neural networks are utilizing the same internal processes for a particular computation? This question is pertinent for multiple subfields of both neuroscience and machine learning, including neuroAI, mechanistic interpretability, and brain-machine interfaces. Standard approaches for comparing neural networks focus on the spatial geometry of latent states. Yet in recurrent networks, computations are implemented at the level of neural dynamics, which do not have a simple one-to-one mapping with geometry. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel similarity metric that compares two systems at the level of their dynamics. Our method incorporates two components: Using recent advances in data-driven dynamical systems theory, we learn a high-dimensional linear system that accurately captures core features of the original nonlinear dynamics. Next, we compare these linear approximations via a novel extension of Procrustes Analysis that accounts for how vector fields change under orthogonal transformation. Via four case studies, we demonstrate that our method effectively identifies and distinguishes dynamic structure in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), whereas geometric methods fall short. We additionally show that our method can distinguish learning rules in an unsupervised manner. Our method therefore opens the door to novel data-driven analyses of the temporal structure of neural computation, and to more rigorous testing of RNNs as models of the brain. ",

We train our networks by minimizing the mean squared error between the network's generated reconstruction and a ground truth 3-D volume. To demonstrate and evaluate our method, we synthesize tilt views from a 3-D image of fly brain tissue acquired with Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy. We compare our method to using a U-Net to directly reconstruct the unstretched tilt views and show that this simple stretching procedure leads to significantly better reconstructions. We also compare to using a network to clean up reconstructions generated by backprojection and filtered backprojection, and find that this simple stretching procedure also gives lower mean squared error on previously unseen images.

In deep learning (DL) applications, that is possible through quantile and expectile regression neural networks (QRNN and ERNN respectively). Here we introduce deep Huber quantile regression networks (DHQRN) that nest QRNNs and ERNNs as edge cases. DHQRN can predict Huber quantiles, which are more general functionals in the sense that they nest quantiles and expectiles as limiting cases. The main idea is to train a deep learning algorithm with the Huber quantile regression function, which is consistent for the Huber quantile functional. As a proof of concept, DHQRN are applied to predict house prices in Australia. In this context, predictive performances of three DL architectures are discussed along with evidential interpretation of results from an economic case study. ",

Statistical models such as linear inverse model (LIM), analog forecasting (AF), and recurrent neural network (RNN) have been widely used for ENSO prediction, offering flexibility and relatively low computational expense compared to large dynamic models. However, these models have limitations in capturing spatial patterns in SST variability or relying on linear dynamics. Here we present a modified Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (ConvGRU) network for the ENSO region spatio-temporal sequence prediction problem, along with the Ni\\~no 3.4 index prediction as a down stream task. The proposed ConvGRU network, with an encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence structure, takes historical SST maps of the Pacific region as input and generates future SST maps for subsequent months within the ENSO region. To evaluate the performance of the ConvGRU network, we trained and tested it using data from multiple large climate models. The results demonstrate that the ConvGRU network significantly improves the predictability of the Ni\\~no 3.4 index compared to LIM, AF, and RNN. This improvement is evidenced by extended useful prediction range, higher Pearson correlation, and lower root-mean-square error. The proposed model holds promise for improving our understanding and predicting capabilities of the ENSO phenomenon and can be broadly applicable to other weather and climate prediction scenarios with spatial patterns and teleconnections.

    "abstract": "Supervised machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms excel at predictive tasks, but it is commonly assumed that they often do so by exploiting non-causal correlations, which may limit both interpretability and generalizability. Here, we show that this trade-off between explanation and prediction is not as deep and fundamental as expected. Whereas ML and DL algorithms will indeed tend to use non-causal features for prediction when fed indiscriminately with all data, it is possible to constrain the learning process of any ML and DL algorithm by selecting features according to Pearl's backdoor adjustment criterion. In such a situation, some algorithms, in particular deep neural networks, can provide near unbiased effect estimates under feature collinearity. Remaining biases are explained by the specific algorithmic structures as well as hyperparameter choice. Consequently, optimal hyperparameter settings are different when tuned for prediction or inference, confirming the general expectation of a trade-off between prediction and explanation. However, the effect of this trade-off is small compared to the effect of a causally constrained feature selection. Thus, once the causal relationship between the features is accounted for, the difference between prediction and explanation may be much smaller than commonly assumed. We also show that such causally constrained models generalize better to new data with altered collinearity structures, suggesting generalization failure may often be due to a lack of causal learning. Our results not only provide a perspective for using ML for inference of (causal) effects but also help to improve the generalizability of fitted ML and DL models to new data. ",

However, most existing efforts still focus on audio modality to improve robustness considering its dominance in AVSR task, with noise adaptation techniques such as front-end denoise processing. Though effective, these methods are usually faced with two practical challenges: 1) lack of sufficient labeled noisy audio-visual training data in some real-world scenarios and 2) less optimal model generality to unseen testing noises. In this work, we investigate the noise-invariant visual modality to strengthen robustness of AVSR, which can adapt to any testing noises while without dependence on noisy training data, a.k.a., unsupervised noise adaptation. Inspired by human perception mechanism, we propose a universal viseme-phoneme mapping (UniVPM) approach to implement modality transfer, which can restore clean audio from visual signals to enable speech recognition under any noisy conditions. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks LRS3 and LRS2 show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art under various noisy as well as clean conditions.

Whereas recent developments in automatic algorithms have shown to make the detection of lacunes faster while preserving sensitivity, they also showed a large number of false positives, which makes them impractical for use in clinical practice or large-scale studies. Here, we develop a novel framework that, in addition to lacune detection, outputs a categorical burden score. This score could provide a more practical estimate of lacune presence that simplifies and effectively accelerates the imaging assessment of lacunes. We hypothesize that the combination of detection and the categorical score makes the procedure less sensitive to noisy labels. ",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are representative models of artificial neural networks (ANNs), that form the backbone of modern computer vision. However, the considerable power consumption and limited computing speed of electrical computing platforms restrict further development of CNNs. Optical neural networks are considered the next-generation physical implementations of ANNs to break the bottleneck. This study proposes a spectral convolutional neural network (SCNN) with the function of matter meta-imaging, namely identifying the composition of matter and mapping its distribution in space. This SCNN includes an optical convolutional layer (OCL) and a reconfigurable electrical backend. The OCL is implemented by integrating very large-scale, pixel-aligned metasurfaces on a CMOS image sensor, which accepts 3D raw datacubes of natural images, containing two-spatial and one-spectral dimensions, at megapixels directly as input to realize the matter meta-imaging. This unique optoelectronic framework empowers in-sensor optical analog computing at extremely high energy efficiency eliminating the need for coherent light sources and greatly reducing the computing load of the electrical backend. We employed the SCNN framework on several real-world complex tasks. It achieved accuracies of 96.4% and 100% for pathological diagnosis and real-time face anti-spoofing at video rate, respectively. The SCNN framework, with an unprecedented new function of substance identification, provides a feasible optoelectronic and integrated optical CNN implementation for edge devices or cellphones with limited computing capabilities, facilitating diverse applications, such as intelligent robotics, industrial automation, medical diagnosis, and astronomy.

Machine Learning (ML) has nowadays a well established role in facilitating this effort in systematic ways. The increasing amount of available accurate DFT data represents a solid basis upon which new ML models can be trained and tested. While conventional models rely on static descriptors, generally suitable for a limited class of systems, the flexibility of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) allows for direct learning representations on graphs, such as the ones formed by crystals. We utilize crystal graph neural networks (CGNN) to predict crystal properties with DFT level accuracy, through graphs with encoding of the atomic (node/vertex), bond (edge), and global state attributes. In this work, we aim at testing the ability of the CGNN MegNet framework in predicting a number of properties of systems previously unseen from the model, obtained by adding a substitutional defect in bulk crystals that are included in the training set. We perform DFT validation to assess the accuracy in the prediction of formation energies and structural features (such as elastic moduli).

    "abstract": "The occurrence of manufacturing defects in wind turbine blade (WTB) production can result in significant increases in operation and maintenance costs and lead to severe and disastrous consequences. Therefore, inspection during the manufacturing process is crucial to ensure consistent fabrication of composite materials. Non-contact sensing techniques, such as Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a full view of these complex structures during curing. In this paper, we enhance the quality assurance of manufacturing utilizing FMCW radar as a non-destructive sensing modality. Additionally, a novel anomaly detection pipeline is developed that offers the following advantages: (1) We use the analytic representation of the Intermediate Frequency signal of the FMCW radar as a feature to disentangle material-specific and round-trip delay information from the received wave. (2) We propose a novel anomaly detection methodology called focus Support Vector Data Description (focus-SVDD). This methodology involves defining the limit boundaries of the dataset after removing healthy data features, thereby focusing on the attributes of anomalies. (3) The proposed method employs a complex-valued autoencoder to remove healthy features and we introduces a new activation function called Exponential Amplitude Decay (EAD). EAD takes advantage of the Rayleigh distribution, which characterizes an instantaneous amplitude signal. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through its application to collected data, where it shows superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods. This method is expected to make a significant contribution not only to structural health monitoring but also to the field of deep complex-valued data processing and SVDD application. ",

With these advances comes a need for adequate empirical validation of the causal relationships learned by different algorithms. However, for most real data sources true causal relations remain unknown. This issue is further compounded by privacy concerns surrounding the release of suitable high-quality data. To help address these challenges, we gather a complex dataset comprising measurements from an assembly line in a manufacturing context. This line consists of numerous physical processes for which we are able to provide ground truth causal relationships on the basis of a detailed study of the underlying physics. We use the assembly line data and associated ground truth information to build a system for generation of semisynthetic manufacturing data that supports benchmarking of causal discovery methods. To accomplish this, we employ distributional random forests in order to flexibly estimate and represent conditional distributions that may be combined into joint distributions that strictly adhere to a causal model over the observed variables. The estimated conditionals and tools for data generation are made available in our Python library $\\texttt{causalAssembly}$. Using the library, we showcase how to benchmark several well-known causal discovery algorithms. ",

However, folding an image or video tensor breaks the original data structure, leading to local information loss as nearby pixels may be assigned into different dimensions and become far away from each other. In this paper, to fully preserve the local information of the original visual data, we explore not folding the data tensor, and at the same time adopt graph information to regularize local similarity between nearby entries. To overcome the high computational complexity introduced by the graph-based regularization in the TT completion problem, we propose to break the original problem into multiple sub-problems with respect to each TT core fiber, instead of each TT core as in traditional methods. Furthermore, to avoid heavy parameter tuning, a sparsity promoting probabilistic model is built based on the generalized inverse Gaussian (GIG) prior, and an inference algorithm is derived under the mean-field approximation. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-world visual data show the superiority of the proposed methods. ",

Here, we provide the first deep investigation of the predictive potential of machine-learning models to understand the connections between soil and biological phenotypes. Indeed, we investigate an integrative framework performing accurate machine-learning-based prediction of plant phenotypes from biological, chemical and physical properties of the soil via two models: random forest and Bayesian neural network. We show that prediction is improved, as evidenced by higher weighted F1 scores, when incorporating into the models environmental features like soil physicochemical properties and microbial population density in addition to the microbiome information. Furthermore, by exploring multiple data preprocessing strategies such as normalization, zero replacement, and data augmentation, we confirm that human decisions have a huge impact on the predictive performance. In particular, we show that the naive total sum scaling normalization that is commonly used in microbiome research is not the optimal strategy to maximize predictive power. In addition, we find that accurately defined labels are more important than normalization, taxonomic level or model characteristics. That is, if humans are unable to classify the samples and provide accurate labels, the performance of machine-learning models will be limited. Lastly, we present strategies for domain scientists via a full model selection decision tree to identify the human choices that maximize the prediction power of the models.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel context-aware multi-prior network (CAMP-Net) for MRI reconstruction. CAMP-Net leverages the complementary nature of multiple prior knowledge and explores data redundancy between adjacent slices in the hybrid domain to improve image quality. It incorporates three interleaved modules respectively for image enhancement, k-space restoration, and calibration consistency to jointly learn context-aware multiple priors in an end-to-end fashion. The image enhancement module learns a coil-combined image prior to suppress noise-like artifacts, while the k-space restoration module explores multi-coil k-space correlations to recover high-frequency details. The calibration consistency module embeds the known physical properties of MRI acquisition to ensure consistency of k-space correlations extracted from measurements and the artifact-free image intermediate. The resulting low- and high-frequency reconstructions are hierarchically aggregated in a frequency fusion module and iteratively refined to progressively reconstruct the final image. We evaluated the generalizability and robustness of our method on three large public datasets with various accelerations and sampling patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CAMP-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality and quantitative $T_2$ mapping. ",

As such, the approach follows the Bayesian paradigm, comparing models via their marginal likelihood and computing the posterior probability of the GPN features. Simulation studies show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in recovering the graphical structure of the network and provides an accurate approximation of its posterior distribution.

We establish the first order asymptotics for the lengths of increasing paths: the lengths of the shortest and longest paths between typical vertices, the maxima of these lengths from a given vertex, as well as the maxima between any two vertices; this covers the (temporal) diameter.

    "abstract": "Spatial processes observed in various fields, such as climate and environmental science, often occur on a large scale and demonstrate spatial nonstationarity. Fitting a Gaussian process with a nonstationary Mat\\'ern covariance is challenging. Previous studies in the literature have tackled this challenge by employing spatial partitioning techniques to estimate the parameters that vary spatially in the covariance function. The selection of partitions is an important consideration, but it is often subjective and lacks a data-driven approach. To address this issue, in this study, we utilize the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) to derive subregions from the nonstationary data. We employ a selection mechanism to identify subregions that exhibit similar behavior to stationary fields. In order to distinguish between stationary and nonstationary random fields, we conducted training on ConvNet using various simulated data. These simulations are generated from Gaussian processes with Mat\\'ern covariance models under a wide range of parameter settings, ensuring adequate representation of both stationary and nonstationary spatial data. We assess the performance of the proposed method with synthetic and real datasets at a large scale. The results revealed enhanced accuracy in parameter estimations when relying on ConvNet-based partition compared to traditional user-defined approaches. ",

Nonetheless, in the area of sound field processing and reconstruction classic methods based on the solutions of wave equation are still widespread. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been proposed as a deep learning paradigm for solving partial differential equations which govern physical phenomena, bridging the gap between purely data-driven and model based methods. Here, we exploit physics-informed neural networks to reconstruct the early part of missing room impulse responses in an uniform linear array. This methodology allows us to exploit the underlying law of acoustics, i.e., the wave equation, forcing the neural network to generate physically meaningful solutions given only a limited number of data points. The results on real measurements show that the proposed model achieves accurate reconstruction and performance in line with respect to state-of-the-art deep-learning and compress sensing techniques while maintaining a lightweight architecture.

We first introduce the risk-sensitive MDP and establish the equivalence between risk-sensitive MDP and regularized robust MDP. This equivalence offers an alternative perspective for addressing the regularized RMDP and enables the design of efficient learning algorithms. Given this equivalence, we further derive the policy gradient theorem for the regularized robust MDP problem and prove the global convergence of the exact policy gradient method under the tabular setting with direct parameterization. We also propose a sample-based offline learning algorithm, namely the robust fitted-Z iteration (RFZI), for a specific regularized robust MDP problem with a KL-divergence regularization term and analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm. Our results are also supported by numerical simulations. ",

Our findings point towards a substantial boost in hypothesis generation when using in-context prompting, a benefit that is further accentuated by adversarial prompting.

However, accurately parameterizing these physics is difficult because their functional forms are often unknown, and because the coupled non-linear flow equations contain singularities. We show that deep neural networks embedded as individual terms in the governing coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can robustly discover both of these physics, without any prior knowledge of the true function structure, as a supervised learning task. We optimize a loss function based on the Mach number, rather than the explicitly solved-for 3 conserved variables, and apply a penalty term towards near-diverging solutions. The same neural network architecture is used for learning both the hidden mass-loading and surface area expansion rates. This work further highlights the feasibility of neural ODEs as a promising discovery tool with mechanistic interpretability for non-linear inverse problems. ",

First, we theoretically derive what is essentially the unique generalization to ReLU GNNs of the well-known He-initialization. Our initialization scheme guarantees that the average scale of network outputs and gradients remains order one at initialization. Second, we prove in finite width vanilla ReLU GNNs that oversmoothing is unavoidable at large depth when using fixed aggregation operator, regardless of initialization. We then prove that using residual aggregation operators, obtained by interpolating a fixed aggregation operator with the identity, provably alleviates oversmoothing at initialization. Finally, we show that the common practice of using residual connections with a fixup-type initialization provably avoids correlation collapse in final layer features at initialization. Through ablation studies we find that using the correct initialization, residual aggregation operators, and residual connections in the forward pass significantly and reliably speeds up early training dynamics in deep ReLU GNNs on a variety of tasks.
