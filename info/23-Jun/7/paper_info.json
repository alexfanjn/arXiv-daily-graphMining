    "abstract": "Objective: To pre-train fair and unbiased patient representations from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using a novel weighted loss function that reduces bias and improves fairness in deep representation learning models. Methods: We defined a new loss function, called weighted loss function, in the deep representation learning model to balance the importance of different groups of patients and features. We applied the proposed model, called Fair Patient Model (FPM), to a sample of 34,739 patients from the MIMIC-III dataset and learned patient representations for four clinical outcome prediction tasks. Results: FPM outperformed the baseline models in terms of three fairness metrics: demographic parity, equality of opportunity difference, and equalized odds ratio. FPM also achieved comparable predictive performance with the baselines, with an average accuracy of 0.7912. Feature analysis revealed that FPM captured more information from clinical features than the baselines. Conclusion: FPM is a novel method to pre-train fair and unbiased patient representations from EHR data using a weighted loss function. The learned representations can be used for various downstream tasks in healthcare and can be extended to other domains where bias and fairness are important. ",

    "title": "A Static Evaluation of Code Completion by Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Large language models trained on code have shown great potential to increase productivity of software developers. Several execution-based benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate functional correctness of model-generated code on simple programming problems. Nevertheless, it is expensive to perform the same evaluation on complex real-world projects considering the execution cost. On the contrary, static analysis tools such as linters, which can detect errors without running the program, haven't been well explored for evaluating code generation models. In this work, we propose a static evaluation framework to quantify static errors in Python code completions, by leveraging Abstract Syntax Trees. Compared with execution-based evaluation, our method is not only more efficient, but also applicable to code in the wild. For experiments, we collect code context from open source repos to generate one million function bodies using public models. Our static analysis reveals that Undefined Name and Unused Variable are the most common errors among others made by language models. Through extensive studies, we also show the impact of sampling temperature, model size, and context on static errors in code completions. ",

    "abstract": "Occluded and long-range objects are ubiquitous and challenging for 3D object detection. Point cloud sequence data provide unique opportunities to improve such cases, as an occluded or distant object can be observed from different viewpoints or gets better visibility over time. However, the efficiency and effectiveness in encoding long-term sequence data can still be improved. In this work, we propose MoDAR, using motion forecasting outputs as a type of virtual modality, to augment LiDAR point clouds. The MoDAR modality propagates object information from temporal contexts to a target frame, represented as a set of virtual points, one for each object from a waypoint on a forecasted trajectory. A fused point cloud of both raw sensor points and the virtual points can then be fed to any off-the-shelf point-cloud based 3D object detector. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Dataset, our method significantly improves prior art detectors by using motion forecasting from extra-long sequences (e.g. 18 seconds), achieving new state of the arts, while not adding much computation overhead.

As Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) greatly improves the mapping performance, in this paper, we propose a NeRF-based mapping method that enables higher-quality reconstruction and real-time capability even on edge computers. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical hybrid representation that leverages implicit multiresolution hash encoding aided by explicit octree SDF priors, describing the scene at different levels of detail. This representation allows for fast scene geometry initialization and makes scene geometry easier to learn. Besides, we present a coverage-maximizing keyframe selection strategy to address the forgetting issue and enhance mapping quality, particularly in marginal areas. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to achieve high-quality NeRF-based mapping on edge computers of handheld devices and quadrotors in real-time. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing NeRF-based mapping methods in geometry accuracy, texture realism, and time consumption.

    "abstract": "In many real-world applications, graph-structured data used for training and testing have differences in distribution, such as in high energy physics (HEP) where simulation data used for training may not match real experiments. Graph domain adaptation (GDA) is a method used to address these differences. However, current GDA primarily works by aligning the distributions of node representations output by a single graph neural network encoder shared across the training and testing domains, which may often yield sub-optimal solutions. This work examines different impacts of distribution shifts caused by either graph structure or node attributes and identifies a new type of shift, named conditional structure shift (CSS), which current GDA approaches are provably sub-optimal to deal with. A novel approach, called structural reweighting (StruRW), is proposed to address this issue and is tested on synthetic graphs, four benchmark datasets, and a new application in HEP. StruRW has shown significant performance improvement over the baselines in the settings with large graph structure shifts, and reasonable performance improvement when node attribute shift dominates.

We present a novel approach for discovering evolutionary traits directly from images without relying on trait labels. Our proposed approach, Phylo-NN, encodes the image of an organism into a sequence of quantized feature vectors -- or codes -- where different segments of the sequence capture evolutionary signals at varying ancestry levels in the phylogeny.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to have a fundamental sensitivity to adversarial attacks, perturbations of the input that are imperceptible to humans yet powerful enough to change the visual decision of a model. Adversarial attacks have long been considered the \"Achilles' heel\" of deep learning, which may eventually force a shift in modeling paradigms. Nevertheless, the formidable capabilities of modern large-scale DNNs have somewhat eclipsed these early concerns. Do adversarial attacks continue to pose a threat to DNNs? Here, we investigate how the robustness of DNNs to adversarial attacks has evolved as their accuracy on ImageNet has continued to improve. We measure adversarial robustness in two different ways: First, we measure the smallest adversarial attack needed to cause a model to change its object categorization decision. Second, we measure how aligned successful attacks are with the features that humans find diagnostic for object recognition. We find that adversarial attacks are inducing bigger and more easily detectable changes to image pixels as DNNs grow better on ImageNet, but these attacks are also becoming less aligned with features that humans find diagnostic for recognition. To better understand the source of this trade-off, we turn to the neural harmonizer, a DNN training routine that encourages models to leverage the same features as humans to solve tasks. Harmonized DNNs achieve the best of both worlds and experience attacks that are detectable and affect features that humans find diagnostic for recognition, meaning that attacks on these models are more likely to be rendered ineffective by inducing similar effects on human perception. Our findings suggest that the sensitivity of DNNs to adversarial attacks can be mitigated by DNN scale, data scale, and training routines that align models with biological intelligence. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) models to analyze source code have shown immense promise during the past few years. More recently, self-supervised pre-training has gained traction for learning generic code representations valuable for many downstream SE tasks, such as clone and bug detection. While previous work successfully learned from different code abstractions (e.g., token, AST, graph), we argue that it is also essential to factor in how developers code day-to-day for general-purpose representation learning. On the one hand, human developers tend to write repetitive programs referencing existing code snippets from the current codebase or online resources (e.g., Stack Overflow website) rather than implementing functions from scratch; such behaviors result in a vast number of code clones. In contrast, a deviant clone by mistake might trigger malicious program behaviors. Thus, as a proxy to incorporate developers' coding behavior into the pre-training scheme, we propose to include code clones and their deviants. In particular, we propose CONCORD, a self-supervised, contrastive learning strategy to place benign clones closer in the representation space while moving deviants further apart. We show that CONCORD's clone-aware contrastive learning drastically reduces the need for expensive pre-training resources while improving the performance of downstream SE tasks. We also empirically demonstrate that CONCORD can improve existing pre-trained models to learn better representations that consequently become more efficient in both identifying semantically equivalent programs and differentiating buggy from non-buggy code.

The perturbation is characterized by a sudden change in real-power load demand or generation. The study focuses on analyzing the spread of the perturbation throughout the grid and proposes a measure of spreadability based on GSP. Moreover, the global and local smoothness properties of the difference bus voltage angle graph signals are evaluated for understanding their embedded patterns of spreadability property. It is demonstrated that the global smoothness of the bus voltage angle graph signal follows a quadratic relationship with the perturbation strength, which helps in characterizing the critical perturbation strength after which the power flow diverges indicating a stressed system. The impact of a single bus perturbation on power system graph signals has been investigated through both analytical derivations using the DC power flow model and simulation using the AC power flow model. The results reveal that the proposed measure of spreadability as well as local and global smoothness properties of the graph signals are independent of the perturbation strength and instead mainly depend on the perturbation's location.

Our findings show that both graph heterophily and model architecture exacerbate conditional shifts, leading to performance degradation. To address this, we propose an approach that involves estimating and minimizing the conditional shift for unsupervised domain adaptation on graphs. In our controlled synthetic experiments, our algorithm demonstrates robustness towards distribution shift, resulting in up to 10% absolute ROC AUC improvement versus the second-best algorithm. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments on both node classification and graph classification show its robust performance under various distribution shifts. ",

Under-counted tensor completion (UC-TC) is well-motivated for many data analytics tasks, e.g., inferring the case numbers of infectious diseases at unobserved locations from under-counted case numbers in neighboring regions. However, existing methods for similar problems often lack supports in theory, making it hard to understand the underlying principles and conditions beyond empirical successes. In this work, a low-rank Poisson tensor model with an expressive unknown nonlinear side information extractor is proposed for under-counted multi-aspect data. A joint low-rank tensor completion and neural network learning algorithm is designed to recover the model. Moreover, the UC-TC formulation is supported by theoretical analysis showing that the fully counted entries of the tensor and each entry's under-counting probability can be provably recovered from partial observations -- under reasonable conditions. To our best knowledge, the result is the first to offer theoretical supports for under-counted multi-aspect data completion. Simulations and real-data experiments corroborate the theoretical claims.

Indeed, in this latter setting the learning is typically unsupervised because outlier data is not available during training, and new approaches for this case need to be investigated. We propose a new prior that aims at learning a robust likelihood for the novelty test, as a defense against attacks. We also integrate the same prior with a state-of-the-art novelty detection approach. Because of the geometric properties of that approach, the resulting robust training is computationally very efficient.

Observational approaches struggle because of the non-stationarity of causal links in dynamic environments, and the sparsity of causal interactions while requiring the approaches to work in an online fashion. Meanwhile interventional approaches are impractical as a vehicle cannot experiment with its actions on a public road. To counter the issue of non-stationarity we reformulate the problem in terms of extracted events, while the previously mentioned restriction upon interventions can be overcome with the use of counterfactual simulation. We present three variants of the proposed counterfactual causal discovery method and evaluate these against state of the art observational temporal causal discovery methods across 3396 causal scenes extracted from a real world driving dataset. We find that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state of the art on the proposed task quantitatively and can offer additional insights by comparing the outcome of an alternate series of decisions in a way that observational and interventional approaches cannot.

Its key to success is the negative sharing strategy, in which every instance serves as a negative for the others within the mini-batch. Recent studies aim to improve performance by sampling hard negatives \\textit{within the current mini-batch}, whose quality is bounded by the mini-batch itself. In this work, we propose to improve contrastive learning by sampling mini-batches from the input data.

To make each mini-batch have fewer false negatives, we design the proximity graph of randomly-selected instances. To form the mini-batch, we leverage random walk with restart on the proximity graph to help sample hard-to-distinguish instances. BatchSampler is a simple and general technique that can be directly plugged into existing contrastive learning models in vision, language, and graphs. Extensive experiments on datasets of three modalities show that BatchSampler can consistently improve the performance of powerful contrastive models, as shown by significant improvements of SimCLR on ImageNet-100, SimCSE on STS (language), and GraphCL and MVGRL on graph datasets.

State-of-the-art approaches regress trajectories either in a one-shot or step-wise manner. Although one-shot approaches are usually preferred for their simplicity, they relinquish powerful self-supervision schemes that can be constructed by chaining multiple time-steps. We address this issue by proposing a middle-ground where multiple trajectory segments are chained together. Our proposed Multi-Branch Self-Supervised Predictor receives additional training on new predictions starting at intermediate future segments. In addition, the model 'imagines' the latent context and 'predicts the past' while combining multi-modal trajectories in a tree-like manner.

    "abstract": "Multi-person motion prediction is a challenging task, especially for real-world scenarios of densely interacted persons. Most previous works have been devoted to studying the case of weak interactions (e.g., hand-shaking), which typically forecast each human pose in isolation. In this paper, we focus on motion prediction for multiple persons with extreme collaborations and attempt to explore the relationships between the highly interactive persons' motion trajectories. Specifically, a novel cross-query attention (XQA) module is proposed to bilaterally learn the cross-dependencies between the two pose sequences tailored for this situation. Additionally, we introduce and build a proxy entity to bridge the involved persons, which cooperates with our proposed XQA module and subtly controls the bidirectional information flows, acting as a motion intermediary. We then adapt these designs to a Transformer-based architecture and devise a simple yet effective end-to-end framework called proxy-bridged game Transformer (PGformer) for multi-person interactive motion prediction. The effectiveness of our method has been evaluated on the challenging ExPI dataset, which involves highly interactive actions. We show that our PGformer consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term predictions by a large margin. Besides, our approach can also be compatible with the weakly interacted CMU-Mocap and MuPoTS-3D datasets and achieve encouraging results. Our code will become publicly available upon acceptance. ",

    "abstract": "Tabular data sharing serves as a common method for data exchange. However, sharing sensitive information without adequate privacy protection can compromise individual privacy. Thus, ensuring privacy-preserving data sharing is crucial. Differential privacy (DP) is regarded as the gold standard in data privacy. Despite this, current DP methods tend to generate privacy-preserving tabular datasets that often suffer from limited practical utility due to heavy perturbation and disregard for the tables' utility dynamics. Besides, there has not been much research on selective attribute release, particularly in the context of controlled partially perturbed data sharing. This has significant implications for scenarios such as cross-agency data sharing in real-world situations. We introduce OptimShare: a utility-focused, multi-criteria solution designed to perturb input datasets selectively optimized for specific real-world applications. OptimShare combines the principles of differential privacy, fuzzy logic, and probability theory to establish an integrated tool for privacy-preserving data sharing. Empirical assessments confirm that OptimShare successfully strikes a balance between better data utility and robust privacy, effectively serving various real-world problem scenarios. ",

On the basis of two hypotheses, we suggest an approach for perturbing phase information during the training of time-domain CM systems. Communication networks often employ lossy compression codec that encodes only magnitude information, therefore heavily altering phase information. Also, state-of-the-art CM systems rely on phase information to identify spoofed speech. Thus, we believe the information loss in the phase domain induced by lossy compression codec degrades the performance of the unseen channel. We first establish the dependence of time-domain CM systems on phase information by perturbing phase in evaluation, showing strong degradation. Then, we demonstrated that perturbing phase during training leads to a significant performance improvement, whereas perturbing magnitude leads to further degradation. ",

Therefore, we must consider generating OD through mathematical models. Existing works utilize physics laws or machine learning (ML) models to build the association between urban structures and OD flows while these two kinds of methods suffer from the limitation of over-simplicity and poor generalization ability, respectively. In this paper, we propose to adopt physics-informed ML paradigm, which couple the physics scientific knowledge and data-driven ML methods, to construct a model named Origin-Destination Generation Networks (ODGN) for better population mobility modeling by leveraging the complementary strengths of combining physics and ML methods. Specifically, we first build a Multi-view Graph Attention Networks (MGAT) to capture the urban features of every region and then use a gravity-guided predictor to obtain OD flow between every two regions. Furthermore, we use a conditional GAN training strategy and design a sequence-based discriminator to consider the overall topological features of OD as a network.

    "abstract": "An accurate prediction of watch time has been of vital importance to enhance user engagement in video recommender systems. To achieve this, there are four properties that a watch time prediction framework should satisfy: first, despite its continuous value, watch time is also an ordinal variable and the relative ordering between its values reflects the differences in user preferences. Therefore the ordinal relations should be reflected in watch time predictions. Second, the conditional dependence between the video-watching behaviors should be captured in the model. For instance, one has to watch half of the video before he/she finishes watching the whole video. Third, modeling watch time with a point estimation ignores the fact that models might give results with high uncertainty and this could cause bad cases in recommender systems. Therefore the framework should be aware of prediction uncertainty. Forth, the real-life recommender systems suffer from severe bias amplifications thus an estimation without bias amplification is expected. Therefore we propose TPM for watch time prediction. Specifically, the ordinal ranks of watch time are introduced into TPM and the problem is decomposed into a series of conditional dependent classification tasks which are organized into a tree structure. The expectation of watch time can be generated by traversing the tree and the variance of watch time predictions is explicitly introduced into the objective function as a measurement for uncertainty. Moreover, we illustrate that backdoor adjustment can be seamlessly incorporated into TPM, which alleviates bias amplifications. Extensive offline evaluations have been conducted in public datasets and TPM have been deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million DAUs. The results indicate that TPM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and indeed improves video consumption significantly. ",

Forecasting the internet traffic demand helps to shed light on the future traffic trend, which is often helpful for ISPs decision-making in network planning activities and investments. Besides, the capability to understand future trend contributes to managing regular and long-term operations. This study aims to predict the network traffic volume demand using deep sequence methods that incorporate Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) based noise reduction, Empirical rule based outlier detection, and $K$-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) based outlier mitigation. In contrast to the former studies, the proposed model does not rely on a particular EMD decomposed component called Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) for signal denoising. In our proposed traffic prediction model, we used an average of all IMFs components for signal denoising. Moreover, the abnormal data points are replaced by $K$ nearest data points average, and the value for $K$ has been optimized based on the KNN regressor prediction error measured in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Finally, we selected the best time-lagged feature subset for our prediction model based on AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. Our experiments are conducted on real-world internet traffic datasets from industry, and the proposed method is compared with various traditional deep sequence baseline models.

However, their performance is limited by insufficient contextual information aggregation, as they struggle to fully capture the implicit contextual dependency relationships among feature maps at different levels. Additionally, researchers have utilized pre-trained denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for training lightweight CD classifiers. Nevertheless, training a DDPM to generate intricately detailed, multi-channel remote sensing images requires months of training time and a substantial volume of unlabeled remote sensing datasets, making it significantly more complex than generating a single-channel change map. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end DDPM-based model architecture called change-aware diffusion model (CADM), which can be trained using a limited annotated dataset quickly. Furthermore, we introduce dynamic difference conditional encoding to enhance step-wise regional attention in DDPM for bitemporal images in CD datasets. This method establishes state-adaptive conditions for each sampling step, emphasizing two main innovative points of our model: 1) its end-to-end nature and 2) difference conditional encoding. We evaluate CADM on four remote sensing CD tasks with different ground scenarios, including CDD, WHU, Levier, and GVLM. Experimental results demonstrate that CADM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, indicating the generalization and effectiveness of the proposed model. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks have been proven to be potential threats to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and many methods are proposed to defend against adversarial attacks. However, while enhancing the robustness, the clean accuracy will decline to a certain extent, implying a trade-off existed between the accuracy and robustness. In this paper, we firstly empirically find an obvious distinction between standard and robust models in the filters' weight distribution of the same architecture, and then theoretically explain this phenomenon in terms of the gradient regularization, which shows this difference is an intrinsic property for DNNs, and thus a static network architecture is difficult to improve the accuracy and robustness at the same time. Secondly, based on this observation, we propose a sample-wise dynamic network architecture named Adversarial Weight-Varied Network (AW-Net), which focuses on dealing with clean and adversarial examples with a ``divide and rule\" weight strategy. The AW-Net dynamically adjusts network's weights based on regulation signals generated by an adversarial detector, which is directly influenced by the input sample. Benefiting from the dynamic network architecture, clean and adversarial examples can be processed with different network weights, which provides the potentiality to enhance the accuracy and robustness simultaneously. A series of experiments demonstrate that our AW-Net is architecture-friendly to handle both clean and adversarial examples and can achieve better trade-off performance than state-of-the-art robust models.

Our results indicate that the proposed learning-based approach can outperform a classical greedy approximation algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalization capability of the graph convolutional network across datasets and its ability to scale to graphs of higher order than those on which it was trained.

To systematically study the task, we introduce two datasets: one with synthetic bugs derived from semantics-altering operator changes (buggy-HumanEval) and one with realistic bugs derived from user submissions to coding problems (buggy-FixEval). We find that the presence of potential bugs significantly degrades the generation performance of the high-performing Code-LLMs. For instance, the passing rates of CodeGen-2B-mono on test cases of buggy-HumanEval drop more than 50% given a single potential bug in the context. Finally, we investigate several post-hoc methods for mitigating the adverse effect of potential bugs and find that there remains a large gap in post-mitigation performance. ",

Among the widely used data resources, mobile phone data is the one passively collected and has the largest coverage in the population. However, mobile operators cannot pinpoint one user within meters, leading to the difficulties in activity inference. To that end, we propose a data analysis framework to identify user's activity via coupling the mobile phone data with location-based social networks (LBSN) data. The two datasets are integrated into a Bayesian inference module, considering people's circadian rhythms in both time and space. Specifically, the framework considers the pattern of arrival time to each type of facility and the spatial distribution of facilities. The former can be observed from the LBSN Data and the latter is provided by the points of interest (POIs) dataset. Taking Shanghai as an example, we reconstruct the activity chains of 1,000,000 active mobile phone users and analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of each activity type. We assess the results with some official surveys and a real-world check-in dataset collected in Shanghai, indicating that the proposed method can capture and analyze human activities effectively. Next, we cluster users' inferred activity chains with a topic model to understand the behavior of different groups of users. This data analysis framework provides an example of reconstructing and understanding the activity of the population at an urban scale with big data fusion. ",

Specifically, we leverage the meta-knowledge across the entire process, where Meta Triple Attention and Meta Temporal Pooling are presented respectively to adaptively capture omni-scale dependency from spatial/channel/temporal dimensions simultaneously and to adaptively aggregate temporal information through integrating the merits of three complementary temporal aggregation methods.

Existing methods partly address this issue through feature imputation. However, these techniques (i) assume uniformity of feature set across nodes, (ii) are transductive by nature, and (iii) fail to work when features are added or removed over time. In this work, we address these limitations through a novel GNN framework called GRAFENNE. GRAFENNE performs a novel allotropic transformation on the original graph, wherein the nodes and features are decoupled through a bipartite encoding. Through a carefully chosen message passing framework on the allotropic transformation, we make the model parameter size independent of the number of features and thereby inductive to both unseen nodes and features. We prove that GRAFENNE is at least as expressive as any of the existing message-passing GNNs in terms of Weisfeiler-Leman tests, and therefore, the additional inductivity to unseen features does not come at the cost of expressivity. In addition, as demonstrated over four real-world graphs, GRAFENNE empowers the underlying GNN with high empirical efficacy and the ability to learn in continual fashion over streaming feature sets.

    "abstract": "Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) based perception systems have been the foundation in supporting many industrial applications and domains, such as self-driving cars, robotic arms, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Over the past few years, the fast progress in data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) has brought a fast-increasing trend to empower MSF systems by deep learning techniques to further improve performance, especially on intelligent systems and their perception systems. Although quite a few AI-enabled MSF perception systems and techniques have been proposed, up to the present, limited benchmarks that focus on MSF perception are publicly available. Given that many intelligent systems such as self-driving cars are operated in safety-critical contexts where perception systems play an important role, there comes an urgent need for a more in-depth understanding of the performance and reliability of these MSF systems. To bridge this gap, we initiate an early step in this direction and construct a public benchmark of AI-enabled MSF-based perception systems including three commonly adopted tasks (i.e., object detection, object tracking, and depth completion). Based on this, to comprehensively understand MSF systems' robustness and reliability, we design 14 common and realistic corruption patterns to synthesize large-scale corrupted datasets. We further perform a systematic evaluation of these systems through our large-scale evaluation. Our results reveal the vulnerability of the current AI-enabled MSF perception systems, calling for researchers and practitioners to take robustness and reliability into account when designing AI-enabled MSF.

    "abstract": "Deep graph generative modeling has gained enormous attraction in recent years due to its impressive ability to directly learn the underlying hidden graph distribution. Despite their initial success, these techniques, like much of the existing deep generative methods, require a large number of training samples to learn a good model. Unfortunately, large number of training samples may not always be available in scenarios such as drug discovery for rare diseases. At the same time, recent advances in few-shot learning have opened door to applications where available training data is limited. In this work, we introduce the hitherto unexplored paradigm of few-shot graph generative modeling. Towards this, we develop GSHOT, a meta-learning based framework for few-shot labeled graph generative modeling. GSHOT learns to transfer meta-knowledge from similar auxiliary graph datasets. Utilizing these prior experiences, GSHOT quickly adapts to an unseen graph dataset through self-paced fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments on datasets from diverse domains having limited training samples, we establish that GSHOT generates graphs of superior fidelity compared to existing baselines. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper we deal with the problem of computing the exact crossing number of almost planar graphs and the closely related problem of computing the exact anchored crossing number of a pair of planar graphs. It was shown by [Cabello and Mohar, 2013] that both problems are NP-hard; although they required an unbounded number of high-degree vertices (in the first problem) or an unbounded number of anchors (in the second problem) to prove their result. Somehow surprisingly, only three vertices of degree greater than 3, or only three anchors, are sufficient to maintain hardness of these problems, as we prove here. The new result also improves the previous result on hardness of joint crossing number on surfaces by [Hlin\\v{e}n\\'y and Salazar, 2015]. Our result is best possible in the anchored case since the anchored crossing number of a pair of planar graphs with two anchors each is trivial, and close to being best possible in the almost planar case since the crossing number is efficiently computable for almost planar graphs of maximum degree 3 [Riskin 1996, Cabello and Mohar 2011].

    "abstract": "Anomaly Detection is challenging as usually only the normal samples are seen during training and the detector needs to discover anomalies on-the-fly. The recently proposed deep-learning-based approaches could somehow alleviate the problem but there is still a long way to go in obtaining an industrial-class anomaly detector for real-world applications. On the other hand, in some particular AD tasks, a few anomalous samples are labeled manually for achieving higher accuracy. However, this performance gain is at the cost of considerable annotation efforts, which can be intractable in many practical scenarios. In this work, the above two problems are addressed in a unified framework. Firstly, inspired by the success of the patch-matching-based AD algorithms, we train a sliding vision transformer over the residuals generated by a novel position-constrained patch-matching. Secondly, the conventional pixel-wise segmentation problem is cast into a block-wise classification problem. Thus the sliding transformer can attain even higher accuracy with much less annotation labor. Thirdly, to further reduce the labeling cost, we propose to label the anomalous regions using only bounding boxes. The unlabeled regions caused by the weak labels are effectively exploited using a highly-customized semi-supervised learning scheme equipped with two novel data augmentation methods. The proposed method outperforms all the state-of-the-art approaches using all the evaluation metrics in both the unsupervised and supervised scenarios. On the popular MVTec-AD dataset, our SemiREST algorithm obtains the Average Precision (AP) of 81.2% in the unsupervised condition and 84.4% AP for supervised anomaly detection. Surprisingly, with the bounding-box-based semi-supervisions, SemiREST still outperforms the SOTA methods with full supervision (83.8% AP) on MVTec-AD. ",

In order to incorporate user input into the model, we explore the use of a combination of simple data augmentation methods to obtain larger data batches for each newly annotated data instance and implement continual learning methods to prevent catastrophic forgetting from repeated updates. For our experiments, we split a domain-specific image captioning dataset, namely VizWiz, into non-overlapping parts to simulate an incremental input flow for continually adapting the model to new data. We find that, while data augmentation worsens results, even when relatively small amounts of data are available, episodic memory is an effective strategy to retain knowledge from previously seen clusters.

Twitter as one of the most popular SNs, with an open and democratic character, enables a transparent discussion among its large user base. Unfortunately, this often leads to Twitter's policy violations, propaganda, abusive actions, civil integrity violation, and consequently to user accounts' suspension and deletion. This study focuses on the Twitter suspension mechanism and the analysis of shared content and features of the user accounts that may lead to this. Toward this goal, we have obtained a dataset containing 107.7M tweets, originating from 9.8 million users, using Twitter API. We extract the categories of shared content of the suspended accounts and explain their characteristics, through the extraction of text embeddings in junction with cosine similarity clustering. Our results reveal scam campaigns taking advantage of trending topics regarding the Russia-Ukrainian conflict for Bitcoin and Ethereum fraud, spam, and advertisement campaigns. Additionally, we apply a machine learning methodology including a SHapley Additive explainability model to understand and explain how user accounts get suspended. ",

    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL), as a self-supervised learning method, can solve the problem of annotated data scarcity. It mines explicit features in unannotated graphs to generate favorable graph representations for downstream tasks. Most existing GCL methods focus on the design of graph augmentation strategies and mutual information estimation operations. Graph augmentation produces augmented views by graph perturbations. These views preserve a locally similar structure and exploit explicit features. However, these methods have not considered the interaction existing in subgraphs. To explore the impact of substructure interactions on graph representations, we propose a novel framework called subgraph network-based contrastive learning (SGNCL). SGNCL applies a subgraph network generation strategy to produce augmented views. This strategy converts the original graph into an Edge-to-Node mapping network with both topological and attribute features. The single-shot augmented view is a first-order subgraph network that mines the interaction between nodes, node-edge, and edges. In addition, we also investigate the impact of the second-order subgraph augmentation on mining graph structure interactions, and further, propose a contrastive objective that fuses the first-order and second-order subgraph information. We compare SGNCL with classical and state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning methods on multiple benchmark datasets of different domains. Extensive experiments show that SGNCL achieves competitive or better performance (top three) on all datasets in unsupervised learning settings. Furthermore, SGNCL achieves the best average gain of 6.9\\% in transfer learning compared to the best method. Finally, experiments also demonstrate that mining substructure interactions have positive implications for graph contrastive learning. ",

The basic idea of LoD is relation diffusion and sampling sub-logic by random walking as well as a special training mechanism called gradient adaption. Besides, LoD is accompanied by a novel loss function to further achieve the robust logical diffusion when facing noisy data in training or testing sets. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of mainstream knowledge graph reasoning models with LoD over state-of-the-art. Moreover, our ablation study proves the general effectiveness of LoD on the noise-rich knowledge graph. ",

However, existing traffic models for SNC cannot effectively represent the complicated nature of real-world network traffic such as dramatic burstiness. To conquer this challenge, we propose an adaptive spatial-temporal traffic model: dMAPAR-HMM. Specifically, we model the temporal on-off switching process as a dual Markovian arrival process (dMAP) and the arrivals during the on phases as an autoregressive hidden Markov model (AR-HMM). The dMAPAR-HMM model fits in with the MGF-SNC analysis framework, unifies various state-of-the-art arrival models, and matches real-world data more closely. We perform extensive experiments with real-world traces under different network topologies and utilization levels. Experimental results show that dMAPAR-HMM significantly outperforms prevailing models in MGF-SNC. ",

Despite achieving solid results, several state-of-the-art methods rely on the penultimate or last layer outputs only, leaving behind valuable information for OOD detection. Methods that explore the multiple layers either require a special architecture or a supervised objective to do so. This work adopts an original approach based on a functional view of the network that exploits the sample's trajectories through the various layers and their statistical dependencies. It goes beyond multivariate features aggregation and introduces a baseline rooted in functional anomaly detection. In this new framework, OOD detection translates into detecting samples whose trajectories differ from the typical behavior characterized by the training set. We validate our method and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in OOD detection compared to strong state-of-the-art baselines on computer vision benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction serves as a fundamental component in online advertising. A common practice is to train a CTR model on advertisement (ad) impressions with user feedback. Since ad impressions are purposely selected by the model itself, their distribution differs from the inference distribution and thus exhibits sample selection bias (SSB) that affects model performance. Existing studies on SSB mainly employ sample re-weighting techniques which suffer from high variance and poor model calibration. Another line of work relies on costly uniform data that is inadequate to train industrial models. Thus mitigating SSB in industrial models with a uniform-data-free framework is worth exploring. Fortunately, many platforms display mixed results of organic items (i.e., recommendations) and sponsored items (i.e., ads) to users, where impressions of ads and recommendations are selected by different systems but share the same user decision rationales. Based on the above characteristics, we propose to leverage recommendations samples as a free lunch to mitigate SSB for ads CTR model (Rec4Ad). After elaborating data augmentation, Rec4Ad learns disentangled representations with alignment and decorrelation modules for enhancement. When deployed in Taobao display advertising system, Rec4Ad achieves substantial gains in key business metrics, with a lift of up to +6.6\\% CTR and +2.9\\% RPM. ",

It divides each epoch into one Key-Block and multiple Micro-Blocks, effectively improving transaction processing capacity. Bitcoin-NG adopts a special incentive mechanism (i.e., the transaction fees in each epoch are split to the current and next leader) to maintain its security. However, there are some limitations to the existing incentive analysis of Bitcoin-NG in recent works. First, the incentive division method of Bitcoin-NG only includes some specific mining attack strategies of adversary, while ignoring more stubborn attack strategies. Second, once adversaries find a whale transaction, they will deviate from honest mining strategy to obtain extra reward. In this paper, we are committed to solving these two limitations. First, we propose a novel mining strategy named Greedy-Mine attack. Then, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to analyze the competition of honest miners and adversaries. Furthermore, we analysis the extra reward of adversaries and summarize the mining power proportion range required for malicious adversaries to launch Greedy-Mine to obtain extra returns. Finally, we make a backward-compatibility progressive modification to Bitcoin-NG protocol that would raise the threshold of propagation factor from 0 to 1. Meanwhile, we get the winning condition of adversaries when adopting Greedy-Mine, compared with honest mining. Simulation and experimental results indicate that Bitcoin-NG is not incentive compatible, which is vulnerable to Greedy-Mine attack. ",

    "abstract": "The low-cost, user-friendly, and convenient nature of Automatic Fingerprint Recognition Systems (AFRS) makes them suitable for a wide range of applications. This spreading use of AFRS also makes them vulnerable to various security threats. Presentation Attack (PA) or spoofing is one of the threats which is caused by presenting a spoof of a genuine fingerprint to the sensor of AFRS. Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detection (FPAD) is a countermeasure intended to protect AFRS against fake or spoof fingerprints created using various fabrication materials. In this paper, we have proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based technique that uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to augment the dataset with spoof samples generated from the proposed Open Patch Generator (OPG). This OPG is capable of generating realistic fingerprint samples which have no resemblance to the existing spoof fingerprint samples generated with other materials. The augmented dataset is fed to the DenseNet classifier which helps in increasing the performance of the Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) module for the various real-world attacks possible with unknown spoof materials. Experimental evaluations of the proposed approach are carried out on the Liveness Detection (LivDet) 2015, 2017, and 2019 competition databases. An overall accuracy of 96.20\\%, 94.97\\%, and 92.90\\% has been achieved on the LivDet 2015, 2017, and 2019 databases, respectively under the LivDet protocol scenarios. The performance of the proposed PAD model is also validated in the cross-material and cross-sensor attack paradigm which further exhibits its capability to be used under real-world attack scenarios.

    "abstract": "Understanding the human-object interactions (HOIs) from a video is essential to fully comprehend a visual scene. This line of research has been addressed by detecting HOIs from images and lately from videos. However, the video-based HOI anticipation task in the third-person view remains understudied. In this paper, we design a framework to detect current HOIs and anticipate future HOIs in videos. We propose to leverage human gaze information since people often fixate on an object before interacting with it. These gaze features together with the scene contexts and the visual appearances of human-object pairs are fused through a spatio-temporal transformer. To evaluate the model in the HOI anticipation task in a multi-person scenario, we propose a set of person-wise multi-label metrics. Our model is trained and validated on the VidHOI dataset, which contains videos capturing daily life and is currently the largest video HOI dataset. Experimental results in the HOI detection task show that our approach improves the baseline by a great margin of 36.3% relatively. Moreover, we conduct an extensive ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our modifications and extensions to the spatio-temporal transformer.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) trains machine learning models on data distributed across multiple devices, avoiding data transfer to a central location. This improves privacy, reduces communication costs, and enhances model performance. However, FL is prone to poisoning attacks, which can be untargeted aiming to reduce the model performance, or targeted, so-called backdoors, which add adversarial behavior that can be triggered with appropriately crafted inputs. Striving for stealthiness, backdoor attacks are harder to deal with. Mitigation techniques against poisoning attacks rely on monitoring certain metrics and filtering malicious model updates. However, previous works didn't consider real-world adversaries and data distributions. To support our statement, we define a new notion of strong adaptive adversaries that can simultaneously adapt to multiple objectives and demonstrate through extensive tests, that existing defense methods can be circumvented in this adversary model. We also demonstrate, that existing defenses have limited effectiveness when no assumptions are made about underlying data distributions. To address realistic scenarios and adversary models, we propose Metric-Cascades (MESAS) a new defense that leverages multiple detection metrics simultaneously for the filtering of poisoned model updates. This approach forces adaptive attackers into a heavy multi-objective optimization problem, and our evaluation with nine backdoors and three datasets shows that even our strong adaptive attacker cannot evade MESAS's detection. We show that MESAS outperforms existing defenses in distinguishing backdoors from distortions originating from different data distributions within and across the clients. Overall, MESAS is the first defense that is robust against strong adaptive adversaries and is effective in real-world data scenarios while introducing a low overhead of 24.37s on average. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are an important tool for representing complex relationships between entities in the biomedical domain. Several methods have been proposed for learning embeddings that can be used to predict new links in such graphs. Some methods ignore valuable attribute data associated with entities in biomedical KGs, such as protein sequences, or molecular graphs. Other works incorporate such data, but assume that entities can be represented with the same data modality. This is not always the case for biomedical KGs, where entities exhibit heterogeneous modalities that are central to their representation in the subject domain. We propose a modular framework for learning embeddings in KGs with entity attributes, that allows encoding attribute data of different modalities while also supporting entities with missing attributes. We additionally propose an efficient pretraining strategy for reducing the required training runtime. We train models using a biomedical KG containing approximately 2 million triples, and evaluate the performance of the resulting entity embeddings on the tasks of link prediction, and drug-protein interaction prediction, comparing against methods that do not take attribute data into account. In the standard link prediction evaluation, the proposed method results in competitive, yet lower performance than baselines that do not use attribute data. When evaluated in the task of drug-protein interaction prediction, the method compares favorably with the baselines. We find settings involving low degree entities, which make up for a substantial amount of the set of entities in the KG, where our method outperforms the baselines. Our proposed pretraining strategy yields significantly higher performance while reducing the required training runtime. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/elsevier-AI-Lab/BioBLP .

In this paper we explore a data-efficient alternative using maps of dynamics (MoD) to represent place-dependent multi-modal spatial motion patterns, learned from prior observations. Our approach can perform efficient human motion prediction in the long-term perspective of up to 60 seconds. We quantitatively evaluate its accuracy with limited amount of training data in comparison to an LSTM-based baseline, and qualitatively show that the predicted trajectories reflect the natural semantic properties of the environment, e.g. the locations of short- and long-term goals, navigation in narrow passages, around obstacles, etc. ",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks are a type of artificial neural networks in which communication between neurons is only made of events, also called spikes. This property allows neural networks to make asynchronous and sparse computations and therefore to drastically decrease energy consumption when run on specialized hardware. However, training such networks is known to be difficult, mainly due to the non-differentiability of the spike activation, which prevents the use of classical backpropagation. This is because state-of-the-art spiking neural networks are usually derived from biologically-inspired neuron models, to which are applied machine learning methods for training. Nowadays, research about spiking neural networks focuses on the design of training algorithms whose goal is to obtain networks that compete with their non-spiking version on specific tasks. In this paper, we attempt the symmetrical approach: we modify the dynamics of a well-known, easily trainable type of recurrent neural network to make it event-based. This new RNN cell, called the Spiking Recurrent Cell, therefore communicates using events, i.e. spikes, while being completely differentiable. Vanilla backpropagation can thus be used to train any network made of such RNN cell. We show that this new network can achieve performance comparable to other types of spiking networks in the MNIST benchmark and its variants, the Fashion-MNIST and the Neuromorphic-MNIST. Moreover, we show that this new cell makes the training of deep spiking networks achievable. ",

Specifically, recent studies show the success of graph neural networks (GNN) for CF is attributed to its low-pass filtering effects. However, current researches lack a study of how different signal components contributes to recommendations, and how to design strategies to properly use them well. To this end, from the view of spectral transformation, we analyze the important factors that a graph filter should consider to achieve better performance. Based on the discoveries, we design JGCF, an efficient and effective method for CF based on Jacobi polynomial bases and frequency decomposition strategies. Extensive experiments on four widely used public datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods, which brings at most 27.06% performance gain on Alibaba-iFashion.

For sets $\\sigma,\\rho$ of non-negative integers, a $(\\sigma,\\rho)$-set of a graph $G$ is a set $S$ of vertices such that $|N(u)\\cap S|\\in \\sigma$ for every $u\\in S$, and $|N(v)\\cap S|\\in \\rho$ for every $v\\not\\in S$. The problem of finding a $(\\sigma,\\rho)$-set (of a certain size) unifies common problems like $\\text{Independent Set}$, $\\text{Dominating Set}$, $\\text{Independent Dominating Set}$, and many others. In an accompanying paper, it is proven that, for all pairs of finite or cofinite sets $(\\sigma,\\rho)$, there is an algorithm that counts $(\\sigma,\\rho)$-sets in time $(c_{\\sigma,\\rho})^{\\text{tw}}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$ (if a tree decomposition of width $\\text{tw}$ is given in the input).

The proposed DeepONet uses a ResUNet in the trunk to encode complex input geometries, and a fully-connected branch network encodes the parametric loads. Additional information fusion is introduced via an element-wise multiplication of the encoded latent space to improve prediction accuracy further. The performance of the proposed DeepONet was compared to two baseline models, a standalone ResUNet and a DeepONet with fully connected networks as the branch and trunk. The results show that ResUNet and the proposed DeepONet share comparable accuracy; both can predict the stress field and accurately identify stress concentration points. However, the novel DeepONet is more memory efficient and allows greater flexibility with framework architecture modifications. The DeepONet with fully connected networks suffers from high prediction error due to its inability to effectively encode the complex, varying geometry. Once trained, all three networks can predict the full stress distribution orders of magnitude faster than finite element simulations. The proposed network can quickly guide preliminary optimization, designs, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, and many other nonlinear analyses that require extensive forward evaluations with variable geometries, loads, and other parameters. This work marks the first time a ResUNet is used as the trunk network in the DeepONet architecture and the first time that DeepONet solves problems with complex, varying input geometries under parametric loads and elasto-plastic material behavior.

These models learn a vector representation of knowledge graph entities and relations, a.k.a. knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). Learning versatile KGEs is desirable as it makes them useful for a broad range of tasks. However, KGEMs are usually trained for a specific task, which makes their embeddings task-dependent. In parallel, the widespread assumption that KGEMs actually create a semantic representation of the underlying entities and relations (e.g., project similar entities closer than dissimilar ones) has been challenged. In this work, we design heuristics for generating protographs -- small, modified versions of a KG that leverage schema-based information. The learnt protograph-based embeddings are meant to encapsulate the semantics of a KG, and can be leveraged in learning KGEs that, in turn, also better capture semantics. Extensive experiments on various evaluation benchmarks demonstrate the soundness of this approach, which we call Modular and Agnostic SCHema-based Integration of protograph Embeddings (MASCHInE). In particular, MASCHInE helps produce more versatile KGEs that yield substantially better performance for entity clustering and node classification tasks. For link prediction, using MASCHInE has little impact on rank-based performance but increases the number of semantically valid predictions. ",

Colonoscopy videos contain richer information than still images, making them a valuable resource for deep learning methods. Great efforts have been made to conduct video polyp detection through multi-frame temporal/spatial aggregation. However, unlike common fixed-camera video, the camera-moving scene in colonoscopy videos can cause rapid video jitters, leading to unstable training for existing video detection models. Additionally, the concealed nature of some polyps and the complex background environment further hinder the performance of existing video detectors. In this paper, we propose the \\textbf{YONA} (\\textbf{Y}ou \\textbf{O}nly \\textbf{N}eed one \\textbf{A}djacent Reference-frame) method, an efficient end-to-end training framework for video polyp detection. YONA fully exploits the information of one previous adjacent frame and conducts polyp detection on the current frame without multi-frame collaborations. Specifically, for the foreground, YONA adaptively aligns the current frame's channel activation patterns with its adjacent reference frames according to their foreground similarity. For the background, YONA conducts background dynamic alignment guided by inter-frame difference to eliminate the invalid features produced by drastic spatial jitters. Moreover, YONA applies cross-frame contrastive learning during training, leveraging the ground truth bounding box to improve the model's perception of polyp and background. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on three public challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed YONA outperforms previous state-of-the-art competitors by a large margin in both accuracy and speed.

To take full advantage of low power consumption and improve the efficiency of these models further, the pruning methods have been explored to find sparse SNNs without redundancy connections after training. However, parameter redundancy still hinders the efficiency of SNNs during training. In the human brain, the rewiring process of neural networks is highly dynamic, while synaptic connections maintain relatively sparse during brain development. Inspired by this, here we propose an efficient evolutionary structure learning (ESL) framework for SNNs, named ESL-SNNs, to implement the sparse SNN training from scratch. The pruning and regeneration of synaptic connections in SNNs evolve dynamically during learning, yet keep the structural sparsity at a certain level. As a result, the ESL-SNNs can search for optimal sparse connectivity by exploring all possible parameters across time. Our experiments show that the proposed ESL-SNNs framework is able to learn SNNs with sparse structures effectively while reducing the limited accuracy. The ESL-SNNs achieve merely 0.28% accuracy loss with 10% connection density on the DVS-Cifar10 dataset. Our work presents a brand-new approach for sparse training of SNNs from scratch with biologically plausible evolutionary mechanisms, closing the gap in the expressibility between sparse training and dense training. Hence, it has great potential for SNN lightweight training and inference with low power consumption and small memory usage. ",

However, the graph isomorphism objective is inherently binary, not giving insights into the degree of similarity between two given graphs. This work resolves this issue by considering continuous extensions of both $1$-WL and MPNNs to graphons. Concretely, we show that the continuous variant of $1$-WL delivers an accurate topological characterization of the expressive power of MPNNs on graphons, revealing which graphs these networks can distinguish and the level of difficulty in separating them. We identify the finest topology where MPNNs separate points and prove a universal approximation theorem. Consequently, we provide a theoretical framework for graph and graphon similarity combining various topological variants of classical characterizations of the $1$-WL. In particular, we characterize the expressive power of MPNNs in terms of the tree distance, which is a graph distance based on the concepts of fractional isomorphisms, and substructure counts via tree homomorphisms, showing that these concepts have the same expressive power as the $1$-WL and MPNNs on graphons. Empirically, we validate our theoretical findings by showing that randomly initialized MPNNs, without training, exhibit competitive performance compared to their trained counterparts. Moreover, we evaluate different MPNN architectures based on their ability to preserve graph distances, highlighting the significance of our continuous $1$-WL test in understanding MPNNs' expressivity.

As a result, intrusion detection based on deep learning (DL) has been developed to achieve high throughput and high precision. Unlike general deep learning-based scenarios, IoT networks contain benign traffic far more than abnormal traffic, with some rare attacks. However, most existing studies have been focused on sacrificing the detection rate of the majority class in order to improve the detection rate of the minority class in class-imbalanced IoT networks. Although this way can reduce the false negative rate of minority classes, it both wastes resources and reduces the credibility of the intrusion detection systems. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight framework named S2CGAN-IDS. The proposed framework leverages the distribution characteristics of network traffic to expand the number of minority categories in both data space and feature space, resulting in a substantial increase in the detection rate of minority categories while simultaneously ensuring the detection precision of majority categories. To reduce the impact of sparsity on the experiments, the CICIDS2017 numeric dataset is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable aspect of secure AI when deploying machine learning models in real-world applications. Previous paradigms either explore better scoring functions or utilize the knowledge of outliers to equip the models with the ability of OOD detection. However, few of them pay attention to the intrinsic OOD detection capability of the given model. In this work, we generally discover the existence of an intermediate stage of a model trained on in-distribution (ID) data having higher OOD detection performance than that of its final stage across different settings, and further identify one critical data-level attribution to be learning with the atypical samples. Based on such insights, we propose a novel method, Unleashing Mask, which aims to restore the OOD discriminative capabilities of the well-trained model with ID data. Our method utilizes a mask to figure out the memorized atypical samples, and then finetune the model or prune it with the introduced mask to forget them. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/Unleashing-Mask. ",

    "abstract": "Most research on hate speech detection has focused on English where a sizeable amount of labeled training data is available. However, to expand hate speech detection into more languages, approaches that require minimal training data are needed. In this paper, we test whether natural language inference (NLI) models which perform well in zero- and few-shot settings can benefit hate speech detection performance in scenarios where only a limited amount of labeled data is available in the target language. Our evaluation on five languages demonstrates large performance improvements of NLI fine-tuning over direct fine-tuning in the target language. However, the effectiveness of previous work that proposed intermediate fine-tuning on English data is hard to match. Only in settings where the English training data does not match the test domain, can our customised NLI-formulation outperform intermediate fine-tuning on English. Based on our extensive experiments, we propose a set of recommendations for hate speech detection in languages where minimal labeled training data is available. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial poisoning attacks pose huge threats to various machine learning applications. Especially, the recent accumulative poisoning attacks show that it is possible to achieve irreparable harm on models via a sequence of imperceptible attacks followed by a trigger batch. Due to the limited data-level discrepancy in real-time data streaming, current defensive methods are indiscriminate in handling the poison and clean samples. In this paper, we dive into the perspective of model dynamics and propose a novel information measure, namely, Memorization Discrepancy, to explore the defense via the model-level information. By implicitly transferring the changes in the data manipulation to that in the model outputs, Memorization Discrepancy can discover the imperceptible poison samples based on their distinct dynamics from the clean samples. We thoroughly explore its properties and propose Discrepancy-aware Sample Correction (DSC) to defend against accumulative poisoning attacks. Extensive experiments comprehensively characterized Memorization Discrepancy and verified its effectiveness. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/Memorization-Discrepancy.

    "abstract": "The increasing reliance on the internet has led to the proliferation of a diverse set of web-browsers and operating systems (OSs) capable of browsing the web. User agent strings (UASs) are a component of web browsing that are transmitted with every Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request. They contain information about the client device and software, which is used by web servers for various purposes such as content negotiation and security. However, due to the proliferation of various browsers and devices, parsing UASs is a non-trivial task due to a lack of standardization of UAS formats. Current rules-based approaches are often brittle and can fail when encountering such non-standard formats. In this work, a novel methodology for parsing UASs using Multi-Headed Attention Based transformers is proposed. The proposed methodology exhibits strong performance in parsing a variety of UASs with differing formats. Furthermore, a framework to utilize parsed UASs to estimate the vulnerability scores for large sections of publicly visible IT networks or regions is also discussed. The methodology present here can also be easily extended or deployed for real-time parsing of logs in enterprise settings. ",

In this paper, we tackle the problem of pragmatic communication with multiple clients with different, and potentially conflicting, objectives. We capture the goal-oriented aspect through the metric of Value of Information (VoI), which considers the estimation of the remote process as well as the timing constraints. However, the most common definition of VoI is simply the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the whole system state, regardless of the relevance for a specific client. Our work aims to overcome this limitation by including different summary statistics, i.e., value functions of the state, for separate clients, and a diversified query process on the client side, expressed through the fact that different applications may request different functions of the process state at different times. A query-aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution based on statically defined VoI can outperform naive approaches by 15-20%. ",

However, most of the existing research treats a cascade as an individual sequence. Actually, the cascades might be correlated with each other due to the shared users or similar topics. Moreover, the preferences of users and semantics of a cascade are usually continuously evolving over time. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time graph learning method for cascade popularity prediction, which first connects different cascades via a universal sequence of user-cascade and user-user interactions and then chronologically learns on the sequence by maintaining the dynamic states of users and cascades. Specifically, for each interaction, we present an evolution learning module to continuously update the dynamic states of the related users and cascade based on their currently encoded messages and previous dynamic states. We also devise a cascade representation learning component to embed the temporal information and structural information carried by the cascade. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of our approach. ",

    "abstract": "The ongoing deep learning revolution has allowed computers to outclass humans in various games and perceive features imperceptible to humans during classification tasks. Current machine learning techniques have clearly distinguished themselves in specialized tasks. However, we have yet to see robots capable of performing multiple tasks at an expert level. Most work in this field is focused on the development of more sophisticated learning algorithms for a robot's controller given a largely static and presupposed robotic design. By focusing on the development of robotic bodies, rather than neural controllers, I have discovered that robots can be designed such that they overcome many of the current pitfalls encountered by neural controllers in multitask settings. Through this discovery, I also present novel metrics to explicitly measure the learning ability of a robotic design and its resistance to common problems such as catastrophic interference. Traditionally, the physical robot design requires human engineers to plan every aspect of the system, which is expensive and often relies on human intuition. In contrast, within the field of evolutionary robotics, evolutionary algorithms are used to automatically create optimized designs, however, such designs are often still limited in their ability to perform in a multitask setting. The metrics created and presented here give a novel path to automated design that allow evolved robots to synergize with their controller to improve the computational efficiency of their learning while overcoming catastrophic interference. Overall, this dissertation intimates the ability to automatically design robots that are more general purpose than current robots and that can perform various tasks while requiring less computation.

The first variant uses spectral features based on the distribution of energy of a node feature signal over the spectrum of the graph. We show that even such a simple approach, having no learned parameters, can yield competitive performance compared to strong neural network and graph kernel baselines. A second, more sophisticated variant is designed to capture multi-scale and localised patterns in the graph by learning spectral graph wavelet filters, obtaining improved performance on synthetic and real-world data sets. Finally, we show that both models produce well calibrated uncertainty estimates, enabling reliable decision making based on the model predictions. ",

    "abstract": "One of the most impactful findings in computational neuroscience over the past decade is that the object recognition accuracy of deep neural networks (DNNs) correlates with their ability to predict neural responses to natural images in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex. This discovery supported the long-held theory that object recognition is a core objective of the visual cortex, and suggested that more accurate DNNs would serve as better models of IT neuron responses to images. Since then, deep learning has undergone a revolution of scale: billion parameter-scale DNNs trained on billions of images are rivaling or outperforming humans at visual tasks including object recognition. Have today's DNNs become more accurate at predicting IT neuron responses to images as they have grown more accurate at object recognition? Surprisingly, across three independent experiments, we find this is not the case. DNNs have become progressively worse models of IT as their accuracy has increased on ImageNet. To understand why DNNs experience this trade-off and evaluate if they are still an appropriate paradigm for modeling the visual system, we turn to recordings of IT that capture spatially resolved maps of neuronal activity elicited by natural images. These neuronal activity maps reveal that DNNs trained on ImageNet learn to rely on different visual features than those encoded by IT and that this problem worsens as their accuracy increases. We successfully resolved this issue with the neural harmonizer, a plug-and-play training routine for DNNs that aligns their learned representations with humans. Our results suggest that harmonized DNNs break the trade-off between ImageNet accuracy and neural prediction accuracy that assails current DNNs and offer a path to more accurate models of biological vision.

Such techniques are critical in risk-based decision-making and planning under uncertainties. Existing approaches are primarily based on parametric or semi-parametric time-series models that are restrictive, difficult to validate, and challenging to adapt to varying conditions. This paper proposes a nonparametric method based on the classic notion of {\\em innovations} pioneered by Norbert Wiener and Gopinath Kallianpur that causally transforms a nonparametric random process to an independent and identical uniformly distributed {\\em innovations process}. We present a machine-learning architecture and a learning algorithm that circumvent two limitations of the original Wiener-Kallianpur innovations representation: (i) the need for known probability distributions of the time series and (ii) the existence of a causal decoder that reproduces the original time series from the innovations representation. We develop a deep-learning approach and a Monte Carlo sampling technique to obtain a generative model for the predicted conditional probability distribution of the time series based on a weak notion of Wiener-Kallianpur innovations representation. The efficacy of the proposed probabilistic forecasting technique is demonstrated on a variety of electricity price datasets, showing marked improvement over leading benchmarks of probabilistic forecasting techniques.

    "abstract": "Virtual health has been acclaimed as a transformative force in healthcare delivery. Yet, its dropout issue is critical that leads to poor health outcomes, increased health, societal, and economic costs. Timely prediction of patient dropout enables stakeholders to take proactive steps to address patients' concerns, potentially improving retention rates. In virtual health, the information asymmetries inherent in its delivery format, between different stakeholders, and across different healthcare delivery systems hinder the performance of existing predictive methods. To resolve those information asymmetries, we propose a Multimodal Dynamic Knowledge-driven Dropout Prediction (MDKDP) framework that learns implicit and explicit knowledge from doctor-patient dialogues and the dynamic and complex networks of various stakeholders in both online and offline healthcare delivery systems. We evaluate MDKDP by partnering with one of the largest virtual health platforms in China. MDKDP improves the F1-score by 3.26 percentage points relative to the best benchmark. Comprehensive robustness analyses show that integrating stakeholder attributes, knowledge dynamics, and compact bilinear pooling significantly improves the performance. Our work provides significant implications for healthcare IT by revealing the value of mining relations and knowledge across different service modalities. Practically, MDKDP offers a novel design artifact for virtual health platforms in patient dropout management. ",

    "abstract": "Conventional time series classification approaches based on bags of patterns or shapelets face significant challenges in dealing with a vast amount of feature candidates from high-dimensional multivariate data. In contrast, deep neural networks can learn low-dimensional features efficiently, and in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown promising results in classifying Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data. A key factor in the success of deep neural networks is this astonishing expressive power. However, this power comes at the cost of complex, black-boxed models, conflicting with the goals of building reliable and human-understandable models. An essential criterion in understanding such predictive deep models involves quantifying the contribution of time-varying input variables to the classification. Hence, in this work, we introduce a new framework for interpreting multivariate time series data by extracting and clustering the input representative patterns that highly activate CNN neurons. This way, we identify each signal's role and dependencies, considering all possible combinations of signals in the MTS input. Then, we construct a graph that captures the temporal relationship between the extracted patterns for each layer. An effective graph merging strategy finds the connection of each node to the previous layer's nodes. Finally, a graph embedding algorithm generates new representations of the created interpretable time-series features. To evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we run extensive experiments on eight datasets of the UCR/UEA archive, along with HAR and PAM datasets. The experiments indicate the benefit of our time-aware graph-based representation in MTS classification while enriching them with more interpretability. ",

A key reason for their success is their ability to accurately model long-range dependencies in spatio-temporal data by learning global convolutions in a computationally efficient manner. To this end, FNOs rely on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), however, DFTs cause visual and spectral artifacts as well as pronounced dissipation when learning operators in spherical coordinates since they incorrectly assume a flat geometry. To overcome this limitation, we generalize FNOs on the sphere, introducing Spherical FNOs (SFNOs) for learning operators on spherical geometries. We apply SFNOs to forecasting atmospheric dynamics, and demonstrate stable auto\\-regressive rollouts for a year of simulated time (1,460 steps), while retaining physically plausible dynamics.

Many recent approaches allow, for example, to sense the driver's drowsiness or awareness of the driving situation. However, so far, this rich information has not been utilized much for improving the effectiveness of support systems. In this paper, we therefore propose a warning system that uses human states in the form of driver errors and can warn users in some cases of upcoming risks several seconds earlier than the state of the art systems not considering human factors. The system consists of a behavior planner Risk Maps which directly changes its prediction of the surrounding driving situation based on the sensed driver errors. By checking if this driver's behavior plan is objectively safe, a more robust and foresighted driver warning is achieved. In different simulations of a dynamic lane change and intersection scenarios, we show how the driver's behavior plan can become unsafe, given the estimate of driver errors, and experimentally validate the advantages of considering human factors.

    "abstract": "For prediction and real-time control tasks, machine-learning (ML)-based digital twins are frequently employed. However, while these models are typically accurate, they are custom-designed for individual systems, making system-to-system (S2S) transferability difficult. This occurs even when substantial similarities exist in the process dynamics across different chemical systems. To address this challenge, we developed a novel time-series-transformer (TST) framework that exploits the powerful transfer learning capabilities inherent in transformer algorithms. This was demonstrated using readily available process data obtained from different crystallizers operating under various operational scenarios. Using this extensive dataset, we trained a TST model (CrystalGPT) to exhibit remarkable S2S transferability not only across all pre-established systems, but also to an unencountered system. CrystalGPT achieved a cumulative error across all systems, which is eight times superior to that of existing ML models. Additionally, we coupled CrystalGPT with a predictive controller to reduce the variance in setpoint tracking to just 1%. ",

    "abstract": "This article focuses on a class of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems where, unlike the growing body of the literature, the objective function is potentially non-linear in the distribution. Existing methods to optimize nonlinear functions in probability space use the Frechet derivatives, which present both theoretical and computational challenges. Motivated by this, we propose an alternative notion for the derivative and corresponding smoothness based on Gateaux (G)-derivative for generic risk measures. These concepts are explained via three running risk measure examples of variance, entropic risk, and risk on finite support sets. We then propose a G-derivative based Frank-Wolfe~(FW) algorithm for generic non-linear optimization problems in probability spaces and establish its convergence under the proposed notion of smoothness in a completely norm-independent manner. We use the set-up of the FW algorithm to devise a methodology to compute a saddle point of the non-linear DRO problem. Finally, for the minimum variance portfolio selection problem we analyze the regularity conditions and compute the FW-oracle in various settings, and validate the theoretical results numerically. ",

    "abstract": "GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme) is the most aggressive type of brain tumor in adults that has a short survival rate even after aggressive treatment with surgery and radiation therapy. The changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients with GBM after radiotherapy are indicative of either radiation-induced necrosis (RN) or recurrent brain tumor (rBT). Screening for rBT and RN at an early stage is crucial for facilitating faster treatment and better outcomes for the patients. Differentiating rBT from RN is challenging as both may present with similar radiological and clinical characteristics on MRI. Moreover, learning-based rBT versus RN classification using MRI may suffer from class imbalance due to lack of patient data. While synthetic data generation using generative models has shown promise to address class imbalance, the underlying data representation may be different in synthetic or augmented data. This study proposes computational modeling with statistically rigorous repeated random sub-sampling to balance the subset sample size for rBT and RN classification. The proposed pipeline includes multiresolution radiomic feature (MRF) extraction followed by feature selection with statistical significance testing (p<0.05). The five-fold cross validation results show the proposed model with MRF features classifies rBT from RN with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8920+-.055. Moreover, considering the dependence between survival time and censor time (where patients are not followed up until death), we demonstrate the feasibility of using MRF radiomic features as a non-invasive biomarker to identify patients who are at higher risk of recurrence or radiation necrosis. The cross-validated results show that the MRF model provides the best overall performance with an AUC of 0.770+-.032. ",

We attached DSD on two state-of-the-art U-shaped backbones, and extensive experiments on two public 3D medical image segmentation datasets (cardiac substructure and brain tumor) demonstrated significant improvement over those backbones. On average, after attaching DSD to the U-shaped backbones, we observed an improvement of 4.25% and 3.15% in Dice similarity score for cardiac substructure and brain tumor segmentation respectively.

    "abstract": "The hybrid architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer are very popular for medical image segmentation. However, it suffers from two challenges. First, although a CNNs branch can capture the local image features using vanilla convolution, it cannot achieve adaptive feature learning. Second, although a Transformer branch can capture the global features, it ignores the channel and cross-dimensional self-attention, resulting in a low segmentation accuracy on complex-content images. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid architecture of convolutional neural networks hand in hand with vision Transformers (CiT-Net) for medical image segmentation. Our network has two advantages. First, we design a dynamic deformable convolution and apply it to the CNNs branch, which overcomes the weak feature extraction ability due to fixed-size convolution kernels and the stiff design of sharing kernel parameters among different inputs. Second, we design a shifted-window adaptive complementary attention module and a compact convolutional projection. We apply them to the Transformer branch to learn the cross-dimensional long-term dependency for medical images. Experimental results show that our CiT-Net provides better medical image segmentation results than popular SOTA methods. Besides, our CiT-Net requires lower parameters and less computational costs and does not rely on pre-training. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/SR0920/CiT-Net. ",

The adjacency matrix of the random $d$-regular graph is a prominent example that has attracted immense interest. A crucial spectral observable is the extremal eigenvalue, which reveals useful geometric properties of the graph. According to the Alon's conjecture, which was verified by Friedman, the (nontrivial) extremal eigenvalue of the random $d$-regular graph is approximately $2\\sqrt{d-1}$. In the present paper, we analyze the extremal spectrum of the random $d$-regular graph (with $d\\ge 3$ fixed) equipped with random edge-weights, and precisely describe its phase transition behavior with respect to the tail of edge-weights. In addition, we establish that the extremal eigenvector is always localized, showing a sharp contrast to the unweighted case where all eigenvectors are delocalized. Our method is robust and inspired by a sparsification technique developed in the context of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi graphs (Ganguly and Nam, '22), which can also be applied to analyze the spectrum of general random matrices whose entries are dependent.

    "abstract": "Accurate and robust medical image segmentation is fundamental and crucial for enhancing the autonomy of computer-aided diagnosis and intervention systems. Medical data collection normally involves different scanners, protocols, and populations, making domain adaptation (DA) a highly demanding research field to alleviate model degradation in the deployment site. To preserve the model performance across multiple testing domains, this work proposes the Curriculum-based Augmented Fourier Domain Adaptation (Curri-AFDA) for robust medical image segmentation. In particular, our curriculum learning strategy is based on the causal relationship of a model under different levels of data shift in the deployment phase, where the higher the shift is, the harder to recognize the variance. Considering this, we progressively introduce more amplitude information from the target domain to the source domain in the frequency space during the curriculum-style training to smoothly schedule the semantic knowledge transfer in an easier-to-harder manner. Besides, we incorporate the training-time chained augmentation mixing to help expand the data distributions while preserving the domain-invariant semantics, which is beneficial for the acquired model to be more robust and generalize better to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on two segmentation tasks of Retina and Nuclei collected from multiple sites and scanners suggest that our proposed method yields superior adaptation and generalization performance. Meanwhile, our approach proves to be more robust under various corruption types and increasing severity levels. In addition, we show our method is also beneficial in the domain-adaptive classification task with skin lesion datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/lofrienger/Curri-AFDA. ",

Recent studies have shown that a tensor-train network (TTN) for VQC, namely TTN-VQC, can improve the representation and generalization powers of VQC. However, the Barren Plateau problem leads to the gradients of the cost function vanishing exponentially small as the number of qubits increases, making it difficult to find the optimal parameters for the VQC. To address this issue, we put forth a new learning approach called Pre+TTN-VQC that builds upon the TTN-VQC architecture by incorporating a pre-trained TTN to alleviate the Barren Plateau problem. The pre-trained TTN allows for efficient fine-tuning of target data, which reduces the depth of the VQC required to achieve good empirical performance and potentially alleviates the training obstacles posed by the Barren Plateau landscape. Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of Pre+TTN-VQC in terms of representation and generalization powers by exploiting the error performance analysis. Moreover, we characterize the optimization performance of Pre+TTN-VQC without the need for the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, thereby enhancing the practicality of implementing quantum neural networks on NISQ devices. We conduct experiments on a handwritten digit classification dataset to corroborate our proposed methods and theorems. ",

Thoracic echocardiography (TTE) can provide sufficient cardiac structure information, evaluate hemodynamics and cardiac function, and is an effective method for atrial septal defect (ASD) examination. This paper aims to study a deep learning method based on cardiac ultrasound video to assist in ASD diagnosis. Materials and methods: We select two standard views of the atrial septum (subAS) and low parasternal four-compartment view (LPS4C) as the two views to identify ASD. We enlist data from 300 children patients as part of a double-blind experiment for five-fold cross-validation to verify the performance of our model. In addition, data from 30 children patients (15 positives and 15 negatives) are collected for clinician testing and compared to our model test results (these 30 samples do not participate in model training). We propose an echocardiography video-based atrial septal defect diagnosis system. In our model, we present a block random selection, maximal agreement decision and frame sampling strategy for training and testing respectively, resNet18 and r3D networks are used to extract the frame features and aggregate them to build a rich video-level representation. Results: We validate our model using our private dataset by five-cross validation. For ASD detection, we achieve 89.33 AUC, 84.95 accuracy, 85.70 sensitivity, 81.51 specificity and 81.99 F1 score. Conclusion: The proposed model is multiple instances learning-based deep learning model for video atrial septal defect detection which effectively improves ASD detection accuracy when compared to the performances of previous networks and clinical doctors.
