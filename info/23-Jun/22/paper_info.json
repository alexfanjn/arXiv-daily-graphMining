    "title": "Neural Shape Diameter Function for Efficient Mesh Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Partitioning a polygonal mesh into meaningful parts can be challenging. Many applications require decomposing such structures for further processing in computer graphics. In the last decade, several methods were proposed to tackle this problem, at the cost of intensive computational times. Recently, machine learning has proven to be effective for the segmentation task on 3D structures. Nevertheless, these state-of-the-art methods are often hardly generalizable and require dividing the learned model into several specific classes of objects to avoid overfitting. We present a data-driven approach leveraging deep learning to encode a mapping function prior to mesh segmentation for multiple applications. Our network reproduces a neighborhood map using our knowledge of the \\textsl{Shape Diameter Function} (SDF) method using similarities among vertex neighborhoods. Our approach is resolution-agnostic as we downsample the input meshes and query the full-resolution structure solely for neighborhood contributions. Using our predicted SDF values, we can inject the resulting structure into a graph-cut algorithm to generate an efficient and robust mesh segmentation while considerably reducing the required computation times.

    "abstract": "3D object reconstruction is important for semantic scene understanding. It is challenging to reconstruct detailed 3D shapes from monocular images directly due to a lack of depth information, occlusion and noise. Most current methods generate deterministic object models without any awareness of the uncertainty of the reconstruction. We tackle this problem by leveraging a neural object representation which learns an object shape distribution from large dataset of 3d object models and maps it into a latent space. We propose a method to model uncertainty as part of the representation and define an uncertainty-aware encoder which generates latent codes with uncertainty directly from individual input images. Further, we propose a method to propagate the uncertainty in the latent code to SDF values and generate a 3d object mesh with local uncertainty for each mesh component. Finally, we propose an incremental fusion method under a Bayesian framework to fuse the latent codes from multi-view observations. We evaluate the system in both synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of uncertainty-based fusion to improve 3D object reconstruction accuracy. ",

    "title": "Focusing on Relevant Responses for Multi-modal Rumor Detection",
    "abstract": "In the absence of an authoritative statement about a rumor, people may expose the truth behind such rumor through their responses on social media. Most rumor detection methods aggregate the information of all the responses and have made great progress. However, due to the different backgrounds of users, the responses have different relevance for discovering th suspicious points hidden in a rumor claim. The methods that focus on all the responding tweets would dilute the effect of the critical ones. Moreover, for a multi-modal rumor claim, the focus of a user may be on several words in the text or an object in the image, so the different modalities should be considered to select the relevant responses and verify the claim. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal rumor detection model, termed Focal Reasoning Model (FoRM), to filter out the irrelevant responses and further conduct fine-grained reasoning with the multi-modal claim and corresponding responses. Concretely, there are two main components in our FoRM: the coarse-grained selection and the fine-grained reasoning. The coarse-grained selection component leverages the post-level features of the responses to verify the claim and learns a relevant score of each response. Based on the relevant scores, the most relevant responses are reserved as the critical ones to the further reasoning. In the fine-grained reasoning component, we design a relation attention module to explore the fine-grained relations, i.e., token-to-token and token-to-object relations, between the reserved responses and the multi-modal claim for finding out the valuable clues. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms all the baselines. ",

    "abstract": "To ensure resilient neural network processing on even unreliable hardware, comprehensive reliability analysis against various hardware faults is generally required before the deep neural network models are deployed, and efficient error injection tools are highly demanded. However, most existing fault injection tools remain rather limited to basic fault injection to neurons and fail to provide fine-grained vulnerability analysis capability. In addition, many of the fault injection tools still need to change the neural network models and make the fault injection closely coupled with normal neural network processing, which further complicates the use of the fault injection tools and slows down the fault simulation. In this work, we propose MRFI, a highly configurable multi-resolution fault injection tool for deep neural networks. It enables users to modify an independent fault configuration file rather than neural network models for the fault injection and vulnerability analysis. Particularly, it integrates extensive fault analysis functionalities from different perspectives and enables multi-resolution investigation of the vulnerability of neural networks. In addition, it does not modify the major neural network computing framework of PyTorch. Hence, it allows parallel processing on GPUs naturally and exhibits fast fault simulation according to our experiments. ",

Obtaining such data is a tedious process and is mainly time consuming, leading to the exploration of new research avenues like synthetic data generation techniques. In this study, we explore the usability of Stable Diffusion 2.1-base for generating synthetic datasets of apple trees for object detection and compare it to a baseline model trained on real-world data. After creating a dataset of realistic apple trees with prompt engineering and utilizing a previously trained Stable Diffusion model, the custom dataset was annotated and evaluated by training a YOLOv5m object detection model to predict apples in a real-world apple detection dataset. YOLOv5m was chosen for its rapid inference time and minimal hardware demands. Results demonstrate that the model trained on generated data is slightly underperforming compared to a baseline model trained on real-world images when evaluated on a set of real-world images. However, these findings remain highly promising, as the average precision difference is only 0.09 and 0.06, respectively. Qualitative results indicate that the model can accurately predict the location of apples, except in cases of heavy shading. These findings illustrate the potential of synthetic data generation techniques as a viable alternative to the collection of extensive training data for object detection models. ",

Discussions are important in collaborative work as they can increase contributor performance and encourage the emergence of shared norms and practices. While disagreements can play a productive role in discussions, they can also lead to conflicts and controversies, which impact contributor well-being and their motivation to engage. We want to understand if and when such phenomena arise in Wikidata, using a mix of quantitative and qualitative analyses to identify the types of topics people disagree about, the most common patterns of interaction, and roles people play when arguing for or against an issue. We find that decisions to create Wikidata properties are much faster than those to delete properties and that more than half of controversial discussions do not lead to consensus. Our analysis suggests that Wikidata is an inclusive community, considering different opinions when making decisions, and that conflict and vandalism are rare in discussions. At the same time, while one-fourth of the editors participating in controversial discussions contribute with legit and insightful opinions about Wikidata's emerging issues, they do not remain engaged in the discussions. We hope our findings will help Wikidata support community decision making, and improve discussion tools and practices. ",

In this paper, we adopt the theory-to-research strategy to extract properties of Complex Systems from research in other fields, mapping them to software systems to create a formal definition of a Complex Software System. We support the evolution of the properties through future validation, and we provide examples of the application of the definition.

    "abstract": "Cutting-edge connected vehicle (CV) technologies have drawn much attention in recent years. The real-time traffic data captured by a CV can be shared with other CVs and data centers so as to open new possibilities for solving diverse transportation problems. However, imagery captured by onboard cameras in a connected environment, are not sufficiently investigated, especially for safety and health-oriented visual perception. In this paper, a bidirectional process of image synthesis and decomposition (BPISD) approach is proposed, and thus a novel self-supervised multi-task learning framework, to simultaneously estimate depth map, atmospheric visibility, airlight, and PM2.5 mass concentration, in which depth map and visibility are considered highly associated with traffic safety, while airlight and PM2.5 mass concentration are directly correlated with human health. Both the training and testing phases of the proposed system solely require a single image as input. Due to the innovative training pipeline, the depth estimation network can manage various levels of visibility conditions and overcome inherent problems in current image-synthesis-based depth estimation, thereby generating high-quality depth maps even in low-visibility situations and further benefiting accurate estimations of visibility, airlight, and PM2.5 mass concentration. Extensive experiments on the synthesized data from the KITTI and real-world data collected in Beijing demonstrate that the proposed method can (1) achieve performance competitive in depth estimation as compared with state-of-the-art methods when taking clear images as input; (2) predict vivid depth map for images contaminated by various levels of haze; and (3) accurately estimate visibility, airlight, and PM2.5 mass concentrations. Beneficial applications can be developed based on the presented work to improve traffic safety, air quality, and public health. ",

Our first contribution is a surprisingly simple deterministic rounding algorithm in bipartite graphs with amortized update time $O(\\epsilon^{-1} \\log^2 (\\epsilon^{-1} \\cdot n))$, matching an (unconditional) recourse lower bound of $\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-1})$ up to logarithmic factors. Moreover, this algorithm's update time improves provided the minimum (non-zero) weight in the fractional matching is lower bounded throughout. Combining this algorithm with novel dynamic \\emph{partial rounding} algorithms to increase this minimum weight, we obtain several algorithms that improve this dependence on $n$. For example, we give a high-probability randomized algorithm with $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-1}\\cdot (\\log\\log n)^2)$-update time against adaptive adversaries. (We use Soft-Oh notation, $\\tilde{O}$, to suppress polylogarithmic factors in the argument, i.e., $\\tilde{O}(f)=O(f\\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(\\log f))$.) Using our rounding algorithms, we also round known $(1-\\epsilon)$-decremental fractional bipartite matching algorithms with no asymptotic overhead, thus improving on state-of-the-art algorithms for the decremental bipartite matching problem.

We aim to address table augmentation tasks, including row/column population and data imputation. Given a corpus of tables, we propose a retrieval augmented self-trained transformer model. Our self-learning strategy consists in randomly ablating tables from the corpus and training the retrieval-based model to reconstruct the original values or headers given the partial tables as input. We adopt this strategy to first train the dense neural retrieval model encoding table-parts to vectors, and then the end-to-end model trained to perform table augmentation tasks. We test on EntiTables, the standard benchmark for table augmentation, as well as introduce a new benchmark to advance further research: WebTables. Our model consistently and substantially outperforms both supervised statistical methods and the current state-of-the-art transformer-based models. ",

However, while learning a task, some agents may end up learning sub-optimal policies, not contributing to the objective of the team.

As a consequence, we observe that the emergence of cooperative behaviours is not necessarily a byproduct of being able to solve a task as a team. In this paper, we investigate the applications of causality in MARL and how it can be applied in MARL to penalise these lazy agents. We observe that causality estimations can be used to improve the credit assignment to the agents and show how it can be leveraged to improve independent learning in MARL. Furthermore, we investigate how Amortized Causal Discovery can be used to automate causality detection within MARL environments. The results demonstrate that causality relations between individual observations and the team reward can be used to detect and punish lazy agents, making them develop more intelligent behaviours. This results in improvements not only in the overall performances of the team but also in their individual capabilities.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a common and practical framework for learning a machine model in a decentralized fashion. A primary motivation behind this decentralized approach is data privacy, ensuring that the learner never sees the data of each local source itself. Federated learning then comes with two majors challenges: one is handling potentially complex model updates between a server and a large number of data sources; the other is that de-centralization may, in fact, be insufficient for privacy, as the local updates themselves can reveal information about the sources' data. To address these issues, we consider an approach to federated learning that combines quantization and differential privacy. Absent privacy, Federated Learning often relies on quantization to reduce communication complexity. We build upon this approach and develop a new algorithm called the \\textbf{R}andomized \\textbf{Q}uantization \\textbf{M}echanism (RQM), which obtains privacy through a two-levels of randomization. More precisely, we randomly sub-sample feasible quantization levels, then employ a randomized rounding procedure using these sub-sampled discrete levels. We are able to establish that our results preserve ``Renyi differential privacy'' (Renyi DP). We empirically study the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate that compared to previous work it yields improved privacy-accuracy trade-offs for DP federated learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that solely relies on randomized quantization without incorporating explicit discrete noise to achieve Renyi DP guarantees in Federated Learning systems.

Current robustness certificates for graph classifiers guarantee output invariance with respect to the total number of node pair flips (edge addition or edge deletion), which amounts to an $l_{0}$ ball centred on the adjacency matrix. Although theoretically attractive, this type of isotropic structural noise can be too restrictive in practical scenarios where some node pairs are more critical than others in determining the classifier's output. The certificate, in this case, gives a pessimistic depiction of the robustness of the graph model. To tackle this issue, we develop a randomised smoothing method based on adding an anisotropic noise distribution to the input graph structure. We show that our process generates structural-aware certificates for our classifiers, whereby the magnitude of robustness certificates can vary across different pre-defined structures of the graph. We demonstrate the benefits of these certificates in both synthetic and real-world experiments. ",

    "abstract": "3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) are a key component for image enhancement. Modern image signal processors (ISPs) have dedicated support for these as part of the camera rendering pipeline. Cameras typically provide multiple options for picture styles, where each style is usually obtained by applying a unique handcrafted 3D LUT. Current approaches for learning and applying 3D LUTs are notably fast, yet not so memory-efficient, as storing multiple 3D LUTs is required. For this reason and other implementation limitations, their use on mobile devices is less popular. In this work, we propose a Neural Implicit LUT (NILUT), an implicitly defined continuous 3D color transformation parameterized by a neural network. We show that NILUTs are capable of accurately emulating real 3D LUTs. Moreover, a NILUT can be extended to incorporate multiple styles into a single network with the ability to blend styles implicitly. Our novel approach is memory-efficient, controllable and can complement previous methods, including learned ISPs. Code, models and dataset available at: https://github.com/mv-lab/nilut ",

    "abstract": "Understanding the optimization dynamics of neural networks is necessary for closing the gap between theory and practice. Stochastic first-order optimization algorithms are known to efficiently locate favorable minima in deep neural networks. This efficiency, however, contrasts with the non-convex and seemingly complex structure of neural loss landscapes. In this study, we delve into the fundamental geometric properties of sampled gradients along optimization paths. We focus on two key quantities, which appear in the restricted secant inequality and error bound. Both hold high significance for first-order optimization. Our analysis reveals that these quantities exhibit predictable, consistent behavior throughout training, despite the stochasticity induced by sampling minibatches. Our findings suggest that not only do optimization trajectories never encounter significant obstacles, but they also maintain stable dynamics during the majority of training. These observed properties are sufficiently expressive to theoretically guarantee linear convergence and prescribe learning rate schedules mirroring empirical practices. We conduct our experiments on image classification, semantic segmentation and language modeling across different batch sizes, network architectures, datasets, optimizers, and initialization seeds. We discuss the impact of each factor. Our work provides novel insights into the properties of neural network loss functions, and opens the door to theoretical frameworks more relevant to prevalent practice. ",

    "abstract": "Obtaining large pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned to new tasks with limited annotated samples has remained an open challenge for medical imaging data. While pre-trained deep networks on ImageNet and vision-language foundation models trained on web-scale data are prevailing approaches, their effectiveness on medical tasks is limited due to the significant domain shift between natural and medical images. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVM-Med, the first family of deep networks trained on large-scale medical datasets. We have collected approximately 1.3 million medical images from 55 publicly available datasets, covering a large number of organs and modalities such as CT, MRI, X-ray, and Ultrasound. We benchmark several state-of-the-art self-supervised algorithms on this dataset and propose a novel self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm using a graph-matching formulation. The proposed approach makes three contributions: (i) it integrates prior pair-wise image similarity metrics based on local and global information; (ii) it captures the structural constraints of feature embeddings through a loss function constructed via a combinatorial graph-matching objective; and (iii) it can be trained efficiently end-to-end using modern gradient-estimation techniques for black-box solvers. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed LVM-Med on 15 downstream medical tasks ranging from segmentation and classification to object detection, and both for the in and out-of-distribution settings. LVM-Med empirically outperforms a number of state-of-the-art supervised, self-supervised, and foundation models. For challenging tasks such as Brain Tumor Classification or Diabetic Retinopathy Grading, LVM-Med improves previous vision-language models trained on 1 billion masks by 6-7% while using only a ResNet-50.

This makes the formation of heterogeneous teams (\\emph{coalitions}) a requirement for task completion. We present two centralized algorithms to schedule robots across tasks and to form suitable coalitions, assuming stochastic travel times across tasks. The coalitions are dynamic, in that the robots form and disband coalitions as the schedule is executed. The first algorithm we propose guarantees optimality, but its run-time is acceptable only for small problem instances.

In contrast to previous research on probing models for linguistic features, we study pre-trained models in a setting that allows for objective and straightforward evaluation of a model's ability to learn semantics. In this paper, we examine whether such models capture the semantics of code, which is precisely and formally defined.

To facilitate partial code reuse, we propose the Partial Code Reuse Chain (PCR-Chain) for resolving fully-qualified names (FQNs) and fixing last-mile syntax errors in partial code based on a giant large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT. Methodologically, PCR-Chain is backed up by the underlying global-level prompt architecture (which combines three design ideas: hierarchical task breakdown, prompt composition, and a mix of prompt-based AI and non-AI units) and the local-level prompt design. Technically, we propose PCR-Chain, which employs in-context learning rather than symbolic, costly training methods. Experimental results demonstrate that in dynamically-typed languages (Python), PCR-Chain outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) 5% accuracy like RING. For statically-type languages (Java), our approach achieves high accuracy of 80.5% in resolving both non-FQNs and last-mile syntax errors, surpassing SOTA methods (RING) that can only address last-mile syntax errors. The correct execution of the unit, module, and PCR-Chain demonstrates the effectiveness of the prompt design, composition, and architecture and opens up possibilities for building software engineering tools based on LLMs, replacing traditional program analysis methods.

Although various methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) have been suggested, there is a lack of literature that delves into their practicality and assesses them based on criteria that could foster trust in clinical environments. To address this gap this study evaluates two popular XAI methods used for explaining predictive models in the healthcare context in terms of whether they (i) generate domain-appropriate representation, i.e. coherent with respect to the application task, (ii) impact clinical workflow and (iii) are consistent. To that end, explanations generated at the cohort and patient levels were analysed. The paper reports the first benchmarking of the XAI methods applied to risk prediction models obtained by evaluating the concordance between generated explanations and the trigger of a future clinical deterioration episode recorded by the data collection system. We carried out an analysis using two Electronic Medical Records (EMR) datasets sourced from Australian major hospitals. The findings underscore the limitations of state-of-the-art XAI methods in the clinical context and their potential benefits. We discuss these limitations and contribute to the theoretical development of trustworthy XAI solutions where clinical decision support guides the choice of intervention by suggesting the pattern or drivers for clinical deterioration in the future.

    "abstract": "Human motion prediction has achieved a brilliant performance with the help of CNNs, which facilitates human-machine cooperation. However, currently, there is no work evaluating the potential risk in human motion prediction when facing adversarial attacks, which may cause danger in real applications. The adversarial attack will face two problems against human motion prediction: 1. For naturalness, pose data is highly related to the physical dynamics of human skeletons where Lp norm constraints cannot constrain the adversarial example well; 2. Unlike the pixel value in images, pose data is diverse at scale because of the different acquisition equipment and the data processing, which makes it hard to set fixed parameters to perform attacks. To solve the problems above, we propose a new adversarial attack method that perturbs the input human motion sequence by maximizing the prediction error with physical constraints. Specifically, we introduce a novel adaptable scheme that facilitates the attack to suit the scale of the target pose and two physical constraints to enhance the imperceptibility of the adversarial example. The evaluating experiments on three datasets show that the prediction errors of all target models are enlarged significantly, which means current convolution-based human motion prediction models can be easily disturbed under the proposed attack. The quantitative analysis shows that prior knowledge and semantic information modeling can be the key to the adversarial robustness of human motion predictors. The qualitative results indicate that the adversarial sample is hard to be noticed when compared frame by frame but is relatively easy to be detected when the sample is animated. ",

However, the cross-domain (i.e., domain generalization) scene presents a challenge in Re-ID tasks due to unseen test domains and domain-shift between the training and test sets. To tackle this challenge, most existing methods aim to learn domain-invariant or robust features for all domains. In this paper, we observe that the data-distribution gap between the training and test sets is smaller in the sample-pair space than in the sample-instance space. Based on this observation, we propose a Generalizable Metric Network (GMN) to further explore sample similarity in the sample-pair space. Specifically, we add a Metric Network (M-Net) after the main network and train it on positive and negative sample-pair features, which is then employed during the test stage. Additionally, we introduce the Dropout-based Perturbation (DP) module to enhance the generalization capability of the metric network by enriching the sample-pair diversity. Moreover, we develop a Pair-Identity Center (PIC) loss to enhance the model's discrimination by ensuring that sample-pair features with the same pair-identity are consistent. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method through a lot of experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and confirm the value of each module in our GMN. ",

While recent methods like Spiking-YOLO have expanded the SNNs to more challenging object detection tasks, they often suffer from high latency and low detection accuracy, making them difficult to deploy on latency sensitive mobile platforms. Furthermore, the conversion method from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs is hard to maintain the complete structure of the ANNs, resulting in poor feature representation and high conversion errors. To address these challenges, we propose two methods: timesteps compression and spike-time-dependent integrated (STDI) coding. The former reduces the timesteps required in ANN-SNN conversion by compressing information, while the latter sets a time-varying threshold to expand the information holding capacity. We also present a SNN-based ultra-low latency and high accurate object detection model (SUHD) that achieves state-of-the-art performance on nontrivial datasets like PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, with about remarkable 750x fewer timesteps and 30% mean average precision (mAP) improvement, compared to the Spiking-YOLO on MS COCO datasets.

According to the different factorization approaches to the graph joint probabilities, existing parsers can be roughly divided into autoregressive and non-autoregressive patterns. The former means that the graph should be factorized into multiple sequentially dependent components, then it can be built up component by component. And the latter assumes these components to be independent so that they can be outputted in a one-shot manner. However, when treating the directed edge as an explicit dependency relationship, we discover that there is a mixture of independent and interdependent components in the dependency graph, signifying that both aforementioned models fail to precisely capture the explicit dependencies among nodes and edges. Based on this property, we design a Semi-Autoregressive Dependency Parser to generate dependency graphs via adding node groups and edge groups autoregressively while pouring out all group elements in parallel. The model gains a trade-off between non-autoregression and autoregression, which respectively suffer from the lack of target inter-dependencies and the uncertainty of graph generation orders. The experiments show the proposed parser outperforms strong baselines on Enhanced Universal Dependencies of multiple languages, especially achieving $4\\%$ average promotion at graph-level accuracy.

SSL is especially attractive for unsupervised tasks such as anomaly detection, where labeled anomalies are often nonexistent and costly to obtain. While self-supervised anomaly detection (SSAD) has seen a recent surge of interest, the literature has failed to treat data augmentation as a hyperparameter. Meanwhile, recent works have reported that the choice of augmentation has significant impact on detection performance. In this paper, we introduce ST-SSAD (Self-Tuning Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection), the first systematic approach to SSAD in regards to rigorously tuning augmentation. To this end, our work presents two key contributions. The first is a new unsupervised validation loss that quantifies the alignment between the augmented training data and the (unlabeled) test data. In principle we adopt transduction, quantifying the extent to which augmentation mimics the true anomaly-generating mechanism, in contrast to augmenting data with arbitrary pseudo anomalies without regard to test data. Second, we present new differentiable augmentation functions, allowing data augmentation hyperparameter(s) to be tuned end-to-end via our proposed validation loss. Experiments on two testbeds with semantic class anomalies and subtle industrial defects show that systematically tuning augmentation offers significant performance gains over current practices. ",

This work formally extends the definition of sample attackability/robustness for NLP attacks. Experiments on two popular NLP datasets, four state of the art models and four different NLP adversarial attack methods, demonstrate that sample uncertainty is insufficient for describing characteristics of attackable/robust samples and hence a deep learning based detector can perform much better at identifying the most attackable and robust samples for an unseen target model. Nevertheless, further analysis finds that there is little agreement in which samples are considered the most attackable/robust across different NLP attack methods, explaining a lack of portability of attackability detection methods across attack methods.

The unpredictability of the accuracy of neural operators impacts their applications in downstream problems of inference, optimization, and control. A framework is proposed based on the linear variational problem that gives the correction to the prediction furnished by neural operators. The operator associated with the corrector problem is referred to as the corrector operator. Numerical results involving a nonlinear diffusion model in two dimensions with PCANet-type neural operators show almost two orders of increase in the accuracy of approximations when neural operators are corrected using the proposed scheme. Further, topology optimization involving a nonlinear diffusion model is considered to highlight the limitations of neural operators and the efficacy of the correction scheme. Optimizers with neural operator surrogates are seen to make significant errors (as high as 80 percent). However, the errors are much lower (below 7 percent) when neural operators are corrected following the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "With the recent development of smart farms, researchers are very interested in such fields. In particular, the field of disease diagnosis is the most important factor. Disease diagnosis belongs to the field of anomaly detection and aims to distinguish whether plants or fruits are normal or abnormal. The problem can be solved by binary or multi-classification based on CNN, but it can also be solved by image reconstruction. However, due to the limitation of the performance of image generation, SOTA's methods propose a score calculation method using a latent vector error. In this paper, we propose a network that focuses on chili peppers and proceeds with background removal through Grabcut. It shows high performance through image-based score calculation method. Due to the difficulty of reconstructing the input image, the difference between the input and output images is large. However, the serial autoencoder proposed in this paper uses the difference between the two fake images except for the actual input as a score. We propose a method of generating meaningful images using the GAN structure and classifying three results simultaneously by one discriminator. The proposed method showed higher performance than previous researches, and image-based scores showed the best performanc ",

    "abstract": "It has been discovered that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) encounter a remarkable drop in performance when multiple layers are piled up. The main factor that accounts for why deep GCNs fail lies in over-smoothing, which isolates the network output from the input with the increase of network depth, weakening expressivity and trainability. In this paper, we start by investigating refined measures upon DropEdge -- an existing simple yet effective technique to relieve over-smoothing. We term our method as DropEdge++ for its two structure-aware samplers in contrast to DropEdge: layer-dependent sampler and feature-dependent sampler. Regarding the layer-dependent sampler, we interestingly find that increasingly sampling edges from the bottom layer yields superior performance than the decreasing counterpart as well as DropEdge. We theoretically reveal this phenomenon with Mean-Edge-Number (MEN), a metric closely related to over-smoothing. For the feature-dependent sampler, we associate the edge sampling probability with the feature similarity of node pairs, and prove that it further correlates the convergence subspace of the output layer with the input features. Extensive experiments on several node classification benchmarks, including both full- and semi- supervised tasks, illustrate the efficacy of DropEdge++ and its compatibility with a variety of backbones by achieving generally better performance over DropEdge and the no-drop version.

To our best knowledge, this study represents the first comprehensive examination of both natural robustness and adversarial robustness in RS tasks. Specifically, we have curated and made publicly available datasets that contain natural and adversarial noises.

To provide a comprehensive assessment of model robustness, we conducted meticulous experiments with numerous different classifiers and detectors, encompassing a wide range of mainstream methods.

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning has made significant progress in wood panel defect detection. However, there are still challenges such as low detection , slow detection speed, and difficulties in deploying embedded devices on wood panel surfaces. To overcome these issues, we propose a lightweight wood panel defect detection method called YOLOv5-LW, which incorporates attention mechanisms and a feature fusion network.Firstly, to enhance the detection capability of acceptable defects, we introduce the Multi-scale Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (MBiFPN) as a feature fusion network. The MBiFPN reduces feature loss, enriches local and detailed features, and improves the model's detection capability for acceptable defects.Secondly, to achieve a lightweight design, we reconstruct the ShuffleNetv2 network model as the backbone network. This reconstruction reduces the number of parameters and computational requirements while maintaining performance. We also introduce the Stem Block and Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (SPPF) models to compensate for any accuracy loss resulting from the lightweight design, ensuring the model's detection capabilities remain intact while being computationally efficient.Thirdly, we enhance the backbone network by incorporating Efficient Channel Attention (ECA), which improves the network's focus on key information relevant to defect detection. By attending to essential features, the model becomes more proficient in accurately identifying and localizing defects.We validate the proposed method using a self-developed wood panel defect dataset.The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved YOLOv5-LW method. Compared to the original model, our approach achieves a 92.8\\% accuracy rate, reduces the number of parameters by 27.78\\%, compresses computational volume by 41.25\\%, improves detection inference speed by 10.16\\% ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been broadly applied in many urban applications upon formulating a city as an urban graph whose nodes are urban objects like regions or points of interest. Recently, a few enhanced GNN architectures have been developed to tackle heterophily graphs where connected nodes are dissimilar. However, urban graphs usually can be observed to possess a unique spatial heterophily property; that is, the dissimilarity of neighbors at different spatial distances can exhibit great diversity. This property has not been explored, while it often exists. To this end, in this paper, we propose a metric, named Spatial Diversity Score, to quantitatively measure the spatial heterophily and show how it can influence the performance of GNNs. Indeed, our experimental investigation clearly shows that existing heterophilic GNNs are still deficient in handling the urban graph with high spatial diversity score. This, in turn, may degrade their effectiveness in urban applications. Along this line, we propose a Spatial Heterophily Aware Graph Neural Network (SHGNN), to tackle the spatial diversity of heterophily of urban graphs. Based on the key observation that spatially close neighbors on the urban graph present a more similar mode of difference to the central node, we first design a rotation-scaling spatial aggregation module, whose core idea is to properly group the spatially close neighbors and separately process each group with less diversity inside. Then, a heterophily-sensitive spatial interaction module is designed to adaptively capture the commonality and diverse dissimilarity in different spatial groups. Extensive experiments on three real-world urban datasets demonstrate the superiority of our SHGNN over several its competitors. ",

To address these issues, we conducted empirical research using data from two well-known social networking platforms, WeChat and Weibo. Our findings suggest that the information-cascading process is best described as an activate-decay dynamical process. Building on these insights, we developed an Activate-Decay (AD)-based algorithm that can accurately predict the long-term popularity of online content based solely on its early repost amount. We tested our algorithm using data from WeChat and Weibo, demonstrating that we could fit the evolution trend of content propagation and predict the longer-term dynamics of message forwarding from earlier data. We also discovered a close correlation between the peak forwarding amount of information and the total amount of dissemination. Finding the peak of the amount of information dissemination can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of our model.

Existing defense mechanisms are narrow addressing a specific type of attack or being vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. We propose a new defense mechanism that, while being focused on image-based classifiers, is general with respect to the cited category. It is rooted on hyperspace projection. In particular, our solution provides a pseudo-random projection of the original dataset into a new dataset. The proposed defense mechanism creates a set of diverse projected datasets, where each projected dataset is used to train a specific classifier, resulting in different trained classifiers with different decision boundaries. During testing, it randomly selects a classifier to test the input. Our approach does not sacrifice accuracy over legitimate input. Other than detailing and providing a thorough characterization of our defense mechanism, we also provide a proof of concept of using four optimization-based adversarial attacks (PGD, FGSM, IGSM, and C\\&W) and a generative adversarial attack testing them on the MNIST dataset. Our experimental results show that our solution increases the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks and significantly reduces the attack success rate by at least 89% for optimization attacks and 78% for generative attacks. We also analyze the relationship between the number of used hyperspaces and the efficacy of the defense mechanism. As expected, the two are positively correlated, offering an easy-to-tune parameter to enforce the desired level of security. The generality and scalability of our solution and adaptability to different attack scenarios, combined with the excellent achieved results, other than providing a robust defense against adversarial attacks on deep learning networks, also lay the groundwork for future research in the field.

The lines and junctions are then represented as an undirected graph, from which polygon representations of the sought planes are obtained. Two different methods for this last step are investigated, where the most promising method is built on a heterogeneous graph transformer. The final output is in all cases a projection of the semantic planes in 2D. The methods are evaluated on the Structured 3D dataset and we investigate the performance both using sampled and estimated wireframes.

As directly optimizing user retention is challenging, multiple evaluation metrics are often employed. Existing methods generally formulate the optimization of these evaluation metrics as a multitask learning problem, but often overlook the fact that user preferences for different tasks are personalized and change over time. Identifying and tracking the evolution of user preferences can lead to better user retention. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of \"user lifecycle\", consisting of multiple stages characterized by users' varying preferences for different tasks. We propose a novel Stage-Adaptive Network (STAN) framework for modeling user lifecycle stages. STAN first identifies latent user lifecycle stages based on learned user preferences, and then employs the stage representation to enhance multi-task learning performance. Our experimental results using both public and industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves multi-task prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the importance of considering user lifecycle stages in recommendation systems. Furthermore, online A/B testing reveals that our model outperforms the existing model, achieving a significant improvement of 3.05% in staytime per user and 0.88% in CVR.

    "title": "Coverage Performance of UAV-powered Sensors for Energy-neutral Networks  with Recharging Stations",
    "abstract": "The projected number of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors makes battery maintenance a challenging task. Although battery-less IoT is technologically viable, the sensors should be somehow energized, either locally or remotely. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can respond to this quest via wireless power transfer (WPT). However, to achieve energy neutrality across the IoT networks and thus mitigate the maintenance issues, the UAVs providing energy and connectivity to IoT sensors must be supplied by recharging stations having multi-source energy harvesting (EH) capability. Yet, as these sensors rely solely on UAV-transferred power, the absence of UAVs causes sensor outages and hence loss of coverage when they visit recharging stations for battery replenishment. Hence, besides the UAV parameters (e.g., battery size and velocity), recharging duration and station density must be carefully determined to avoid these outages. To address that, this paper uses stochastic geometry to derive the coverage probability of UAV-powered sensors. Our analysis sheds light on the fundamental trade-offs and design guidelines for energy-neutral IoT networks with recharging stations in regard to the regulatory organization limitations, practical rectenna and UAV models, and the minimum power requirements of sensors.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of implicit neural representation methods. The recent work Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF) has achieved satisfactory performance for continuous image representation, where pixel values are inferred from a neural network in a continuous spatial domain. However, the computational cost of such implicit arbitrary-scale super-resolution (SR) methods increases rapidly as the scale factor increases, which makes arbitrary-scale SR time-consuming. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Implicit Image Function (DIIF), which is a fast and efficient method to represent images with arbitrary resolution. Instead of taking an image coordinate and the nearest 2D deep features as inputs to predict its pixel value, we propose a coordinate grouping and slicing strategy, which enables the neural network to perform decoding from coordinate slices to pixel value slices. We further propose a Coarse-to-Fine Multilayer Perceptron (C2F-MLP) to perform decoding with dynamic coordinate slicing, where the number of coordinates in each slice varies as the scale factor varies. With dynamic coordinate slicing, DIIF significantly reduces the computational cost when encountering arbitrary-scale SR. Experimental results demonstrate that DIIF can be integrated with implicit arbitrary-scale SR methods and achieves SOTA SR performance with significantly superior computational efficiency, thereby opening a path for real-time arbitrary-scale image representation.

Previous research has attempted to address these challenges via feature selection approaches, which can lead to unstable performance on real-world data.

In this paper, we propose ProtoGate, a prototype-based neural model that introduces an inductive bias by attending to both homogeneity and heterogeneity across samples. ProtoGate selects features in a global-to-local manner and leverages them to produce explainable predictions via an interpretable prototype-based model. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of ProtoGate on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that exploiting the homogeneous and heterogeneous patterns in the data can improve prediction accuracy while prototypes imbue interpretability. ",

    "abstract": "For a number of years since its introduction to hydrology, recurrent neural networks like long short-term memory (LSTM) have proven remarkably difficult to surpass in terms of daily hydrograph metrics on known, comparable benchmarks. Outside of hydrology, Transformers have now become the model of choice for sequential prediction tasks, making it a curious architecture to investigate. Here, we first show that a vanilla Transformer architecture is not competitive against LSTM on the widely benchmarked CAMELS dataset, and lagged especially for the high-flow metrics due to short-term processes. However, a recurrence-free variant of Transformer can obtain mixed comparisons with LSTM, producing the same Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE), along with other metrics. The lack of advantages for the Transformer is linked to the Markovian nature of the hydrologic prediction problem. Similar to LSTM, the Transformer can also merge multiple forcing dataset to improve model performance. While the Transformer results are not higher than current state-of-the-art, we still learned some valuable lessons: (1) the vanilla Transformer architecture is not suitable for hydrologic modeling; (2) the proposed recurrence-free modification can improve Transformer performance so future work can continue to test more of such modifications; and (3) the prediction limits on the dataset should be close to the current state-of-the-art model. As a non-recurrent model, the Transformer may bear scale advantages for learning from bigger datasets and storing knowledge. This work serves as a reference point for future modifications of the model. ",

Therefore, reconstruction of high resolution OCT images from the low resolution versions is an essential step for better OCT based diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel OCT super-resolution technique using Tensor Ring decomposition in the embedded space. A new tensorization method based on a block Hankelization approach with overlapped patches, called overlapped patch Hankelization, has been proposed which allows us to employ Tensor Ring decomposition. The Hankelization method enables us to better exploit the inter connection of pixels and consequently achieve better super-resolution of images. The low resolution image was first patch Hankelized and then its Tensor Ring decomposition with rank incremental has been computed. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach is effective in OCT super-resolution. ",

    "abstract": "The ability of deep learning (DL) approaches to learn generalised signal and noise models, coupled with their fast inference on GPUs, holds great promise for enhancing gravitational-wave (GW) searches in terms of speed, parameter space coverage, and search sensitivity. However, the opaque nature of DL models severely harms their reliability. In this work, we meticulously develop a DL model stage-wise and work towards improving its robustness and reliability. First, we address the problems in maintaining the purity of training data by deriving a new metric that better reflects the visual strength of the \"chirp\" signal features in the data. Using a reduced, smooth representation obtained through a variational auto-encoder (VAE), we build a classifier to search for compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals. Our tests on real LIGO data show an impressive performance of the model. However, upon probing the robustness of the model through adversarial attacks, its simple failure modes were identified, underlining how such models can still be highly fragile. As a first step towards bringing robustness, we retrain the model in a novel framework involving a generative adversarial network (GAN). Over the course of training, the model learns to eliminate the primary modes of failure identified by the adversaries. Although absolute robustness is practically impossible to achieve, we demonstrate some fundamental improvements earned through such training, like sparseness and reduced degeneracy in the extracted features at different layers inside the model. Through comparative inference on real LIGO data, we show that the prescribed robustness is achieved at practically zero cost in terms of performance. Through a direct search on ~8.8 days of LIGO data, we recover two significant CBC events from GWTC-2.1, GW190519_153544 and GW190521_074359, and report the search sensitivity. ",

Deep learning has demonstrated great potential for accelerating MRI by reconstructing images from undersampled data. However, most existing deep conventional neural networks (CNN) directly apply square convolution to k-space data without considering the inherent properties of k-space sampling, limiting k-space learning efficiency and image reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose an encoding enhanced (EN2) complex CNN for highly undersampled pulmonary MRI reconstruction. EN2 employs convolution along either the frequency or phase-encoding direction, resembling the mechanisms of k-space sampling, to maximize the utilization of the encoding correlation and integrity within a row or column of k-space. We also employ complex convolution to learn rich representations from the complex k-space data. In addition, we develop a feature-strengthened modularized unit to further boost the reconstruction performance. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can accurately reconstruct hyperpolarized 129Xe and 1H lung MRI from 6-fold undersampled k-space data and provide lung function measurements with minimal biases compared with fully-sampled image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithmic components and indicate that the proposed approach could be used for accelerated pulmonary MRI in research and clinical lung disease patient care.

Current state-of-the-art neural network methods use temporal filters to handle temporal dependencies, resulting in an unrealistic and inflexible processing flow. Meanwhile, these methods target trial-averaged firing rates and fail to capture important features in spike trains. This work presents the temporal conditioning spiking latent variable models (TeCoS-LVM) to simulate the neural response to natural visual stimuli. We use spiking neurons to produce spike outputs that directly match the recorded trains. This approach helps to avoid losing information embedded in the original spike trains. We exclude the temporal dimension from the model parameter space and introduce a temporal conditioning operation to allow the model to adaptively explore and exploit temporal dependencies in stimuli sequences in a natural paradigm. We show that TeCoS-LVM models can produce more realistic spike activities and accurately fit spike statistics than powerful alternatives. Additionally, learned TeCoS-LVM models can generalize well to longer time scales. Overall, while remaining computationally tractable, our model effectively captures key features of neural coding systems. It thus provides a useful tool for building accurate predictive computational accounts for various sensory perception circuits. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals plays a crucial role in the early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. While ECG signals can be used for the diagnosis of various diseases, their pathological characteristics exhibit minimal variations, posing a challenge to automatic classification models. Existing methods primarily utilize convolutional neural networks to extract ECG signal features for classification, which may not fully capture the pathological feature differences of different diseases. Transformer networks have advantages in feature extraction for sequence data, but the complete network is complex and relies on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a single-layer Transformer network called Multi-Scale Shifted Windows Transformer Networks (MSW-Transformer), which uses a multi-window sliding attention mechanism at different scales to capture features in different dimensions. The self-attention is restricted to non-overlapping local windows via shifted windows, and different window scales have different receptive fields. A learnable feature fusion method is then proposed to integrate features from different windows to further enhance model performance. Furthermore, we visualize the attention mechanism of the multi-window shifted mechanism to achieve better clinical interpretation in the ECG classification task. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on five classification tasks of the PTBXL-2020 12-lead ECG dataset, which includes 5 diagnostic superclasses, 23 diagnostic subclasses, 12 rhythm classes, 17 morphology classes, and 44 diagnosis classes, with average macro-F1 scores of 77.85%, 47.57%, 66.13%, 34.60%, and 34.29%, and average sample-F1 scores of 81.26%, 68.27%, 91.32%, 50.07%, and 63.19%, respectively.

Consequently, clinical decision making is centered on accurate knowledge of timing and often requires a radiologist to interpret Computed Tomography (CT) of the brain to confirm the occurrence and age of an event. These tasks are particularly challenging due to the subtle expression of acute ischemic lesions and the dynamic nature of their appearance. Automation efforts have not yet applied deep learning to estimate lesion age and treated these two tasks independently, so, have overlooked their inherent complementary relationship. To leverage this, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-task transformer-based network optimized for concurrent segmentation and age estimation of cerebral ischemic lesions. By utilizing gated positional self-attention and CT-specific data augmentation, the proposed method can capture long-range spatial dependencies while maintaining its ability to be trained from scratch under low-data regimes commonly found in medical imaging. Furthermore, to better combine multiple predictions, we incorporate uncertainty by utilizing quantile loss to facilitate estimating a probability density function of lesion age. The effectiveness of our model is then extensively evaluated on a clinical dataset consisting of 776 CT images from two medical centers. Experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains promising performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.933 for classifying lesion ages <=4.5 hours compared to 0.858 using a conventional approach, and outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art algorithms.

    "abstract": "Exoplanet detection by direct imaging is a difficult task: the faint signals from the objects of interest are buried under a spatially structured nuisance component induced by the host star. The exoplanet signals can only be identified when combining several observations with dedicated detection algorithms. In contrast to most of existing methods, we propose to learn a model of the spatial, temporal and spectral characteristics of the nuisance, directly from the observations. In a pre-processing step, a statistical model of their correlations is built locally, and the data are centered and whitened to improve both their stationarity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then trained in a supervised fashion to detect the residual signature of synthetic sources in the pre-processed images. Our method leads to a better trade-off between precision and recall than standard approaches in the field. It also outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm based solely on a statistical framework. Besides, the exploitation of the spectral diversity improves the performance compared to a similar model built solely from spatio-temporal data. ",

    "title": "From structure mining to unsupervised exploration of atomic octahedral  networks",
    "abstract": "Networks of atom-centered coordination octahedra commonly occur in inorganic and hybrid solid-state materials. Characterizing their spatial arrangements and characteristics is crucial for relating structures to properties for many materials families. The traditional method using case-by-case inspection becomes prohibitive for discovering trends and similarities in large datasets. Here, we operationalize chemical intuition to automate the geometric parsing, quantification, and classification of coordination octahedral networks. We find axis-resolved tilting trends in ABO$_{3}$ perovskite polymorphs, which assist in detecting oxidation state changes. Moreover, we develop a scale-invariant encoding scheme to represent these networks, which, combined with human-assisted unsupervised machine learning, allows us to taxonomize the inorganic framework polytypes in hybrid iodoplumbates (A$_x$Pb$_y$I$_z$). Consequently, we uncover a violation of Pauling's third rule and the design principles underpinning their topological diversity. Our results offer a glimpse into the vast design space of atomic octahedral networks and inform high-throughput, targeted screening of specific structure types. ",

We derive the sharp nonlinear dimension-free version of this kind of inequalities. Interestingly, the resultant inequalities show a phase transition depending on the parameters. We then connect R\\'enyi--Sobolev inequalities to the spectral graph theory. Our proofs in this paper are based on the information-theoretic characterization of the R\\'enyi--Sobolev inequalities, as well as the method of types. ",

    "abstract": "Acquiring properly annotated data is expensive in the medical field as it requires experts, time-consuming protocols, and rigorous validation. Active learning attempts to minimize the need for large annotated samples by actively sampling the most informative examples for annotation. These examples contribute significantly to improving the performance of supervised machine learning models, and thus, active learning can play an essential role in selecting the most appropriate information in deep learning-based diagnosis, clinical assessments, and treatment planning. Although some existing works have proposed methods for sampling the best examples for annotation in medical image analysis, they are not task-agnostic and do not use multimodal auxiliary information in the sampler, which has the potential to increase robustness. Therefore, in this work, we propose a Multimodal Variational Adversarial Active Learning (M-VAAL) method that uses auxiliary information from additional modalities to enhance the active sampling. We applied our method to two datasets: i) brain tumor segmentation and multi-label classification using the BraTS2018 dataset, and ii) chest X-ray image classification using the COVID-QU-Ex dataset. Our results show a promising direction toward data-efficient learning under limited annotations. ",
