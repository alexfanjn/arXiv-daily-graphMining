    "title": "Multi-constrained Symmetric Nonnegative Latent Factor Analysis for  Accurately Representing Large-scale Undirected Weighted Networks",
    "abstract": "An Undirected Weighted Network (UWN) is frequently encountered in a big-data-related application concerning the complex interactions among numerous nodes, e.g., a protein interaction network from a bioinformatics application. A Symmetric High-Dimensional and Incomplete (SHDI) matrix can smoothly illustrate such an UWN, which contains rich knowledge like node interaction behaviors and local complexes. To extract desired knowledge from an SHDI matrix, an analysis model should carefully consider its symmetric-topology for describing an UWN's intrinsic symmetry. Representation learning to an UWN borrows the success of a pyramid of symmetry-aware models like a Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) model whose objective function utilizes a sole Latent Factor (LF) matrix for representing SHDI's symmetry rigorously. However, they suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) their computational complexity is high; and 2) their modeling strategy narrows their representation features, making them suffer from low learning ability. Aiming at addressing above critical issues, this paper proposes a Multi-constrained Symmetric Nonnegative Latent-factor-analysis (MSNL) model with two-fold ideas: 1) introducing multi-constraints composed of multiple LF matrices, i.e., inequality and equality ones into a data-density-oriented objective function for precisely representing the intrinsic symmetry of an SHDI matrix with broadened feature space; and 2) implementing an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-incorporated learning scheme for precisely solving such a multi-constrained model. Empirical studies on three SHDI matrices from a real bioinformatics or industrial application demonstrate that the proposed MSNL model achieves stronger representation learning ability to an SHDI matrix than state-of-the-art models do.

    "title": "Designing Decision Support Systems Using Counterfactual Prediction Sets",
    "abstract": "Decision support systems for classification tasks are predominantly designed to predict the value of the ground truth labels. However, since their predictions are not perfect, these systems also need to make human experts understand when and how to use these predictions to update their own predictions. Unfortunately, this has been proven challenging. In this context, it has been recently argued that an alternative type of decision support systems may circumvent this challenge. Rather than providing a single label prediction, these systems provide a set of label prediction values constructed using a conformal predictor, namely a prediction set, and forcefully ask experts to predict a label value from the prediction set. However, the design and evaluation of these systems have so far relied on stylized expert models, questioning their promise. In this paper, we revisit the design of this type of systems from the perspective of online learning and develop a methodology that does not require, nor assumes, an expert model. Our methodology leverages the nested structure of the prediction sets provided by any conformal predictor and a natural counterfactual monotonicity assumption on the experts' predictions over the prediction sets to achieve an exponential improvement in regret in comparison with vanilla bandit algorithms. We conduct a large-scale human subject study ($n = 2{,}751$) to verify our counterfactual monotonicity assumption and compare our methodology to several competitive baselines. The results suggest that decision support systems that limit experts' level of agency may be practical and may offer greater performance than those allowing experts to always exercise their own agency.

    "title": "Learning Causal Mechanisms through Orthogonal Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "A fundamental feature of human intelligence is the ability to infer high-level abstractions from low-level sensory data. An essential component of such inference is the ability to discover modularized generative mechanisms. Despite many efforts to use statistical learning and pattern recognition for finding disentangled factors, arguably human intelligence remains unmatched in this area. In this paper, we investigate a problem of learning, in a fully unsupervised manner, the inverse of a set of independent mechanisms from distorted data points. We postulate, and justify this claim with experimental results, that an important weakness of existing machine learning solutions lies in the insufficiency of cross-module diversification. Addressing this crucial discrepancy between human and machine intelligence is an important challenge for pattern recognition systems. To this end, our work proposes an unsupervised method that discovers and disentangles a set of independent mechanisms from unlabeled data, and learns how to invert them. A number of experts compete against each other for individual data points in an adversarial setting: one that best inverses the (unknown) generative mechanism is the winner. We demonstrate that introducing an orthogonalization layer into the expert architectures enforces additional diversity in the outputs, leading to significantly better separability. Moreover, we propose a procedure for relocating data points between experts to further prevent any one from claiming multiple mechanisms. We experimentally illustrate that these techniques allow discovery and modularization of much less pronounced transformations, in addition to considerably faster convergence. ",

The following paper presents a data-efficient solution to constructing dialogue systems, leveraging explicit instructions derived from agent guidelines, such as company policies or customer service manuals. Our proposed Knowledge-Augmented Dialogue System (KADS) combines a large language model with a knowledge retrieval module that pulls documents outlining relevant procedures from a predefined set of policies, given a user-agent interaction. To train this system, we introduce a semi-supervised pre-training scheme that employs dialogue-document matching and action-oriented masked language modeling with partial parameter freezing. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on prominent task-oriented dialogue datasets, Action-Based Conversations Dataset and Schema-Guided Dialogue, for two dialogue tasks: action state tracking and workflow discovery. Our results demonstrate that procedural knowledge augmentation improves accuracy predicting in- and out-of-distribution actions while preserving high performance in settings with low or sparse data.

    "abstract": "Recently there has been great interest in operator learning, where networks learn operators between function spaces from an essentially infinite-dimensional perspective. In this work we present results for when the operators learned by these networks are injective and surjective. As a warmup, we combine prior work in both the finite-dimensional ReLU and operator learning setting by giving sharp conditions under which ReLU layers with linear neural operators are injective. We then consider the case the case when the activation function is pointwise bijective and obtain sufficient conditions for the layer to be injective. We remark that this question, while trivial in the finite-rank case, is subtler in the infinite-rank case and is proved using tools from Fredholm theory. Next, we prove that our supplied injective neural operators are universal approximators and that their implementation, with finite-rank neural networks, are still injective. This ensures that injectivity is not `lost' in the transcription from analytical operators to their finite-rank implementation with networks. Finally, we conclude with an increase in abstraction and consider general conditions when subnetworks, which may be many layers deep, are injective and surjective and provide an exact inversion from a `linearization.' This section uses general arguments from Fredholm theory and Leray-Schauder degree theory for non-linear integral equations to analyze the mapping properties of neural operators in function spaces. These results apply to subnetworks formed from the layers considered in this work, under natural conditions. We believe that our work has applications in Bayesian UQ where injectivity enables likelihood estimation and in inverse problems where surjectivity and injectivity corresponds to existence and uniqueness, respectively.

    "abstract": "Currently, the wide spreading of real-time applications such as VoIP and videos-based applications require more data rates and reduced latency to ensure better quality of service (QoS). A well-designed traffic classification mechanism plays a major role for good QoS provision and network security verification. Port-based approaches and deep packet inspections (DPI) techniques have been used to classify and analyze network traffic flows. However, none of these methods can cope with the rapid growth of network traffic due to the increasing number of Internet users and the growth of real time applications. As a result, these methods lead to network congestion, resulting in packet loss, delay and inadequate QoS delivery. Recently, a deep learning approach has been explored to address the time-consumption and impracticality gaps of the above methods and maintain existing and future traffics of real-time applications. The aim of this research is then to design a dynamic traffic classifier that can detect elephant flows to prevent network congestion. Thus, we are motivated to provide efficient bandwidth and fast transmision requirements to many Internet users using SDN capability and the potential of Deep Learning. Specifically, DNN, CNN, LSTM and Deep autoencoder are used to build elephant detection models that achieve an average accuracy of 99.12%, 98.17%, and 98.78%, respectively. Deep autoencoder is also one of the promising algorithms that does not require human class labeler. It achieves an accuracy of 97.95% with a loss of 0.13 . Since the loss value is closer to zero, the performance of the model is good. Therefore, the study has a great importance to Internet service providers, Internet subscribers, as well as for future researchers in this area. ",

A key component of retrieval is to model (user, item) similarity, which is commonly represented as the dot product of two learned embeddings.

Despite its popularity, dot products cannot capture complex user-item interactions, which are multifaceted and likely high rank. We hence examine non-dot-product retrieval settings on accelerators, and propose \\textit{mixture of logits} (MoL), which models (user, item) similarity as an adaptive composition of elementary similarity functions. This new formulation is expressive, capable of modeling high rank (user, item) interactions, and further generalizes to the long tail. When combined with a hierarchical retrieval strategy, \\textit{h-indexer}, we are able to scale up MoL to 100M corpus on a single GPU with latency comparable to MIPS baselines.

Yet, many scenarios in which lack of robustness can result in serious risks, such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, or recommender systems often do not rely on images or text but instead on tabular data. Adversarial robustness in tabular data poses two serious challenges. First, tabular datasets often contain categorical features, and therefore cannot be tackled directly with existing optimization procedures. Second, in the tabular domain, algorithms that are not based on deep networks are widely used and offer great performance, but algorithms to enhance robustness are tailored to neural networks (e.g. adversarial training). In this paper, we tackle both challenges. We present a method that allows us to train adversarially robust deep networks for tabular data and to transfer this robustness to other classifiers via universal robust embeddings tailored to categorical data. These embeddings, created using a bilevel alternating minimization framework, can be transferred to boosted trees or random forests making them robust without the need for adversarial training while preserving their high accuracy on tabular data.

The recently proposed \\underline{p}atch-level routing in \\underline{MoE} (pMoE) divides each input into $n$ patches (or tokens) and sends $l$ patches ($l\\ll n$) to each expert through prioritized routing. pMoE has demonstrated great empirical success in reducing training and inference costs while maintaining test accuracy. However, the theoretical explanation of pMoE and the general MoE remains elusive. Focusing on a supervised classification task using a mixture of two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we show for the first time that pMoE provably reduces the required number of training samples to achieve desirable generalization (referred to as the sample complexity) by a factor in the polynomial order of $n/l$, and outperforms its single-expert counterpart of the same or even larger capacity. The advantage results from the discriminative routing property, which is justified in both theory and practice that pMoE routers can filter label-irrelevant patches and route similar class-discriminative patches to the same expert. Our experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA support our theoretical findings on pMoE's generalization and show that pMoE can avoid learning spurious correlations. ",

    "title": "PANE-GNN: Unifying Positive and Negative Edges in Graph Neural Networks  for Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems play a crucial role in addressing the issue of information overload by delivering personalized recommendations to users. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) for recommender systems, capitalizing on advancements in graph representation learning. These GNN-based models primarily focus on analyzing users' positive feedback while overlooking the valuable insights provided by their negative feedback. In this paper, we propose PANE-GNN, an innovative recommendation model that unifies Positive And Negative Edges in Graph Neural Networks for recommendation. By incorporating user preferences and dispreferences, our approach enhances the capability of recommender systems to offer personalized suggestions. PANE-GNN first partitions the raw rating graph into two distinct bipartite graphs based on positive and negative feedback. Subsequently, we employ two separate embeddings, the interest embedding and the disinterest embedding, to capture users' likes and dislikes, respectively. To facilitate effective information propagation, we design distinct message-passing mechanisms for positive and negative feedback. Furthermore, we introduce a distortion to the negative graph, which exclusively consists of negative feedback edges, for contrastive training. This distortion plays a crucial role in effectively denoising the negative feedback. The experimental results provide compelling evidence that PANE-GNN surpasses the existing state-of-the-art benchmark methods across four real-world datasets. These datasets include three commonly used recommender system datasets and one open-source short video recommendation dataset. ",

    "abstract": "High annotation cost for training machine learning classifiers has driven extensive research in active learning and self-supervised learning. Recent research has shown that in the context of supervised learning different active learning strategies need to be applied at various stages of the training process to ensure improved performance over the random baseline. We refer to the point where the number of available annotations changes the suitable active learning strategy as the phase transition point. In this paper, we establish that when combining active learning with self-supervised models to achieve improved performance, the phase transition point occurs earlier. It becomes challenging to determine which strategy should be used for previously unseen datasets. We argue that existing active learning algorithms are heavily influenced by the phase transition because the empirical risk over the entire active learning pool estimated by these algorithms is inaccurate and influenced by the number of labeled samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel active learning strategy, neural tangent kernel clustering-pseudo-labels (NTKCPL). It estimates empirical risk based on pseudo-labels and the model prediction with NTK approximation. We analyze the factors affecting this approximation error and design a pseudo-label clustering generation method to reduce the approximation error. We validate our method on five datasets, empirically demonstrating that it outperforms the baseline methods in most cases and is valid over a wider range of training budgets. ",

Following the recent success of prompt-tuning, we present the cloze task in the same format as the main QA task, allowing the model to learn both tasks seamlessly together to fully take advantage of the power of prompt-tuning. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that Gotta consistently outperforms competitive baselines, validating the effectiveness of our proposed prompt-tuning-based cloze task, which not only fine-tunes language models but also learns to guide reasoning in QA tasks. Further analysis shows that the prompt-based loss incorporates the auxiliary task better than the multi-task loss, highlighting the strength of prompt-tuning on the few-shot QA task. ",

However, concrete evidence has revealed that a graph neural network could be biased against certain demographic groups, which calls for the consideration of algorithmic fairness. Despite the increasing efforts in ensuring algorithmic fairness on graph neural networks, they often do not explicitly consider the induced bias caused by message passing in GNN during training. In this paper, we first investigate the problem of bias amplification in message passing. We empirically and theoretically demonstrate that message passing could amplify the bias when the 1-hop neighbors from different demographic groups are unbalanced. Guided by such analyses, we propose BeMap, a fair message passing method, that leverages a balance-aware sampling strategy to balance the number of the 1-hop neighbors of each node among different demographic groups. Extensive experiments on node classification demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed BeMap method in mitigating bias while maintaining classification accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Membership inference attack is one of the most popular privacy attacks in machine learning, which aims to predict whether a given sample was contained in the target model's training set. Label-only membership inference attack is a variant that exploits sample robustness and attracts more attention since it assumes a practical scenario in which the adversary only has access to the predicted labels of the input samples. However, since the decision boundary distance, which measures robustness, is strongly affected by the random initial image, the adversary may get opposite results even for the same input samples. In this paper, we propose a new attack method, called muti-class adaptive membership inference attack in the label-only setting. All decision boundary distances for all target classes have been traversed in the early attack iterations, and the subsequent attack iterations continue with the shortest decision boundary distance to obtain a stable and optimal decision boundary distance. Instead of using a single boundary distance, the relative boundary distance between samples and neighboring points has also been employed as a new membership score to distinguish between member samples inside the training set and nonmember samples outside the training set. Experiments show that previous label-only membership inference attacks using the untargeted HopSkipJump algorithm fail to achieve optimal decision bounds in more than half of the samples, whereas our multi-targeted HopSkipJump algorithm succeeds in almost all samples. In addition, extensive experiments show that our multi-class adaptive MIA outperforms current label-only membership inference attacks in the CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, especially for the true positive rate at low false positive rates metric.

Our pipeline automatically recognizes screentone regions and generates novel screentones with newly specified characteristics (e.g., intensity or type). Existing manga generation methods have limitations in understanding and synthesizing complex tone- or intensity-varying regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel interpretable representation of screentones that disentangles their intensity and type features, enabling better recognition and synthesis of screentones. This interpretable screentone representation reduces ambiguity in recognizing intensity-varying regions and provides fine-grained controls during screentone synthesis by decoupling and anchoring the type or the intensity feature. Our proposed method is demonstrated to be effective and convenient through various experiments, showcasing the superiority of the newly proposed pipeline with the interpretable screentone representations.

Therefore, accurate side-slip angle observers are necessary for the proper planning and control of vehicles. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines model-based side-slip angle estimation with neural networks. We apply our approach to real vehicle data.

In this work, we proposed a stochastic optimization-based motion generation method to generate collision-free and time-optimal motion for the articulated robot represented by composite signed distance field (SDF) networks. First, we propose composite SDF networks to learn the SDF for articulated robots. The learned composite SDF networks combined with the kinematics of the robot allow for quick and accurate estimates of the minimum distance between the robot and obstacles in a batch fashion. Then, a stochastic optimization-based trajectory planning algorithm generates a spatial-optimized and collision-free trajectory offline with the learned composite SDF networks. This stochastic trajectory planner is formulated as a Bayesian Inference problem with a time-normalized Gaussian process prior and exponential likelihood function. The Gaussian process prior can enforce initial and goal position constraints in Configuration Space. Besides, it can encode the correlation of waypoints in time series. The likelihood function aims at encoding task-related cost terms, such as collision avoidance, trajectory length penalty, boundary avoidance, etc. The kernel updating strategies combined with model-predictive path integral (MPPI) is proposed to solve the maximum a posteriori inference problems. Lastly, we integrate the learned composite SDF networks into the trajectory planning algorithm and apply it to a Franka Emika Panda robot. The simulation and experiment results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

To this end, we propose to augment the knowledge directly in the input of LLMs. Specifically, we first retrieve the relevant facts to the input question from the knowledge graph based on semantic similarities between the question and its associated facts. After that, we prepend the retrieved facts to the input question in the form of the prompt, which is then forwarded to LLMs to generate the answer. Our framework, Knowledge-Augmented language model PromptING (KAPING), requires no model training, thus completely zero-shot. We validate the performance of our KAPING framework on the knowledge graph question answering task, that aims to answer the user's question based on facts over a knowledge graph, on which ours outperforms relevant zero-shot baselines by up to 48% in average, across multiple LLMs of various sizes.

Although it is desirable for a security system to be able to identify emergencies, existing corpora provide only a binary label (i.e., shouted or normal) for each speech sample, making it difficult to predict the shout intensity.

Thus, this paper presents a novel research source, the RItsumeikan Shout Corpus (RISC), which contains wide variety types of shouted speech samples collected in recording experiments. Each shouted speech sample in RISC has a shout type and is also assigned shout intensity ratings via a crowdsourcing service. We also present a comprehensive performance comparison among deep learning approaches for speech type classification tasks and a shout intensity prediction task. The results show that feature learning based on the spectral and cepstral domains achieves high performance, no matter which network architecture is used.

    "abstract": "Relation extraction task is a crucial and challenging aspect of Natural Language Processing. Several methods have surfaced as of late, exhibiting notable performance in addressing the task; however, most of these approaches rely on vast amounts of data from large-scale knowledge graphs or language models pretrained on voluminous corpora. In this paper, we hone in on the effective utilization of solely the knowledge supplied by a corpus to create a high-performing model. Our objective is to showcase that by leveraging the hierarchical structure and relational distribution of entities within a corpus without introducing external knowledge, a relation extraction model can achieve significantly enhanced performance. We therefore proposed a relation extraction approach based on the incorporation of pretrained knowledge graph embeddings at the corpus scale into the sentence-level contextual representation. We conducted a series of experiments which revealed promising and very interesting results for our proposed approach.The obtained results demonstrated an outperformance of our method compared to context-based relation extraction models.

    "abstract": "Graph-based semi-supervised node classification has been shown to become a state-of-the-art approach in many applications with high research value and significance. Most existing methods are only based on the original intrinsic or artificially established graph structure which may not accurately reflect the \"true\" correlation among data and are not optimal for semi-supervised node classification in the downstream graph neural networks. Besides, while existing graph-based methods mostly utilize the explicit graph structure, some implicit information, for example, the density information, can also provide latent information that can be further exploited. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Dual Hypergraph Neural Network (DualHGNN), a new dual connection model integrating both hypergraph structure learning and hypergraph representation learning simultaneously in a unified architecture. The DualHGNN first leverages a multi-view hypergraph learning network to explore the optimal hypergraph structure from multiple views, constrained by a consistency loss proposed to improve its generalization. Then, DualHGNN employs a density-aware hypergraph attention network to explore the high-order semantic correlation among data points based on the density-aware attention mechanism. Extensive experiments are conducted in various benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "Topic models have been prevalent for decades with various applications. However, existing topic models commonly suffer from the notorious topic collapsing: discovered topics semantically collapse towards each other, leading to highly repetitive topics, insufficient topic discovery, and damaged model interpretability. In this paper, we propose a new neural topic model, Embedding Clustering Regularization Topic Model (ECRTM). Besides the existing reconstruction error, we propose a novel Embedding Clustering Regularization (ECR), which forces each topic embedding to be the center of a separately aggregated word embedding cluster in the semantic space. This enables each produced topic to contain distinct word semantics, which alleviates topic collapsing. Regularized by ECR, our ECRTM generates diverse and coherent topics together with high-quality topic distributions of documents. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ECRTM effectively addresses the topic collapsing issue and consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in terms of topic quality, topic distributions of documents, and downstream classification tasks.

Hence, the need to address citizens' privacy while they drive and, correspondingly, the importance of privacy threat modelling (in support of a respective risk assessment, such as through a Data Protection Impact Assessment). This paper addresses privacy threats by advancing a general modelling methodology and by demonstrating it specifically on soft privacy, which ensures citizens' full control on their personal data. By considering all relevant threat agents, the paper applies the methodology to the specific automotive domain while keeping threats at the same level of detail as ENISA's. The main result beside the modelling methodology consists of both domain-independent and automotive domain-dependent soft privacy threats. While cybersecurity has been vastly threat-modelled so far, this paper extends the literature with a threat model for soft privacy on smart cars, producing 17 domain-independent threats that, associated with 41 domain-specific assets, shape a novel set of domain-dependent threats in automotive.

The solution process is often computationally expensive and it can be difficult to interpret the solution in high-dimensional input spaces. In this paper, we use a problem from additive manufacturing to address these two issues with the intent of making it easier to solve inverse problems and exploit their results. First, focusing on Gaussian process surrogates that are used to solve inverse problems, we describe how a simple modification to the idea of tapering can substantially speed up the surrogate without losing accuracy in prediction. Second, we demonstrate that Kohonen self-organizing maps can be used to visualize and interpret the solution to the inverse problem in the high-dimensional input space. For our data set, as not all input dimensions are equally important, we show that using weighted distances results in a better organized map that makes the relationships among the inputs obvious. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce Probabilistic Coordinate Fields (PCFs), a novel geometric-invariant coordinate representation for image correspondence problems. In contrast to standard Cartesian coordinates, PCFs encode coordinates in correspondence-specific barycentric coordinate systems (BCS) with affine invariance. To know \\textit{when and where to trust} the encoded coordinates, we implement PCFs in a probabilistic network termed PCF-Net, which parameterizes the distribution of coordinate fields as Gaussian mixture models. By jointly optimizing coordinate fields and their confidence conditioned on dense flows, PCF-Net can work with various feature descriptors when quantifying the reliability of PCFs by confidence maps. An interesting observation of this work is that the learned confidence map converges to geometrically coherent and semantically consistent regions, which facilitates robust coordinate representation. By delivering the confident coordinates to keypoint/feature descriptors, we show that PCF-Net can be used as a plug-in to existing correspondence-dependent approaches. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets suggest that accurate geometric invariant coordinates help to achieve the state of the art in several correspondence problems, such as sparse feature matching, dense image registration, camera pose estimation, and consistency filtering. Further, the interpretable confidence map predicted by PCF-Net can also be leveraged to other novel applications from texture transfer to multi-homography classification. ",

To address this issue, previous works generate randomized 3D scenes and pre-train models on generated data. Although the pre-trained models gain promising performance boosts, previous works have two major shortcomings. First, they focus on only one downstream task (i.e., object detection). Second, a fair comparison of generated data is still lacking. In this work, we systematically compare data generation methods using a unified setup. To clarify the generalization of the pre-trained models, we evaluate their performance in multiple tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic segmentation) and with different pre-training methods (e.g., masked autoencoder and contrastive learning). Moreover, we propose a new method to generate 3D scenes with spherical harmonics. It surpasses the previous formula-driven method with a clear margin and achieves on-par results with methods using real-world scans and CAD models. ",

At the same time, this framework serves the functions of column image embedding and global feature intersection, enabling the model to obtain information in not only spatial but frequency domain, and thus improving the prediction accuracy of the model. Numerical experiments have been designed for several models, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive framework. Numerical experiments show that our data augmentation framework can improve the performance of original neural network model by 2%, which provides competitive results to state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Most self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often work on curated datasets where the object-centric assumption holds. This assumption breaks down in uncurated scene images. Existing scene image SSL methods try to find the two views from original scene images that are well matched or dense, which is both complex and computationally heavy. This paper proposes a conceptually different pipeline: first find regions that are coarse objects (with adequate objectness), crop them out as pseudo object-centric images, then any SSL method can be directly applied as in a real object-centric dataset. That is, cropping benefits scene images SSL. A novel cropping strategy is proposed to find coarse object regions in scene images. The proposed pipeline and cropping strategy successfully learn high quality visual representation from uncurated scene datasets like MS-COCO, and the learning does not rely on external object-centric datasets such as ImageNet. Experiments show that our pipeline outperforms existing SSL methods on scene images, and is friendly for non-contrastive SSL methods like MAE. Ablations further verify that the proposed cropping strategy does not rely on pretrained SSL models, too. ",

SVAT-CMCS facilitates the use of known vulnerability and exploit information, incremental testing of system components and data analysis techniques to identify attack pathways in CMCSs. This data can be utilized for corrective activities or to target controlled manual follow-up testing. This paper presents the SVAT-CMCS paradigm and describes its implementation in a software tool, which was built using the Blackboard Architecture, that can be utilized for attack pathway identification. The performance of this tool is characterized using three example models. In particular, it explores the path generation speed and the impact of link cap restrictions on system operations, under different levels of network size and complexity. Accurate fact-rule processing is also tested using these models. The results show significant decreases in path generation efficiency as the link cap and network complexity increase; however, rule processing accuracy is not impacted. ",

Our contribution consists of experiments on timed process interventions with synthetic data that renders genuine online RL and the comparison to CI possible, and allows for an accurate evaluation of the results. Our experiments reveal that RL's policies outperform those from CI and are more robust at the same time. Indeed, the RL policies approach perfect policies.

However, at high SNR and with high modulation orders, the achievable rate saturates after a finite SNR value due to the stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon. This paper proposes a novel pseudo-random quantization (PRQ) scheme by modifying the quantization thresholds that can help compensate for the effects of SR and makes communication with high-order modulation schemes such as $1024$-QAM in one-bit quantized uplink massive MIMO systems possible. Moreover, modified linear detectors for non-zero threshold quantization are derived, and a two-stage uplink detector for single-carrier (SC) multi-user systems is proposed. The first stage is an iterative method called Boxed Newton Detector (BND) that utilizes Newton's Method to maximize the log-likelihood with box constraints. The second stage, Nearest Codeword Detector (NCD), exploits the first stage solution and creates a small set of most likely candidates based on sign constraints to increase detection performance. The proposed two-stage method with PRQ outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors from the literature with comparable complexity while supporting high-order modulation schemes. ",

    "abstract": "Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) aims to extract all emotion clauses and their corresponding cause clauses from a document. Existing approaches tackle this task through multi-task learning (MTL) framework in which the two subtasks provide indicative clues for ECPE. However, the previous MTL framework considers only one round of multi-task reasoning and ignores the reverse feedbacks from ECPE to the subtasks. Besides, its multi-task reasoning only relies on semantics-level interactions, which cannot capture the explicit dependencies, and both the encoder sharing and multi-task hidden states concatenations can hardly capture the causalities. To solve these issues, we first put forward a new MTL framework based on Co-evolving Reasoning. It (1) models the bidirectional feedbacks between ECPE and its subtasks; (2) allows the three tasks to evolve together and prompt each other recurrently; (3) integrates prediction-level interactions to capture explicit dependencies. Then we propose a novel multi-task relational graph (MRG) to sufficiently exploit the causal relations. Finally, we propose a Co-evolving Graph Reasoning Network (CGR-Net) that implements our MTL framework and conducts Co-evolving Reasoning on MRG. Experimental results show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art performance, and further analysis confirms the advantages of our method. ",

Previous studies show that the performance gap between low and high-resolution systems gets more prominent as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases since the detection performance starts to saturate at some point due to the stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon. In our previous work, we proposed new quantization and detection schemes for one-bit massive MIMO systems operating under frequency-flat fading. This paper offers a new frequency domain equalization (FDE) scheme that can work with the previously proposed pseudo-random quantization (PRQ) scheme to mitigate the effects of SR to support high-order modulation schemes such as $64$-QAM and $256$-QAM. Our equalizer is based on a projected quasi-Newton method for one-bit uplink massive MIMO systems applicable for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and single carrier (SC) transmission under frequency-selective fading. The proposed low-complexity detector can outperform the benchmark detector from the literature with very similar complexity. We analyze the effects of PRQ under frequency-selective fading for different scenarios and show that the PRQ scheme can close the performance gap between SC and OFDM systems by simulations. ",

    "abstract": "Collaborative Mobile Crowd Sensing (CMCS) enhances data quality and coverage by promoting teamwork in task sensing, with worker recruitment representing a complex multi-objective optimization problem. Existing strategies mainly focus on the characteristics of workers themselves, neglecting the asymmetric trust relationships between them, which affects the rationality of task utility evaluation. To address this, this paper first employs the Mini-Batch K-Means clustering algorithm and deploys edge servers to enable efficient distributed worker recruitment. Historical data and task requirements are utilized to obtain workers' ability types and distances. A trust-directed graph in the worker's social network is input into the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) framework for training, capturing asymmetric trustworthiness between worker pairs. Privacy leakage is prevented in CMCS scenarios through high trust values between workers. Ultimately, an undirected recruitment graph is constructed using workers' abilities, trust values, and distance weights, transforming the worker recruitment problem into a Maximum Weight Average Subgraph Problem (MWASP). A Tabu Search Recruitment (TSR) algorithm is proposed to rationally recruit a balanced multi-objective optimal task utility worker set for each task. Extensive simulation experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, outperforming other strategies. ",

Cographs are precisely those graphs that can be uniquely represented by a rooted tree where the leaves of the tree correspond to the vertices of the graph. As a generalization, GaTEx graphs are precisely those graphs that can be uniquely represented by a particular rooted directed acyclic graph (called galled-tree). We consider here four prominent problems that are, in general, NP-hard: computing the size $\\omega(G)$ of a maximum clique, the size $\\chi(G)$ of an optimal vertex-coloring and the size $\\alpha(G)$ of a maximum independent set of a given graph $G$ as well as determining whether a graph is perfectly orderable. We show here that $\\omega(G)$, $\\chi(G)$, $\\alpha(G)$ can be computed in linear-time for GaTEx graphs $G$. The crucial idea for the linear-time algorithms is to avoid working on the GaTEx graphs $G$ directly, but to use the the galled-trees that explain $G$ as a guide for the algorithms to compute these invariants. In particular, we show first how to employ the galled-tree structure to compute a perfect ordering of GaTEx graphs in linear-time which is then used to determine $\\omega(G)$, $\\chi(G)$, $\\alpha(G)$.

In Arabic, this challenge gets amplified, with added complexities in collecting data from dysarthric speakers. In this paper, we aim to improve the performance of Arabic dysarthric automatic speech recognition through a multi-stage augmentation approach. To this effect, we first propose a signal-based approach to generate dysarthric Arabic speech from healthy Arabic speech by modifying its speed and tempo. We also propose a second stage Parallel Wave Generative (PWG) adversarial model that is trained on an English dysarthric dataset to capture language-independant dysarthric speech patterns and further augment the signal-adjusted speech samples. Furthermore, we propose a fine-tuning and text-correction strategies for Arabic Conformer at different dysarthric speech severity levels. Our fine-tuned Conformer achieved 18% Word Error Rate (WER) and 17.2% Character Error Rate (CER) on synthetically generated dysarthric speech from the Arabic commonvoice speech dataset. This shows significant WER improvement of 81.8% compared to the baseline model trained solely on healthy data. We perform further validation on real English dysarthric speech showing a WER improvement of 124% compared to the baseline trained only on healthy English LJSpeech dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is a potent tool for comprehending the \"language of life\" and can provide insights into various downstream biomedical tasks. Large-scale language models (LLMs) are starting to be used for cell representation learning. However, current LLM-based cell representation learning methods depend solely on the BERT architecture, causing an anisotropic embedding space that leads to inefficient semantic representation. Contrastive learning alleviates this problem by distributing the embeddings uniformly. As a larger batch size in contrastive learning results in better representation, the practical application of contrastive learning in cell representation learning is hampered by the high dimensionality of scRNA-seq data and the large parameter volume of LLMs. To address the batch size limitation, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer contrastive learning approach to decouple the batch size from the GPU memory size for cell representation learning. Based on our divide-and-conquer contrastive learning approach, we introduce Single-Cell Language Model CellLM, a large-scale cell representation learning model to handle high-dimensional scRNA-seq data with tens of thousands of genes. CellLM has over 50 million parameters trained with 2 million scRNA-seq data and makes the first attempt to learn cell language models from both normal cells and cancer cells. CellLM achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in all evaluated downstream tasks: including a 71.8 F_1-score for cell type annotation (a 3.0% absolute improvement over scBERT), an average F_1-score of 88.9 for single-cell drug sensitivity prediction in a few-shot scenario (an 8.3% absolute improvement), and a 93.4 Pearson's correlation for single-omics cell line drug sensitivity prediction (a 6.2% absolute improvement).

    "abstract": "Domain adaptive object detection aims to leverage the knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to improve the performance on an unlabeled target domain. Prior works typically require the access to the source domain data for adaptation, and the availability of sufficient data on the target domain. However, these assumptions may not hold due to data privacy and rare data collection. In this paper, we propose and investigate a more practical and challenging domain adaptive object detection problem under both source-free and few-shot conditions, named as SF-FSDA. To overcome this problem, we develop an efficient labeled data factory based approach. Without accessing the source domain, the data factory renders i) infinite amount of synthesized target-domain like images, under the guidance of the few-shot image samples and text description from the target domain; ii) corresponding bounding box and category annotations, only demanding minimum human effort, i.e., a few manually labeled examples. On the one hand, the synthesized images mitigate the knowledge insufficiency brought by the few-shot condition. On the other hand, compared to the popular pseudo-label technique, the generated annotations from data factory not only get rid of the reliance on the source pretrained object detection model, but also alleviate the unavoidably pseudo-label noise due to domain shift and source-free condition. The generated dataset is further utilized to adapt the source pretrained object detection model, realizing the robust object detection under SF-FSDA. The experiments on different settings showcase that our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on SF-FSDA problem. Our codes and models will be made publicly available. ",

We have proposed a bio-plausible meta-learning model inspired by the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex using spiking neural networks with a reward-based learning system. Our proposed model includes a memory designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon that occurs when meta-learning models forget what they have learned as soon as the new task begins. Also, our new model can easily be applied to spike-based neuromorphic devices and enables fast learning in neuromorphic hardware. The final analysis will discuss the implications and predictions of the model for solving few-shot classification tasks.

For a specific topic or community, opinion leaders are individuals who have a significant influence on others' opinions. Detecting and modeling opinion leaders is crucial as they play a vital role in shaping public opinion and driving online conversations. Existing research have extensively explored various methods for detecting opinion leaders, but there is a lack of consensus between definitions and methods. It is important to note that the term \"important node\" in graph theory does not necessarily align with the concept of \"opinion leader\" in social psychology. This paper aims to address this issue by introducing the methodologies for identifying influential nodes in OSNs and providing a corresponding definition of opinion leaders in relation to social psychology. The key novelty is to review connections and cross-compare different approaches that have origins in: graph theory, natural language processing, social psychology, control theory, and graph sampling. We discuss how they tell a different technical tale of influence and also propose how some of the approaches can be combined via networked dynamical systems modeling. A case study is performed on Twitter data to compare the performance of different methodologies discussed. The primary objective of this work is to elucidate the progression of opinion leader detection on OSNs and inspire further research in understanding the dynamics of opinion evolution within the field.

Importantly, our EV-GP criterion is training-free, i.e., it does not require any training of the NN during data selection, which makes it computationally efficient.

But ESS poses greater challenges than conventional object and regular smoke segmentation due to its small scale and transparent appearance, which can result in high miss detection rate and low precision. To address these issues, a Focus and Separation Network (FoSp) is proposed. We first introduce a Focus module employing bidirectional cascade which guides low-resolution and high-resolution features towards mid-resolution to locate and determine the scope of smoke, reducing the miss detection rate. Next, we propose a Separation module that separates smoke images into a pure smoke foreground and a smoke-free background, enhancing the contrast between smoke and background fundamentally, improving segmentation precision. Finally, a Domain Fusion module is developed to integrate the distinctive features of the two modules which can balance recall and precision to achieve high F_beta. Futhermore, to promote the development of ESS, we introduce a high-quality real-world dataset called SmokeSeg, which contains more small and transparent smoke than the existing datasets. Experimental results show that our model achieves the best performance on three available datasets: SYN70K (mIoU: 83.00%), SMOKE5K (F_beta: 81.6%) and SmokeSeg (F_beta: 72.05%). Especially, our FoSp outperforms SegFormer by 7.71% (F_beta) for early smoke segmentation on SmokeSeg. ",

    "title": "Vulnerable Smart Contract Function Locating Based on Multi-Relational  Nested Graph Convolutional Network",
    "abstract": "The immutable and trustable characteristics of blockchain enable smart contracts to be applied in various fields. Unfortunately, smart contracts are subject to various vulnerabilities, which are frequently exploited by attackers, causing financial damage to users.In this paper, we study the problem of vulnerable smart contract function locating. We construct a novel Multi-Relational Nested contract Graph (MRNG) to better characterize the rich syntactic and semantic information in the smart contract code, including the relationships between data and instructions. An MRNG represents a smart contract, where each node represents a function in the smart contract and each edge describes the calling relationship between the functions. In addition, we create a Multi-Relational Function Graph (MRFG) for each function, which characterizes the corresponding function code. That is, each function is characterized as an MRFG, which corresponds to a node in the MRNG. Each MRFG uses different types of edges to represent the different control and data relationships between nodes within a function. We also propose a Multi-Relational Nested Graph Convolutional Network (MRN-GCN) to process the MRNG. MRN-GCN first extracts and aggregates features from each MRFG, using the edge-enhanced graph convolution network and self-attention mechanism. The extracted feature vector is then assigned to the corresponding node in the MRNG to obtain a new Featured Contract Graph (FCG) for the smart contract. Graph convolution is used to further extract features from the FCG. Finally, a feed forward network with a Sigmoid function is used to locate the vulnerable functions. Experimental results on the real-world smart contract datasets show that model MRN-GCN can effectively improve the accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score performance of vulnerable smart contract function locating.

    "abstract": "As computer vision systems are being increasingly deployed at scale in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving, concerns about social bias in these systems are rising. Analysis of fairness in real-world vision systems, such as object detection in driving scenes, has been limited to observing predictive inequity across attributes such as pedestrian skin tone, and lacks a consistent methodology to disentangle the role of confounding variables e.g. does my model perform worse for a certain skin tone, or are such scenes in my dataset more challenging due to occlusion and crowds? In this work, we introduce ICON$^2$, a framework for robustly answering this question. ICON$^2$ leverages prior knowledge on the deficiencies of object detection systems to identify performance discrepancies across sub-populations, compute correlations between these potential confounders and a given sensitive attribute, and control for the most likely confounders to obtain a more reliable estimate of model bias. Using our approach, we conduct an in-depth study on the performance of object detection with respect to income from the BDD100K driving dataset, revealing useful insights. ",

In this work, we study this question from a theoretical perspective. While recent work established such transferability and approximation results via graph limits, e.g., via graphons, these only apply non-trivially to dense graphs. To include frequently encountered sparse graphs such as bounded-degree or power law graphs, we take a perspective of taking limits of operators derived from graphs, such as the aggregation operation that makes up GNNs. This leads to the recently introduced limit notion of graphops (Backhausz and Szegedy, 2022). We demonstrate how the operator perspective allows us to develop quantitative bounds on the distance between a finite GNN and its limit on an infinite graph, as well as the distance between the GNN on graphs of different sizes that share structural properties, under a regularity assumption verified for various graph sequences. Our results hold for dense and sparse graphs, and various notions of graph limits. ",

However, the objectives used to train these networks enforce only that similar images are embedded at similar locations in the representation space, and do not directly constrain the global structure of the resulting space. Here, we explore the impact of supervising this global structure by linearly aligning it with human similarity judgments. We find that a naive approach leads to large changes in local representational structure that harm downstream performance. Thus, we propose a novel method that aligns the global structure of representations while preserving their local structure. This global-local transform considerably improves accuracy across a variety of few-shot learning and anomaly detection tasks. Our results indicate that human visual representations are globally organized in a way that facilitates learning from few examples, and incorporating this global structure into neural network representations improves performance on downstream tasks.

Recently, the first runtime analyses of the famous and highly cited EMO algorithm NSGA-II have emerged, demonstrating that practical algorithms with thousands of applications can be rigorously analysed. However, these results only show that NSGA-II has the same performance guarantees as GSEMO and it is unclear how and when NSGA-II can outperform GSEMO. We study this question in noisy optimisation and consider a noise model that adds large amounts of posterior noise to all objectives with some constant probability $p$ per evaluation. We show that GSEMO fails badly on every noisy fitness function as it tends to remove large parts of the population indiscriminately. In contrast, NSGA-II is able to handle the noise efficiently on \\textsc{LeadingOnesTrailingZeroes} when $p<1/2$, as the algorithm is able to preserve useful search points even in the presence of noise. We identify a phase transition at $p=1/2$ where the expected time to cover the Pareto front changes from polynomial to exponential. To our knowledge, this is the first proof that NSGA-II can outperform GSEMO and the first runtime analysis of NSGA-II in noisy optimisation. ",

Through experiments over state-of-the-art DSTs, the proposed framework leads to the greatest reduction in accuracy and the best attack success rate while maintaining good fluency and a low perturbation ratio.

Multi-frame temporal fusion which leverages historical information has been demonstrated to provide more comprehensive perception results. While most research focuses on ego-centric maps of fixed settings, long-range local map generation remains less explored. This work outlines a new paradigm, named NeMO, for generating local maps through the utilization of a readable and writable big map, a learning-based fusion module, and an interaction mechanism between the two. With an assumption that the feature distribution of all BEV grids follows an identical pattern, we adopt a shared-weight neural network for all grids to update the big map. This paradigm supports the fusion of longer time series and the generation of long-range BEV local maps. Furthermore, we release BDD-Map, a BDD100K-based dataset incorporating map element annotations, including lane lines, boundaries, and pedestrian crossing. Experiments on the NuScenes and BDD-Map datasets demonstrate that NeMO outperforms state-of-the-art map segmentation methods.

One of the key implicit assumptions when solving cooperative multi-robot problems is that all robots use the same (homogeneous) underlying algorithm. However, in practice, we want to allow collaboration between robots possessing different capabilities and that therefore must rely on heterogeneous algorithms. We present a system architecture and the supporting theory, to enable collaboration in a decentralized network of robots, where each robot relies on different estimation algorithms. To develop our approach, we focus on multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with multi-target tracking. Our theoretical framework builds on our idea of exploiting the conditional independence structure inherent to many robotics applications to separate between each robot's local inference (estimation) tasks and fuse only relevant parts of their non-equal, but overlapping probability density function (pdfs). We present a new decentralized graph-based approach to the multi-robot SLAM and tracking problem. We leverage factor graphs to split between different parts of the problem for efficient data sharing between robots in the network while enabling robots to use different local sparse landmark/dense/metric-semantic SLAM algorithms.

We first define a trajectory divergence measure based on the spatial and temporal features of demonstrated trajectories to detect and discard parts of the trajectories that have been significantly modified by an adversarial expert, and, could degrade the learner's performance, if used for learning, We then use an options-based algorithm that partitions trajectories and learns only from the parts of trajectories that have been determined as admissible. We provide theoretical results of our technique to show that repairing partial trajectories improves the sample efficiency of the demonstrations without degrading the learner's performance.

However, we find that existing calibration algorithms often overlook the issue of proximity bias, a phenomenon where models tend to be more overconfident in low proximity data (i.e., lying in the sparse region of the data distribution) compared to high proximity samples, and thus suffer from inconsistent miscalibration across different proximity samples. We examine the problem over pretrained ImageNet models and observe that: 1) Proximity bias exists across a wide variety of model architectures and sizes; 2) Transformer-based models are more susceptible to proximity bias than CNN-based models; 3) Proximity bias persists even after performing popular calibration algorithms like temperature scaling; 4) Models tend to overfit more heavily on low proximity samples than on high proximity samples. Motivated by the empirical findings, we propose ProCal, a plug-and-play algorithm with a theoretical guarantee to adjust sample confidence based on proximity. To further quantify the effectiveness of calibration algorithms in mitigating proximity bias, we introduce proximity-informed expected calibration error (PIECE) with theoretical analysis. We show that ProCal is effective in addressing proximity bias and improving calibration on balanced, long-tail, and distribution-shift settings under four metrics over various model architectures. ",

However, the usage of diffusion models to generate high-quality object detection data remains an underexplored area, where not only the image-level perceptual quality but also geometric conditions such as bounding boxes and camera views are essential. Previous studies have utilized either copy-paste synthesis or layout-to-image (L2I) generation with specifically designed modules to encode semantic layouts. In this paper, we propose GeoDiffusion, a simple framework that can flexibly translate various geometric conditions into text prompts and empower the pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models for high-quality detection data generation. Unlike previous L2I methods, our GeoDiffusion is able to encode not only bounding boxes but also extra geometric conditions such as camera views in self-driving scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate GeoDiffusion outperforms previous L2I methods while maintaining 4x training time faster. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt diffusion models for layout-to-image generation with geometric conditions and demonstrate that L2I-generated images can be beneficial for improving the performance of object detectors.

We find that the distribution shift settings in previous studies commonly lack adequate challenges, hindering the accurate evaluation of OOD robustness. To address these issues, we propose a benchmark construction protocol that ensures clear differentiation and challenging distribution shifts. Then we introduce BOSS, a Benchmark suite for Out-of-distribution robustneSS evaluation covering 5 tasks and 20 datasets. Based on BOSS, we conduct a series of experiments on pre-trained language models for analysis and evaluation of OOD robustness. First, for vanilla fine-tuning, we examine the relationship between in-distribution (ID) and OOD performance. We identify three typical types that unveil the inner learning mechanism, which could potentially facilitate the forecasting of OOD robustness, correlating with the advancements on ID datasets. Then, we evaluate 5 classic methods on BOSS and find that, despite exhibiting some effectiveness in specific cases, they do not offer significant improvement compared to vanilla fine-tuning. Further, we evaluate 5 LLMs with various adaptation paradigms and find that when sufficient ID data is available, fine-tuning domain-specific models outperform LLMs on ID examples significantly. However, in the case of OOD instances, prioritizing LLMs with in-context learning yields better results. We identify that both fine-tuned small models and LLMs face challenges in effectively addressing downstream tasks. The code is public at \\url{https://github.com/lifan-yuan/OOD_NLP}. ",

Specifically, ARTIC3D is built upon a skeleton-based surface representation and is further guided by 2D diffusion priors from Stable Diffusion. First, we enhance the input images with occlusions/truncation via 2D diffusion to obtain cleaner mask estimates and semantic features. Second, we perform diffusion-guided 3D optimization to estimate shape and texture that are of high-fidelity and faithful to input images. We also propose a novel technique to calculate more stable image-level gradients via diffusion models compared to existing alternatives. Finally, we produce realistic animations by fine-tuning the rendered shape and texture under rigid part transformations. Extensive evaluations on multiple existing datasets as well as newly introduced noisy web image collections with occlusions and truncation demonstrate that ARTIC3D outputs are more robust to noisy images, higher quality in terms of shape and texture details, and more realistic when animated.

    "abstract": "Selecting hyperparameters in deep learning greatly impacts its effectiveness but requires manual effort and expertise. Recent works show that Bayesian model selection with Laplace approximations can allow to optimize such hyperparameters just like standard neural network parameters using gradients and on the training data. However, estimating a single hyperparameter gradient requires a pass through the entire dataset, limiting the scalability of such algorithms. In this work, we overcome this issue by introducing lower bounds to the linearized Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood. In contrast to previous estimators, these bounds are amenable to stochastic-gradient-based optimization and allow to trade off estimation accuracy against computational complexity. We derive them using the function-space form of the linearized Laplace, which can be estimated using the neural tangent kernel. Experimentally, we show that the estimators can significantly accelerate gradient-based hyperparameter optimization. ",

    "abstract": "Extended reality (XR) is a key innovation of 5G-advanced and beyond networks. The diverse XR use-cases, including virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality, transform the way humans interact with surrounding environments. Thus, XR technology enables true immersive experiences of novel services spanning, e.g., e-commerce, healthcare, and education, respectively. However, the efficient support of XR services over existing and future cellular systems is highly challenging and requires multiple radio design improvements, due to the unique XR traffic and performance characteristics. Thus, this article surveys the state-of-art 3GPP standardization activities (release-18) for integrating the XR service class into the 5G-advanced specifications, highlighting the major XR performance challenges. Furthermore, the paper introduces valuable insights and research directions for supporting true XR services over the next-generation 6G networks, where multiple novel radio design mindsets and protocol enhancements are proposed and evaluated using extensive system level simulations, including solutions for application-native dynamic performance reporting, traffic-dependent control channel design, collaborative device aggregation for XR capacity boosting and offload, respectively.

    "abstract": "One of the goals of causal inference is to generalize from past experiments and observational data to novel conditions. While it is in principle possible to eventually learn a mapping from a novel experimental condition to an outcome of interest, provided a sufficient variety of experiments is available in the training data, coping with a large combinatorial space of possible interventions is hard. Under a typical sparse experimental design, this mapping is ill-posed without relying on heavy regularization or prior distributions. Such assumptions may or may not be reliable, and can be hard to defend or test. In this paper, we take a close look at how to warrant a leap from past experiments to novel conditions based on minimal assumptions about the factorization of the distribution of the manipulated system, communicated in the well-understood language of factor graph models. A postulated $\\textit{interventional factor model}$ (IFM) may not always be informative, but it conveniently abstracts away a need for explicit unmeasured confounding and feedback mechanisms, leading to directly testable claims. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for causal effect identifiability with IFMs using data from a collection of experimental settings, and implement practical algorithms for generalizing expected outcomes to novel conditions never observed in the data.

    "title": "TEC-Net: Vision Transformer Embrace Convolutional Neural Networks for  Medical Image Segmentation",
    "abstract": "The hybrid architecture of convolution neural networks (CNN) and Transformer has been the most popular method for medical image segmentation. However, the existing networks based on the hybrid architecture suffer from two problems. First, although the CNN branch can capture image local features by using convolution operation, the vanilla convolution is unable to achieve adaptive extraction of image features. Second, although the Transformer branch can model the global information of images, the conventional self-attention only focuses on the spatial self-attention of images and ignores the channel and cross-dimensional self-attention leading to low segmentation accuracy for medical images with complex backgrounds. To solve these problems, we propose vision Transformer embrace convolutional neural networks for medical image segmentation (TEC-Net). Our network has two advantages. First, dynamic deformable convolution (DDConv) is designed in the CNN branch, which not only overcomes the difficulty of adaptive feature extraction using fixed-size convolution kernels, but also solves the defect that different inputs share the same convolution kernel parameters, effectively improving the feature expression ability of CNN branch. Second, in the Transformer branch, a (shifted)-window adaptive complementary attention module ((S)W-ACAM) and compact convolutional projection are designed to enable the network to fully learn the cross-dimensional long-range dependency of medical images with few parameters and calculations. Experimental results show that the proposed TEC-Net provides better medical image segmentation results than SOTA methods including CNN and Transformer networks. In addition, our TEC-Net requires fewer parameters and computational costs and does not rely on pre-training. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/SR0920/TEC-Net. ",

    "title": "Self-supervised Audio Teacher-Student Transformer for Both Clip-level  and Frame-level Tasks",
    "abstract": "In recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a popular approach for learning audio representations. The ultimate goal of audio self-supervised pre-training is to transfer knowledge to downstream audio tasks, generally including clip-level and frame-level tasks. Clip-level tasks classify the scene or sound of an entire audio clip, e.g. audio tagging, instrument recognition, etc. While frame-level tasks detect event-level timestamps from an audio clip, e.g. sound event detection, speaker diarization, etc. Prior studies primarily evaluate on clip-level downstream tasks. Frame-level tasks are important for fine-grained acoustic scene/event understanding, and are generally more challenging than clip-level tasks. In order to tackle both clip-level and frame-level tasks, this paper proposes two self-supervised audio representation learning methods: ATST-Clip and ATST-Frame, responsible for learning clip-level and frame-level representations, respectively. ATST stands for Audio Teacher-Student Transformer, which means both methods use a transformer encoder and a teacher-student training scheme.Experimental results show that our ATST-Frame model obtains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on most of the clip-level and frame-level downstream tasks. Especially, it outperforms other models by a large margin on the frame-level sound event detection task. In addition, the performance can be further improved by combining the two models through knowledge distillation. ",

    "abstract": "One key communication block in 5G and 6G radios is the active phased array (APA). To ensure reliable operation, efficient and timely fault diagnosis of APAs on-site is crucial. To date, fault diagnosis has relied on measurement of frequency domain radiation patterns using costly equipment and multiple strictly controlled measurement probes, which are time-consuming, complex, and therefore infeasible for on-site deployment. This paper proposes a novel method exploiting a Deep Neural Network (DNN) tailored to extract the features hidden in the baseband in-phase and quadrature signals for classifying the different faults. It requires only a single probe in one measurement point for fast and accurate diagnosis of the faulty elements and components in APAs. Validation of the proposed method is done using a commercial 28 GHz APA. Accuracies of 99% and 80% have been demonstrated for single- and multi-element failure detection, respectively. Three different test scenarios are investigated: on-off antenna elements, phase variations, and magnitude attenuation variations. In a low signal to noise ratio of 4 dB, stable fault detection accuracy above 90% is maintained. This is all achieved with a detection time of milliseconds (e.g 6~ms), showing a high potential for on-site deployment. ",

    "abstract": "On-chip implementation of optical nonlinear activation functions (NAFs) is essential for realizing large-scale photonic neural chips. To implement different neural processing and machine learning tasks with optimal performances, different NAFs are explored with the use of different devices. From the perspective of on-chip integration and reconfigurability of photonic neural network (PNN), it is highly preferred that a single compact device can fulfill multiple NAFs. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a compact high-speed microdisk modulator to realize multiple NAFs. The fabricated microdisk modulator has an add-drop configuration in which a lateral PN junction is incorporated for tuning. Based on high-speed nonlinear electrical-optical (E-O) effect, multiple NAFs are realized by electrically controlling free-carrier injection. Thanks to its strong optical confinement of the disk cavity, all-optical thermo-optic (TO) nonlinear effect can also be leveraged to realize other four different NAFs, which is difficult to be realized with the use of electrical-optical effect. With the use of the realized nonlinear activation function, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is studied to perform handwritten digit classification task, and an accuracy as large as 98% is demonstrated, which verifies the effectiveness of the use of the high-speed microdisk modulator to realize the NAFs. Thanks to its compact footprint and strong electrical-optical or all-optical effects, the microdisk modulator features multiple NAFs, which could serve as a flexible nonlinear unit for large-scale PNNs.

In this paper, we first present a unifying framework, distribution feature matching (DFM), that recovers as particular instances various estimators introduced in previous literature. We derive a general performance bound for DFM procedures, improving in several key aspects upon previous bounds derived in particular cases. We then extend this analysis to study robustness of DFM procedures in the misspecified setting under departure from the exact label shift hypothesis, in particular in the case of contamination of the target by an unknown distribution. These theoretical findings are confirmed by a detailed numerical study on simulated and real-world datasets. We also introduce an efficient, scalable and robust version of kernel-based DFM using the Random Fourier Feature principle. ",

    "abstract": "Information on natural phenomena and engineering systems is typically contained in data. Data can be corrupted by systematic errors in models and experiments. In this paper, we propose a tool to uncover the spatiotemporal solution of the underlying physical system by removing the systematic errors from data. The tool is the physics-constrained convolutional neural network (PC-CNN), which combines information from both the systems governing equations and data. We focus on fundamental phenomena that are modelled by partial differential equations, such as linear convection, Burgers equation, and two-dimensional turbulence. First, we formulate the problem, describe the physics-constrained convolutional neural network, and parameterise the systematic error. Second, we uncover the solutions from data corrupted by large multimodal systematic errors. Third, we perform a parametric study for different systematic errors. We show that the method is robust. Fourth, we analyse the physical properties of the uncovered solutions. We show that the solutions inferred from the PC-CNN are physical, in contrast to the data corrupted by systematic errors that does not fulfil the governing equations. This work opens opportunities for removing epistemic errors from models, and systematic errors from measurements. ",
