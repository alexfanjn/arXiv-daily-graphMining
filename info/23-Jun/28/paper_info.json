    "title": "Detect Depression from Social Networks with Sentiment Knowledge Sharing",
    "abstract": "Social network plays an important role in propagating people's viewpoints, emotions, thoughts, and fears. Notably, following lockdown periods during the COVID-19 pandemic, the issue of depression has garnered increasing attention, with a significant portion of individuals resorting to social networks as an outlet for expressing emotions. Using deep learning techniques to discern potential signs of depression from social network messages facilitates the early identification of mental health conditions. Current efforts in detecting depression through social networks typically rely solely on analyzing the textual content, overlooking other potential information. In this work, we conduct a thorough investigation that unveils a strong correlation between depression and negative emotional states. The integration of such associations as external knowledge can provide valuable insights for detecting depression. Accordingly, we propose a multi-task training framework, DeSK, which utilizes shared sentiment knowledge to enhance the efficacy of depression detection. Experiments conducted on both Chinese and English datasets demonstrate the cross-lingual effectiveness of DeSK. ",

    "abstract": "The problem of unveiling the author of a given text document from multiple candidate authors is called authorship attribution. Manifold word-based stylistic markers have been successfully used in deep learning methods to deal with the intrinsic problem of authorship attribution. Unfortunately, the performance of word-based authorship attribution systems is limited by the vocabulary of the training corpus. Literature has recommended character-based stylistic markers as an alternative to overcome the hidden word problem. However, character-based methods often fail to capture the sequential relationship of words in texts which is a chasm for further improvement. The question addressed in this paper is whether it is possible to address the ambiguity of hidden words in text documents while preserving the sequential context of words. Consequently, a method based on bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) with a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to capture sequential writing styles for authorship attribution. The BLSTM was used to obtain the sequential relationship among characteristics using subword information. The 2-dimensional CNN was applied to understand the local syntactical position of the style from unlabeled input text. The proposed method was experimentally evaluated against numerous state-of-the-art methods across the public corporal of CCAT50, IMDb62, Blog50, and Twitter50. Experimental results indicate accuracy improvement of 1.07\\%, and 0.96\\% on CCAT50 and Twitter, respectively, and produce comparable results on the remaining datasets. ",

    "abstract": "We study universal traits which emerge both in real-world complex datasets, as well as in artificially generated ones. Our approach is to analogize data to a physical system and employ tools from statistical physics and Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to reveal their underlying structure. We focus on the feature-feature covariance matrix, analyzing both its local and global eigenvalue statistics. Our main observations are: (i) The power-law scalings that the bulk of its eigenvalues exhibit are vastly different for uncorrelated random data compared to real-world data, (ii) this scaling behavior can be completely recovered by introducing long range correlations in a simple way to the synthetic data, (iii) both generated and real-world datasets lie in the same universality class from the RMT perspective, as chaotic rather than integrable systems, (iv) the expected RMT statistical behavior already manifests for empirical covariance matrices at dataset sizes significantly smaller than those conventionally used for real-world training, and can be related to the number of samples required to approximate the population power-law scaling behavior, (v) the Shannon entropy is correlated with local RMT structure and eigenvalues scaling, and substantially smaller in strongly correlated datasets compared to uncorrelated synthetic data, and requires fewer samples to reach the distribution entropy. These findings can have numerous implications to the characterization of the complexity of data sets, including differentiating synthetically generated from natural data, quantifying noise, developing better data pruning methods and classifying effective learning models utilizing these scaling laws.

Recent studies have shown that in the case of random initializations, a chaos/order phase transition occur in the space of variances of random weights and biases. Experiments then had shown that large improvements can be made, in terms of the training speed, if a neural network is initialized on values along the critical line of such phase transition. In this contribution, we show evidence that the scaling property exhibited by physical systems at criticality, is also present in untrained feedforward networks with random weights initialization at the critical line. Additionally, we suggest an additional data-resizing symmetry, which is directly inherited from the scaling symmetry at criticality. ",

Using local network measures that take into account asymmetry of social interactions we show that the observed tie strength is a kind of compromise, which depends on the relative strength of the tie as seen from its both ends. This statement is supported by the Granovetter-like, strongly positive weight-topology correlations, in the form of a power-law relationship between the asymmetric tie strength and asymmetric neighbourhood overlap, observed in three different real coauthorship networks and in a synthetic model of scientific collaboration. This observation is juxtaposed against the current misconception that coauthorship networks, being the proxy of scientific collaboration networks, contradict the Granovetter's strength of weak ties hypothesis, and the reasons for this misconception are explained. Finally, by testing various link similarity scores, it is shown that taking into account the asymmetry of social ties can remarkably increase the efficiency of link prediction methods. The perspective outlined also allows us to comment on the surprisingly high performance of the resource allocation index -- one of the most recognizable and effective local similarity scores -- which can be rationalized by the strong triadic closure property, assuming that the property takes into account the asymmetry of social ties.

Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an advanced and adaptive shift architecture, namely the Swap operation, which incorporates non-exponential growth parameters while retaining analogous functionalities to integrate local feature spatial information, resembling a high-dimensional convolution operator. The Swap, cross-channel operation, architecture implements the XOR operation to alternately exchange adjacent or diagonal features, and then blends alternating channels through a 1x1 convolution operation to consolidate information from different channels. The SwapNN architecture, on the other hand, incorporates a group-based parameter-sharing mechanism inspired by the convolutional neural network process and thereby significantly reducing the number of parameters. We validated our proposed approach through experiments on the SpaceNet corpus, a publicly available dataset annotated with 2,001 buildings across the cities of Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Paris. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this innovative architecture in building planar graph reconstruction from 2D building images. ",

SCADA systems are essential to critical grid functions and include industrial control systems (ICS) protocols such as the Distributed Network Protocol-3 (DNP3). These protocols are vulnerable to cyber threats that power systems, as cyber-physical critical infrastructure, must be protected against. For this reason, the NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection standard CIP-005-5 specifies that an electronic system perimeter is needed, accomplished with firewalls. This paper presents how these electronic system perimeters can be optimally found and generated using a proposed meta-heuristic approach for optimal security zone formation for large-scale power systems. Then, to implement the optimal firewall rules in a large scale power system model, this work presents a prototype software tool that takes the optimization results and auto-configures the firewall nodes for different utilities in a cyber-physical testbed. Using this tool, firewall policies are configured for all the utilities and their substations within a synthetic 2000-bus model, assuming two different network topologies. Results generate the optimal electronic security perimeters to protect a power system's data flows and compare the number of firewalls, monetary cost, and risk alerts from path analysis. ",

    "abstract": "The advent of heterogeneous multi-core architectures brought with it huge benefits to energy efficiency by running programs on properly-sized cores. Modern heterogeneous multi-core systems as suggested by Artjom et al. schedule tasks to different cores based on governors that may optimize a task for energy use or performance. This provides benefits to the system as a whole in reducing energy costs where possible, but also not compromising on performance for timing-critical applications. In the era of dark silicon, energy optimization is increasingly important, and many architectures have arisen that seek to optimize processors to specific tasks, often at the cost of generality. We propose that we can still achieve energy-saving and potentially performance-improving benefits while not affecting a system's generality at all, by achieving heterogeneity at the level of Arithmetic logic unit (ALUs). Much like a heterogeneous multi-core system achieves benefits from its heterogeneity and efficient scheduling, a heterogeneous ALU system can achieve similar benefits by routing ALU operations to properly sized ALUs. Additionally much like there are scheduling modes for the governors of heterogeneous multi-core processors, we propose that energy-constrained modes can be effective in a heterogeneous ALU system with the routing of operations to smaller ALUs for immense energy savings. We examine the energy and performance characteristics of scaling ripple carry adders and evaluate the total energy and performance benefits of such a system when running applications. With our proposed controls, input operand size-based and energy constraint-based, we could potentially emulate the success of heterogeneous processor task scheduling at a finer-grained level. This paper presents our evaluation of the potential of heterogeneous ALU processors. ",

Rootkits tend to hide their access level within microgrid system components to launch sudden attacks that prey on the slow response time of defenders to manipulate system trajectory. This problem can be formulated as a multi-stage, non-cooperative, zero-sum game with the attacker and the defender modeled as opposing players. To solve the game, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based strategy that dynamically identifies rootkit access levels and isolates incoming manipulations by incorporating changes in the defense plan. A major advantage of the proposed strategy is its ability to establish resiliency without altering the physical transmission/distribution network topology, thereby diminishing potential instability issues. The paper also presents several simulation results and case studies to demonstrate the operating mechanism and robustness of the proposed strategy. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge transfer across sensing technology is a novel concept that has been recently explored in many application domains, including gesture-based human computer interaction. The main aim is to gather semantic or data driven information from a source technology to classify / recognize instances of unseen classes in the target technology. The primary challenge is the significant difference in dimensionality and distribution of feature sets between the source and the target technologies. In this paper, we propose TRANSFER, a generic framework for knowledge transfer between a source and a target technology. TRANSFER uses a language-based representation of a hand gesture, which captures a temporal combination of concepts such as handshape, location, and movement that are semantically related to the meaning of a word. By utilizing a pre-specified syntactic structure and tokenizer, TRANSFER segments a hand gesture into tokens and identifies individual components using a token recognizer. The tokenizer in this language-based recognition system abstracts the low-level technology-specific characteristics to the machine interface, enabling the design of a discriminator that learns technology-invariant features essential for recognition of gestures in both source and target technologies. We demonstrate the usage of TRANSFER for three different scenarios: a) transferring knowledge across technology by learning gesture models from video and recognizing gestures using WiFi, b) transferring knowledge from video to accelerometer, and d) transferring knowledge from accelerometer to WiFi signals.

    "abstract": "In the autonomous driving system, trajectory prediction plays a vital role in ensuring safety and facilitating smooth navigation. However, we observe a substantial discrepancy between the accuracy of predictors on fixed datasets and their driving performance when used in downstream tasks. This discrepancy arises from two overlooked factors in the current evaluation protocols of trajectory prediction: 1) the dynamics gap between the dataset and real driving scenario; and 2) the computational efficiency of predictors. In real-world scenarios, prediction algorithms influence the behavior of autonomous vehicles, which, in turn, alter the behaviors of other agents on the road. This interaction results in predictor-specific dynamics that directly impact prediction results. As other agents' responses are predetermined on datasets, a significant dynamics gap arises between evaluations conducted on fixed datasets and actual driving scenarios. Furthermore, focusing solely on accuracy fails to address the demand for computational efficiency, which is critical for the real-time response required by the autonomous driving system. Therefore, in this paper, we demonstrate that an interactive, task-driven evaluation approach for trajectory prediction is crucial to reflect its efficacy for autonomous driving. ",

In most existing works, the similarity matrix is computed once for all or is updated alternatively. However, the former is difficult to reflect comprehensive relationships among data points, and the latter is time-consuming and is even infeasible for large-scale problems. In this work, we propose a restarted clustering framework with self-guiding and block diagonal representation. An advantage of the strategy is that some useful clustering information obtained from previous cycles could be preserved as much as possible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies restarting strategy to spectral clustering. The key difference is that we reclassify the samples in each cycle of our method, while they are classified only once in existing methods. To further release the overhead, we introduce a block diagonal representation with Nystr\\\"{o}m approximation for constructing the similarity matrix. Theoretical results are established to show the rationality of inexact computations in spectral clustering. Comprehensive experiments are performed on some benchmark databases, which show the superiority of our proposed algorithms over many state-of-the-art algorithms for large-scale problems. Specifically, our framework has a potential boost for clustering algorithms and works well even using an initial guess chosen randomly. ",

To tackle these challenges, we firstly propose a dual matching scheme for positive samples, which accelerates inference speed through sparse matching scheme and accelerates model convergence through dense matching scheme. Then, we propose a novel text contour representation method based on low-rank approximation by exploiting the shape correlation between different text contours, which is complete, compact, simplicity and robustness.

There have been many frameworks and optimization techniques proposed in the literature to accelerate GNNs. However, getting consistently high performance across many input graphs with different sparsity patterns and GNN embedding sizes has remained difficult. In this paper, we propose different algebraic reassociations of GNN computations that lead to novel dense and sparse matrix primitive selections and compositions. We show that the profitability of these compositions depends on the input graph, embedding size, and the target hardware. We developed SENSEi, a system that uses a data-driven adaptive strategy to select the best composition given the input graph and GNN embedding sizes. Our evaluations on a wide range of graphs and embedding sizes show that SENSEi achieves geomean speedups of $1.105\\times$ (up to $2.959\\times$) and $1.187\\times$ (up to $1.99\\times$) on graph convolutional networks and geomean speedups of $2.307\\times$ (up to $35.866\\times$) and $1.44\\times$ (up to $5.69\\times$) on graph attention networks on CPUs and GPUs respectively over the widely used Deep Graph Library. Further, we show that the compositions yield notable synergistic performance benefits on top of other established sparse optimizations such as sparse matrix tiling by evaluating against a well-tuned baseline.

    "abstract": "Tropical geometry has recently found several applications in the analysis of neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions. This paper presents a new look at the problem of tropical polynomial division and its application to the simplification of neural networks. We analyze tropical polynomials with real coefficients, extending earlier ideas and methods developed for polynomials with integer coefficients. We first prove the existence of a unique quotient-remainder pair and characterize the quotient in terms of the convex bi-conjugate of a related function. Interestingly, the quotient of tropical polynomials with integer coefficients does not necessarily have integer coefficients. Furthermore, we develop a relationship of tropical polynomial division with the computation of the convex hull of unions of convex polyhedra and use it to derive an exact algorithm for tropical polynomial division. An approximate algorithm is also presented, based on an alternation between data partition and linear programming. We also develop special techniques to divide composite polynomials, described as sums or maxima of simpler ones. Finally, we present some numerical results to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithms proposed, using the MNIST handwritten digit and CIFAR-10 datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training is one of the best-performing methods in improving the robustness of deep language models. However, robust models come at the cost of high time consumption, as they require multi-step gradient ascents or word substitutions to obtain adversarial samples. In addition, these generated samples are deficient in grammatical quality and semantic consistency, which impairs the effectiveness of adversarial training. To address these problems, we introduce a novel, effective procedure for instead adversarial training with only clean data. Our procedure, distribution shift risk minimization (DSRM), estimates the adversarial loss by perturbing the input data's probability distribution rather than their embeddings. This formulation results in a robust model that minimizes the expected global loss under adversarial attacks. Our approach requires zero adversarial samples for training and reduces time consumption by up to 70\\% compared to current best-performing adversarial training methods. Experiments demonstrate that DSRM considerably improves BERT's resistance to textual adversarial attacks and achieves state-of-the-art robust accuracy on various benchmarks. ",

One-bit MIMO detection arises in such a scenario. It aims to detect the multiuser signals from the one-bit quantized received signals in an uplink channel. In this paper, we consider one-bit maximum-likelihood (ML) MIMO detection in massive MIMO systems, which amounts to solving a large-scale nonlinear integer programming problem. We propose an efficient global algorithm for solving the one-bit ML MIMO detection problem. We first reformulate the problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem that has a massive number of linear constraints. The massive number of linear constraints raises computational challenges. To solve the MILP problem efficiently, we custom build a light-weight branch-and-bound tree search algorithm, where the linear constraints are incrementally added during the tree search procedure and only small-size linear programming subproblems need to be solved at each iteration. We provide simulation results to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. ",

Through extensive quantitative study with a new edge crispness measure, we find that noisy human-labeled edges are the main cause of thick predictions. Based on this observation, we advocate that more attention should be paid on label quality than on model design to achieve crisp edge detection. To this end, we propose an effective Canny-guided refinement of human-labeled edges whose result can be used to train crisp edge detectors. Essentially, it seeks for a subset of over-detected Canny edges that best align human labels. We show that several existing edge detectors can be turned into a crisp edge detector through training on our refined edge maps. Experiments demonstrate that deep models trained with refined edges achieve significant performance boost of crispness from 17.4% to 30.6%. With the PiDiNet backbone, our method improves ODS and OIS by 12.2% and 12.6% on the Multicue dataset, respectively, without relying on non-maximal suppression. We further conduct experiments and show the superiority of our crisp edge detection for optical flow estimation and image segmentation. ",

Dominant meta-learning methodologies for FSNC were developed under the existence of abundant labeled nodes for training, which however may not be possible to obtain in the real-world. Although few studies have been proposed to tackle the label-scarcity problem, they still rely on a limited amount of labeled data, which hinders the full utilization of the information of all nodes in a graph. Despite the effectiveness of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approaches on FSNC without labels, they mainly learn generic node embeddings without consideration on the downstream task to be solved, which may limit its performance. In this work, we propose unsupervised episode generation methods to benefit from their generalization ability for FSNC tasks while resolving label-scarcity problem. We first propose a method that utilizes graph augmentation to generate training episodes called g-UMTRA, which however has several drawbacks, i.e., 1) increased training time due to the computation of augmented features and 2) low applicability to existing baselines. Hence, we propose Neighbors as Queries (NaQ), which generates episodes from structural neighbors found by graph diffusion. Our proposed methods are model-agnostic, that is, they can be plugged into any existing graph meta-learning models, while not sacrificing much of their performance or sometimes even improving them. We provide theoretical insights to support why our unsupervised episode generation methodologies work, and extensive experimental results demonstrate the potential of our unsupervised episode generation methods for graph meta-learning towards FSNC problems.

However, training of SNNs poses a significant challenge due to the necessity for precise temporal and spatial credit assignment. Back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, whilst being the most widely used method for addressing these issues, incurs a high computational cost due to its temporal dependency. Moreover, BPTT and its approximations solely utilize causal information derived from the spiking activity to compute the synaptic updates, thus neglecting non-causal relationships. In this work, we propose S-TLLR, a novel three-factor temporal local learning rule inspired by the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) mechanism, aimed at training SNNs on event-based learning tasks. S-TLLR considers both causal and non-causal relationships between pre and post-synaptic activities, achieving performance comparable to BPTT and enhancing performance relative to methods using only causal information. Furthermore, S-TLLR has low memory and time complexity, which is independent of the number of time steps, rendering it suitable for online learning on low-power devices. To demonstrate the scalability of our proposed method, we have conducted extensive evaluations on event-based datasets spanning a wide range of applications, such as image and gesture recognition, audio classification, and optical flow estimation. In all the experiments, S-TLLR achieved high accuracy with a reduction in the number of computations between $1.1-10\\times$. ",

When offroad vehicles travel at high speed ($>10m/s$), they need to reason at long-range ($50m$-$100m$) for safe and deliberate navigation. Moreover, vehicles often operate in new environments and under different weather conditions. LiDAR provides accurate estimates robust to visual appearances, however, it is often too noisy beyond 30m for fine-grained estimates due to sparse measurements. Conversely, visual-based models give dense predictions at further distances but perform poorly at all ranges when out of training distribution. To address these challenges, we present ALTER, an offroad perception module that adapts-on-the-drive to combine the best of both sensors. Our visual model continuously learns from new near-range LiDAR measurements. This self-supervised approach enables accurate long-range traversability prediction in novel environments without hand-labeling. Results on two distinct real-world offroad environments show up to 52.5% improvement in traversability estimation over LiDAR-only estimates and 38.1% improvement over non-adaptive visual baseline. ",

Interactive fleet learning (IFL) mitigates distribution shift by allowing robots to access remote human teleoperators during task execution and learn from them over time, but is not equipped to handle multimodality. Recent work proposes Implicit Behavior Cloning (IBC), which is able to represent multimodal demonstrations using energy-based models (EBMs). In this work, we propose addressing both multimodality and distribution shift with Implicit Interactive Fleet Learning (IIFL), the first extension of implicit policies to interactive imitation learning (including the single-robot, single-human setting). IIFL quantifies uncertainty using a novel application of Jeffreys divergence to EBMs. While IIFL is more computationally expensive than explicit methods, results suggest that IIFL achieves 4.5x higher return on human effort in simulation experiments and an 80% higher success rate in a physical block pushing task over (Explicit) IFL, IBC, and other baselines when human supervision is heterogeneous.

Existing approaches make substantial contributions in this field by modeling news from a single-modal or multi-modal perspective.

For instance, they haven't taken into consideration the component-by-component reading process: from the headline, images, comments, to the body, which is essential for modeling news with more granularity. To this end, we propose an approach of Emulating the behaviors of readers (Ember) for fake news detection on social media, incorporating readers' reading and verificating process to model news from the component perspective thoroughly. Specifically, we first construct intra-component feature extractors to emulate the behaviors of semantic analyzing on each component. Then, we design a module that comprises inter-component feature extractors and a sequence-based aggregator. This module mimics the process of verifying the correlation between components and the overall reading and verification sequence. Thus, Ember can handle the news with various components by emulating corresponding sequences.

The sinusoidal enables the network to automatically learn the positional embedding of an input coordinate while the damping passes on the actual coordinate value by preventing it from being projected down to within a finite range of values. Our results indicate that SPDERs speed up training by 10x and converge to losses 1,500-50,000x lower than that of the state-of-the-art for image representation. SPDER is also state-of-the-art in audio representation. The superior representation capability allows SPDER to also excel on multiple downstream tasks such as image super-resolution and video frame interpolation.

The method evaluates the behavior of DCT coefficients after recompression using the local JPEG encoder to select robust coefficients and sets the other coefficients as wet cost. Combining the lattice embedding scheme, the method is errorless by construction. However, the authors only concern with the success rate under theoretical embedding, while the success rate of the implementation with practical steganographic codes is not verified. In this letter, we implement the method with two steganographic codes, i.e., steganographic polar code and syndrome-trellis code. By analyzing the possibility of success embedding of two steganographic codes under wet paper embedding, we discover that steganographic polar code achieves success embedding with a larger number of wet coefficients compared with syndrome-trellis code, which makes steganographic polar code more suitable under the errorless robust embedding paradigm. The experimental results show that the combination of steganographic polar code and errorless robust embedding achieves a higher success rate compared with the implementation with syndrome-trellis code under close security performance.

Specifically, the FP subproblem is to place service functions into cloud nodes in the network, and solving it can return a function placement strategy based on which the TR subproblem is defined; and the TR subproblem is to find paths connecting two nodes hosting two adjacent functions in the network, and solving it can either verify that the solution of the FP subproblem is an optimal solution of the original problem, or return a valid inequality to the FP subproblem that cuts off the current infeasible solution.

    "abstract": "While collaborative systems provide convenience to our lives, they also face many security threats. One of them is the Low-rate Distributed Denial-of-Service (LDDoS) attack, which is a worthy concern. Unlike volumetric DDoS attacks that continuously send large volumes of traffic, LDDoS attacks are more stealthy and difficult to be detected owing to their low-volume feature. Due to its stealthiness and harmfulness, LDDoS has become one of the most destructive attacks in cloud computing. Although a few LDDoS attack detection and defense methods have been proposed, we observe that sophisticated LDDoS attacks (being more stealthy) can bypass some of the existing LDDoS defense methods. To verify our security observation, we proposed a new Feint-based LDDoS (F-LDDoS) attack strategy. In this strategy, we divide a Pulse Interval into a Feinting Interval and an Attack Interval. Unlike the previous LDDoS attacks, the bots also send traffic randomly in the Feinting Interval, thus disguise themselves as benign users during the F-LDDoS attack. In this way, although the victim detects that it is under an LDDoS attack, it is difficult to locate the attack sources and apply mitigation solutions. Experimental results show that F-LDDoS attack can degrade TCP bandwidth 6.7%-14% more than the baseline LDDoS attack. Besides, F-LDDoS also reduces the similarities between bot traffic and aggregated attack traffic, and increases the uncertainty of packet arrival. These results mean that the proposed F-LDDoS is more effective and more stealthy than normal LDDoS attacks. Finally, we discuss the countermeasures of F-LDDoS to draw the attention of defenders and improve the defense methods. ",

We design an explicit mind module that can track three-level beliefs -- the speaker's belief, the speaker's prediction of the listener's belief, and the common belief based on the gap between the first two. Then the speaking act classification head will decide to continue to talk, end this turn, or take task-related action. We augment a common ground alignment dataset MutualFriend with belief dynamics annotation, of which the goal is to find a single mutual friend based on the free chat between two agents. Experiments show that our model with mental state modeling can resemble human responses when aligning common ground meanwhile mimic the natural human conversation flow. The ablation study further validates the third-level common belief can aggregate information of the first and second-order beliefs and align common ground more efficiently. ",

    "abstract": "Cloud data storage solutions offer customers cost-effective and reduced data management. While attractive, data security issues remain to be a core concern. Traditional encryption protects stored documents, but hinders simple functionalities such as keyword search. Therefore, searchable encryption schemes have been proposed to allow for the search on encrypted data. Efficient schemes leak at least the access pattern (the accessed documents per keyword search), which is known to be exploitable in query recovery attacks assuming the attacker has a significant amount of background knowledge on the stored documents. Existing attacks can only achieve decent results with strong adversary models (e.g. at least 20% of previously known documents or require additional knowledge such as on query frequencies) and they give no metric to evaluate the certainty of recovered queries. This hampers their practical utility and questions their relevance in the real-world. We propose a refined score attack which achieves query recovery rates of around 85% without requiring exact background knowledge on stored documents; a distributionally similar, but otherwise different (i.e., non-indexed), dataset suffices. The attack starts with very few known queries (around 10 known queries in our experiments over different datasets of varying size) and then iteratively recovers further queries with confidence scores by adding previously recovered queries that had high confidence scores to the set of known queries. Additional to high recovery rates, our approach yields interpretable results in terms of confidence scores. ",

However, it is unclear which models will perform best on which task, and it is prohibitively expensive to try all possible combinations. If transferability estimation offers a computation-efficient approach to evaluate the generalisation ability of models, prior works focused exclusively on classification settings. To overcome this limitation, we extend transferability metrics to object detection. We design a simple method to extract local features corresponding to each object within an image using ROI-Align. We also introduce TLogME, a transferability metric taking into account the coordinates regression task. In our experiments, we compare TLogME to state-of-the-art metrics in the estimation of transfer performance of the Faster-RCNN object detector. We evaluate all metrics on source and target selection tasks, for real and synthetic datasets, and with different backbone architectures. We show that, over different tasks, TLogME using the local extraction method provides a robust correlation with transfer performance and outperforms other transferability metrics on local and global level features.

However, existing approaches are limited in fine-grained action recognition due to the similarity of inter-class data.

Based on CVSTA, we construct a Multi-Dimensional Refinement Graph Convolutional Network (MDR-GCN), which can improve the discrimination among channel-, joint- and frame-level features for fine-grained actions. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Decouple Loss (RDL), which significantly boosts the effect of the CVSTA and reduces the impact of noise.

    "abstract": "Evasion attacks are a threat to machine learning models, where adversaries attempt to affect classifiers by injecting malicious samples. An alarming side-effect of evasion attacks is their ability to transfer among different models: this property is called transferability. Therefore, an attacker can produce adversarial samples on a custom model (surrogate) to conduct the attack on a victim's organization later. Although literature widely discusses how adversaries can transfer their attacks, their experimental settings are limited and far from reality. For instance, many experiments consider both attacker and defender sharing the same dataset, balance level (i.e., how the ground truth is distributed), and model architecture. In this work, we propose the DUMB attacker model. This framework allows analyzing if evasion attacks fail to transfer when the training conditions of surrogate and victim models differ. DUMB considers the following conditions: Dataset soUrces, Model architecture, and the Balance of the ground truth. We then propose a novel testbed to evaluate many state-of-the-art evasion attacks with DUMB; the testbed consists of three computer vision tasks with two distinct datasets each, four types of balance levels, and three model architectures. Our analysis, which generated 13K tests over 14 distinct attacks, led to numerous novel findings in the scope of transferable attacks with surrogate models. In particular, mismatches between attackers and victims in terms of dataset source, balance levels, and model architecture lead to non-negligible loss of attack performance. ",

We have established a neural network based on even-odd decomposition and concluded that enforcing the initial condition for the linear transport equation with inflow boundary conditions is crucial. This APNN method based on even-odd parity relaxes the stringent conservation prerequisites while concurrently introducing an auxiliary deep neural network. Additionally, we have incorporated the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy for the Boltzmann-BGK equation into the APNN framework by enforcing exact boundary conditions. This is our second contribution. The most notable finding of this study is that approximating the zeroth, first and second moments of the particle density distribution is simpler than the distribution itself. Furthermore, a compelling phenomenon in the training process is that the convergence of density is swifter than that of momentum and energy.

The main purpose of this system is to improve the model's ability to learn precise forgery information for FSD task in low-quality scenarios. The task of random Specmix, a data augmentation, is to improve the generalization ability of the model and enhance the model's ability to locate discriminative information. Specmix cuts and pastes the frequency dimension information of the spectrogram in the same batch of samples without introducing other data, which helps the model to locate the really useful information. At the same time, we randomly select samples for augmentation to reduce the impact of data augmentation directly changing all the data. Once the purpose of helping the model to locate information is achieved, it is also important to reduce unnecessary information. The role of MPIF-Res2Net is to reduce redundant interference information. Deceptive information from a single perspective is always similar, so the model learning this similar information will produce redundant spoofing clues and interfere with truly discriminative information. The proposed MPIF-Res2Net fuses information from different perspectives, making the information learned by the model more diverse, thereby reducing the redundancy caused by similar information and avoiding interference with the learning of discriminative information.

At the same time, 1-bit convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with binary weights and activations show their potential for resource-limited embedded devices. One natural approach is to use 1-bit CNNs to reduce the computation and memory cost of NAS by taking advantage of the strengths of each in a unified framework, while searching the 1-bit CNNs is more challenging due to the more complicated processes involved. In this paper, we introduce Discrepant Child-Parent Neural Architecture Search (DCP-NAS) to efficiently search 1-bit CNNs, based on a new framework of searching the 1-bit model (Child) under the supervision of a real-valued model (Parent). Particularly, we first utilize a Parent model to calculate a tangent direction, based on which the tangent propagation method is introduced to search the optimized 1-bit Child. We further observe a coupling relationship between the weights and architecture parameters existing in such differentiable frameworks. To address the issue, we propose a decoupled optimization method to search an optimized architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DCP-NAS achieves much better results than prior arts on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. In particular, the backbones achieved by our DCP-NAS achieve strong generalization performance on person re-identification and object detection. ",

    "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) are increasingly applied in safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. However, they are fragile and are often ill-behaved. Consequently, their behaviors should undergo rigorous guarantees before deployment in practice. In this paper, we propose a set-boundary reachability method to investigate the safety verification problem of NNs from a topological perspective. Given an NN with an input set and a safe set, the safety verification problem is to determine whether all outputs of the NN resulting from the input set fall within the safe set. In our method, the homeomorphism property and the open map property of NNs are mainly exploited, which establish rigorous guarantees between the boundaries of the input set and the boundaries of the output set. The exploitation of these two properties facilitates reachability computations via extracting subsets of the input set rather than the entire input set, thus controlling the wrapping effect in reachability analysis and facilitating the reduction of computation burdens for safety verification. The homeomorphism property exists in some widely used NNs such as invertible residual networks (i-ResNets) and Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs), and the open map is a less strict property and easier to satisfy compared with the homeomorphism property. For NNs establishing either of these properties, our set-boundary reachability method only needs to perform reachability analysis on the boundary of the input set. Moreover, for NNs that do not feature these properties with respect to the input set, we explore subsets of the input set for establishing the local homeomorphism property and then abandon these subsets for reachability computations. Finally, some examples demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. ",

Based on the location of these tracklets, we predict the successor lane graph from an initial position using overhead RGB images only, not requiring any human supervision. In a subsequent stage, we show how the individual successor predictions can be aggregated into a consistent lane graph. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the UrbanLaneGraph dataset and perform extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, indicating that AutoGraph is on par with models trained on hand-annotated graph data. Model and dataset will be made available at redacted-for-review. ",

    "title": "RMVPE: A Robust Model for Vocal Pitch Estimation in Polyphonic Music",
    "abstract": "Vocal pitch is an important high-level feature in music audio processing. However, extracting vocal pitch in polyphonic music is more challenging due to the presence of accompaniment. To eliminate the influence of the accompaniment, most previous methods adopt music source separation models to obtain clean vocals from polyphonic music before predicting vocal pitches. As a result, the performance of vocal pitch estimation is affected by the music source separation models. To address this issue and directly extract vocal pitches from polyphonic music, we propose a robust model named RMVPE. This model can extract effective hidden features and accurately predict vocal pitches from polyphonic music. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RMVPE in terms of raw pitch accuracy (RPA) and raw chroma accuracy (RCA). Additionally, experiments conducted with different types of noise show that RMVPE is robust across all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. The code of RMVPE is available at this URL. https://github.com/Dream-High/RMVPE. ",

    "abstract": "Change detection and irregular object extraction in 3D point clouds is a challenging task that is of high importance not only for autonomous navigation but also for updating existing digital twin models of various industrial environments. This article proposes an innovative approach for change detection in 3D point clouds using deep learned place recognition descriptors and irregular object extraction based on voxel-to-point comparison. The proposed method first aligns the bi-temporal point clouds using a map-merging algorithm in order to establish a common coordinate frame. Then, it utilizes deep learning techniques to extract robust and discriminative features from the 3D point cloud scans, which are used to detect changes between consecutive point cloud frames and therefore find the changed areas. Finally, the altered areas are sampled and compared between the two time instances to extract any obstructions that caused the area to change. The proposed method was successfully evaluated in real-world field experiments, where it was able to detect different types of changes in 3D point clouds, such as object or muck-pile addition and displacement, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach. The results of this study demonstrate important implications for various applications, including safety and security monitoring in construction sites, mapping and exploration and suggests potential future research directions in this field.

The robustness of our preconditioners is crucial for real-world applications, such as the efficient and accurate modeling of subsurface flow in porous media and other important domains. The core of our method lies in the construction of a suitable partition of unity functions and coarse spaces utilizing local spectral information. Leveraging these components, we implement a two-level additive Schwarz preconditioner. We demonstrate that the condition number of the preconditioned systems is bounded with a bound that is independent of the contrast. Our claims are further substantiated through selected numerical experiments, which confirm the robustness of our preconditioners. ",

    "abstract": "Context modeling and recognition are crucial for adaptive mobile and ubiquitous computing. Context-awareness in mobile environments relies on prompt reactions to context changes. However, current solutions focus on limited context information processed on centralized architectures, risking privacy leakage and lacking personalization. On-device context modeling and recognition are emerging research trends, addressing these concerns. Social interactions and visited locations play significant roles in characterizing daily life scenarios. This paper proposes an unsupervised and lightweight approach to model the user's social context and locations directly on the mobile device. Leveraging the ego-network model, the system extracts high-level, semantic-rich context features from smartphone-embedded sensor data. For the social context, the approach utilizes data on physical and cyber social interactions among users and their devices. Regarding location, it prioritizes modeling the familiarity degree of specific locations over raw location data, such as GPS coordinates and proximity devices. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three sets of experiments, employing five real-world datasets. These experiments evaluate the structure of social and location ego networks, provide a semantic evaluation of the proposed models, and assess mobile computing performance. Finally, the relevance of the extracted features is showcased by the improved performance of three machine learning models in recognizing daily-life situations. Compared to using only features related to physical context, the proposed approach achieves a 3% improvement in AUROC, 9% in Precision, and 5% in Recall. ",

    "abstract": "Large language models are now tuned to align with the goals of their creators, namely to be \"helpful and harmless.\" These models should respond helpfully to user questions, but refuse to answer requests that could cause harm. However, adversarial users can construct inputs which circumvent attempts at alignment. In this work, we study to what extent these models remain aligned, even when interacting with an adversarial user who constructs worst-case inputs (adversarial examples). These inputs are designed to cause the model to emit harmful content that would otherwise be prohibited. We show that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models: even when current NLP-based attacks fail, we can find adversarial inputs with brute force. As a result, the failure of current attacks should not be seen as proof that aligned text models remain aligned under adversarial inputs. However the recent trend in large-scale ML models is multimodal models that allow users to provide images that influence the text that is generated. We show these models can be easily attacked, i.e., induced to perform arbitrary un-aligned behavior through adversarial perturbation of the input image. We conjecture that improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models. ",

However, despite the recent attempts to assess the Theory-of-Mind (ToM) reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the degree to which these models can align with human ToM remains a nuanced topic of exploration. This is primarily due to two distinct challenges: (1) the presence of inconsistent results from previous evaluations, and (2) concerns surrounding the validity of existing evaluation methodologies. To address these challenges, we present a novel framework for procedurally generating evaluations with LLMs by populating causal templates. Using our framework, we create a new social reasoning benchmark (BigToM) for LLMs which consists of 25 controls and 5,000 model-written evaluations. We find that human participants rate the quality of our benchmark higher than previous crowd-sourced evaluations and comparable to expert-written evaluations. Using BigToM, we evaluate the social reasoning capabilities of a variety of LLMs and compare model performances with human performance. Our results suggest that GPT4 has ToM capabilities that mirror human inference patterns, though less reliable, while other LLMs struggle. ",

To defend against adversarial attacks, many defense strategies have been proposed, among which adversarial training has been demonstrated to be the most effective strategy. However, it has been known that adversarial training sometimes hurts natural accuracy. Then, many works focus on optimizing model parameters to handle the problem. Different from the previous approaches, in this paper, we propose a new approach to improve the adversarial robustness by using an external signal rather than model parameters. In the proposed method, a well-optimized universal external signal called a booster signal is injected into the outside of the image which does not overlap with the original content. Then, it boosts both adversarial robustness and natural accuracy. The booster signal is optimized in parallel to model parameters step by step collaboratively. Experimental results show that the booster signal can improve both the natural and robust accuracies over the recent state-of-the-art adversarial training methods. Also, optimizing the booster signal is general and flexible enough to be adopted on any existing adversarial training methods. ",

However, existing approaches lack an understanding of learning adversarially robust feature representation. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called Robust Proxy Learning. In the proposed method, the model explicitly learns robust feature representations with robust proxies. To this end, firstly, we demonstrate that we can generate class-representative robust features by adding class-wise robust perturbations. Then, we use the class representative features as robust proxies. With the class-wise robust features, the model explicitly learns adversarially robust features through the proposed robust proxy learning framework. Through extensive experiments, we verify that we can manually generate robust features, and our proposed learning framework could increase the robustness of the DNNs. ",

Numerous approaches have been proposed to train robust networks both empirically and certifiably. However, most of them defend against only a single type of attack, while recent work takes steps forward in defending against multiple attacks. In this paper, to understand multi-target robustness, we view this problem as a bargaining game in which different players (adversaries) negotiate to reach an agreement on a joint direction of parameter updating. We identify a phenomenon named player domination in the bargaining game, namely that the existing max-based approaches, such as MAX and MSD, do not converge. Based on our theoretical analysis, we design a novel framework that adjusts the budgets of different adversaries to avoid any player dominance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that employing the proposed framework to the existing approaches significantly advances multi-target robustness. ",

    "abstract": "This paper makes the first attempt to tackle the challenging task of recovering arbitrary frame rate latent global shutter (GS) frames from two consecutive rolling shutter (RS) frames, guided by the novel event camera data. Although events possess high temporal resolution, beneficial for video frame interpolation (VFI), a hurdle in tackling this task is the lack of paired GS frames. Another challenge is that RS frames are susceptible to distortion when capturing moving objects. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised framework that leverages events to guide RS frame correction and VFI in a unified framework. Our key idea is to estimate the displacement field (DF) non-linear dense 3D spatiotemporal information of all pixels during the exposure time, allowing for the reciprocal reconstruction between RS and GS frames as well as arbitrary frame rate VFI. Specifically, the displacement field estimation (DFE) module is proposed to estimate the spatiotemporal motion from events to correct the RS distortion and interpolate the GS frames in one step. We then combine the input RS frames and DF to learn a mapping for RS-to-GS frame interpolation. However, as the mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping (i.e., GS-to-RS) and RS frame warping (i.e., RS-to-RS) for self-supervision. As there is a lack of labeled datasets for evaluation, we generate two synthetic datasets and collect a real-world dataset to train and test our method. Experimental results show that our method yields comparable or better performance with prior supervised methods. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-assisted antenna design methods such as surrogate models have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their potential to greatly increase design efficiencies by replacing the time-consuming full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulations. However, a large number of training data with sufficiently diverse and representative samples (antenna structure parameters, scattering properties, etc.) is mandatory for these methods to ensure good performance. Traditional antenna modeling methods relying on manual model construction and modification are time-consuming and cannot meet the requirement of efficient training data acquisition. In this study, we proposed a deep learning-assisted and image-based intelligent modeling approach for accelerating the data acquisition of antenna samples with different physical structures. Specifically, our method only needs an image of the antenna structure, usually available in scientific publications, as the input while the corresponding modeling codes (VBA language) are generated automatically. The proposed model mainly consists of two parts: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The former is used for capturing features of antenna structure images and the latter is employed to generate the modeling codes. Through training, the proposed model can achieve fast and automatic data acquisition of antenna physical structures based on antenna images. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves a significant speed enhancement than the manual modeling approach. This approach lays the foundation for efficient data acquisition needed to build robust surrogate models in the future. ",

    "abstract": "Despite their ability to aid developers in detecting potential defects early in the software development life cycle, static analysis tools often suffer from precision issues (i.e., high false positive rates of reported alarms). To improve the availability of these tools, many automated warning identification techniques have been proposed to assist developers in classifying false positive alarms. However, existing approaches mainly focus on using hand-engineered features or statement-level abstract syntax tree token sequences to represent the defective code, failing to capture semantics from the reported alarms. To overcome the limitations of traditional approaches, this paper employs deep neural networks' powerful feature extraction and representation abilities to generate code semantics from control flow graph paths for warning identification. The control flow graph abstractly represents the execution process of a given program. Thus, the generated path sequences of the control flow graph can guide the deep neural networks to learn semantic information about the potential defect more accurately. In this paper, we fine-tune the pre-trained language model to encode the path sequences and capture the semantic representations for model building. Finally, this paper conducts extensive experiments on eight open-source projects to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing it with the state-of-the-art baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Our ISCA 2015 paper provides a new programmable processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture and system design that can accelerate key data-intensive applications, with a focus on graph processing workloads. Our major idea was to completely rethink the system, including the programming model, data partitioning mechanisms, system support, instruction set architecture, along with near-memory execution units and their communication architecture, such that an important workload can be accelerated at a maximum level using a distributed system of well-connected near-memory accelerators. We built our accelerator system, Tesseract, using 3D-stacked memories with logic layers, where each logic layer contains general-purpose processing cores and cores communicate with each other using a message-passing programming model. Cores could be specialized for graph processing (or any other application to be accelerated). To our knowledge, our paper was the first to completely design a near-memory accelerator system from scratch such that it is both generally programmable and specifically customizable to accelerate important applications, with a case study on major graph processing workloads. Ensuing work in academia and industry showed that similar approaches to system design can greatly benefit both graph processing workloads and other applications, such as machine learning, for which ideas from Tesseract seem to have been influential. This short retrospective provides a brief analysis of our ISCA 2015 paper and its impact. We briefly describe the major ideas and contributions of the work, discuss later works that built on it or were influenced by it, and make some educated guesses on what the future may bring on PIM and accelerator systems.

    "abstract": "Radiological material transportation is primarily facilitated by heavy-duty on-road vehicles. Modern vehicles have dozens of electronic control units or ECUs, which are small, embedded computers that communicate with sensors and each other for vehicle functionality. ECUs use a standardized network architecture--Controller Area Network or CAN--which presents grave security concerns that have been exploited by researchers and hackers alike. For instance, ECUs can be impersonated by adversaries who have infiltrated an automotive CAN and disable or invoke unintended vehicle functions such as brakes, acceleration, or safety mechanisms. Further, the quality of security approaches varies wildly between manufacturers. Thus, research and development of after-market security solutions have grown remarkably in recent years. Many researchers are exploring deployable intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms using machine learning and data science techniques. However, there is a gap between developing security system algorithms and deploying prototype security appliances in-vehicle. In this paper, we, a research team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory working in this space, highlight challenges in the development pipeline, and provide techniques to standardize methodology and overcome technological hurdles.

    "abstract": "Despite the great success of deep learning in stereo matching, recovering accurate and clearly-contoured disparity map is still challenging. Currently, L1 loss and cross-entropy loss are the two most widely used loss functions for training the stereo matching networks. Comparing with the former, the latter can usually achieve better results thanks to its direct constraint to the the cost volume. However, how to generate reasonable ground-truth distribution for this loss function remains largely under exploited. Existing works assume uni-modal distributions around the ground-truth for all of the pixels, which ignores the fact that the edge pixels may have multi-modal distributions. In this paper, we first experimentally exhibit the importance of correct edge supervision to the overall disparity accuracy. Then a novel adaptive multi-modal cross-entropy loss which encourages the network to generate different distribution patterns for edge and non-edge pixels is proposed. We further optimize the disparity estimator in the inference stage to alleviate the bleeding and misalignment artifacts at the edge. Our method is generic and can help classic stereo matching models regain competitive performance. GANet trained by our loss ranks 1st on the KITTI 2015 and 2012 benchmarks and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Meanwhile, our method also exhibits superior cross-domain generalization ability and outperforms existing generalization-specialized methods on four popular real-world datasets. ",

At the same time, empirically estimating the training loss is challenging because residuals and related quantities can have high variance, especially for transport-dominated and high-dimensional problems that exhibit local features such as waves and coherent structures. Thus, estimators based on data samples from un-informed, uniform distributions are inefficient. This work introduces Neural Galerkin schemes that estimate the training loss with data from adaptive distributions, which are empirically represented via ensembles of particles. The ensembles are actively adapted by evolving the particles with dynamics coupled to the nonlinear parametrizations of the solution fields so that the ensembles remain informative for estimating the training loss. Numerical experiments indicate that few dynamic particles are sufficient for obtaining accurate empirical estimates of the training loss, even for problems with local features and with high-dimensional spatial domains.

Many current methods however, struggle to learn good representations in High Dimensional, Low Sample Size (HDLSS) tasks, which is an inherently challenging setting. We address this challenge by using an ensemble of lightweight VAEs to learn posteriors over subsets of the feature-space, which get aggregated into a joint posterior in a novel divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, we present an alternative factorisation of the joint posterior that induces a form of implicit data augmentation that yields greater sample efficiency. Through a series of experiments on eight real-world datasets, we show that our method learns better latent representations in HDLSS settings, which leads to higher accuracy in a downstream classification task. Furthermore, we verify that our approach has a positive effect on disentanglement and achieves a lower estimated Total Correlation on learnt representations. Finally, we show that our approach is robust to partial features at inference, exhibiting little performance degradation even with most features missing. ",

The paper examines the general functionality of detection tools for artificial intelligence generated text and evaluates them based on accuracy and error type analysis. Specifically, the study seeks to answer research questions about whether existing detection tools can reliably differentiate between human-written text and ChatGPT-generated text, and whether machine translation and content obfuscation techniques affect the detection of AIgenerated text. The research covers 12 publicly available tools and two commercial systems (Turnitin and PlagiarismCheck) that are widely used in the academic setting. The researchers conclude that the available detection tools are neither accurate nor reliable and have a main bias towards classifying the output as human-written rather than detecting AIgenerated text. Furthermore, content obfuscation techniques significantly worsen the performance of tools. The study makes several significant contributions. First, it summarises up-to-date similar scientific and non-scientific efforts in the field. Second, it presents the result of one of the most comprehensive tests conducted so far, based on a rigorous research methodology, an original document set, and a broad coverage of tools. Third, it discusses the implications and drawbacks of using detection tools for AI-generated text in academic settings. ",

In particular, we employ Mordred descriptors as physicochemical features and identify the Markov blanket of the target property, which theoretically contains the most relevant features for accurate prediction. Our results demonstrate a superior performance of our proposed approach compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, including the chemical language-based MOLFORMER and graph neural networks, in predicting complex tasks such as biodegradability and PFAS toxicity estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature selection method in reducing the dimensionality of the Mordred feature space while maintaining or improving the model's performance. Our approach opens up promising avenues for future research in molecular property prediction by harnessing the synergistic potential of both chemical language and physicochemical features, leading to enhanced performance and advancements in the field.

Unfortunately, the algorithm uses linear qubits in the worst case, and only works if the constraints of the general adversary dual are exactly satisfied. The challenge of improving the algorithm is that it is brittle to arbitrarily small errors since it relies on a reflection over a span of vectors. We overcome this challenge and build a robust dual adversary algorithm that can handle approximately satisfied constraints. As one application of our robust algorithm, we prove that for any Boolean function with polynomially many 1-valued inputs (or in fact a slightly weaker condition) there is a query-optimal algorithm that uses logarithmic qubits. As another application, we prove that numerically derived, approximate solutions to the general adversary dual give a bounded-error quantum algorithm under certain conditions. Further, we show that these conditions empirically hold with reasonable iterations for Boolean functions with small domains. We also develop several tools that may be of independent interest, including a robust approximate spectral gap lemma, a method to compress a general adversary dual solution using the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, and open-source code to find solutions to the general adversary dual.

Accurate UQ allows for cost savings by reducing both the required size of training data sets and the required safety factors, while poor UQ prevents users from confidently relying on model predictions. We examine several machine learning techniques, including both Gaussian processes and a family UQ-augmented neural networks: Ensemble neural networks (ENN), Bayesian neural networks (BNN), Dropout neural networks (D-NN), and Gaussian neural networks (G-NN). We evaluate UQ accuracy (distinct from model accuracy) using two metrics: the distribution of normalized residuals on validation data, and the distribution of estimated uncertainties. We apply these metrics to two model data sets, representative of complex dynamical systems: an ocean engineering problem in which a ship traverses irregular wave episodes, and a dispersive wave turbulence system with extreme events, the Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak model.

In this work, we present a novel Polychromatic neural representation (Polyner) to tackle the challenging problem of CT imaging when metallic implants exist within the human body. The artifacts arise from the drastic variation of metal's attenuation coefficients at various energy levels of the X-ray spectrum, leading to a nonlinear metal effect in CT measurements. Reconstructing CT images from metal-affected measurements hence poses a complicated nonlinear inverse problem where empirical models adopted in previous metal artifact reduction (MAR) approaches lead to signal loss and strongly aliased reconstructions. Polyner instead models the MAR problem from a nonlinear inverse problem perspective. Specifically, we first derive a polychromatic forward model to accurately simulate the nonlinear CT acquisition process. Then, we incorporate our forward model into the implicit neural representation to accomplish reconstruction. Lastly, we adopt a regularizer to preserve the physical properties of the CT images across different energy levels while effectively constraining the solution space. Our Polyner is an unsupervised method and does not require any external training data. Experimenting with multiple datasets shows that our Polyner achieves comparable or better performance than supervised methods on in-domain datasets while demonstrating significant performance improvements on out-of-domain datasets. To the best of our knowledge, our Polyner is the first unsupervised MAR method that outperforms its supervised counterparts. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the high variation in the application requirements of sound event detection (SED) systems, it is not sufficient to evaluate systems only in a single operating mode. Therefore, the community recently adopted the polyphonic sound detection score (PSDS) as an evaluation metric, which is the normalized area under the PSD receiver operating characteristic (PSD-ROC). It summarizes the system performance over a range of operating modes resulting from varying the decision threshold that is used to translate the system output scores into a binary detection output. Hence, it provides a more complete picture of the overall system behavior and is less biased by specific threshold tuning. However, besides the decision threshold there is also the post-processing that can be changed to enter another operating mode. In this paper we propose the post-processing independent PSDS (piPSDS) as a generalization of the PSDS. Here, the post-processing independent PSD-ROC includes operating points from varying post-processings with varying decision thresholds. Thus, it summarizes even more operating modes of an SED system and allows for system comparison without the need of implementing a post-processing and without a bias due to different post-processings. While piPSDS can in principle combine different types of post-processing, we hear, as a first step, present median filter independent PSDS (miPSDS) results for this year's DCASE Challenge Task4a systems.

    "abstract": "PyBADS is a Python implementation of the Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search (BADS) algorithm for fast and robust black-box optimization (Acerbi and Ma 2017). BADS is an optimization algorithm designed to efficiently solve difficult optimization problems where the objective function is rough (non-convex, non-smooth), mildly expensive (e.g., the function evaluation requires more than 0.1 seconds), possibly noisy, and gradient information is unavailable. With BADS, these issues are well addressed, making it an excellent choice for fitting computational models using methods such as maximum-likelihood estimation. The algorithm scales efficiently to black-box functions with up to $D \\approx 20$ continuous input parameters and supports bounds or no constraints. PyBADS comes along with an easy-to-use Pythonic interface for running the algorithm and inspecting its results. PyBADS only requires the user to provide a Python function for evaluating the target function, and optionally other constraints. Extensive benchmarks on both artificial test problems and large real model-fitting problems models drawn from cognitive, behavioral and computational neuroscience, show that BADS performs on par with or better than many other common and state-of-the-art optimizers (Acerbi and Ma 2017), making it a general model-fitting tool which provides fast and robust solutions.

    "title": "Optimizing Credit Limit Adjustments Under Adversarial Goals Using  Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has been explored for many problems, from video games with deterministic environments to portfolio and operations management in which scenarios are stochastic; however, there have been few attempts to test these methods in banking problems. In this study, we sought to find and automatize an optimal credit card limit adjustment policy by employing reinforcement learning techniques. In particular, because of the historical data available, we considered two possible actions per customer, namely increasing or maintaining an individual's current credit limit. To find this policy, we first formulated this decision-making question as an optimization problem in which the expected profit was maximized; therefore, we balanced two adversarial goals: maximizing the portfolio's revenue and minimizing the portfolio's provisions. Second, given the particularities of our problem, we used an offline learning strategy to simulate the impact of the action based on historical data from a super-app (i.e., a mobile application that offers various services from goods deliveries to financial products) in Latin America to train our reinforcement learning agent. Our results show that a Double Q-learning agent with optimized hyperparameters can outperform other strategies and generate a non-trivial optimal policy reflecting the complex nature of this decision. Our research not only establishes a conceptual structure for applying reinforcement learning framework to credit limit adjustment, presenting an objective technique to make these decisions primarily based on data-driven methods rather than relying only on expert-driven systems but also provides insights into the effect of alternative data usage for determining these modifications.

    "title": "Recurrent Neural Network-coupled SPAD TCSPC System for Real-time  Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging",
    "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) has been receiving increased attention in recent years as a powerful imaging technique in biological and medical research. However, existing FLI systems often suffer from a tradeoff between processing speed, accuracy, and robustness. In this paper, we propose a SPAD TCSPC system coupled to a recurrent neural network (RNN) for FLI that accurately estimates on the fly fluorescence lifetime directly from raw timestamps instead of histograms, which drastically reduces the data transfer rate and hardware resource utilization. We train two variants of the RNN on a synthetic dataset and compare the results to those obtained using the center-of-mass method (CMM) and least squares fitting (LS fitting) methods. The results demonstrate that two RNN variants, gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM), are comparable to CMM and LS fitting in terms of accuracy and outperform CMM and LS fitting by a large margin in the presence of background noise. We also look at the Cramer-Rao lower bound and detailed analysis showed that the RNN models are close to the theoretical optima. The analysis of experimental data shows that our model, which is purely trained on synthetic datasets, works well on real-world data. We build a FLI microscope setup for evaluation based on Piccolo, a 32$\\times$32 SPAD sensor developed in our lab. Four quantized GRU cores, capable of processing up to 4 million photons per second, are deployed on a Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA. Powered by the GRU, the FLI setup can retrieve real-time fluorescence lifetime images at up to 10 frames per second. The proposed FLI system is promising for many important biomedical applications, ranging from biological imaging of fast-moving cells to fluorescence-assisted diagnosis and surgery. ",
