    "abstract": "As we deal with the effects of climate change and the increase of global atmospheric temperatures, the accurate tracking and prediction of ice layers within polar ice sheets grows in importance. Studying these ice layers reveals climate trends, how snowfall has changed over time, and the trajectory of future climate and precipitation. In this paper, we propose a machine learning model that uses adaptive, recurrent graph convolutional networks to, when given the amount of snow accumulation in recent years gathered through airborne radar data, predict historic snow accumulation by way of the thickness of deep ice layers. We found that our model performs better and with greater consistency than our previous model as well as equivalent non-temporal, non-geometric, and non-adaptive models. ",

    "abstract": "Synapse is a key element of any neuromorphic computing system which is mostly constructed with memristor devices. A memristor is a two-terminal analog memory device. Memristive synapse suffers from various challenges such as forming at high voltage, SET, RESET failure, and READ margin or resolution issue between two weights. Enhanced READ resolution is very important to make a memristive synapse functionally reliable. Usually, the READ resolution is very small for a memristive synapse with 4-bit data precision. This work considers a step-by-step analysis to enhance the READ current resolution for a current-controlled memristor-based synapse. An empirical model is used to characterize the HfO2-based memristive device. 1st and 2nd stage device of our proposed synapse can be scaled to enhance the READ current margin up to ~ 4.3x and ~ 21% respectively. Moreover, READ current resolution can be enhanced with run-time adaptation features such as READ voltage scaling and body biasing. The READ voltage scaling and body biasing can improve the READ current resolution by about 46% and 15% respectively. TENNLabs' neuromorphic computing framework is leveraged to evaluate the effect of READ current resolution on classification applications. Higher READ current resolution shows better accuracy than lower resolution with different percentages of read noise scenarios. ",

To address this limitation, we propose the Temporal-Logic-based Causal Diagram (TL-CD) in RL, which captures the temporal causal relationships between different properties of the environment. We exploit the TL-CD to devise an RL algorithm in which an agent requires significantly less exploration of the environment. To this end, based on a TL-CD and a task DFA, we identify configurations where the agent can determine the expected rewards early during an exploration. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate the benefits of using TL-CDs, particularly the faster convergence of the algorithm to an optimal policy due to reduced exploration of the environment.

In this work, we study a naturally emerging variant of the object navigation task, hierarchical relational object navigation (HRON), where the goal is to find objects specified by logical predicates organized in a hierarchical structure - objects related to furniture and then to rooms - such as finding an apple on top of a table in the kitchen. Solving such a task requires an efficient representation to reason about object relations and correlate the relations in the environment and in the task goal. HRON in large scenes (e.g. homes) is particularly challenging due to its partial observability and long horizon, which invites solutions that can compactly store the past information while effectively exploring the scene. We demonstrate experimentally that scene graphs are the best-suited representation compared to conventional representations such as images or 2D maps. We propose a solution that uses scene graphs as part of its input and integrates graph neural networks as its backbone, with an integrated task-driven attention mechanism, and demonstrate its better scalability and learning efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.

However, they are vulnerable to privacy attacks, including data reconstruction attacks that aim to extract the data used to train the model. Most previous studies on data reconstruction attacks have focused on LLM, while classification models were assumed to be more secure. In this work, we propose a new targeted data reconstruction attack called the Mix And Match attack, which takes advantage of the fact that most classification models are based on LLM. The Mix And Match attack uses the base model of the target model to generate candidate tokens and then prunes them using the classification head. We extensively demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack using both random and organic canaries. This work highlights the importance of considering the privacy risks associated with data reconstruction attacks in classification models and offers insights into possible leakages. ",

At first, QNNRepair applies a software fault localization method to identify the neurons that cause performance degradation during neural network quantization. Then, it formulates the repair problem into a linear programming problem of solving neuron weights parameters, which corrects the QNN's performance on failing tests while not compromising its performance on passing tests. We evaluate QNNRepair with widely used neural network architectures such as MobileNetV2, ResNet, and VGGNet on popular datasets, including high-resolution images. We also compare QNNRepair with the state-of-the-art data-free quantization method SQuant. According to the experiment results, we conclude that QNNRepair is effective in improving the quantized model's performance in most cases. Its repaired models have 24% higher accuracy than SQuant's in the independent validation set, especially for the ImageNet dataset. ",

A recent line of work by \\cite{LigettNeRoWaWu17, WhitehouseWuRaRo22} has developed such accuracy-first mechanisms by leveraging the idea of \\emph{noise reduction} that adds correlated noise to the sufficient statistic in a private computation and produces a sequence of increasingly accurate answers. A major advantage of noise reduction mechanisms is that the analysts only pay the privacy cost of the least noisy or most accurate answer released. Despite this appealing property in isolation, there has not been a systematic study on how to use them in conjunction with other differentially private mechanisms. A fundamental challenge is that the privacy guarantee for noise reduction mechanisms is (necessarily) formulated as \\emph{ex-post privacy} that bounds the privacy loss as a function of the released outcome. Furthermore, there has yet to be any study on how ex-post private mechanisms compose, which allows us to track the accumulated privacy over several mechanisms. We develop privacy filters \\citep{RogersRoUlVa16, FeldmanZr21, WhitehouseRaRoWu22} that allow an analyst to adaptively switch between differentially private and ex-post private mechanisms subject to an overall privacy guarantee.

Because it is difficult to parametrise aggregation functions, currently most methods select a \"standard aggregator\" such as $\\mathrm{mean}$, $\\mathrm{sum}$, or $\\mathrm{max}$. While this selection is often made without any reasoning, it has been shown that the choice in aggregator has a significant impact on performance, and the best choice in aggregator is problem-dependent. Since aggregation is a lossy operation, it is crucial to select the most appropriate aggregator in order to minimise information loss. In this paper, we present GenAgg, a generalised aggregation operator, which parametrises a function space that includes all standard aggregators. In our experiments, we show that GenAgg is able to represent the standard aggregators with much higher accuracy than baseline methods. We also show that using GenAgg as a drop-in replacement for an existing aggregator in a GNN often leads to a significant boost in performance across various tasks. ",

In DEKGCI, we use the high-order collaborative signals from the user-item interaction graph to enrich the user representations on the user side. Additionally, we utilize the high-order structural and semantic information from the knowledge graph to enrich the item representations on the item side. DEKGCI simultaneously learns the user and item representations to effectively capture the joint interactions between users and items. Three real-world datasets are adopted in the experiments to evaluate DEKGCI's performance, and experimental results demonstrate its high effectiveness compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines in terms of AUC and ACC.

    "abstract": "Recent works demonstrate that GNN models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which refer to imperceptible perturbation on the graph structure and node features. Among various GNN models, graph contrastive learning (GCL) based methods specifically suffer from adversarial attacks due to their inherent design that highly depends on the self-supervision signals derived from the original graph, which however already contains noise when the graph is attacked. To achieve adversarial robustness against such attacks, existing methods adopt adversarial training (AT) to the GCL framework, which considers the attacked graph as an augmentation under the GCL framework. However, we find that existing adversarially trained GCL methods achieve robustness at the expense of not being able to preserve the node feature similarity. In this paper, we propose a similarity-preserving adversarial graph contrastive learning (SP-AGCL) framework that contrasts the clean graph with two auxiliary views of different properties (i.e., the node similarity-preserving view and the adversarial view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SP-AGCL achieves a competitive performance on several downstream tasks, and shows its effectiveness in various scenarios, e.g., a network with adversarial attacks, noisy labels, and heterophilous neighbors.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) encode meanings of words in the form of distributed semantics. Distributed semantics capture common statistical patterns among language tokens (words, phrases, and sentences) from large amounts of data. LLMs perform exceedingly well across General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) tasks designed to test a model's understanding of the meanings of the input tokens. However, recent studies have shown that LLMs tend to generate unintended, inconsistent, or wrong texts as outputs when processing inputs that were seen rarely during training, or inputs that are associated with diverse contexts (e.g., well-known hallucination phenomenon in language generation tasks). Crowdsourced and expert-curated knowledge graphs such as ConceptNet are designed to capture the meaning of words from a compact set of well-defined contexts. Thus LLMs may benefit from leveraging such knowledge contexts to reduce inconsistencies in outputs. We propose a novel ensemble learning method, Interpretable Ensemble Representation Learning (IERL), that systematically combines LLM and crowdsourced knowledge representations of input tokens. IERL has the distinct advantage of being interpretable by design (when was the LLM context used vs. when was the knowledge context used?) over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, allowing scrutiny of the inputs in conjunction with the parameters of the model, facilitating the analysis of models' inconsistent or irrelevant outputs. Although IERL is agnostic to the choice of LLM and crowdsourced knowledge, we demonstrate our approach using BERT and ConceptNet. We report improved or competitive results with IERL across GLUE tasks over current SOTA methods and significantly enhanced model interpretability. ",

In particular, datasets, especially social data, are often not representative of minorities. In this paper, we consider the problem of representation bias identification on image datasets without explicit attribute values. Using the notion of data coverage for detecting a lack of representation, we develop multiple crowdsourcing approaches. Our core approach, at a high level, is a divide and conquer algorithm that applies a search space pruning strategy to efficiently identify if a dataset misses proper coverage for a given group. We provide a different theoretical analysis of our algorithm, including a tight upper bound on its performance which guarantees its near-optimality. Using this algorithm as the core, we propose multiple heuristics to reduce the coverage detection cost across different cases with multiple intersectional/non-intersectional groups. We demonstrate how the pre-trained predictors are not reliable and hence not sufficient for detecting representation bias in the data. Finally, we adjust our core algorithm to utilize existing models for predicting image group(s) to minimize the coverage identification cost.

    "abstract": "Visible light communication (VLC) is an emerging technology and considered as an alternative to overcome some of the disadvantages of radio frequency communication technology in an indoor environment. However, the line of sight nature of the technology limits the user mobility and create new challenges to provides seamless network coverage under user mobility scenarios. In VLC multi access points and multi cell based network, co channel interference (CCI) between neighbor cells limits the overall performance. Therefore, by following the already existing VLC handover systems, this statistical parameter based novel handover method is designed. This paper proposes a handover mechanism for indoor VLC systems by introducing cell ID bits and statistical kurtosis values of the cell ID waveforms as metric for the handover initiation. As advantage of the method, effects from the CCI can be eliminate when measuring signal strengths in the signal overlapping cell boundary area. Also the handover criteria are adoptive to the different ambient lighting conditions compared to existing pre-configured light intensity threshold based handover systems. With the use of bit error rate (BER), the experiment results showed that Kurtosis value of the cell ID waveforms can be used as metric to initiate network handover in indoor VLC systems. ",

    "abstract": "What is the effect of releasing a preprint of a paper before it is submitted for peer review? No randomized controlled trial has been conducted, so we turn to observational data to answer this question. We use data from the ICLR conference (2018--2022) and apply methods from causal inference to estimate the effect of arXiving a paper before the reviewing period (early arXiving) on its acceptance to the conference. Adjusting for 18 confounders such as topic, authors, and quality, we may estimate the causal effect. However, since quality is a challenging construct to estimate, we use the negative outcome control method, using paper citation count as a control variable to debias the quality confounding effect. Our results suggest that early arXiving may have a small effect on a paper's chances of acceptance. However, this effect (when existing) does not differ significantly across different groups of authors, as grouped by author citation count and institute rank. This suggests that early arXiving does not provide an advantage to any particular group. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate shared micromobility demand predictions are essential for transportation planning and management. Although deep learning models provide powerful tools to deal with demand prediction problems, studies on forecasting highly-accurate spatiotemporal shared micromobility demand are still lacking. This paper proposes a deep learning model named Interactive Convolutional Network (ICN) to forecast spatiotemporal travel demand for shared micromobility. The proposed model develops a novel channel dilation method by utilizing multi-dimensional spatial information (i.e., demographics, functionality, and transportation supply) based on travel behavior knowledge for building the deep learning model. We use the convolution operation to process the dilated tensor to simultaneously capture temporal and spatial dependencies. Based on a binary-tree-structured architecture and interactive convolution, the ICN model extracts features at different temporal resolutions, and then generates predictions using a fully-connected layer. The proposed model is evaluated for two real-world case studies in Chicago, IL, and Austin, TX. The results show that the ICN model significantly outperforms all the selected benchmark models. The model predictions can help the micromobility operators develop optimal vehicle rebalancing schemes and guide cities to better manage the shared micromobility system. ",

To address this problem, virtual try-on systems have been developed to provide customers with a more realistic and personalized way to try on clothing. In this paper, we propose a novel virtual try-on method called ClothFit, which can predict the draping shape of a garment on a target body based on the actual size of the garment and human attributes. Unlike existing try-on models, ClothFit considers the actual body proportions of the person and available cloth sizes for clothing virtualization, making it more appropriate for current online apparel outlets. The proposed method utilizes a U-Net-based network architecture that incorporates cloth and human attributes to guide the realistic virtual try-on synthesis. Specifically, we extract features from a cloth image using an auto-encoder and combine them with features from the user's height, weight, and cloth size. The features are concatenated with the features from the U-Net encoder, and the U-Net decoder synthesizes the final virtual try-on image. Our experimental results demonstrate that ClothFit can significantly improve the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of photo-realistic virtual try-on results. ",

In this paper, we extend this formulation by adding additional geometric structure to the embedding space by enforcing transformations of input space to correspond to simple (i.e., linear) transformations of embedding space. Specifically, in the contrastive learning setting, we introduce an equivariance objective and theoretically prove that its minima forces augmentations on input space to correspond to rotations on the spherical embedding space. We show that merely combining our equivariant loss with a non-collapse term results in non-trivial representations, without requiring invariance to data augmentations. Optimal performance is achieved by also encouraging approximate invariance, where input augmentations correspond to small rotations. Our method, CARE: Contrastive Augmentation-induced Rotational Equivariance, leads to improved performance on downstream tasks, and ensures sensitivity in embedding space to important variations in data (e.g., color) that standard contrastive methods do not achieve.

We provide a distinct characterization of signal learning and noise memorization in two-layer graph convolutional networks (GCNs), contrasting them with two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our findings reveal that graph convolution significantly augments the benign overfitting regime over the counterpart CNNs, where signal learning surpasses noise memorization, by approximately factor $\\sqrt{D}^{q-2}$, with $D$ denoting a node's expected degree and $q$ being the power of the ReLU activation function where $q > 2$.

The problem of interest is formulated as the minimization of the total transmit power of the BSs, subject to all users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints and all BSs' fronthaul rate constraints. In this paper, we first show that there is no duality gap between the considered joint optimization problem and its Lagrangian dual by showing the tightness of its semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, we propose an efficient algorithm based on the above duality result for solving the considered problem. The proposed algorithm judiciously exploits the special structure of an enhanced Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the considered problem and finds the solution that satisfies the enhanced KKT conditions via two fixed point iterations. Two key features of the proposed algorithm are: (1) it is able to detect whether the considered problem is feasible or not and find its globally optimal solution when it is feasible; (2) it is highly efficient because both of the fixed point iterations in the proposed algorithm are linearly convergent and evaluating the functions in the fixed point iterations are computationally cheap. Numerical results show the global optimality and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Model inversion attacks involve reconstructing the training data of a target model, which raises serious privacy concerns for machine learning models. However, these attacks, especially learning-based methods, are likely to suffer from low attack accuracy, i.e., low classification accuracy of these reconstructed data by machine learning classifiers. Recent studies showed an alternative strategy of model inversion attacks, GAN-based optimization, can improve the attack accuracy effectively. However, these series of GAN-based attacks reconstruct only class-representative training data for a class, whereas learning-based attacks can reconstruct diverse data for different training data in each class. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new training paradigm for a learning-based model inversion attack that can achieve higher attack accuracy in a black-box setting. First, we regularize the training process of the attack model with an added semantic loss function and, second, we inject adversarial examples into the training data to increase the diversity of the class-related parts (i.e., the essential features for classification tasks) in training data. This scheme guides the attack model to pay more attention to the class-related parts of the original data during the data reconstruction process. The experimental results show that our method greatly boosts the performance of existing learning-based model inversion attacks. Even when no extra queries to the target model are allowed, the approach can still improve the attack accuracy of reconstructed data. This new attack shows that the severity of the threat from learning-based model inversion adversaries is underestimated and more robust defenses are required. ",

This is especially manifested as significant degradation in performance when faced with out-of-distribution data. Recent solutions that rely on counterfactually augmented datasets show promising results, but they are inherently limited because of the lack of access to explicit causal structure. In this paper, we present an alternative approach that relies on non-counterfactual data augmentation. Our proposal instead relies on using noisy, cost-efficient data augmentations that preserve semantics associated with the target aspect. Our approach then relies on modelling invariances between different versions of the data to improve robustness. A comprehensive suite of experiments shows that our proposal significantly improves upon strong pre-trained baselines on both standard and robustness-specific datasets. Our approach further establishes a new state-of-the-art on the ABSA robustness benchmark and transfers well across domains. ",

    "abstract": "Node.js provides Node.js applications with system interaction capabilities using system calls. However, such convenience comes with a price, i.e., the attack surface of JavaScript arbitrary code execution (ACE) vulnerabilities is expanded to the system call level. There lies a noticeable gap between existing protection techniques in the JavaScript code level (either by code debloating or read-write-execute permission restriction) and a targeted defense for emerging critical system call level exploitation. To fill the gap, we design and implement HODOR, a lightweight runtime protection system based on enforcing precise system call restrictions when running a Node.js application. HODOR achieved this by addressing several nontrivialial technical challenges. First, HODOR requires to construct high-quality call graphs for both the Node.js application (in JavaScript) and its underlying Node.js framework (in JavaScript and C/C++). Specifically, HODOR incorporates several important optimizations in both the JavaScript and C/C++ level to improve the state-of-the-art tools for building more precise call graphs. Then, HODOR creates the main-thread whitelist and the thread-pool whitelist respectively containing the identified necessary system calls based on the call graphs mappings. Finally, with the whitelists, HODOR implements lightweight system call restriction using the Linux kernel feature Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) to shrink the attack surface. We utilize HODOR to protect 83 real-world Node.js applications compromised by arbitrary code/command execution attacks. HODOR could reduce the attack surface to 16.75% on average with negligible runtime overhead (i.e., <3%). ",

Artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning and deep learning have successfully analyzed complex heterogeneous data in the biomedical domain and have also been used for drug repurposing. This study presents a novel unsupervised machine learning framework that utilizes a graph-based autoencoder for multi-feature type clustering on heterogeneous drug data.

Our machine-learning framework reveals three clusters of interest and provides recommendations featuring the top 15 drugs for COVID-19 drug repurposing, which were shortlisted based on the predicted clusters that were dominated by category A drugs.

This paper considers predicting multiple node labeling functions on graphs simultaneously and revisits this problem from a multitask learning perspective. For a concrete example, consider overlapping community detection: each community membership is a binary node classification task. Due to complex overlapping patterns, we find that negative transfer is prevalent when we apply naive multitask learning to multiple community detection, as task relationships are highly nonlinear across different node labeling. To address the challenge, we develop an algorithm to cluster tasks into groups based on a higher-order task affinity measure. We then fit a multitask model on each task group, resulting in a boosting procedure on top of the baseline model. We estimate the higher-order task affinity measure between two tasks as the prediction loss of one task in the presence of another task and a random subset of other tasks. Then, we use spectral clustering on the affinity score matrix to identify task grouping. We design several speedup techniques to compute the higher-order affinity scores efficiently and show that they can predict negative transfers more accurately than pairwise task affinities. We validate our procedure using various community detection and molecular graph prediction data sets, showing favorable results compared with existing methods. Lastly, we provide a theoretical analysis to show that under a planted block model of tasks on graphs, our affinity scores can provably separate tasks into groups. ",

This is because otherwise the few true positives may be dominated by the many possible false positives. This happens, for instance, when the selection follows from a naive optimisation of an information criterion, such as AIC or Mallows's Cp. It can be argued that the overestimation of the selection comes from the optimisation process itself changing the statistics of the selected variables, in a way that the information criterion no longer reflects the true divergence between the selection and the data generating process. In lasso, the overestimation can also be linked to the shrinkage estimator, which makes the selection too tolerant of false positive selections. For these reasons, this paper works on refined information criteria, carefully balancing false positives and false negatives, for use with estimators without shrinkage. In particular, the paper develops corrected Mallows's Cp criteria for structured selection in trees and graphical models. ",

To this end, many efforts have been made to extract finite automata from RNNs, which are more amenable for analysis and explanation.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework of Weighted Finite Automata (WFA) extraction and explanation to tackle the limitations for natural language tasks. First, to address the transition sparsity and context loss problems we identified in WFA extraction for natural language tasks, we propose an empirical method to complement missing rules in the transition diagram, and adjust transition matrices to enhance the context-awareness of the WFA. We also propose two data augmentation tactics to track more dynamic behaviours of RNN, which further allows us to improve the extraction precision. Based on the extracted model, we propose an explanation method for RNNs including a word embedding method -- Transition Matrix Embeddings (TME) and TME-based task oriented explanation for the target RNN. Our evaluation demonstrates the advantage of our method in extraction precision than existing approaches, and the effectiveness of TME-based explanation method in applications to pretraining and adversarial example generation.

ML systems outsource the task of generating or harvesting randomness to the compiler, the cloud service provider or elsewhere in the toolchain.

In this paper we consider whether attackers can compromise an ML system using only the randomness on which they commonly rely. We focus our effort on Randomised Smoothing, a popular approach to train certifiably robust models, and to certify specific input datapoints of an arbitrary model. We choose Randomised Smoothing since it is used for both security and safety -- to counteract adversarial examples and quantify uncertainty respectively. Under the hood, it relies on sampling Gaussian noise to explore the volume around a data point to certify that a model is not vulnerable to adversarial examples. We demonstrate an entirely novel attack against it, where an attacker backdoors the supplied randomness to falsely certify either an overestimate or an underestimate of robustness. We demonstrate that such attacks are possible, that they require very small changes to randomness to succeed, and that they can be hard to detect. As an example, we hide an attack in the random number generator and show that the randomness tests suggested by NIST fail to detect it. We advocate updating the NIST guidelines on random number testing to make them more appropriate for safety-critical and security-critical machine-learning applications. ",

These acceleration techniques touch on various aspects of the GNN pipeline, from smart training and inference algorithms to efficient systems and customized hardware. As the amount of research on GNN acceleration has grown rapidly, there lacks a systematic treatment to provide a unified view and address the complexity of relevant works.

The uniform geometry of Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces allows for representing graphs with uniform geometric and topological features, such as grids and hierarchies, with minimal distortion.

In this work, we utilize the Riemannian symmetric space of symmetric positive definite matrices (SPD) to construct graph neural networks that can robustly handle complex graphs. To do this, we develop an innovative library that leverages the SPD gyrocalculus tools \\cite{lopez2021gyroSPD} to implement the building blocks of five popular graph neural networks in SPD.

Existing models mainly focus on encoding global contexts of events using techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or self-attention mechanisms. However, local event contexts also play an important role in the occurrences of events, which has been largely ignored. Popular convolutional neural networks, which are designated for local context capturing, have never been applied to TPP modelling due to their incapability of modelling in continuous time. In this work, we propose a novel TPP modelling approach that combines local and global contexts by integrating a continuous-time convolutional event encoder with an RNN. The presented framework is flexible and scalable to handle large datasets with long sequences and complex latent patterns. The experimental result shows that the proposed model improves the performance of probabilistic sequential modelling and the accuracy of event prediction.

Most existing methods rely on the assumption that event sequences are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, this i.i.d. assumption is often violated due to the inherent dependencies among the event sequences. Fortunately, in practice, we find these dependencies can be modeled by a topological network, suggesting a potential solution to the non-i.i.d. problem by introducing the prior topological network into Granger causal discovery. This observation prompts us to tackle two ensuing challenges: 1) how to model the event sequences while incorporating both the prior topological network and the latent Granger causal structure, and 2) how to learn the Granger causal structure. To this end, we devise a two-stage unified topological neural Poisson auto-regressive model. During the generation stage, we employ a variant of the neural Poisson process to model the event sequences, considering influences from both the topological network and the Granger causal structure. In the inference stage, we formulate an amortized inference algorithm to infer the latent Granger causal structure. We encapsulate these two stages within a unified likelihood function, providing an end-to-end framework for this task. ",

Yet, existing association-based approaches on rationalization cannot identify true rationales when two or more snippets are highly inter-correlated and thus provide a similar contribution to prediction accuracy, so-called spuriousness. To address this limitation, we novelly leverage two causal desiderata, non-spuriousness and efficiency, into rationalization from the causal inference perspective. We formally define a series of probabilities of causation based on a newly proposed structural causal model of rationalization, with its theoretical identification established as the main component of learning necessary and sufficient rationales. The superior performance of the proposed causal rationalization is demonstrated on real-world review and medical datasets with extensive experiments compared to state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial objects usually have very stable shape features, which are stable, persistent properties in geometry. They can provide evidence for object recognition. Shape features are more stable and more distinguishing than appearance features, color features, grayscale features, or gradient features. The difficulty with object recognition based on shape features is that objects may differ in color, lighting, size, position, pose, and background interference, and it is not currently possible to predict all possible conditions. The variety of objects and conditions renders object recognition based on geometric features very challenging. This paper provides a method based on shape templates, which involves the selection, collection, and combination discrimination of geometric evidence of the edge segments of images, to find out the target object accurately from background, and it is able to identify the semantic attributes of each line segment of the target object. In essence, the method involves solving a global optimal combinatorial optimization problem. Although the complexity of the global optimal combinatorial optimization problem seems to be very high, there is no need to define the complex feature vector and no need for any expensive training process. It has very good generalization ability and environmental adaptability, and more solid basis for cognitive psychology than other methods. The process of collecting geometric evidence, which is simple and universal, shows considerable prospects for practical use. The experimental results prove that the method has great advantages in response to changes in the environment, invariant recognition, pinpointing the geometry of objects, search efficiency, and efficient calculation. This attempt contributes to understanding of some types of universal processing during the process of object recognition. ",

However, most of the existing models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can lead to inaccurate predictions and negative consequences such as congestion and delays. Therefore, improving the adversarial robustness of these models is crucial for ITS. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for incorporating adversarial training into spatiotemporal traffic forecasting tasks. We demonstrate that traditional adversarial training methods designated for static domains cannot be directly applied to traffic forecasting tasks, as they fail to effectively defend against dynamic adversarial attacks. Then, we propose a reinforcement learning-based method to learn the optimal node selection strategy for adversarial examples, which simultaneously strengthens the dynamic attack defense capability and reduces the model overfitting. Additionally, we introduce a self-knowledge distillation regularization module to overcome the \"forgetting issue\" caused by continuously changing adversarial nodes during training. We evaluate our approach on two real-world traffic datasets and demonstrate its superiority over other baselines. Our method effectively enhances the adversarial robustness of spatiotemporal traffic forecasting models. The source code for our framework is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/RDAT. ",

However, they also suffer from the unstable issue of grouped selection in $\\ell1$ and online dictionary learning. Therefore, they tend to yield different results each time. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a novel method to associate data self-representation with a shallow neural network to learn expressive, interpretable word embeddings.

Considering the challenges posed by low contrast and low-light conditions in underwater environments, several underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have been proposed to improve the quality of underwater images. However, only using the enhanced images does not improve the performance of UOD, since it may unavoidably remove or alter critical patterns and details of underwater objects. In contrast, we believe that exploring the complementary information from the two domains is beneficial for UOD. The raw image preserves the natural characteristics of the scene and texture information of the objects, while the enhanced image improves the visibility of underwater objects. Based on this perspective, we propose a Gated Cross-domain Collaborative Network (GCC-Net) to address the challenges of poor visibility and low contrast in underwater environments, which comprises three dedicated components. Firstly, a real-time UIE method is employed to generate enhanced images, which can improve the visibility of objects in low-contrast areas. Secondly, a cross-domain feature interaction module is introduced to facilitate the interaction and mine complementary information between raw and enhanced image features. Thirdly, to prevent the contamination of unreliable generated results, a gated feature fusion module is proposed to adaptively control the fusion ratio of cross-domain information. Our method presents a new UOD paradigm from the perspective of cross-domain information interaction and fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GCC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on four underwater datasets. ",

In this paper, we propose a modeling strategy that combines existing work on stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOM) and diffusion contagion models with a novel network sampling method based on the identification of independent sets. By assigning respondents from an independent set to the treatment, we are able to block any direct spillover of the treatment, thereby allowing us to isolate the direct effect of the treatment from the indirect network-induced effects. As a result, our method allows for the estimation of both the direct as well as the net effect of a chosen policy intervention, in the presence of network effects in the population. We perform a comparative simulation analysis to show that the choice of sampling technique leads to significantly distinct estimates for both direct and net effects of the policy, as well as for the relevant network effects, such as homophily. Furthermore, using a modified diffusion contagion model, we show that our proposed sampling technique leads to greater and faster spread of the policy-linked behavior through the network. This study highlights the importance of network sampling techniques in improving policy evaluation studies and has the potential to help researchers and policymakers with better planning, designing, and anticipating policy responses in a networked society.

In this paper, we demonstrated that vector-quantized(VQ) acoustic feature contains less speaker information than mel-spectrogram. Based on this finding, we propose a novel dual speaker embedding TTS (DSE-TTS) framework for CTTS with authentic speaking style. Here, one embedding is fed to the acoustic model to learn the linguistic speaking style, while the other one is integrated into the vocoder to mimic the target speaker's timbre. Experiments show that by combining both embeddings, DSE-TTS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art SANE-TTS in cross-lingual synthesis, especially in terms of nativeness. ",

In this way, GRL\\_EnSAT not only learns low-dimensional embedding vectors but also preserves the nonlinear dynamic feature of the evolving network. GRL\\_EnSAT is evaluated on four real datasets, in which GRL\\_EnSAT outperforms most advanced baselines. Benefiting from the dynamic self-attention mechanism, GRL\\_EnSAT yields better performance than approaches based on recursive graph evolution modeling. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting future trajectories of surrounding agents is essential for safety-critical autonomous driving. Most existing work focuses on predicting marginal trajectories for each agent independently. However, it has rarely been explored in predicting joint trajectories for interactive agents. In this work, we propose Bi-level Future Fusion (BiFF) to explicitly capture future interactions between interactive agents. Concretely, BiFF fuses the high-level future intentions followed by low-level future behaviors. Then the polyline-based coordinate is specifically designed for multi-agent prediction to ensure data efficiency, frame robustness, and prediction accuracy. Experiments show that BiFF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the interactive prediction benchmark of Waymo Open Motion Dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) has various applications, including but not limited to vulnerability detection, plagiarism detection, and malware detection. Previous research efforts mainly focus on transforming binary code to assembly code strings using reverse compilation and then using pre-trained deep learning models with large parameters to obtain feature representation vector of binary code. While these models have proven to be effective in representing binary code, their large parameter size leads to considerable computational expenses during both training and inference. In this paper, we present a lightweight neural network, called FastBCSD, that employs a dynamic instruction vector encoding method and takes only assembly code as input feature to achieve comparable accuracy to the pre-training models while reducing the computational resources and time cost. On the BinaryCorp dataset, our method achieves a similar average MRR score to the state-of-the-art pre-training-based method (jTrans), while on the BinaryCorp 3M dataset, our method even outperforms the latest technology by 0.01. Notably, FastBCSD has a much smaller parameter size (13.4M) compared to jTrans (87.88M), and its latency time is 1/5 of jTrans on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti. ",

    "abstract": "The recent 'Mpox' outbreak, formerly known as 'Monkeypox', has become a significant public health concern and has spread to over 110 countries globally. The challenge of clinically diagnosing mpox early on is due, in part, to its similarity to other types of rashes. Computer-aided screening tools have been proven valuable in cases where Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based diagnosis is not immediately available. Deep learning methods are powerful in learning complex data representations, but their efficacy largely depends on adequate training data. To address this challenge, we present the \"Mpox Skin Lesion Dataset Version 2.0 (MSLD v2.0)\" as a follow-up to the previously released openly accessible dataset, one of the first datasets containing mpox lesion images. This dataset contains images of patients with mpox and five other non-mpox classes (chickenpox, measles, hand-foot-mouth disease, cowpox, and healthy). We benchmark the performance of several state-of-the-art deep learning models, including VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB3, InceptionV3, and Xception, to classify mpox and other infectious skin diseases. In order to reduce the impact of racial bias, we utilize a color space data augmentation method to increase skin color variability during training. Additionally, by leveraging transfer learning implemented with pre-trained weights generated from the HAM10000 dataset, an extensive collection of pigmented skin lesion images, we achieved the best overall accuracy of $83.59\\pm2.11\\%$. Finally, the developed models are incorporated within a prototype web application to analyze uploaded skin images by a user and determine whether a subject is a suspected mpox patient. ",

However, trigger classification highly depends on abundant annotated trigger words and the accuracy of trigger identification.

For this reason, we propose a trigger-free event detection model, which transforms event detection into a two-tower model based on machine reading comprehension and prompt learning.

    "abstract": "Scene information plays a crucial role in trajectory forecasting systems for autonomous driving by providing semantic clues and constraints on potential future paths of traffic agents. Prevalent trajectory prediction techniques often take high-definition maps (HD maps) as part of the inputs to provide scene knowledge. Although HD maps offer accurate road information, they may suffer from the high cost of annotation or restrictions of law that limits their widespread use. Therefore, those methods are still expected to generate reliable prediction results in mapless scenarios. In this paper, we tackle the problem of improving the consistency of multi-modal prediction trajectories and the real road topology when map information is unavailable during the test phase. Specifically, we achieve this by training a map-based prediction teacher network on the annotated samples and transferring the knowledge to a student mapless prediction network using a two-fold knowledge distillation framework. Our solution is generalizable for common trajectory prediction networks and does not bring extra computation burden. Experimental results show that our method stably improves prediction performance in mapless mode on many widely used state-of-the-art trajectory prediction baselines, compensating for the gaps caused by the absence of HD maps. Qualitative visualization results demonstrate that our approach helps infer unseen map information. ",

    "abstract": "Multimedia content is of predominance in the modern Web era. In real scenarios, multiple modalities reveal different aspects of item attributes and usually possess different importance to user purchase decisions. However, it is difficult for models to figure out users' true preference towards different modalities since there exists strong statistical correlation between modalities. Even worse, the strong statistical correlation might mislead models to learn the spurious preference towards inconsequential modalities. As a result, when data (modal features) distribution shifts, the learned spurious preference might not guarantee to be as effective on the inference set as on the training set. We propose a novel MOdality DEcorrelating STable learning framework, MODEST for brevity, to learn users' stable preference. Inspired by sample re-weighting techniques, the proposed method aims to estimate a weight for each item, such that the features from different modalities in the weighted distribution are decorrelated. We adopt Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as independence testing measure which is a kernel-based method capable of evaluating the correlation degree between two multi-dimensional and non-linear variables. Our method could be served as a play-and-plug module for existing multimedia recommendation backbones. Extensive experiments on four public datasets and four state-of-the-art multimedia recommendation backbones unequivocally show that our proposed method can improve the performances by a large margin.

In this paper, we propose PrimaDNN, a CRNN model with a characteristics-oriented improvement.

In the results of J-POP singing technique detection, PrimaDNN achieved the best results of 44.9% at the overall macro-F measure, compared to conventional works.

In the area of semantic image segmentation, a number of adversarial training approaches have been proposed as a defense against adversarial perturbation, but the methodology of evaluating the robustness of the models is still lacking, compared to image classification. Here, we demonstrate that, just like in image classification, it is important to evaluate the models over several different and hard attacks. We propose a set of gradient based iterative attacks and show that it is essential to perform a large number of iterations. We include attacks against the internal representations of the models as well. We apply two types of attacks: maximizing the error with a bounded perturbation, and minimizing the perturbation for a given level of error. Using this set of attacks, we show for the first time that a number of models in previous work that are claimed to be robust are in fact not robust at all. We then evaluate simple adversarial training algorithms that produce reasonably robust models even under our set of strong attacks. Our results indicate that a key design decision to achieve any robustness is to use only adversarial examples during training. However, this introduces a trade-off between robustness and accuracy. ",

Towards mitigating the carbon footprint of FL, the current work proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach, targeting the minimization of both the overall energy consumption of an FL process and any unnecessary resource utilization, by orchestrating the computational and communication resources of the involved devices, while guaranteeing a certain FL model performance target. A penalty function is introduced in the offline phase of the GA that penalizes the strategies that violate the constraints of the environment, ensuring a safe GA process.

The approach is based on our previously proposed lookup table-based ship passenger evacuation method, i.e., ANT. The simulation results we present show that delays in the users' reception of instructions significantly impair the effectiveness of the evacuation service. In contrast, behavior uncertainty has a weaker influence on the performance of the navigation method. In addition, these effects also vary with the extent of the behavior uncertainty, the dynamics of the traversal time distributions, and the delay in receiving directions. These findings demonstrate the importance of carefully designing evacuation systems for passenger ships in a way that takes into account all realistic features of the ship's indoor evacuation environment, including the crucial role of information technology.

By modelling the control process as the solution of a Neural RDE driven by the state process, we show that the control-state joint dynamics are governed by an uncontrolled, augmented Neural RDE, allowing for fast Monte-Carlo estimation of the value function via trajectories simulation and memory-efficient backpropagation. We provide theoretical underpinnings for the proposed algorithmic framework by demonstrating that Neural RDEs serve as universal approximators for functions of random rough paths. Exhaustive numerical experiments on non-Markovian stochastic control problems are presented, which reveal that the proposed framework is time-resolution-invariant and achieves higher accuracy and better stability in irregular sampling compared to existing RNN-based approaches.

While adversarial training (AT) has proven to be an effective defense approach, the AT mechanism for robustness improvement is not fully understood. This work investigates AT from a spectral perspective, adding new insights to the design of effective defenses. In particular, we show that AT induces the deep model to focus more on the low-frequency region, which retains the shape-biased representations, to gain robustness. Further, we find that the spectrum of a white-box attack is primarily distributed in regions the model focuses on, and the perturbation attacks the spectral bands where the model is vulnerable. Based on this observation, to train a model tolerant to frequency-varying perturbation, we propose a spectral alignment regularization (SAR) such that the spectral output inferred by an attacked adversarial input stays as close as possible to its natural input counterpart. Experiments demonstrate that SAR and its weight averaging (WA) extension could significantly improve the robust accuracy by 1.14% ~ 3.87% relative to the standard AT, across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet), and various attacks (PGD, C&W and Autoattack), without any extra data.

    "title": "Enhancing Adversarial Training via Reweighting Optimization Trajectory",
    "abstract": "Despite the fact that adversarial training has become the de facto method for improving the robustness of deep neural networks, it is well-known that vanilla adversarial training suffers from daunting robust overfitting, resulting in unsatisfactory robust generalization. A number of approaches have been proposed to address these drawbacks such as extra regularization, adversarial weights perturbation, and training with more data over the last few years. However, the robust generalization improvement is yet far from satisfactory. In this paper, we approach this challenge with a brand new perspective -- refining historical optimization trajectories. We propose a new method named \\textbf{Weighted Optimization Trajectories (WOT)} that leverages the optimization trajectories of adversarial training in time. We have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of WOT under various state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. Our results show that WOT integrates seamlessly with the existing adversarial training methods and consistently overcomes the robust overfitting issue, resulting in better adversarial robustness. For example, WOT boosts the robust accuracy of AT-PGD under AA-$L_{\\infty}$ attack by 1.53\\% $\\sim$ 6.11\\% and meanwhile increases the clean accuracy by 0.55\\%$\\sim$5.47\\% across SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.

    "abstract": "Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging and realistic task that extends beyond the scope of standard Object Detection task. It involves detecting both known and unknown objects while integrating learned knowledge for future tasks. However, the level of 'unknownness' varies significantly depending on the context. For example, a tree is typically considered part of the background in a self-driving scene, but it may be significant in a household context. We argue that this external or contextual information should already be embedded within the known classes. In other words, there should be a semantic or latent structure relationship between the known and unknown items to be discovered. Motivated by this observation, we propose Hyp-OW, a method that learns and models hierarchical representation of known items through a SuperClass Regularizer. Leveraging this learned representation allows us to effectively detect unknown objects using a Similarity Distance-based Relabeling module. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Hyp-OW achieving improvement in both known and unknown detection (up to 6 points). These findings are particularly pronounced in our newly designed benchmark, where a strong hierarchical structure exists between known and unknown objects. ",

    "abstract": "Robustness and compactness are two essential components of deep learning models that are deployed in the real world. The seemingly conflicting aims of (i) generalization across domains as in robustness, and (ii) specificity to one domain as in compression, are why the overall design goal of achieving robust compact models, despite being highly important, is still a challenging open problem. We introduce Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Pruning, or AdaSAP, a method that yields robust sparse networks. The central tenet of our approach is to optimize the loss landscape so that the model is primed for pruning via adaptive weight perturbation, and is also consistently regularized toward flatter regions for improved robustness. This unifies both goals through the lens of network sharpness. AdaSAP achieves strong performance in a comprehensive set of experiments. For classification on ImageNet and object detection on Pascal VOC datasets, AdaSAP improves the robust accuracy of pruned models by +6% on ImageNet C, +4% on ImageNet V2, and +4% on corrupted VOC datasets, over a wide range of compression ratios, saliency criteria, and network architectures, outperforming recent pruning art by large margins.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation requires understanding the dynamic patterns of users' behaviors, contexts, and preferences from their historical interactions. Most existing works focus on modeling user-item interactions only from the item level, ignoring that they are driven by latent shopping intentions (e.g., ballpoint pens, miniatures, etc). The detection of the underlying shopping intentions of users based on their historical interactions is a crucial aspect for e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, to enhance the convenience and efficiency of their customers' shopping experiences. Despite its significance, the area of main shopping intention detection remains under-investigated in the academic literature. To fill this gap, we propose a graph-regularized stochastic Transformer method, G-STO. By considering intentions as sets of products and user preferences as compositions of intentions, we model both of them as stochastic Gaussian embeddings in the latent representation space. Instead of training the stochastic representations from scratch, we develop a global intention relational graph as prior knowledge for regularization, allowing relevant shopping intentions to be distributionally close. Finally, we feed the newly regularized stochastic embeddings into Transformer-based models to encode sequential information from the intention transitions. We evaluate our main shopping intention identification model on three different real-world datasets, where G-STO achieves significantly superior performances to the baselines by 18.08% in Hit@1, 7.01% in Hit@10, and 6.11% in NDCG@10 on average.

The channel is governed by discrete memoryless and i.i.d. channel states and the channel state information (CSI) is revealed to the encoders in a causal manner. Inner and outer bounds are provided. To establish the inner bound, we investigate coding schemes incorporating wiretap coding and secret key agreement between the sender and the legitimate receiver. Two kinds of block Markov coding schemes are proposed. The first one is a new coding scheme using backward decoding and Wyner-Ziv coding and the secret key is constructed from a lossy description of the CSI. The other one is an extended version of the existing coding scheme for point-to-point wiretap channels with causal CSI. A numerical example shows that the achievable region given by the first coding scheme can be strictly larger than the second one. However, these two schemes do not outperform each other in general and there exists some numerical examples that in different channel models each coding scheme achieves some rate pairs that cannot be achieved by another scheme. Our established inner bound reduces to some best-known results in the literature as special cases. We further investigate some capacity-achieving cases for state-dependent multiple access wiretap channels (SD-MAWCs) with degraded message sets. It turns out that the two coding schemes are both optimal in these cases. ",

In this paper, we study this process of language driving and influencing social reasoning in a probabilistic goal inference domain. We propose a neuro-symbolic model that carries out goal inference from linguistic inputs of agent scenarios. The \"neuro\" part is a large language model (LLM) that translates language descriptions to code representations, and the \"symbolic\" part is a Bayesian inverse planning engine. To test our model, we design and run a human experiment on a linguistic goal inference task.

This asymmetry provides a rationale for the fact that robust classifications approaches are frequently fooled in the literature. Second, we show that inference-time robustness certificates are not affected by this asymmetry, by introducing a proof-of-concept approach named Counter-Attack (CA). Indeed, CA displays a reversed asymmetry: running the defense is $\\mathit{NP}$-hard, while attacking it is $\\Sigma_2^P$-hard. Finally, motivated by our previous result, we argue that adversarial attacks can be used in the context of robustness certification, and provide an empirical evaluation of their effectiveness.

Under this challenging attack pattern, traditional sketch algorithms can only detect a high share of the attack bursts by incurring a large number of false positives. In this paper, we present ALBUS, a probabilistic monitoring algorithm that overcomes the inherent limitations of previous schemes: ALBUS is highly effective at detecting large bursts while reporting no legitimate flows, and therefore improves on prior work regarding both recall and precision. Besides improving accuracy, ALBUS scales to high traffic rates, which we demonstrate with an FPGA implementation, and is suitable for programmable switches, which we showcase with a P4 implementation.

Our theoretical results show that it is essential to design adaptive polynomial filters that adapts different degrees of graph heterophily to guarantee the generalization performance of GNNs. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we propose a simple yet powerful GNN named GPatcher by leveraging the MLP-Mixer architectures. Our approach comprises two main components: (1) an adaptive patch extractor function that automatically transforms each node's non-Euclidean graph representations to Euclidean patch representations given different degrees of heterophily, and (2) an efficient patch mixer function that learns salient node representation from both the local context information and the global positional information. Through extensive experiments, the GPatcher model demonstrates outstanding performance on node classification compared with popular homophily GNNs and state-of-the-art heterophily GNNs. ",

The performance of $K$-means depends upon location of minima low in cost function, amongst a potentially vast number of solutions. Here, we use the energy landscape approach to map the change in $K$-means solution space as a result of increasing dataset outliers and show that the cost function surface becomes more funnelled. Kinetic analysis reveals that in all cases the overall funnel is composed of shallow locally-funnelled regions, each of which are separated by areas that do not support any clustering solutions. These shallow regions correspond to different types of clustering solution and their increasing number with outliers leads to longer pathways within the funnel and a reduced correlation between accuracy and cost function. Finally, we propose that the rates obtained from kinetic analysis provide a novel measure of clustering similarity that incorporates information about the paths between them. This measure is robust to outliers and we illustrate the application to datasets containing multiple outliers. ",

Recently, several sampling techniques have been proposed for the efficient training of GCNs and to improve the performance of GCNs on ML tasks. Specifically, the subgraph-based sampling approaches such as ClusterGCN and GraphSAINT have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the node classification tasks. These subgraph-based sampling approaches rely on heuristics -- such as graph partitioning via edge cuts -- to identify clusters that are then treated as minibatches during GCN training. In this work, we hypothesize that rather than relying on such heuristics, one can learn a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to compute efficient clusters that lead to effective GCN performance. To that end, we propose PolicyClusterGCN, an online RL framework that can identify good clusters for GCN training. We develop a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation that allows the policy network to predict ``importance\" weights on the edges which are then utilized by a clustering algorithm (Graclus) to compute the clusters. We train the policy network using a standard policy gradient algorithm where the rewards are computed from the classification accuracies while training GCN using clusters given by the policy. Experiments on six real-world datasets and several synthetic datasets show that PolicyClusterGCN outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on node classification task. ",

    "abstract": "Traversability prediction is a fundamental perception capability for autonomous navigation. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used to predict traversability during the last decade. The performance of DNNs is significantly boosted by exploiting a large amount of data. However, the diversity of data in different domains imposes significant gaps in the prediction performance. In this work, we make efforts to reduce the gaps by proposing a novel pseudo-trilateral adversarial model that adopts a coarse-to-fine alignment (CALI) to perform unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our aim is to transfer the perception model with high data efficiency, eliminate the prohibitively expensive data labeling, and improve the generalization capability during the adaptation from easy-to-access source domains to various challenging target domains. Existing UDA methods usually adopt a bilateral zero-sum game structure. We prove that our CALI model -- a pseudo-trilateral game structure is advantageous over existing bilateral game structures. This proposed work bridges theoretical analyses and algorithm designs, leading to an efficient UDA model with easy and stable training. We further develop a variant of CALI -- Informed CALI (ICALI), which is inspired by the recent success of mixup data augmentation techniques and mixes informative regions based on the results of CALI. This mixture step provides an explicit bridging between the two domains and exposes underperforming classes more during training. We show the superiorities of our proposed models over multiple baselines in several challenging domain adaptation setups. To further validate the effectiveness of our proposed models, we then combine our perception model with a visual planner to build a navigation system and show the high reliability of our model in complex natural environments.

    "abstract": "Brain graphs, which model the structural and functional relationships between brain regions, are crucial in neuroscientific and clinical applications involving graph classification. However, dense brain graphs pose computational challenges including high runtime and memory usage and limited interpretability. In this paper, we investigate effective designs in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to sparsify brain graphs by eliminating noisy edges. While prior works remove noisy edges based on explainability or task-irrelevant properties, their effectiveness in enhancing performance with sparsified graphs is not guaranteed. Moreover, existing approaches often overlook collective edge removal across multiple graphs. To address these issues, we introduce an iterative framework to analyze different sparsification models. Our findings are as follows: (i) methods prioritizing interpretability may not be suitable for graph sparsification as they can degrade GNNs' performance in graph classification tasks; (ii) simultaneously learning edge selection with GNN training is more beneficial than post-training; (iii) a shared edge selection across graphs outperforms separate selection for each graph; and (iv) task-relevant gradient information aids in edge selection. Based on these insights, we propose a new model, Interpretable Graph Sparsification (IGS), which enhances graph classification performance by up to 5.1% with 55.0% fewer edges. The retained edges identified by IGS provide neuroscientific interpretations and are supported by well-established literature. ",

In this paper, we proposed a ContentCTR model that leverages multimodal transformer for frame-level CTR prediction. First, we present an end-to-end framework that can make full use of multimodal information, including visual frames, audio, and comments, to identify the most attractive live frames. Second, to prevent the model from collapsing into a mediocre solution, a novel pairwise loss function with first-order difference constraints is proposed to utilize the contrastive information existing in the highlight and non-highlight frames. Additionally, we design a temporal text-video alignment module based on Dynamic Time Warping to eliminate noise caused by the ambiguity and non-sequential alignment of visual and textual information. We conduct extensive experiments on both real-world scenarios and public datasets, and our ContentCTR model outperforms traditional recommendation models in capturing real-time content changes. Moreover, we deploy the proposed method on our company platform, and the results of online A/B testing further validate its practical significance. ",

    "abstract": "Product image segmentation is vital in e-commerce. Most existing methods extract the product image foreground only based on the visual modality, making it difficult to distinguish irrelevant products. As product titles contain abundant appearance information and provide complementary cues for product image segmentation, we propose a mutual query network to segment products based on both visual and linguistic modalities. First, we design a language query vision module to obtain the response of language description in image areas, thus aligning the visual and linguistic representations across modalities. Then, a vision query language module utilizes the correlation between visual and linguistic modalities to filter the product title and effectively suppress the content irrelevant to the vision in the title. To promote the research in this field, we also construct a Multi-Modal Product Segmentation dataset (MMPS), which contains 30,000 images and corresponding titles. The proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on MMPS. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate customer lifetime value (LTV) prediction can help service providers optimize their marketing policies in customer-centric applications. However, the heavy sparsity of consumption events and the interference of data variance and noise obstruct LTV estimation. Many existing LTV prediction methods directly train a single-view LTV predictor on consumption samples, which may yield inaccurate and even biased knowledge extraction. In this paper, we propose a contrastive multi-view framework for LTV prediction, which is a plug-and-play solution compatible with various backbone models. It synthesizes multiple heterogeneous LTV regressors with complementary knowledge to improve model robustness and captures sample relatedness via contrastive learning to mitigate the dependency on data abundance. Concretely, we use a decomposed scheme that converts the LTV prediction problem into a combination of estimating consumption probability and payment amount. To alleviate the impact of noisy data on model learning, we propose a multi-view framework that jointly optimizes multiple types of regressors with diverse characteristics and advantages to encode and fuse comprehensive knowledge. To fully exploit the potential of limited training samples, we propose a hybrid contrastive learning method to help capture the relatedness between samples in both classification and regression tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world game LTV prediction dataset and the results validate the effectiveness of our method. We have deployed our solution online in Huawei's mobile game center and achieved 32.26% of total payment amount gains. ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies give more attention to the anomaly detection (AD) methods that can leverage a handful of labeled anomalies along with abundant unlabeled data. These existing anomaly-informed AD methods rely on manually predefined score target(s), e.g., prior constant or margin hyperparameter(s), to realize discrimination in anomaly scores between normal and abnormal data. However, such methods would be vulnerable to the existence of anomaly contamination in the unlabeled data, and also lack adaptation to different data scenarios. In this paper, we propose to optimize the anomaly scoring function from the view of score distribution, thus better retaining the diversity and more fine-grained information of input data, especially when the unlabeled data contains anomaly noises in more practical AD scenarios. We design a novel loss function called Overlap loss that minimizes the overlap area between the score distributions of normal and abnormal samples, which no longer depends on prior anomaly score targets and thus acquires adaptability to various datasets. Overlap loss consists of Score Distribution Estimator and Overlap Area Calculation, which are introduced to overcome challenges when estimating arbitrary score distributions, and to ensure the boundness of training loss. As a general loss component, Overlap loss can be effectively integrated into multiple network architectures for constructing AD models. Extensive experimental results indicate that Overlap loss based AD models significantly outperform their state-of-the-art counterparts, and achieve better performance on different types of anomalies.

    "abstract": "When deep neural network has been proposed to assist the dentist in designing the location of dental implant, most of them are targeting simple cases where only one missing tooth is available. As a result, literature works do not work well when there are multiple missing teeth and easily generate false predictions when the teeth are sparsely distributed. In this paper, we are trying to integrate a weak supervision text, the target region, to the implant position regression network, to address above issues. We propose a text condition embedded implant position regression network (TCEIP), to embed the text condition into the encoder-decoder framework for improvement of the regression performance. A cross-modal interaction that consists of cross-modal attention (CMA) and knowledge alignment module (KAM) is proposed to facilitate the interaction between features of images and texts. The CMA module performs a cross-attention between the image feature and the text condition, and the KAM mitigates the knowledge gap between the image feature and the image encoder of the CLIP. Extensive experiments on a dental implant dataset through five-fold cross-validation demonstrated that the proposed TCEIP achieves superior performance than existing methods. ",

Descriptions for code changes (commit messages) help people better understand the changes.

Several methods have been proposed with the aim of automated commit message generation. However, the existing methods are still limited because they only utilise either the changed code or the changed code combined with surrounding statements. This paper proposes a method to represent code changes by combining the changed code and the unchanged code which have program dependence on the changed code. This method overcomes the limitations of current representations while improving the performance of 5/6 of state-of-the-art commit message generation methods by up to 15% in METEOR, 14% in ROUGE-L, and 10% in BLEU-4.

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection under weak supervision is challenging due to the absence of frame-level annotations during the training phase. Previous work has employed graph convolution networks or self-attention mechanisms to model temporal relations, along with multiple instance learning (MIL)-based classification loss to learn discriminative features. However, most of them utilize multi-branches to capture local and global dependencies separately, leading to increased parameters and computational cost. Furthermore, the binarized constraint of the MIL-based loss only ensures coarse-grained interclass separability, ignoring fine-grained discriminability within anomalous classes. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised anomaly detection framework that emphasizes efficient context modeling and enhanced semantic discriminability. To this end, we first construct a temporal context aggregation (TCA) module that captures complete contextual information by reusing similarity matrix and adaptive fusion. Additionally, we propose a prompt-enhanced learning (PEL) module that incorporates semantic priors into the model by utilizing knowledge-based prompts, aiming at enhancing the discriminative capacity of context features while ensuring separability between anomaly sub-classes. Furthermore, we introduce a score smoothing (SS) module in the testing phase to suppress individual bias and reduce false alarms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of various components of our method, which achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters and computational effort on three challenging benchmarks: the UCF-crime, XD-violence, and ShanghaiTech datasets. The detection accuracy of some anomaly sub-classes is also improved with a great margin. ",

    "abstract": "Recommendation systems suffer in the strict cold-start (SCS) scenario, where the user-item interactions are entirely unavailable. The ID-based approaches completely fail to work. Cold-start recommenders, on the other hand, leverage item contents to map the new items to the existing ones. However, the existing SCS recommenders explore item contents in coarse-grained manners that introduce noise or information loss. Moreover, informative data sources other than item contents, such as users' purchase sequences and review texts, are ignored. We explore the role of the fine-grained item attributes in bridging the gaps between the existing and the SCS items and pre-train a knowledgeable item-attribute graph for SCS item recommendation. Our proposed framework, ColdGPT, models item-attribute correlations into an item-attribute graph by extracting fine-grained attributes from item contents. ColdGPT then transfers knowledge into the item-attribute graph from various available data sources, i.e., item contents, historical purchase sequences, and review texts of the existing items, via multi-task learning. To facilitate the positive transfer, ColdGPT designs submodules according to the natural forms of the data sources and coordinates the multiple pre-training tasks via unified alignment-and-uniformity losses. Our pre-trained item-attribute graph acts as an implicit, extendable item embedding matrix, which enables the SCS item embeddings to be easily acquired by inserting these items and propagating their attributes' embeddings. We carefully process three public datasets, i.e., Yelp, Amazon-home, and Amazon-sports, to guarantee the SCS setting for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that ColdGPT consistently outperforms the existing SCS recommenders by large margins and even surpasses models that are pre-trained on 75-224 times more, cross-domain data on two out of four datasets.

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting the demand for ride-hailing services can result in significant benefits such as more effective surge pricing strategies, improved driver positioning, and enhanced customer service. By understanding the demand fluctuations, companies can anticipate and respond to consumer requirements more efficiently, leading to increased efficiency and revenue. However, forecasting demand in a particular region can be challenging, as it is influenced by several external factors, such as time of day, weather conditions, and location. Thus, understanding and evaluating these factors is essential for predicting consumer behavior and adapting to their needs effectively. Grid-based deep learning approaches have proven effective in predicting regional taxi demand. However, these models have limitations in integrating external factors in their spatiotemporal complexity and maintaining high accuracy over extended time horizons without continuous retraining, which makes them less suitable for practical and commercial applications. To address these limitations, this paper introduces STEF-DHNet, a demand prediction model that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to integrate external features as spatiotemporal information and capture their influence on ride-hailing demand. The proposed model is evaluated using a long-term performance metric called the rolling error, which assesses its ability to maintain high accuracy over long periods without retraining. The results show that STEF-DHNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on three diverse datasets, demonstrating its potential for practical use in real-world scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Natural interaction between multiple users within a shared virtual environment (VE) relies on each other's awareness of the current position of the interaction partners. This, however, cannot be warranted when users employ noncontinuous locomotion techniques, such as teleportation, which may cause confusion among bystanders. In this paper, we pursue two approaches to create a pleasant experience for both the moving user and the bystanders observing that movement. First, we will introduce a Smart Avatar system that delivers continuous full-body human representations for noncontinuous locomotion in shared virtual reality (VR) spaces. Smart Avatars imitate their assigned user's real-world movements when close-by and autonomously navigate to their user when the distance between them exceeds a certain threshold, i.e., after the user teleports. As part of the Smart Avatar system, we implemented four avatar transition techniques and compared them to conventional avatar locomotion in a user study, revealing significant positive effects on the observer's spatial awareness, as well as pragmatic and hedonic quality scores. Second, we introduce the concept of Stuttered Locomotion, which can be applied to any continuous locomotion method. By converting a continuous movement into short-interval teleport steps, we provide the merits of non-continuous locomotion for the moving user while observers can easily keep track of their path. Thus, while the experience for observers is similarly positive as with continuous motion, a user study confirmed that Stuttered Locomotion can significantly reduce the occurrence of cybersickness symptoms for the moving user, making it an attractive choice for shared VEs. We will discuss the potential of Smart Avatars and Stuttered Locomotion for shared VR experiences, both when applied individually and in combination. ",

We recover the result of Barber \\& Duchi (2014) stating that histogram estimators are optimal against Lipschitz distributions for the L2 risk, and under regular differential privacy, and we extend it to other norms and notions of privacy. Then, we investigate higher degrees of smoothness, drawing two conclusions: First, and contrary to what happens with constant privacy budget (Wasserman \\& Zhou, 2010), there are regimes where imposing privacy degrades the regular minimax risk of estimation on Sobolev densities. Second, so-called projection estimators are near-optimal against the same classes of densities in this new setup with pure differential privacy, but contrary to the constant privacy budget case, it comes at the cost of relaxation. With zero concentrated differential privacy, there is no need for relaxation, and we prove that the estimation is optimal. ",

In contrast, Delay Differential Equations (DDEs) and their data-driven, approximated counterparts naturally appear as good candidates to characterize such complicated systems.

To efficiently measure the hallucination generated by LMMs, we propose GPT4-Assisted Visual Instruction Evaluation (GAVIE), a novel approach to evaluate visual instruction tuning without the need for human-annotated groundtruth answers and can adapt to diverse instruction formats. We conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate the hallucination of LMMs. Our results demonstrate that existing LMMs exhibit significant hallucination when presented with our negative instructions, particularly with Existent Element Manipulation instructions. Moreover, by finetuning MiniGPT4 on LRV-Instruction, we successfully mitigate hallucination while improving performance on public datasets using less training data compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we observed that a balanced ratio of positive and negative instances in the training data leads to a more robust model.

    "abstract": "Network delays, throughput bottlenecks and privacy issues push Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) designers towards evaluating the feasibility of moving model training and execution (inference) as near as possible to the terminals. Meanwhile, results from the TinyML community demonstrate that, in some cases, it is possible to execute model inference directly on the terminals themselves, even if these are small microcontroller-based devices. However, to date, researchers and practitioners in the domain lack convenient all-in-one toolkits to help them evaluate the feasibility of moving execution of arbitrary models to arbitrary low-power IoT hardware. To this effect, we present in this paper U-TOE, a universal toolkit we designed to facilitate the task of AIoT designers and researchers, by combining functionalities from a low-power embedded OS, a generic model transpiler and compiler, an integrated performance measurement module, and an open-access remote IoT testbed. We provide an open source implementation of U-TOE and we demonstrate its use to experimentally evaluate the performance of a wide variety of models, on a wide variety of low-power boards, based on popular microcontroller architectures (ARM Cortex-M and RISC-V). U-TOE thus allows easily reproducible and customisable comparative evaluation experiments in this domain, on a wide variety of IoT hardware all-at-once. The availability of a toolkit such as U-TOE is desirable to accelerate the field of AIoT, towards fully exploiting the potential of edge computing. ",

Different from the previous translation-based models, TransERR encodes knowledge graphs in the hypercomplex-valued space, thus enabling it to possess a higher degree of translation freedom in mining latent information between the head and tail entities. To further minimize the translation distance, TransERR adaptively rotates the head entity and the tail entity with their corresponding unit quaternions, which are learnable in model training. The experiments on 7 benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and the generalization of TransERR.

LLMs, such as Transformer-based models like Codex and ChatGPT, have been shown to be highly capable of solving a wide range of programming problems. However, the extent to which LLMs understand problem descriptions and generate programs accordingly or just retrieve source code from the most relevant problem in training data based on superficial cues has not been discovered yet. To explore this research question, we conduct experiments to understand the robustness of several popular LLMs, CodeGen and GPT-3.5 series models, capable of tackling code generation tasks in introductory programming problems. Our experimental results show that CodeGen and Codex are sensitive to the superficial modifications of problem descriptions and significantly impact code generation performance. Furthermore, we observe that Codex relies on variable names, as randomized variables decrease the solved rate significantly. However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, show higher robustness to superficial modifications and have an outstanding capability for solving programming problems. This highlights the fact that slight modifications to the prompts given to the LLMs can greatly affect code generation performance, and careful formatting of prompts is essential for high-quality code generation, while the SOTA models are becoming more robust to perturbations.

    "abstract": "Recently, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) have received significant research interest. The employment of large STAR-RIS and high-frequency signaling inevitably make the near-field propagation dominant in wireless communications. In this work, a STAR-RIS aided near-field multiple-input multiple-multiple (MIMO) communication framework is proposed. A weighted sum rate maximization problem for the joint optimization of the active beamforming at the base station (BS) and the transmission/reflection-coefficients (TRCs) at the STAR-RIS is formulated. The non-convex problem is solved by a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm. In particular, under given STAR-RIS TRCs, the optimal active beamforming matrices are obtained by solving a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. For given active beamforming matrices, two algorithms are suggested for optimizing the STAR-RIS TRCs: a penalty-based iterative (PEN) algorithm and an element-wise iterative (ELE) algorithm. The latter algorithm is conceived for STAR-RISs with a large number of elements. Numerical results illustrate that: i) near-field beamforming for STAR-RIS aided MIMO communications significantly improves the achieved weighted sum rate compared with far-field beamforming; ii) the near-field channels facilitated by the STAR-RIS provide enhanced degrees-of-freedom and accessibility for the multi-user MIMO system; and iii) the BCD-PEN algorithm achieves better performance than the BCD-ELE algorithm, while the latter has a significantly lower computational complexity.

We use VDA to derive attention maps for state-of-the art SSL methods and show they do not highlight all salient regions in an image accurately, suggesting their inability to learn strong representations for downstream tasks like segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we cast VDA as a differentiable operation and propose a new learning objective, Differentiable Difference Attention (DiDA) loss, which leads to substantial improvements in an SSL model's visually grounding to an image's salient regions.

To provide guarantees, verification tools must efficiently capture the interplay between the neural network and the physical system within the control loop. In this paper, a compositional approach focused on inclusion preserving long term symbolic dependency modeling is proposed for the analysis of NNCSs. First of all, the matrix structure of symbolic zonotopes is exploited to efficiently abstract the input/output mapping of the loop elements through (inclusion preserving) affine symbolic expressions, thus maintaining linear dependencies between interacting blocks. Then, two further extensions are studied. Firstly, symbolic polynotopes are used to abstract the loop elements behaviour by means of polynomial symbolic expressions and dependencies. Secondly, an original input partitioning algorithm takes advantage of symbol preservation to assess the sensitivity of the computed approximation to some input directions. The approach is evaluated via different numerical examples and benchmarks. A good trade-off between low conservatism and computational efficiency is obtained. ",

    "abstract": "Patient monitoring in intensive care units, although assisted by biosensors, needs continuous supervision of staff. To reduce the burden on staff members, IT infrastructures are built to record monitoring data and develop clinical decision support systems. These systems, however, are vulnerable to artifacts (e.g. muscle movement due to ongoing treatment), which are often indistinguishable from real and potentially dangerous signals. Video recordings could facilitate the reliable classification of biosignals using object detection (OD) methods to find sources of unwanted artifacts. Due to privacy restrictions, only blurred videos can be stored, which severely impairs the possibility to detect clinically relevant events such as interventions or changes in patient status with standard OD methods. Hence, new kinds of approaches are necessary that exploit every kind of available information due to the reduced information content of blurred footage and that are at the same time easily implementable within the IT infrastructure of a normal hospital. In this paper, we propose a new method for exploiting information in the temporal succession of video frames. To be efficiently implementable using off-the-shelf object detectors that comply with given hardware constraints, we repurpose the image color channels to account for temporal consistency, leading to an improved detection rate of the object classes. Our method outperforms a standard YOLOv5 baseline model by +1.7% mAP@.5 while also training over ten times faster on our proprietary dataset. We conclude that this approach has shown effectiveness in the preliminary experiments and holds potential for more general video OD in the future. ",

It explicitly encodes entities and events in a single semantic graph, and further has the flexibility to encode a wider range of additional IE relations and jointly infer individual tasks. JSEEGraph performs in an end-to-end manner via general graph parsing: (1) instead of flat sequence labelling, nested structures between entities/triggers are efficiently encoded as separate nodes in the graph, allowing for nested and overlapping entities and triggers; (2) both entities, relations, and events can be encoded in the same graph, where entities and event triggers are represented as nodes and entity relations and event arguments are constructed via edges; (3) joint inference avoids error propagation and enhances the interpolation of different IE tasks. We experiment on two benchmark datasets of varying structural complexities; ACE05 and Rich ERE, covering three languages: English, Chinese, and Spanish. Experimental results show that JSEEGraph can handle nested event structures, that it is beneficial to solve different IE tasks jointly, and that event argument extraction in particular benefits from entity extraction.

In this paper, we propose a 3D-Aware Adversarial Makeup Generation GAN (3DAM-GAN). which aims to improve the quality and transferability of synthetic makeup for identity information concealing. Specifically, a UV-based generator consisting of a novel Makeup Adjustment Module (MAM) and Makeup Transfer Module (MTM) is designed to render realistic and robust makeup with the aid of symmetric characteristics of human faces. Moreover, a makeup attack mechanism with an ensemble training strategy is proposed to boost the transferability of black-box models. Extensive experiment results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that 3DAM-GAN could effectively protect faces against various FR models, including both publicly available state-of-the-art models and commercial face verification APIs, such as Face++, Baidu and Aliyun.

In this work, we demonstrate that competition can fundamentally alter the behavior of these scaling trends, even causing overall predictive accuracy across users to be non-monotonic or decreasing with scale. We define a model of competition for classification tasks, and use data representations as a lens for studying the impact of increases in scale. We find many settings where improving data representation quality (as measured by Bayes risk) decreases the overall predictive accuracy across users (i.e., social welfare) for a marketplace of competing model-providers. Our examples range from closed-form formulas in simple settings to simulations with pretrained representations on CIFAR-10. At a conceptual level, our work suggests that favorable scaling trends for individual model-providers need not translate to downstream improvements in social welfare in marketplaces with multiple model providers.

The immersive experience is achieved through seamless human-avatar interaction, e.g., augmented reality navigation, which requires intensive resources that are inefficient and impractical to process on intelligent vehicles locally. Fortunately, offloading avatar tasks to RoadSide Units (RSUs) or cloud servers for remote execution can effectively reduce resource consumption. However, the high mobility of vehicles, the dynamic workload of RSUs, and the heterogeneity of RSUs pose novel challenges to making avatar migration decisions. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a dynamic migration framework for avatar tasks based on real-time trajectory prediction and Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Specifically, we propose a model to predict the future trajectories of intelligent vehicles based on their historical data, indicating the future workloads of RSUs.Based on the expected workloads of RSUs, we formulate the avatar task migration problem as a long-term mixed integer programming problem. To tackle this problem efficiently, the problem is transformed into a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and solved by multiple DRL agents with hybrid continuous and discrete actions in decentralized. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the latency of executing avatar tasks by around 25% without prediction and 30% with prediction and enhance user immersive experiences in the AIoT-enabled Vehicular Metaverse (AeVeM).

    "abstract": "Autonomous individuals establish a structural complex system through pairwise connections and interactions. Notably, the evolution reflects the dynamic nature of each complex system since it recodes a series of temporal changes from the past, the present into the future. Different systems follow distinct evolutionary trajectories, which can serve as distinguishing traits for system classification. However, modeling a complex system's evolution is challenging for the graph model because the graph is typically a snapshot of the static status of a system, and thereby hard to manifest the long-term evolutionary traits of a system entirely. To address this challenge, we suggest utilizing a heat-driven method to generate temporal graph augmentation. This approach incorporates the physics-based heat kernel and DropNode technique to transform each static graph into a sequence of temporal ones. This approach effectively describes the evolutional behaviours of the system, including the retention or disappearance of elements at each time point based on the distributed heat on each node. Additionally, we propose a dynamic time-wrapping distance GDTW to quantitatively measure the distance between pairwise evolutionary systems through optimal matching. The resulting approach, called the Evolution Kernel method, has been successfully applied to classification problems in real-world structural graph datasets. The results yield significant improvements in supervised classification accuracy over a series of baseline methods. ",

    "abstract": "Smart grids are replacing conventional power grids due to rising electricity use, failing infrastructure, and reliability problems. Two-way communication, demand-side administration, and real-time pricing make smart grids (SGs) dependent on its communication system. Manual network administration slows down SG communication. SG networks additionally utilize hardware and software from several vendors, allowing devices to communicate. Software-defined SGs (SD-SG) use software-defined networking (SDN) to monitor and regulate SG global communication networks to address these concerns. SDN separates the data plane (routers and switches) from the control plane (routing logic) and centralizes control into the SDN controller. This helps network operators manage visibility, control, and security. These benefits have made SDN popular in SG architectural and security studies. But because SD-SGs are vulnerable to cyberattacks, there are concerns about the security of these SD-SG networks. Cybercriminals can attack software-defined communication networks, affecting the power grid. Unauthorized access can be used to intercept messages and introduce false data into system measurements, flood communication channels with fraudulent data packets, or target controllers, a potential single point of failure, to cripple SDN networks. Current research reflects this paradigm as defense and security against such attacks have developed and evolved. There is a need for a current study that provides a more detailed analysis and description of SD-SG network security dangers and countermeasures, as well as future research needs and developing threats for the sector.

    "abstract": "The efficient utilization of wind power by wind turbines relies on the ability of their pitch systems to adjust blade pitch angles in response to varying wind speeds. However, the presence of multiple fault types in the pitch system poses challenges in accurately classifying these faults. This paper proposes a novel method based on hard sample mining-enabled contrastive feature learning (HSMCFL) to address this problem. The proposed method employs cosine similarity to identify hard samples and subsequently leverages contrastive feature learning to enhance representation learning through the construction of hard sample pairs. Furthermore, a multilayer perceptron is trained using the learned discriminative representations to serve as an efficient classifier. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two real datasets comprising wind turbine pitch system cog belt fracture data are utilized. The fault diagnosis performance of the proposed method is compared against existing methods, and the results demonstrate its superior performance. The proposed approach exhibits significant improvements in fault diagnosis accuracy, providing promising prospects for enhancing the reliability and efficiency of wind turbine pitch system fault diagnosis.

However, this series of improvements to GAN all have redundancy to a certain extent, which affects the generation performance and complexity to a certain extent. We use the popular simple and effective idea (1) to remove redundancy structure and improve the backbone network of AttnGAN. (2) to integrate and reconstruct multiple losses of DAMSM.

In many practical applications, it is important for novel view synthesis methods to stay grounded in the physical world as much as possible, while also being able to imagine it from previously unseen views. While most current methods are developed and tested in virtual environments with small scenes and no errors in pose and depth information, we push the boundaries to the real-world domain of large scales in the new context of UAVs. Our algorithmic contributions are two folds. First, we manage to stay anchored in the real 3D world, by introducing an efficient multi-scale voxel carving method, which is able to accommodate significant noises in pose, depth, and illumination variations, while being able to reconstruct the view of the world from drastically different poses at test time. Second, our final high-resolution output is efficiently self-trained on data automatically generated by the voxel carving module, which gives it the flexibility to adapt efficiently to any scene. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our method on highly complex and large-scale scenes in real environments while outperforming the current state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in automated vulnerability detection have achieved potential results in helping developers determine vulnerable components. However, after detecting vulnerabilities, investigating to fix vulnerable code is a non-trivial task. In fact, the types of vulnerability, such as buffer overflow or memory corruption, could help developers quickly understand the nature of the weaknesses and localize vulnerabilities for security analysis. In this work, we investigate the problem of vulnerability type identification (VTI). The problem is modeled as the multi-label classification task, which could be effectively addressed by \"pre-training, then fine-tuning\" framework with deep pre-trained embedding models. We evaluate the performance of the well-known and advanced pre-trained models for VTI on a large set of vulnerabilities. Surprisingly, their performance is not much better than that of the classical baseline approach with an old-fashioned bag-of-word, TF-IDF. Meanwhile, these deep neural network approaches cost much more resources and require GPU. We also introduce a lightweight independent component to refine the predictions of the baseline approach. Our idea is that the types of vulnerabilities could strongly correlate to certain code tokens (distinguishing tokens) in several crucial parts of programs. The distinguishing tokens for each vulnerability type are statistically identified based on their prevalence in the type versus the others. Our results show that the baseline approach enhanced by our component can outperform the state-of-the-art deep pre-trained approaches while retaining very high efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed component could also improve the neural network approaches by up to 92.8% in macro-average F1. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning have been widely used in various fields of mathematical computing, physical modeling, computational science, communication science, and stochastic analysis. Approaches based on Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANN) are very popular in our days. Depending on the learning task, the exact form of DANNs is determined via their multi-layer architecture, activation functions and the so-called loss function. However, for a majority of deep learning approaches based on DANNs, the kernel structure of neural signal processing remains the same, where the node response is encoded as a linear superposition of neural activity, while the non-linearity is triggered by the activation functions. In the current paper, we suggest to analyze the neural signal processing in DANNs from the point of view of homogeneous chaos theory as known from polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). From the PCE perspective, the (linear) response on each node of a DANN could be seen as a $1^{st}$ degree multi-variate polynomial of single neurons from the previous layer, i.e. linear weighted sum of monomials. From this point of view, the conventional DANN structure relies implicitly (but erroneously) on a Gaussian distribution of neural signals. Additionally, this view revels that by design DANNs do not necessarily fulfill any orthogonality or orthonormality condition for a majority of data-driven applications. Therefore, the prevailing handling of neural signals in DANNs could lead to redundant representation as any neural signal could contain some partial information from other neural signals. To tackle that challenge, we suggest to employ the data-driven generalization of PCE theory known as arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) to construct a corresponding multi-variate orthonormal representations on each node of a DANN to obtain Deep arbitrary polynomial chaos neural networks.

However, estimating a deterministic prototype using a simple average function from a limited number of examples remains a fragile process. To overcome this limitation, we introduce ProtoDiff, a novel framework that leverages a task-guided diffusion model during the meta-training phase to gradually generate prototypes, thereby providing efficient class representations. Specifically, a set of prototypes is optimized to achieve per-task prototype overfitting, enabling accurately obtaining the overfitted prototypes for individual tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a task-guided diffusion process within the prototype space, enabling the meta-learning of a generative process that transitions from a vanilla prototype to an overfitted prototype. ProtoDiff gradually generates task-specific prototypes from random noise during the meta-test stage, conditioned on the limited samples available for the new task. Furthermore, to expedite training and enhance ProtoDiff's performance, we propose the utilization of residual prototype learning, which leverages the sparsity of the residual prototype. We conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate its ability to accurately capture the underlying prototype distribution and enhance generalization. The new state-of-the-art performance on within-domain, cross-domain, and few-task few-shot classification further substantiates the benefit of ProtoDiff. ",

However, it is necessary that these machine learning techniques are not prone to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate adversarial sample vulnerabilities in four different machine learning-based intrusion detection systems for automotive networks. We show that adversarial samples negatively impact three of the four studied solutions. Furthermore, we analyze transferability of adversarial samples between different systems. We also investigate detection performance and the attack success rate after using adversarial samples in the training.

    "abstract": "Cerebral Microbleeds (CMBs) are chronic deposits of small blood products in the brain tissues, which have explicit relation to various cerebrovascular diseases depending on their anatomical location, including cognitive decline, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral infarction. However, manual detection of CMBs is a time-consuming and error-prone process because of their sparse and tiny structural properties. The detection of CMBs is commonly affected by the presence of many CMB mimics that cause a high false-positive rate (FPR), such as calcification and pial vessels. This paper proposes a novel 3D deep learning framework that does not only detect CMBs but also inform their anatomical location in the brain (i.e., lobar, deep, and infratentorial regions). For the CMB detection task, we propose a single end-to-end model by leveraging the U-Net as a backbone with Region Proposal Network (RPN). To significantly reduce the FPs within the same single model, we develop a new scheme, containing Feature Fusion Module (FFM) that detects small candidates utilizing contextual information and Hard Sample Prototype Learning (HSPL) that mines CMB mimics and generates additional loss term called concentration loss using Convolutional Prototype Learning (CPL). The anatomical localization task does not only tell to which region the CMBs belong but also eliminate some FPs from the detection task by utilizing anatomical information. The results show that the proposed RPN that utilizes the FFM and HSPL outperforms the vanilla RPN and achieves a sensitivity of 94.66% vs. 93.33% and an average number of false positives per subject (FPavg) of 0.86 vs. 14.73. Also, the anatomical localization task further improves the detection performance by reducing the FPavg to 0.56 while maintaining the sensitivity of 94.66%. ",

Our CGCN model is extensively validated on fourteen real-world bimolecular interaction networks and a series of simulated data.

It outperforms all existing models, as far as we know, in thirteen out of the fourteen real-world datasets and ranks as the second in the rest one.

Here, we show that the method proposed by Angelopoulos et al.

    "abstract": "Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction, which aims at predicting whether a drug will be bounded to a target, have received wide attention recently, with the goal to automate and accelerate the costly process of drug design. Most of the recently proposed methods use single drug-drug similarity and target-target similarity information for DTI prediction, which are unable to take advantage of the abundant information regarding various types of similarities between them. Very recently, some methods are proposed to leverage multi-similarity information, however, they still lack the ability to take into consideration the rich topological information of all sorts of knowledge bases where the drugs and targets reside in. More importantly, the time consumption of these approaches is very high, which prevents the usage of large-scale network information. We thus propose a network-based drug-target interaction prediction approach, which applies probabilistic soft logic (PSL) to meta-paths on a heterogeneous network that contains multiple sources of information, including drug-drug similarities, target-target similarities, drug-target interactions, and other potential information. Our approach is based on the PSL graphical model and uses meta-path counts instead of path instances to reduce the number of rule instances of PSL. We compare our model against five methods, on three open-source datasets. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms all the five baselines in terms of AUPR score and AUC score. ",

    "abstract": "Chest radiographs are the most commonly performed radiological examinations for lesion detection. Recent advances in deep learning have led to encouraging results in various thoracic disease detection tasks. Particularly, the architecture with feature pyramid network performs the ability to recognise targets with different sizes. However, such networks are difficult to focus on lesion regions in chest X-rays due to their high resemblance in vision. In this paper, we propose a dual attention supervised module for multi-label lesion detection in chest radiographs, named DualAttNet. It efficiently fuses global and local lesion classification information based on an image-level attention block and a fine-grained disease attention algorithm. A binary cross entropy loss function is used to calculate the difference between the attention map and ground truth at image level. The generated gradient flow is leveraged to refine pyramid representations and highlight lesion-related features. We evaluate the proposed model on VinDr-CXR, ChestX-ray8 and COVID-19 datasets. The experimental results show that DualAttNet surpasses baselines by 0.6% to 2.7% mAP and 1.4% to 4.7% AP50 with different detection architectures.

The first is learning based on sampling points, which aims to model an underlying sampling distribution of radio signals. The second is an unrolled generator design, combined with an estimated pure signal distribution as a prior, which can greatly reduce learning difficulty and effectively improve learning precision. Finally, we present an energy-constrained optimization algorithm to achieve better training stability and convergence. Experimental results with extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed GAN framework can effectively learn transmitter characteristics and various channel effects, thus accurately modeling for an underlying sampling distribution to synthesize radio signals of high quality.

    "abstract": "In data-driven optimization, sample average approximation is known to suffer from the so-called optimizer's curse that causes optimistic bias in evaluating the solution performance. This can be tackled by adding a \"margin\" to the estimated objective value, or via distributionally robust optimization (DRO), a fast-growing approach based on worst-case analysis, which gives a protective bound on the attained objective value. However, in all these existing approaches, a statistically guaranteed bound on the true solution performance either requires restrictive conditions and knowledge on the objective function complexity, or otherwise exhibits an over-conservative rate that depends on the distribution dimension. We argue that a special type of DRO offers strong theoretical advantages in regard to these challenges: It attains a statistical bound on the true solution performance that is the tightest possible in terms of exponential decay rate, for a wide class of objective functions that notably does not hinge on function complexity. Correspondingly, its calibration also does not require any complexity information. This DRO uses an ambiguity set based on a KL-divergence smoothed by the Wasserstein or Levy-Prokhorov distance via a suitable distance optimization. Computationally, we also show that such a DRO, and its generalized version using smoothed $f$-divergence, is not much harder than standard DRO problems using the $f$-divergence or Wasserstein distance, thus supporting the strengths of such DRO as both statistically optimal and computationally viable.

While Markov Decision Processes (MDP) offers a mathematical framework for identifying optimal actions, such as vaccination and transmission-reducing intervention, to combat disease spreading according to the SEIR model. However, uncertainties in these scenarios demand a more robust approach that is less reliant on error-prone assumptions. The primary objective of our study is to introduce a new DRMDP framework that allows for an ambiguous distribution of transition dynamics. Specifically, we consider the worst-case distribution of these transition probabilities within a decision-dependent ambiguity set. To overcome the computational complexities associated with policy determination, we propose an efficient Real-Time Dynamic Programming (RTDP) algorithm that is capable of computing optimal policies based on the reformulated DRMDP model in an accurate, timely, and scalable manner. Comparative analysis against the classic MDP model demonstrates that the DRMDP achieves a lower proportion of infections and susceptibilities at a reduced cost. ",

We trained the Style and WAvelet based GAN (SWAGAN) on 142,628 AS-OCT B-scans. Three experienced refractive surgeons performed a blinded assessment to evaluate the realism of the generated images; their results were not significantly better than chance in distinguishing between real and synthetic images, thus demonstrating a high degree of image realism. To gauge their suitability for machine learning tasks, a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier was trained with a dataset containing both real and GAN-generated images. The CNN demonstrated an accuracy rate of 78% trained on real images alone, but this accuracy rose to 100% when training included the generated images. This underscores the utility of synthetic images for machine learning applications. We further improved the resolution of the generated images by up-sampling them twice (2x) using an Enhanced Super Resolution GAN (ESRGAN), which outperformed traditional up-sampling techniques. In conclusion, GANs can effectively generate high-definition, realistic AS-OCT images, proving highly beneficial for machine learning and image analysis tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) can reflect spontaneous neural activities in brain and is widely used for brain disorder analysis.Previous studies propose to extract fMRI representations through diverse machine/deep learning methods for subsequent analysis. But the learned features typically lack biological interpretability, which limits their clinical utility. From the view of graph theory, the brain exhibits a remarkable modular structure in spontaneous brain functional networks, with each module comprised of functionally interconnected brain regions-of-interest (ROIs). However, most existing learning-based methods for fMRI analysis fail to adequately utilize such brain modularity prior. In this paper, we propose a Brain Modularity-constrained dynamic Representation learning (BMR) framework for interpretable fMRI analysis, consisting of three major components: (1) dynamic graph construction, (2) dynamic graph learning via a novel modularity-constrained graph neural network(MGNN), (3) prediction and biomarker detection for interpretable fMRI analysis. Especially, three core neurocognitive modules (i.e., salience network, central executive network, and default mode network) are explicitly incorporated into the MGNN, encouraging the nodes/ROIs within the same module to share similar representations. To further enhance discriminative ability of learned features, we also encourage the MGNN to preserve the network topology of input graphs via a graph topology reconstruction constraint. Experimental results on 534 subjects with rs-fMRI scans from two datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The identified discriminative brain ROIs and functional connectivities can be regarded as potential fMRI biomarkers to aid in clinical diagnosis. ",

This is a significant and crucial task in many applications such as medical imaging. Deep learning (DL) methods have been proposed and widely used for image segmentation. However, these methods usually require a large amount of manually segmented data as training data and suffer from poor interpretability (known as the black box problem). The classical Mumford-Shah (MS) model is effective for segmentation and provides a piece-wise smooth approximation of the original image. In this paper, we replace the hand-crafted regularity term in the MS model with a data adaptive generalized learnable regularity term and use a multi-grid framework to unroll the MS model and obtain a variational model-based segmentation network with better generalizability and interpretability. This approach allows for the incorporation of learnable prior information into the network structure design. Moreover, the multi-grid framework enables multi-scale feature extraction and offers a mathematical explanation for the effectiveness of the U-shaped network structure in producing good image segmentation results. Due to the proposed network originates from a variational model, it can also handle small training sizes. Our experiments on the REFUGE dataset, the White Blood Cell image dataset, and 3D thigh muscle magnetic resonance (MR) images demonstrate that even with smaller training datasets, our method yields better segmentation results compared to related state of the art segmentation methods.

However, due to the lack of sufficient projection data, the reconstructed CT images often present severe artifacts, which will be further amplified when patients carry metallic implants. For this joint sparse-view reconstruction and metal artifact reduction task, most of the existing methods are generally confronted with two main limitations: 1) They are almost built based on common network modules without fully embedding the physical imaging geometry constraint of this specific task into the dual-domain learning; 2) Some important prior knowledge is not deeply explored and sufficiently utilized. Against these issues, we specifically construct a dual-domain reconstruction model and propose a model-driven equivariant proximal network, called MEPNet. The main characteristics of MEPNet are: 1) It is optimization-inspired and has a clear working mechanism; 2) The involved proximal operator is modeled via a rotation equivariant convolutional neural network, which finely represents the inherent rotational prior underlying the CT scanning that the same organ can be imaged at different angles. Extensive experiments conducted on several datasets comprehensively substantiate that compared with the conventional convolution-based proximal network, such a rotation equivariance mechanism enables our proposed method to achieve better reconstruction performance with fewer network parameters.

    "abstract": "Feature-Imitating-Networks (FINs) are neural networks with weights that are initialized to approximate closed-form statistical features. In this work, we perform the first-ever evaluation of FINs for biomedical image processing tasks. We begin by training a set of FINs to imitate six common radiomics features, and then compare the performance of networks with and without the FINs for three experimental tasks: COVID-19 detection from CT scans, brain tumor classification from MRI scans, and brain-tumor segmentation from MRI scans; we find that FINs provide best-in-class performance for all three tasks, while converging faster and more consistently when compared to networks with similar or greater representational power. The results of our experiments provide evidence that FINs may provide state-of-the-art performance for a variety of other biomedical image processing tasks. ",

    "title": "Deep Learning for Cancer Prognosis Prediction Using Portrait Photos by  StyleGAN Embedding",
    "abstract": "urvival prediction for cancer patients is critical for optimal treatment selection and patient management. Current patient survival prediction methods typically extract survival information from patients' clinical record data or biological and imaging data. In practice, experienced clinicians can have a preliminary assessment of patients' health status based on patients' observable physical appearances, which are mainly facial features. However, such assessment is highly subjective. In this work, the efficacy of objectively capturing and using prognostic information contained in conventional portrait photographs using deep learning for survival predication purposes is investigated for the first time. A pre-trained StyleGAN2 model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset of our cancer patients' photos to empower its generator with generative ability suitable for patients' photos. The StyleGAN2 is then used to embed the photographs to its highly expressive latent space. Utilizing the state-of-the-art survival analysis models and based on StyleGAN's latent space photo embeddings, this approach achieved a C-index of 0.677, which is notably higher than chance and evidencing the prognostic value embedded in simple 2D facial images. In addition, thanks to StyleGAN's interpretable latent space, our survival prediction model can be validated for relying on essential facial features, eliminating any biases from extraneous information like clothing or background. Moreover, a health attribute is obtained from regression coefficients, which has important potential value for patient care. ",

    "title": "Multi-View Attention Learning for Residual Disease Prediction of Ovarian  Cancer",
    "abstract": "In the treatment of ovarian cancer, precise residual disease prediction is significant for clinical and surgical decision-making. However, traditional methods are either invasive (e.g., laparoscopy) or time-consuming (e.g., manual analysis). Recently, deep learning methods make many efforts in automatic analysis of medical images. Despite the remarkable progress, most of them underestimated the importance of 3D image information of disease, which might brings a limited performance for residual disease prediction, especially in small-scale datasets. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Multi-View Attention Learning (MuVAL) method for residual disease prediction, which focuses on the comprehensive learning of 3D Computed Tomography (CT) images in a multi-view manner. Specifically, we first obtain multi-view of 3D CT images from transverse, coronal and sagittal views. To better represent the image features in a multi-view manner, we further leverage attention mechanism to help find the more relevant slices in each view. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 111 patients show that our method outperforms existing deep-learning methods. ",

    "abstract": "Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is considered the in vivo reference standard for assessing infarct size (IS) and microvascular obstruction (MVO) in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. However, the exact quantification of those markers of myocardial infarct severity remains challenging and very time-consuming. As LGE distribution patterns can be quite complex and hard to delineate from the blood pool or epicardial fat, automatic segmentation of LGE CMR images is challenging. In this work, we propose a cascaded framework of two-dimensional and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which enables to calculate the extent of myocardial infarction in a fully automated way. By artificially generating segmentation errors which are characteristic for 2D CNNs during training of the cascaded framework we are enforcing the detection and correction of 2D segmentation errors and hence improve the segmentation accuracy of the entire method. The proposed method was trained and evaluated in a five-fold cross validation using the training dataset from the EMIDEC challenge. We perform comparative experiments where our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods of the EMIDEC challenge, as well as 2D and 3D nnU-Net. Furthermore, in extensive ablation studies we show the advantages that come with the proposed error correcting cascaded method. ",

    "abstract": "The accurate predictions and principled uncertainty measures provided by GP regression incur O(n^3) cost which is prohibitive for modern-day large-scale applications. This has motivated extensive work on computationally efficient approximations. We introduce a new perspective by exploring robustness properties and limiting behaviour of GP nearest-neighbour (GPnn) prediction. We demonstrate through theory and simulation that as the data-size n increases, accuracy of estimated parameters and GP model assumptions become increasingly irrelevant to GPnn predictive accuracy. Consequently, it is sufficient to spend small amounts of work on parameter estimation in order to achieve high MSE accuracy, even in the presence of gross misspecification. In contrast, as n tends to infinity, uncertainty calibration and NLL are shown to remain sensitive to just one parameter, the additive noise-variance; but we show that this source of inaccuracy can be corrected for, thereby achieving both well-calibrated uncertainty measures and accurate predictions at remarkably low computational cost. We exhibit a very simple GPnn regression algorithm with stand-out performance compared to other state-of-the-art GP approximations as measured on large UCI datasets. It operates at a small fraction of those other methods' training costs, for example on a basic laptop taking about 30 seconds to train on a dataset of size n = 1.6 x 10^6. ",

    "abstract": "People nowadays express their opinions in online spaces, using different forms of interactions such as posting, sharing and discussing with one another. These digital traces allow to capture how people dynamically react to the myriad of events occurring in the world. By unfolding the structure of Reddit conversations, we describe how highly engaging events happening in the society affect user interactions and behaviour with respect to unperturbed discussion patterns. Conversations, defined as a post and the comments underneath, are analysed along their temporal and semantic dimensions. We disclose that changes in the pace and language used in conversations exhibit notable similarities across diverse events. Conversations tend to become repetitive with a more limited vocabulary, display different semantic structures and feature heightened emotions. As the event approaches, the shifts occurring in conversations are reflected in the users' dynamics. Users become more active and they exchange information with a growing audience, despite using a less rich vocabulary and repetitive messages. The peers of each user fill up more semantic space, shifting the dialogue and widening the exchange of information. The recurring patterns we discovered are persistent across several contexts, thus represent a fingerprint of human behavior, which could impact the modeling of online social networks interactions. ",

State-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection algorithms are based on heavyweight neural networks, unsuitable for automating the diagnosis in the laboratory routine. We circumvent the problem by presenting a flyweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that weighs thousands of times less than SOTA object detectors. The kernels in our approach are learned layer-by-layer from attention regions indicated by user-drawn scribbles on very few training images. Representative kernels are visually identified and selected to improve performance with reduced computational cost. Another innovation is a single-layer adaptive decoder whose convolutional weights are automatically defined for each image on-the-fly. The experiments show that our CNN can outperform three SOTA baselines according to five measures, being also suitable for CPU execution in the laboratory routine, processing approximately four images a second for each available thread.

In such cases, we show that identifiability is achievable even in the case of regression, extending prior work restricted to the single-task classification case. Furthermore, we show that the existence of a task distribution which defines a conditional prior over latent variables reduces the equivalence class for identifiability to permutations and scaling, a much stronger and more useful result. When we further assume a causal structure over these tasks, our approach enables simple maximum marginal likelihood optimization together with downstream applicability to causal representation learning. Empirically, we validate that our model outperforms more general unsupervised models in recovering canonical representations for synthetic and real-world data. ",
