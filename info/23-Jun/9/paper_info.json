    "title": "Generalizable Low-Resource Activity Recognition with Diverse and  Discriminative Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) is a time series classification task that focuses on identifying the motion patterns from human sensor readings. Adequate data is essential but a major bottleneck for training a generalizable HAR model, which assists customization and optimization of online web applications. However, it is costly in time and economy to collect large-scale labeled data in reality, i.e., the low-resource challenge. Meanwhile, data collected from different persons have distribution shifts due to different living habits, body shapes, age groups, etc. The low-resource and distribution shift challenges are detrimental to HAR when applying the trained model to new unseen subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Diverse and Discriminative representation Learning (DDLearn) for generalizable low-resource HAR. DDLearn simultaneously considers diversity and discrimination learning. With the constructed self-supervised learning task, DDLearn enlarges the data diversity and explores the latent activity properties. Then, we propose a diversity preservation module to preserve the diversity of learned features by enlarging the distribution divergence between the original and augmented domains. Meanwhile, DDLearn also enhances semantic discrimination by learning discriminative representations with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on three public HAR datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-art methods by an average accuracy improvement of 9.5% under the low-resource distribution shift scenarios, while being a generic, explainable, and flexible framework.

To exploit the spatial information that the dense prediction tasks require but neglected by the existing self-supervised transformers, we introduce point-level supervision across views in a novel token-based way. Specifically, DenseDINO introduces some extra input tokens called reference tokens to match the point-level features with the position prior. With the reference token, the model could maintain spatial consistency and deal with multi-object complex scene images, thus generalizing better on dense prediction tasks. Compared with the vanilla DINO, our approach obtains competitive performance when evaluated on classification in ImageNet and achieves a large margin (+7.2% mIoU) improvement in semantic segmentation on PascalVOC under the linear probing protocol for segmentation.

    "title": "2D Object Detection with Transformers: A Review",
    "abstract": "Astounding performance of Transformers in natural language processing (NLP) has delighted researchers to explore their utilization in computer vision tasks. Like other computer vision tasks, DEtection TRansformer (DETR) introduces transformers for object detection tasks by considering the detection as a set prediction problem without needing proposal generation and post-processing steps. It is a state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for object detection, particularly in scenarios where the number of objects in an image is relatively small. Despite the success of DETR, it suffers from slow training convergence and performance drops for small objects. Therefore, many improvements are proposed to address these issues, leading to immense refinement in DETR. Since 2020, transformer-based object detection has attracted increasing interest and demonstrated impressive performance. Although numerous surveys have been conducted on transformers in vision in general, a review regarding advancements made in 2D object detection using transformers is still missing. This paper gives a detailed review of twenty-one papers about recent developments in DETR. We begin with the basic modules of Transformers, such as self-attention, object queries and input features encoding. Then, we cover the latest advancements in DETR, including backbone modification, query design and attention refinement. We also compare all detection transformers in terms of performance and network design. We hope this study will increase the researcher's interest in solving existing challenges towards applying transformers in the object detection domain. Researchers can follow newer improvements in detection transformers on this webpage available at: https://github.com/mindgarage-shan/trans_object_detection_survey ",

The first stage learns the templates, in the form of 3D Gaussian functions, across different scenes, without 3D supervision. In the reconstruction stage, our predicted templates serve as anchors to help ``stitch'' the surfaces over sparse regions. We demonstrate that our approach is not only able to complete the surface geometry but also reconstructs surface details to a reasonable extent from few disparate input views. On the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets, our approach achieves the best reconstruction quality among existing methods in the presence of such sparse views, and performs on par, if not better, with competing methods when dense views are employed as inputs.

Non-rigid registration, in particular, involves addressing challenges including various levels of deformation, noise, outliers, and data incompleteness. This paper introduces Robust-DefReg, a robust non-rigid point cloud registration method based on graph convolutional networks (GCNNs). Robust-DefReg is a coarse-to-fine registration approach within an end-to-end pipeline, leveraging the advantages of both coarse and fine methods. The method learns global features to find correspondences between source and target point clouds, to enable appropriate initial alignment, and subsequently fine registration. The simultaneous achievement of high accuracy and robustness across all challenges is reported less frequently in existing studies, making it a key objective of the Robust-DefReg method. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in large deformations while maintaining computational efficiency. This method possesses three primary attributes: high accuracy, robustness to different challenges, and computational efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed Robust-DefReg holds significant potential as a foundational architecture for future investigations in non-rigid point cloud registration.

    "abstract": "Symbolic regression (SR) is a powerful technique for discovering the analytical mathematical expression from data, finding various applications in natural sciences due to its good interpretability of results. However, existing methods face scalability issues when dealing with complex equations involving multiple variables. To address this challenge, we propose SRCV, a novel neural symbolic regression method that leverages control variables to enhance both accuracy and scalability. The core idea is to decompose multi-variable symbolic regression into a set of single-variable SR problems, which are then combined in a bottom-up manner. The proposed method involves a four-step process. First, we learn a data generator from observed data using deep neural networks (DNNs). Second, the data generator is used to generate samples for a certain variable by controlling the input variables. Thirdly, single-variable symbolic regression is applied to estimate the corresponding mathematical expression. Lastly, we repeat steps 2 and 3 by gradually adding variables one by one until completion. We evaluate the performance of our method on multiple benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SRCV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in discovering mathematical expressions with multiple variables. Moreover, it can substantially reduce the search space for symbolic regression. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication. ",

    "abstract": "Rapidly increasing quality of AI-generated content makes it difficult to distinguish between human and AI-generated texts, which may lead to undesirable consequences for society. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to study the properties of human texts that are invariant over text domains and various proficiency of human writers, can be easily calculated for any language, and can robustly separate natural and AI-generated texts regardless of the generation model and sampling method. In this work, we propose such an invariant of human texts, namely the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold underlying the set of embeddings of a given text sample. We show that the average intrinsic dimensionality of fluent texts in natural language is hovering around the value $9$ for several alphabet-based languages and around $7$ for Chinese, while the average intrinsic dimensionality of AI-generated texts for each language is $\\approx 1.5$ lower, with a clear statistical separation between human-generated and AI-generated distributions. This property allows us to build a score-based artificial text detector. The proposed detector's accuracy is stable over text domains, generator models, and human writer proficiency levels, outperforming SOTA detectors in model-agnostic and cross-domain scenarios by a significant margin.

    "abstract": "Natural Language to SQL systems (NL-to-SQL) have recently shown a significant increase in accuracy for natural language to SQL query translation. This improvement is due to the emergence of transformer-based language models, and the popularity of the Spider benchmark - the de-facto standard for evaluating NL-to-SQL systems. The top NL-to-SQL systems reach accuracies of up to 85\\%. However, Spider mainly contains simple databases with few tables, columns, and entries, which does not reflect a realistic setting. Moreover, complex real-world databases with domain-specific content have little to no training data available in the form of NL/SQL-pairs leading to poor performance of existing NL-to-SQL systems. In this paper, we introduce ScienceBenchmark, a new complex NL-to-SQL benchmark for three real-world, highly domain-specific databases. For this new benchmark, SQL experts and domain experts created high-quality NL/SQL-pairs for each domain. To garner more data, we extended the small amount of human-generated data with synthetic data generated using GPT-3. We show that our benchmark is highly challenging, as the top performing systems on Spider achieve a very low performance on our benchmark. Thus, the challenge is many-fold: creating NL-to-SQL systems for highly complex domains with a small amount of hand-made training data augmented with synthetic data. To our knowledge, ScienceBenchmark is the first NL-to-SQL benchmark designed with complex real-world scientific databases, containing challenging training and test data carefully validated by domain experts.

The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) has collected comprehensive longitudinal data from diverse patient cohorts to identify biomarkers and aid in the development of interventions. Despite over 110 machine learning studies using the PPMI database, the majority have focused on supervised models for diagnosis prediction, which has limited impact on understanding patient variability and progression. This paper addresses this gap by combining supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to identify subtypes that accurately predict disease progression in Parkinson's patients. Building upon previous work, we replicate and extend the study by integrating unsupervised patient clustering and prediction of present and future symptoms using 5 additional years of longitudinal data from the Progressive Parkinson's Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. Our findings demonstrate accurate prediction of disease trajectories and symptoms at baseline, offering valuable insights into patient heterogeneity and the potential for personalized interventions. The integration of supervised and unsupervised models presents a promising avenue for uncovering latent subgroups and understanding the complexity of Parkinson's disease progression. ",

However, for tabular datasets with extremely high $d$-dimensional features but limited $n$ samples (i.e. $d \\gg n$), machine learning models struggle to achieve strong performance due to the risk of overfitting. Here, our key insight is that there is often abundant, auxiliary domain information describing input features which can be structured as a heterogeneous knowledge graph (KG). We propose PLATO, a method that achieves strong performance on tabular data with $d \\gg n$ by using an auxiliary KG describing input features to regularize a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In PLATO, each input feature corresponds to a node in the auxiliary KG. In the MLP's first layer, each input feature also corresponds to a weight vector. PLATO is based on the inductive bias that two input features corresponding to similar nodes in the auxiliary KG should have similar weight vectors in the MLP's first layer. PLATO captures this inductive bias by inferring the weight vector for each input feature from its corresponding node in the KG via a trainable message-passing function. Across 6 $d \\gg n$ datasets, PLATO outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.19%. ",

Here, we propose correlative information maximization between layer activations as an alternative normative approach to describe the signal propagation in biological neural networks in both forward and backward directions. This new framework addresses many concerns about the biological-plausibility of conventional artificial neural networks and the backpropagation algorithm. The coordinate descent-based optimization of the corresponding objective, combined with the mean square error loss function for fitting labeled supervision data, gives rise to a neural network structure that emulates a more biologically realistic network of multi-compartment pyramidal neurons with dendritic processing and lateral inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, our approach provides a natural resolution to the weight symmetry problem between forward and backward signal propagation paths, a significant critique against the plausibility of the conventional backpropagation algorithm. This is achieved by leveraging two alternative, yet equivalent forms of the correlative mutual information objective. These alternatives intrinsically lead to forward and backward prediction networks without weight symmetry issues, providing a compelling solution to this long-standing challenge. ",

A key feature of Machine Learning approaches for KG completion is their ability to learn inference patterns, so that the predicted facts are the results of applying these patterns to the KG. Standard completion benchmarks, however, are not well-suited for evaluating models' abilities to learn patterns, because the training and test sets of these benchmarks are a random split of a given KG and hence do not capture the causality of inference patterns. We propose a novel approach for designing KG completion benchmarks based on the following principles: there is a set of logical rules so that the missing facts are the results of the rules' application; the training set includes both premises matching rule antecedents and the corresponding conclusions; the test set consists of the results of applying the rules to the training set; the negative examples are designed to discourage the models from learning rules not entailed by the rule set.

In such system, the agent is responsible for serving thousands of skills and interpretations which create a long-tail distribution due to the natural frequency of requests.

Moreover, inputs used for ML-based skill routing are often a heterogeneous mix of strings, embedding vectors, categorical and scalar features which makes employing augmentation-based long-tail learning approaches challenging. To improve the skill-routing robustness, we propose an augmentation of heterogeneous skill-routing data and training targeted for robust operation in long-tail data regimes. We explore a variety of conditional encoder-decoder generative frameworks to perturb original data fields and create synthetic training data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world data from a commercial conversational system.

In contrast, popular queries typically lack context and have a broad intent where additional context from users historical interaction can be helpful. In this paper, we share our novel approach to address both: the semantic gap problem followed by an end to end trained model for personalized semantic retrieval. We propose learning a unified embedding model incorporating graph, transformer and term-based embeddings end to end and share our design choices for optimal tradeoff between performance and efficiency. We share our learnings in feature engineering, hard negative sampling strategy, and application of transformer model, including a novel pre-training strategy and other tricks for improving search relevance and deploying such a model at industry scale. Our personalized retrieval model significantly improves the overall search experience, as measured by a 5.58% increase in search purchase rate and a 2.63% increase in site-wide conversion rate, aggregated across multiple A/B tests - on live traffic.

    "abstract": "Detection of artificial objects from underwater imagery gathered by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is a key requirement for many subsea applications. Real-world AUV image datasets tend to be very large and unlabelled. Furthermore, such datasets are typically imbalanced, containing few instances of objects of interest, particularly when searching for unusual objects in a scene. It is therefore, difficult to fit models capable of reliably detecting these objects. Given these factors, we propose to treat artificial objects as anomalies and detect them through a semi-supervised framework based on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We develop a method which clusters image data in a learned low-dimensional latent space and extracts images that are likely to contain anomalous features. We also devise an anomaly score based on extracting poorly reconstructed regions of an image. We demonstrate that by applying both methods on large image datasets, human operators can be shown candidate anomalous samples with a low false positive rate to identify objects of interest. We apply our approach to real seafloor imagery gathered by an AUV and evaluate its sensitivity to the dimensionality of the latent representation used by the VAE. We evaluate the precision-recall tradeoff and demonstrate that by choosing an appropriate latent dimensionality and threshold, we are able to achieve an average precision of 0.64 on unlabelled datasets.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have various practical applications, such as drug discovery, recommendation engines, and chip design. However, GNNs lack transparency as they cannot provide understandable explanations for their predictions. To address this issue, counterfactual reasoning is used. The main goal is to make minimal changes to the input graph of a GNN in order to alter its prediction. While several algorithms have been proposed for counterfactual explanations of GNNs, most of them have two main drawbacks. Firstly, they only consider edge deletions as perturbations. Secondly, the counterfactual explanation models are transductive, meaning they do not generalize to unseen data. In this study, we introduce an inductive algorithm called INDUCE, which overcomes these limitations. By conducting extensive experiments on several datasets, we demonstrate that incorporating edge additions leads to better counterfactual results compared to the existing methods. Moreover, the inductive modeling approach allows INDUCE to directly predict counterfactual perturbations without requiring instance-specific training. This results in significant computational speed improvements compared to baseline methods and enables scalable counterfactual analysis for GNNs. ",

However, existing works are limited in independent generation of each element, i.e., flow, in OD matrix, overlooking the element relations within the matrix that can be well formulated as a network. In this paper, we instead propose to generate the city-wide OD matrix from the network perspective, and design a graph denoising diffusion method to learn the conditional joint probability distribution of all elements in the OD matrix given city characteristics at region level. To overcome the learning difficulty of the city-wide OD matrix covering over thousands of regions, we decompose the original one-shot generative modeling of the diffusion model into two cascaded stages, corresponding to the generation of network topology and mobility flow, respectively. To further reproduce important network properties contained in city-wide OD matrices, we design an elaborated graph denoising network structure including a node property augmentation module and a graph transformer backbone. Empirical experiments on data collected in two large US cities have verified that our method can generate OD matrices for new cities with network statistics remarkably similar with the ground truth, further achieving superior outperformance over competitive baselines in terms of the generation realism.

Literature has seen an increasing need for NLP solutions for other languages. We, therefore, ask one natural question: whether state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods generalize to other languages. This paper investigates how to adapt SOTA adversarial attack algorithms in English to the Chinese language. Our experiments show that attack methods previously applied to English NLP can generate high-quality adversarial examples in Chinese when combined with proper text segmentation and linguistic constraints. In addition, we demonstrate that the generated adversarial examples can achieve high fluency and semantic consistency by focusing on the Chinese language's morphology and phonology, which in turn can be used to improve the adversarial robustness of Chinese NLP models.

In the first place, while users' perception of satisfactory service diverges widely, current networks are designed to be a \"universal fit,\" where they are generally over-engineered to deliver services appealing to all types of users. Also, current networks lack user-level data cognitive intelligence that would enable fast personalized network decisions and actions through automation. Thus, in this article, we propose the utilization of AI, big data analytics, and real-time non-intrusive user feedback in order to enable the personalization of wireless networks. Based on each user's actual QoS requirements and context, a multi-objective formulation enables the network to micro-manage and optimize the provided QoS and user satisfaction levels simultaneously. Moreover, in order to enable user feedback tracking and measurement, we propose a user satisfaction model based on the zone of tolerance concept. Furthermore, we propose a big-data-driven and AI-based personalization framework to integrate personalization into wireless networks. Finally, we implement a personalized network prototype to demonstrate the proposed personalization concept and its potential benefits through a case study. The case study shows how personalization can be realized to enable the efficient optimization of network resources such that certain requirement levels of user satisfaction and revenue in the form of saved resources are achieved.

To this end, adoption of the augmented Lagrangian method within the PECANN framework is paramount for learning the solution of PDEs without manually balancing the individual loss terms in the objective function used for determining the parameters of the neural network. Generally speaking, ALM combines the merits of the penalty and Lagrange multiplier methods while avoiding the ill conditioning and convergence issues associated singly with these methods . In the present work, we apply our PECANN framework to solve forward and inverse problems that have an expanded and diverse set of constraints. We show that ALM with its conventional formulation to update its penalty parameter and Lagrange multipliers stalls for such challenging problems. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive ALM in which each constraint is assigned a unique penalty parameter that evolve adaptively according to a rule inspired by the adaptive subgradient method. Additionally, we revise our PECANN formulation for improved computational efficiency and savings which allows for mini-batch training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach by solving several forward and PDE-constrained inverse problems with noisy data, including simulation of incompressible fluid flows with a primitive-variables formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations up to a Reynolds number of 1000.

Then, the closed-form expressions for coverage probability of HAP network and terrestrial network are derived based on differential geometry and stochastic geometry. We verify the accuracy of closed-form expressions by Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that HAP network has less interference to terrestrial network.

    "abstract": "Accurately detecting lane lines in 3D space is crucial for autonomous driving. Existing methods usually first transform image-view features into bird-eye-view (BEV) by aid of inverse perspective mapping (IPM), and then detect lane lines based on the BEV features. However, IPM ignores the changes in road height, leading to inaccurate view transformations. Additionally, the two separate stages of the process can cause cumulative errors and increased complexity. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient transformer for 3D lane detection. Different from the vanilla transformer, our model contains a decomposed cross-attention mechanism to simultaneously learn lane and BEV representations. The mechanism decomposes the cross-attention between image-view and BEV features into the one between image-view and lane features, and the one between lane and BEV features, both of which are supervised with ground-truth lane lines. Our method obtains 2D and 3D lane predictions by applying the lane features to the image-view and BEV features, respectively. This allows for a more accurate view transformation than IPM-based methods, as the view transformation is learned from data with a supervised cross-attention. Additionally, the cross-attention between lane and BEV features enables them to adjust to each other, resulting in more accurate lane detection than the two separate stages. Finally, the decomposed cross-attention is more efficient than the original one. Experimental results on OpenLane and ONCE-3DLanes demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. ",

Recent work shows that the long-tailed learning performance could be boosted by sampling extra in-domain (ID) data for self-supervised training, however, large-scale ID data which can rebalance the minority classes are expensive to collect. In this paper, we propose an alternative but easy-to-use and effective solution, Contrastive with Out-of-distribution (OOD) data for Long-Tail learning (COLT), which can effectively exploit OOD data to dynamically re-balance the feature space. We empirically identify the counter-intuitive usefulness of OOD samples in SSL long-tailed learning and principally design a novel SSL method. Concretely, we first localize the `head' and `tail' samples by assigning a tailness score to each OOD sample based on its neighborhoods in the feature space. Then, we propose an online OOD sampling strategy to dynamically re-balance the feature space. Finally, we enforce the model to be capable of distinguishing ID and OOD samples by a distribution-level supervised contrastive loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets and several state-of-the-art SSL frameworks to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that our method significantly improves the performance of SSL on long-tailed datasets by a large margin, and even outperforms previous work which uses external ID data.

For instance, in a scenario where a robot plans a trajectory around a pedestrian, this combined notion can now capture uncertainty of the pedestrian arriving earlier or later than anticipated. We first derive desirable properties of this new notion with respect to left and right time shifts and then design control laws for linear systems that maximize temporal robustness using mixed-integer linear programming.

    "abstract": "While deep learning models have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, they are susceptible to learning non-generalizable spurious features rather than the core features that are genuinely correlated to the true label. In this paper, beyond existing analyses of linear models, we theoretically examine the learning process of a two-layer nonlinear convolutional neural network in the presence of spurious features. Our analysis suggests that imbalanced data groups and easily learnable spurious features can lead to the dominance of spurious features during the learning process. In light of this, we propose a new training algorithm called PDE that efficiently enhances the model's robustness for a better worst-group performance. PDE begins with a group-balanced subset of training data and progressively expands it to facilitate the learning of the core features. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets confirm the superior performance of our method on models such as ResNets and Transformers. On average, our method achieves a 2.8% improvement in worst-group accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art method, while enjoying up to 10x faster training efficiency. ",

In light of these phenomena, here we introduce another, orthogonal perspective studying the human-machine vision gap. We revisit the task of recovering images under degradation, first introduced over 30 years ago in the Recognition-by-Components theory of human vision. Specifically, we study the performance and behavior of neural networks on the seemingly simple task of classifying regular polygons at varying orders of degradation along their perimeters. To this end, we implement the Automated Shape Recoverability Test for rapidly generating large-scale datasets of perimeter-degraded regular polygons, modernizing the historically manual creation of image recoverability experiments. We then investigate the capacity of neural networks to recognize and recover such degraded shapes when initialized with different priors. Ultimately, we find that neural networks' behavior on this simple task conflicts with human behavior, raising a fundamental question of the robustness and learning capabilities of modern computer vision models.

During the inference stage, these adaptation matrices are combined with the existing model to generate the final prediction output.

Its focus is on node clustering on temporal graphs, and it offers greater flexibility for large-scale graph structures due to the mechanism of temporal graph methods. However, the development of TGC is currently constrained by a significant problem: the lack of suitable and reliable large-scale temporal graph datasets to evaluate clustering performance. In other words, most existing temporal graph datasets are in small sizes, and even large-scale datasets contain only a limited number of available node labels. It makes evaluating models for large-scale temporal graph clustering challenging. To address this challenge, we build arXiv4TGC, a set of novel academic datasets (including arXivAI, arXivCS, arXivMath, arXivPhy, and arXivLarge) for large-scale temporal graph clustering. In particular, the largest dataset, arXivLarge, contains 1.3 million labeled available nodes and 10 million temporal edges. We further compare the clustering performance with typical temporal graph learning models on both previous classic temporal graph datasets and the new datasets proposed in this paper. The clustering performance on arXiv4TGC can be more apparent for evaluating different models, resulting in higher clustering confidence and more suitable for large-scale temporal graph clustering.

In these settings, conservative models -- models which can defer to human judgment when they are likely to make an error -- may offer a solution. However, detecting unusual or difficult examples is notably challenging, as it is impossible to anticipate all potential inputs at test time. To address this issue, prior work has proposed to minimize the model's confidence on an auxiliary pseudo-OOD dataset. We theoretically analyze the effect of confidence minimization and show that the choice of auxiliary dataset is critical. Specifically, if the auxiliary dataset includes samples from the OOD region of interest, confidence minimization provably separates ID and OOD inputs by predictive confidence. Taking inspiration from this result, we present data-driven confidence minimization (DCM), which minimizes confidence on an uncertainty dataset containing examples that the model is likely to misclassify at test time. Our experiments show that DCM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on 8 ID-OOD dataset pairs, reducing FPR (at TPR 95%) by 6.3% and 58.1% on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and outperforms existing selective classification approaches on 4 datasets in conditions of distribution shift.

    "abstract": "As a collaborative paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) empowers clients to engage in collective model training without exchanging their respective local data. Nevertheless, FL remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks in which an attacker compromises malicious clients, and injects poisoned model weights into the aggregation process to yield attacker-chosen predictions for particular samples. Existing countermeasures, mainly based on anomaly detection, may erroneously reject legitimate weights while accepting malicious ones, which is due to inadequacies in quantifying client model similarities. Other defense mechanisms prove effective exclusively when confronted with a restricted number of malicious clients, e.g., less than 10%. To address these vulnerabilities, we present G$^2$uardFL, a protective framework that reframes the detection of malicious clients as an attributed graph clustering problem, thereby safeguarding FL systems. This framework employs a client graph clustering technique to identify malicious clients and incorporates an adaptive method to amplify the disparity between the aggregated model and poisoned client models, thereby eliminating previously embedded backdoors. A theoretical analysis of convergence is also performed to demonstrate that the global model closely approximates the model untouched by any backdoor. Through empirical evaluation compared to cutting-edge defenses and against various backdoor attacks, our experimental results indicate that G$^2$uardFL considerably undermines the effectiveness of backdoor attacks while maintaining a negligible impact on the benign sample performance.

    "abstract": "Research has shown that deep networks tend to be overly optimistic about their predictions, leading to an underestimation of prediction errors. Due to the limited nature of data, existing studies have proposed various methods based on model prediction probabilities to bin the data and evaluate calibration error. We propose a more generalized definition of calibration error called Partitioned Calibration Error (PCE), revealing that the key difference among these calibration error metrics lies in how the data space is partitioned. We put forth an intuitive proposition that an accurate model should be calibrated across any partition, suggesting that the input space partitioning can extend beyond just the partitioning of prediction probabilities, and include partitions directly related to the input. Through semantic-related partitioning functions, we demonstrate that the relationship between model accuracy and calibration lies in the granularity of the partitioning function. This highlights the importance of partitioning criteria for training a calibrated and accurate model. To validate the aforementioned analysis, we propose a method that involves jointly learning a semantic aware grouping function based on deep model features and logits to partition the data space into subsets. Subsequently, a separate calibration function is learned for each subset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance improvements across multiple datasets and network architectures, thus highlighting the importance of the partitioning function for calibration.

We contribute to the existing literature by providing a flexible, generic CNN architecture, allowing for the inclusion of external features with varying dimensions. Additionally, we provide a feature selection and hyperparameter optimization framework utilizing Bayesian optimization. We integrate historical ambulance demand and external information such as weather, events, holidays, and time.

The deployment of neural networks to such dataflow architecture accelerators is usually hindered by the available on-chip memory as it is desirable to preload the weights of neural networks on-chip to maximise the system performance. To address this, networks are usually compressed before the deployment through methods such as pruning, quantization and tensor decomposition. In this paper, a framework for mapping CNNs onto FPGAs based on a novel tensor decomposition method called Mixed-TD is proposed.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel lightweight robust zero-cost proxy that considers the consistency across features, parameters, and gradients of both clean and perturbed images at the initialization state. Our approach facilitates an efficient and rapid search for neural architectures capable of learning generalizable features that exhibit robustness across diverse perturbations. The experimental results demonstrate that our proxy can rapidly and efficiently search for neural architectures that are consistently robust against various perturbations on multiple benchmark datasets and diverse search spaces, largely outperforming existing clean zero-shot NAS and robust NAS with reduced search cost.

In this paper, we present an accurate, lightweight, and adaptive log-based anomaly detection framework, referred to as SeaLog.

    "abstract": "As Transformer-based models have achieved impressive performance on various time series tasks, Long-Term Series Forecasting (LTSF) tasks have also received extensive attention in recent years. However, due to the inherent computational complexity and long sequences demanding of Transformer-based methods, its application on LTSF tasks still has two major issues that need to be further investigated: 1) Whether the sparse attention mechanism designed by these methods actually reduce the running time on real devices; 2) Whether these models need extra long input sequences to guarantee their performance? The answers given in this paper are negative. Therefore, to better copy with these two issues, we design a lightweight Period-Attention mechanism (Periodformer), which renovates the aggregation of long-term subseries via explicit periodicity and short-term subseries via built-in proximity. Meanwhile, a gating mechanism is embedded into Periodformer to regulate the influence of the attention module on the prediction results. Furthermore, to take full advantage of GPUs for fast hyperparameter optimization (e.g., finding the suitable input length), a Multi-GPU Asynchronous parallel algorithm based on Bayesian Optimization (MABO) is presented. MABO allocates a process to each GPU via a queue mechanism, and then creates multiple trials at a time for asynchronous parallel search, which greatly reduces the search time. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the prediction error of Periodformer reduced by 13% and 26% for multivariate and univariate forecasting, respectively. In addition, MABO reduces the average search time by 46% while finding better hyperparameters. As a conclusion, this paper indicates that LTSF may not need complex attention and extra long input sequences. The source code will be open source on Github. ",

While deep neural networks are gradually replacing all traditional automatic processing methods, they surprisingly do not guarantee such normalization-equivariance (scale + shift) property, which can be detrimental in many applications. To address this issue, we propose a methodology for adapting existing neural networks so that normalization-equivariance holds by design. Our main claim is that not only ordinary convolutional layers, but also all activation functions, including the ReLU (rectified linear unit), which are applied element-wise to the pre-activated neurons, should be completely removed from neural networks and replaced by better conditioned alternatives. To this end, we introduce affine-constrained convolutions and channel-wise sort pooling layers as surrogates and show that these two architectural modifications do preserve normalization-equivariance without loss of performance. Experimental results in image denoising show that normalization-equivariant neural networks, in addition to their better conditioning, also provide much better generalization across noise levels. ",

In contrast to the previous sample selection approach for the offline training that requires the estimation of a clean ratio of the dataset before each epoch of training, OGRS can automatically select clean samples by steps of gradient update from datasets with varying clean ratios without changing the parameter setting. During the training process, the OGRS method selects clean samples at each iteration and feeds the selected sample to incrementally update the model parameters. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis to demonstrate data selection process is converging to the low-loss region of the sample space, by introducing and proving the sub-linear local Lagrangian regret of the non-convex constrained optimization problem.

    "abstract": "This work studies how brain-inspired neural ensembles equipped with local Hebbian plasticity can perform active inference (AIF) in order to control dynamical agents. A generative model capturing the environment dynamics is learned by a network composed of two distinct Hebbian ensembles: a posterior network, which infers latent states given the observations, and a state transition network, which predicts the next expected latent state given current state-action pairs. Experimental studies are conducted using the Mountain Car environment from the OpenAI gym suite, to study the effect of the various Hebbian network parameters on the task performance. It is shown that the proposed Hebbian AIF approach outperforms the use of Q-learning, while not requiring any replay buffer, as in typical reinforcement learning systems. These results motivate further investigations of Hebbian learning for the design of AIF networks that can learn environment dynamics without the need for revisiting past buffered experiences. ",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are blockchain programs that often handle valuable assets. Writing secure smart contracts is far from trivial, and any vulnerability may lead to significant financial losses. To support developers in identifying and eliminating vulnerabilities, methods and tools for the automated analysis have been proposed. However, the lack of commonly accepted benchmark suites and performance metrics makes it difficult to compare and evaluate such tools. Moreover, the tools are heterogeneous in their interfaces and reports as well as their runtime requirements, and installing several tools is time-consuming. In this paper, we present SmartBugs 2.0, a modular execution framework. It provides a uniform interface to 19 tools aimed at smart contract analysis and accepts both Solidity source code and EVM bytecode as input. After describing its architecture, we highlight the features of the framework. We evaluate the framework via its reception by the community and illustrate its scalability by describing its role in a study involving 3.25 million analyses. ",

    "abstract": "Since the rise of fair machine learning as a critical field of inquiry, many different notions on how to quantify and measure discrimination have been proposed in the literature. Some of these notions, however, were shown to be mutually incompatible. Such findings make it appear that numerous different kinds of fairness exist, thereby making a consensus on the appropriate measure of fairness harder to reach, hindering the applications of these tools in practice. In this paper, we investigate one of these key impossibility results that relates the notions of statistical and predictive parity. Specifically, we derive a new causal decomposition formula for the fairness measures associated with predictive parity, and obtain a novel insight into how this criterion is related to statistical parity through the legal doctrines of disparate treatment, disparate impact, and the notion of business necessity. Our results show that through a more careful causal analysis, the notions of statistical and predictive parity are not really mutually exclusive, but complementary and spanning a spectrum of fairness notions through the concept of business necessity. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of our findings on a real-world example. ",

    "abstract": "As society transitions towards an AI-based decision-making infrastructure, an ever-increasing number of decisions once under control of humans are now delegated to automated systems. Even though such developments make various parts of society more efficient, a large body of evidence suggests that a great deal of care needs to be taken to make such automated decision-making systems fair and equitable, namely, taking into account sensitive attributes such as gender, race, and religion. In this paper, we study a specific decision-making task called outcome control in which an automated system aims to optimize an outcome variable $Y$ while being fair and equitable. The interest in such a setting ranges from interventions related to criminal justice and welfare, all the way to clinical decision-making and public health. In this paper, we first analyze through causal lenses the notion of benefit, which captures how much a specific individual would benefit from a positive decision, counterfactually speaking, when contrasted with an alternative, negative one. We introduce the notion of benefit fairness, which can be seen as the minimal fairness requirement in decision-making, and develop an algorithm for satisfying it. We then note that the benefit itself may be influenced by the protected attribute, and propose causal tools which can be used to analyze this. Finally, if some of the variations of the protected attribute in the benefit are considered as discriminatory, the notion of benefit fairness may need to be strengthened, which leads us to articulating a notion of causal benefit fairness. Using this notion, we develop a new optimization procedure capable of maximizing $Y$ while ascertaining causal fairness in the decision process. ",

    "abstract": "Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is an effective tuning method for adapting pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) to downstream tasks. It leverages extra learnable tokens, known as prompts, which steer the frozen pretrained ViTs. Although VPT has demonstrated its applicability with supervised vision transformers, it often underperforms with self-supervised ones. Through empirical observations, we deduce that the effectiveness of VPT hinges largely on the ViT blocks with which the prompt tokens interact. Specifically, VPT shows improved performance on image classification tasks for MAE and MoCo v3 when the prompt tokens are inserted into later blocks rather than the first block. These observations suggest that there exists an optimal location of blocks for the insertion of prompt tokens. Unfortunately, identifying the optimal blocks for prompts within each self-supervised ViT for diverse future scenarios is a costly process. To mitigate this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method that learns a gate for each ViT block to adjust its intervention into the prompt tokens. With our method, prompt tokens are selectively influenced by blocks that require steering for task adaptation. Our method outperforms VPT variants in FGVC and VTAB image classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/ryongithub/GatedPromptTuning. ",

It has been shown that an external language model, trained on additional target-side monolingual data, can help improve translation quality. However, there has always been the assumption that the translation model also learns an implicit target-side language model during training, which interferes with the external language model at decoding time. Recently, some works on automatic speech recognition have demonstrated that, if the implicit language model is neutralized in decoding, further improvements can be gained when integrating an external language model. In this work, we transfer this concept to the task of machine translation and compare with the most prominent way of including additional monolingual data - namely back-translation. We find that accounting for the implicit language model significantly boosts the performance of language model fusion, although this approach is still outperformed by back-translation. ",

Despite these improvements, the inability to incorporate the temporal dimension remains a significant limitation of these approaches. This is particularly problematic as identifying and addressing the root causes of undesired outcomes requires understanding time-dependent relationships between variables.

As models are being increasingly used, on devices, to automate tasks and power new applications, there have been concerns that such white-box access to its parameters, as opposed to the black-box setting which only provides query access to the model, increases the attack surface. Directly extending the shadow modelling technique from the black-box to the white-box setting has been shown, in general, not to perform better than black-box only attacks. A key reason is misalignment, a known characteristic of deep neural networks. We here present the first systematic analysis of the causes of misalignment in shadow models and show the use of a different weight initialisation to be the main cause of shadow model misalignment. Second, we extend several re-alignment techniques, previously developed in the model fusion literature, to the shadow modelling context, where the goal is to re-align the layers of a shadow model to those of the target model.We show re-alignment techniques to significantly reduce the measured misalignment between the target and shadow models. Finally, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of white-box membership inference attacks (MIA). Our analysis reveals that (1) MIAs suffer from misalignment between shadow models, but that (2) re-aligning the shadow models improves, sometimes significantly, MIA performance. On the CIFAR10 dataset with a false positive rate of 1\\%, white-box MIA using re-aligned shadow models improves the true positive rate by 4.5\\%.Taken together, our results highlight that on-device deployment increase the attack surface and that the newly available information can be used by an attacker.

Recently, Google proposed the Topics API framework as a privacy-friendly alternative for behavioural advertising. Using this approach, the browser builds a user profile based on navigation history, which advertisers can access. The Topics API has the possibility of becoming the new standard for behavioural advertising, thus it is necessary to fully understand its operation and find possible limitations. This paper evaluates the robustness of the Topics API to a re-identification attack where an attacker reconstructs the user profile by accumulating user's exposed topics over time to later re-identify the same user on a different website. Using real traffic traces and realistic population models, we find that the Topics API mitigates but cannot prevent re-identification to take place, as there is a sizeable chance that a user's profile is unique within a website's audience. Consequently, the probability of correct re-identification can reach 15-17%, considering a pool of 1,000 users. We offer the code and data we use in this work to stimulate further studies and the tuning of the Topic API parameters. ",

We first argue that the conventional loss form of continual learning which consists of single task-specific loss (for plasticity) and a regularizer (for stability) may not be ideal for contrastive loss based CSSL that focus on representation learning. Our reasoning is that, in contrastive learning based methods, the task-specific loss would suffer from decreasing diversity of negative samples and the regularizer may hinder learning new distinctive representations. To that end, we propose Sy-CON that consists of two losses (one for plasticity and the other for stability) with symmetric dependence on current and past models' negative sample embeddings. We argue our model can naturally find good trade-off between the plasticity and stability without any explicit hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating that MoCo-based implementation of Sy-CON loss achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art CSSL methods.

Therefore, there is a need for a unified modelling of higher-order graphs, and a collection of comprehensive datasets with an accessible evaluation framework to fully understand the performance of these algorithms on complex graphs.

The task of automatically detecting sponsored content aims to enable the monitoring and enforcement of such regulations at scale. Current research in this field primarily frames this problem as a machine learning task, focusing on developing models that achieve high classification performance in detecting ads. These machine learning tasks rely on human data annotation to provide ground truth information. However, agreement between annotators is often low, leading to inconsistent labels that hinder the reliability of models. To improve annotation accuracy and, thus, the detection of sponsored content, we propose using chatGPT to augment the annotation process with phrases identified as relevant features and brief explanations. Our experiments show that this approach consistently improves inter-annotator agreement and annotation accuracy. Additionally, our survey of user experience in the annotation task indicates that the explanations improve the annotators' confidence and streamline the process.

In this work, we aim to answer the question how to best utilize a context-aware translation model in decoding. We start with the most popular document-level NMT approach and compare different decoding schemes, some from the literature and others proposed by us. In the comparison, we are using both, standard automatic metrics, as well as specific linguistic phenomena on three standard document-level translation benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Understanding the characteristics of neural networks is important but difficult due to their complex structures and behaviors. Some previous work proposes to transform neural networks into equivalent Boolean expressions and apply verification techniques for characteristics of interest. This approach is promising since rich results of verification techniques for circuits and other Boolean expressions can be readily applied. The bottleneck is the time complexity of the transformation. More precisely, (i) each neuron of the network, i.e., a linear threshold function, is converted to a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD), and (ii) they are further combined into some final form, such as Boolean circuits. For a linear threshold function with $n$ variables, an existing method takes $O(n2^{\\frac{n}{2}})$ time to construct an ordered BDD of size $O(2^{\\frac{n}{2}})$ consistent with some variable ordering. However, it is non-trivial to choose a variable ordering producing a small BDD among $n!$ candidates. We propose a method to convert a linear threshold function to a specific form of a BDD based on the boosting approach in the machine learning literature. Our method takes $O(2^n \\text{poly}(1/\\rho))$ time and outputs BDD of size $O(\\frac{n^2}{\\rho^4}\\ln{\\frac{1}{\\rho}})$, where $\\rho$ is the margin of some consistent linear threshold function. Our method does not need to search for good variable orderings and produces a smaller expression when the margin of the linear threshold function is large. More precisely, our method is based on our new boosting algorithm, which is of independent interest. We also propose a method to combine them into the final Boolean expression representing the neural network. ",

    "abstract": "Binary neural networks (BNNs) have shown an immense promise for resource-constrained edge artificial intelligence (AI) platforms as their binarized weights and inputs can significantly reduce the compute, storage and communication costs. Several works have explored XNOR-based BNNs using SRAMs and nonvolatile memories (NVMs). However, these designs typically need two bit-cells to encode signed weights leading to an area overhead. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a compact and low power in-memory computing (IMC) of XNOR-based dot products featuring signed weight encoding in a single bit-cell. Our approach utilizes valley-spin Hall (VSH) effect in monolayer tungsten di-selenide to design an XNOR bit-cell (named 'XNOR-VSH') with differential storage and access-transistor-less topology. We co-optimize the proposed VSH device and a memory array to enable robust in-memory dot product computations between signed binary inputs and signed binary weights with sense margin (SM) > 1 micro-amps. Our results show that the proposed XNOR-VSH array achieves 4.8% ~ 9.0% and 37% ~ 63% lower IMC latency and energy, respectively, with 4 % ~ 64% smaller area compared to spin-transfer-torque (STT)-MRAM and spin-orbit-torque (SOT)-MRAM based XNOR-arrays.

    "abstract": "Transfer-based attack adopts the adversarial examples generated on the surrogate model to attack various models, making it applicable in the physical world and attracting increasing interest. Recently, various adversarial attacks have emerged to boost adversarial transferability from different perspectives. In this work, inspired by the fact that flat local minima are correlated with good generalization, we assume and empirically validate that adversarial examples at a flat local region tend to have good transferability by introducing a penalized gradient norm to the original loss function. Since directly optimizing the gradient regularization norm is computationally expensive and intractable for generating adversarial examples, we propose an approximation optimization method to simplify the gradient update of the objective function. Specifically, we randomly sample an example and adopt the first-order gradient to approximate the second-order Hessian matrix, which makes computing more efficient by interpolating two Jacobian matrices. Meanwhile, in order to obtain a more stable gradient direction, we randomly sample multiple examples and average the gradients of these examples to reduce the variance due to random sampling during the iterative process. Extensive experimental results on the ImageNet-compatible dataset show that the proposed method can generate adversarial examples at flat local regions, and significantly improve the adversarial transferability on either normally trained models or adversarially trained models than the state-of-the-art attacks.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised person re-identification has achieved great success through the self-improvement of individual neural networks. However, limited by the lack of diversity of discriminant information, a single network has difficulty learning sufficient discrimination ability by itself under unsupervised conditions. To address this limit, we develop a population-based evolutionary gaming (PEG) framework in which a population of diverse neural networks is trained concurrently through selection, reproduction, mutation, and population mutual learning iteratively. Specifically, the selection of networks to preserve is modeled as a cooperative game and solved by the best-response dynamics, then the reproduction and mutation are implemented by cloning and fluctuating hyper-parameters of networks to learn more diversity, and population mutual learning improves the discrimination of networks by knowledge distillation from each other within the population. In addition, we propose a cross-reference scatter (CRS) to approximately evaluate re-ID models without labeled samples and adopt it as the criterion of network selection in PEG. CRS measures a model's performance by indirectly estimating the accuracy of its predicted pseudo-labels according to the cohesion and separation of the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (1) CRS approximately measures the performance of models without labeled samples; (2) and PEG produces new state-of-the-art accuracy for person re-identification, indicating the great potential of population-based network cooperative training for unsupervised learning.

    "abstract": "Considering the balance of performance and efficiency, sampled point and voxel methods are usually employed to down-sample dense events into sparse ones. After that, one popular way is to leverage a graph model which treats the sparse points/voxels as nodes and adopts graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the representation for event data. Although good performance can be obtained, however, their results are still limited mainly due to two issues. (1) Existing event GNNs generally adopt the additional max (or mean) pooling layer to summarize all node embeddings into a single graph-level representation for the whole event data representation. However, this approach fails to capture the importance of graph nodes and also fails to be fully aware of the node representations. (2) Existing methods generally employ either a sparse point or voxel graph representation model which thus lacks consideration of the complementary between these two types of representation models. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel dual point-voxel absorbing graph representation learning for event stream data representation. To be specific, given the input event stream, we first transform it into the sparse event cloud and voxel grids and build dual absorbing graph models for them respectively. Then, we design a novel absorbing graph convolutional network (AGCN) for our dual absorbing graph representation and learning. The key aspect of the proposed AGCN is its ability to effectively capture the importance of nodes and thus be fully aware of node representations in summarizing all node representations through the introduced absorbing nodes. Finally, the event representations of dual learning branches are concatenated together to extract the complementary information of two cues. The output is then fed into a linear layer for event data classification. ",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of short video platforms has spawned a lot of fake news videos, which have stronger propagation ability than textual fake news. Thus, automatically detecting fake news videos has been an important countermeasure in practice. Previous works commonly verify each news video individually with multimodal information. Nevertheless, news videos from different perspectives regarding the same event are commonly posted together, which contain complementary or contradictory information and thus can be used to evaluate each other mutually. To this end, we introduce a new and practical paradigm, i.e., cross-sample fake news video detection, and propose a novel framework, Neighbor-Enhanced fakE news video Detection (NEED), which integrates the neighborhood relationship of new videos belonging to the same event. NEED can be readily combined with existing single-sample detectors and further enhance their performances with the proposed graph aggregation (GA) and debunking rectification (DR) modules. Specifically, given the feature representations obtained from single-sample detectors, GA aggregates the neighborhood information with the dynamic graph to enrich the features of independent samples. After that, DR explicitly leverages the relationship between debunking videos and fake news videos to refute the candidate videos via textual and visual consistency. Extensive experiments on the public benchmark demonstrate that NEED greatly improves the performance of both single-modal (up to 8.34% in accuracy) and multimodal (up to 4.97% in accuracy) base detectors.

However, the overfitting to simulated impacts and the lack of generalizability caused by distributional shift of different head impact datasets hinders the broad clinical applications of current MLHMs. We propose brain deformation estimators that integrates unsupervised domain adaptation with a deep neural network to predict whole-brain maximum principal strain (MPS) and MPS rate (MPSR). With 12,780 simulated head impacts, we performed unsupervised domain adaptation on on-field head impacts from 302 college football (CF) impacts and 457 mixed martial arts (MMA) impacts using domain regularized component analysis (DRCA) and cycle-GAN-based methods. The new model improved the MPS/MPSR estimation accuracy, with the DRCA method significantly outperforming other domain adaptation methods in prediction accuracy (p<0.001): MPS RMSE: 0.027 (CF) and 0.037 (MMA); MPSR RMSE: 7.159 (CF) and 13.022 (MMA). On another two hold-out test sets with 195 college football impacts and 260 boxing impacts, the DRCA model significantly outperformed the baseline model without domain adaptation in MPS and MPSR estimation accuracy (p<0.001). The DRCA domain adaptation reduces the MPS/MPSR estimation error to be well below TBI thresholds, enabling accurate brain deformation estimation to detect TBI in future clinical applications. ",

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can generate realistic images from any viewpoint. It simultaneously reconstructs the shape, lighting, and materials of objects, and without surface defects, which breaks down the barrier between virtuality and reality. The potential spatial correspondences displayed by NeRF between reconstructed scenes and real-world scenes offer a wide range of practical applications possibilities. Despite significant progress in 3D reconstruction since NeRF were introduced, there remains considerable room for exploration and experimentation. NeRF-based models are susceptible to interference issues caused by colored \"fog\" noise. Additionally, they frequently encounter instabilities and failures while attempting to reconstruct unbounded scenes. Moreover, the model takes a significant amount of time to converge, making it even more challenging to use in such scenarios. Our approach, coined Enhance-NeRF, which adopts joint color to balance low and high reflectivity objects display, utilizes a decoding architecture with prior knowledge to improve recognition, and employs multi-layer performance evaluation mechanisms to enhance learning capacity. It achieves reconstruction of outdoor scenes within one hour under single-card condition. Based on experimental results, Enhance-NeRF partially enhances fitness capability and provides some support to outdoor scene reconstruction.

However, high-fidelity multi-scale cardiac models remain a barrier to adoption due to their extensive computational costs and the high number of model evaluations needed for patient-specific personalization. Artificial Intelligence-based methods can make the creation of fast and accurate whole-heart digital twins feasible. In this work, we use Latent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (LNODEs) to learn the temporal pressure-volume dynamics of a heart failure patient. Our surrogate model based on LNODEs is trained from 400 3D-0D whole-heart closed-loop electromechanical simulations while accounting for 43 model parameters, describing single cell through to whole organ and cardiovascular hemodynamics. The trained LNODEs provides a compact and efficient representation of the 3D-0D model in a latent space by means of a feedforward fully-connected Artificial Neural Network that retains 3 hidden layers with 13 neurons per layer and allows for 300x real-time numerical simulations of the cardiac function on a single processor of a standard laptop. This surrogate model is employed to perform global sensitivity analysis and robust parameter estimation with uncertainty quantification in 3 hours of computations, still on a single processor. We match pressure and volume time traces unseen by the LNODEs during the training phase and we calibrate 4 to 11 model parameters while also providing their posterior distribution.

    "abstract": "Crystal property prediction is a crucial aspect of developing novel materials. However, there are two technical challenges to be addressed for speeding up the investigation of crystals. First, labeling crystal properties is intrinsically difficult due to the high cost and time involved in physical simulations or lab experiments. Second, crystals adhere to a specific quantum chemical principle known as periodic invariance, which is often not captured by existing machine learning methods. To overcome these challenges, we propose the crystal-specific pre-training framework for learning crystal representations with self-supervision. The framework designs a mutex mask strategy for enhancing representation learning so as to alleviate the limited labels available for crystal property prediction. Moreover, we take into account the specific periodic invariance in crystal structures by developing a periodic invariance multi-graph module and periodic attribute learning within our framework. This framework has been tested on eight different tasks. The experimental results on these tasks show that the framework achieves promising prediction performance and is able to outperform recent strong baselines. ",

    "abstract": "There are increasing concerns about malicious attacks on autonomous vehicles. In particular, inaudible voice command attacks pose a significant threat as voice commands become available in autonomous driving systems. How to empirically defend against these inaudible attacks remains an open question. Previous research investigates utilizing deep learning-based multimodal fusion for defense, without considering the model uncertainty in trustworthiness. As deep learning has been applied to increasingly sensitive tasks, uncertainty measurement is crucial in helping improve model robustness, especially in mission-critical scenarios. In this paper, we propose the Multimodal Fusion Framework (MFF) as an intelligent security system to defend against inaudible voice command attacks. MFF fuses heterogeneous audio-vision modalities using VGG family neural networks and achieves the detection accuracy of 92.25% in the comparative fusion method empirical study. Additionally, extensive experiments on audio-vision tasks reveal the model's uncertainty. Using Expected Calibration Errors, we measure calibration errors and Monte-Carlo Dropout to estimate the predictive distribution for the proposed models. Our findings show empirically to train robust multimodal models, improve standard accuracy and provide a further step toward interpretability. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of our approach and its applicability for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. ",

In conflict zones where freedom of expression is constrained and information warfare is pervasive, social media has emerged as an indispensable lifeline. Anonymous social media platforms, as publicly available sources for disseminating war-related information, have the potential to serve as effective instruments for monitoring and documenting Human Rights Violations (HRV). Our research focuses on the analysis of data from Telegram, the leading social media platform for reading independent news in post-Soviet regions. We gathered a dataset of posts sampled from 95 public Telegram channels that cover politics and war news, which we have utilized to identify potential occurrences of HRV. Employing a mBERT-based text classifier, we have conducted an analysis to detect any mentions of HRV in the Telegram data. Our final approach yielded an $F_2$ score of 0.71 for HRV detection, representing an improvement of 0.38 over the multilingual BERT base model. We release two datasets that contains Telegram posts: (1) large corpus with over 2.3 millions posts and (2) annotated at the sentence-level dataset to indicate HRVs. The Telegram posts are in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. We posit that our findings hold significant implications for NGOs, governments, and researchers by providing a means to detect and document possible human rights violations. ",

In the FSL framework, the full learning model at the server side is divided into multiple submodels such that each selected client needs to download only the required submodel(s) and upload the corresponding update(s) in accordance with its local training data. The server comprises multiple independent databases and the full model is stored across these databases. An eavesdropper passively observes all the storage and listens to all the communicated data, of its controlled databases, to gain knowledge about the remote client data and the submodel information. In addition, a subset of databases may fail, negatively affecting the FSL process, as FSL process may take a non-negligible amount of time for large models. To resolve these two issues together (i.e., security and database repair), we propose a novel coding mechanism coined ramp secure regenerating coding (RSRC), to store the full model in a distributed manner. Using our new RSRC method, the eavesdropper is permitted to learn a controllable amount of submodel information for the sake of reducing the communication and storage costs. Further, during the database repair process, in the construction of the replacement database, the submodels to be updated are stored in the form of their latest version from updating clients, while the remaining submodels are obtained from the previous version in other databases through routing clients. Our new RSRC-based distributed FSL approach is constructed on top of our earlier two-database FSL scheme which uses private set union (PSU). A complete one-round FSL process consists of FSL-PSU phase, FSL-write phase and additional auxiliary phases. Our proposed FSL scheme is also robust against database drop-outs, client drop-outs, client late-arrivals and an active adversary controlling databases. ",

We introduce SNAP, a deep network that learns rich neural 2D maps from ground-level and overhead images. We train our model to align neural maps estimated from different inputs, supervised only with camera poses over tens of millions of StreetView images. SNAP can resolve the location of challenging image queries beyond the reach of traditional methods, outperforming the state of the art in localization by a large margin. Moreover, our neural maps encode not only geometry and appearance but also high-level semantics, discovered without explicit supervision. This enables effective pre-training for data-efficient semantic scene understanding, with the potential to unlock cost-efficient creation of more detailed maps. ",

Finally, we train an LBA-Learner with object-centric local BA to generalize the generated 3D pseudo labels to moving objects. Experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset show that the performance of BA$^2$-Det is on par with the fully-supervised BA-Det trained with 10% videos and even outperforms some pioneer fully-supervised methods.

Multiscale Flow uses hierarchical decomposition of cosmological fields via a wavelet basis, and then models different wavelet components separately as Normalizing Flows. The log-likelihood of the original cosmological field can be recovered by summing over the log-likelihood of each wavelet term. This decomposition allows us to separate the information from different scales and identify distribution shifts in the data such as unknown scale-dependent systematics. The resulting likelihood analysis can not only identify these types of systematics, but can also be made optimal, in the sense that the Multiscale Flow can learn the full likelihood at the field without any dimensionality reduction. We apply Multiscale Flow to weak lensing mock datasets for cosmological inference, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional summary statistics such as power spectrum and peak counts, as well as novel Machine Learning based summary statistics such as scattering transform and convolutional neural networks. We further show that Multiscale Flow is able to identify distribution shifts not in the training data such as baryonic effects.

In most scenarios, CSS researchers first obtain labels for documents and then explain labels using interpretable regression analyses in the second step. The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) can lower costs for CSS research by annotating documents cheaply at scale, but such surrogate labels are often imperfect and biased. We present a new algorithm for using outputs from LLMs for downstream statistical analyses while guaranteeing statistical properties -- like asymptotic unbiasedness and proper uncertainty quantification -- which are fundamental to CSS research. We show that direct use of LLM-predicted surrogate labels in downstream statistical analyses leads to substantial bias and invalid confidence intervals, even with high surrogate accuracy of 80--90\\%. To address this, we build on debiased machine learning to propose the design-based semi-supervised learning (DSL) estimator. DSL employs a doubly-robust procedure to combine surrogate labels with a smaller number of gold-standard labels. Our approach guarantees valid inference for downstream statistical analyses, even when surrogates are arbitrarily biased, without requiring stringent assumptions, by controlling the probability of sampling documents for gold-standard labeling. Both our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that DSL provides valid statistical inference while achieving root mean squared errors comparable to existing alternatives that focus only on prediction without statistical guarantees.

Due to the fact that a single WSI consists of billions of pixels and there is a lack of vast annotated datasets required for computational pathology, the problem of learning from WSIs using typical deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural network (CNN) is challenging. Additionally, WSIs down-sampling may lead to the loss of data that is essential for cancer detection. A novel two-stage learning technique is presented in this work. Since context, such as topological features in the tumor surroundings, may hold important information for cancer grading and diagnosis, a graph representation capturing all dependencies among regions in the WSI is very intuitive. Graph convolutional network (GCN) is deployed to include context from the tumor and adjacent tissues, and self-supervised learning is used to enhance training through unlabeled data. More specifically, the entire slide is presented as a graph, where the nodes correspond to the patches from the WSI. The proposed framework is then tested using WSIs from prostate and kidney cancers. To assess the performance improvement through self-supervised mechanism, the proposed context-aware model is tested with and without use of pre-trained self-supervised layer. The overall model is also compared with multi-instance learning (MIL) based and other existing approaches. ",

    "abstract": "The recent progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has boosted the computational possibilities in fields where standard computers are not able to perform. The AI paradigm is to emulate human intelligence and therefore breaks the familiar architecture on which digital computers are based. In particular, neuromorphic computing, artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep learning models mimic how the brain computes. Large networks of interconnected neurons whose synapsis are individually strengthened or weakened during the learning phase find many applications. With this respect, photonics is a suitable platform to implement ANN hardware thanks to its speed, low power dissipation and multi-wavelength opportunities. One photonic device candidate to perform as an optical neuron is the optical microring resonator. Indeed microring resonators show both a nonlinear response and a capability of optical energy storage, which can be interpreted as a fading memory. Moreover, by using silicon photonics, the photonic integrated circuits can be fabricated in volume and with integrated electronics on board. For these reasons, here, we describe the physics of silicon microring resonators and of arrays of microring resonators for application in neuromorphic computing. We describe different types of ANNs from feed-forward networks to photonics extreme learning machines and reservoir computing. In addition, we discuss also hybrid systems where silicon microresonators are coupled to other active materials. this review aims to introduce the basics and to discuss the most recent developments in the field.

Existing techniques, however, encounter limitations that restrict their applicability to real-world systems, like reliance on orthogonality assumptions, inadequate incorporation of inter- and intra-state variability, and incapability to handle sessions of varying duration. Here, we present a framework for Similarity-driven Building Block Inference using Graphs across States (SiBBlInGS). SiBBlInGS employs a graph-based dictionary learning approach for BB discovery, simultaneously considers both inter- and intra-state relationships in the data, can extract non-orthogonal components, and allows for variations in session counts and duration across states. Additionally, SiBBlInGS allows for cross-state variations in BB structure and per-trial temporal variability, can identify state-specific vs state-invariant BBs, and offers both supervised and data-driven approaches for controlling the level of BB similarity between states. We demonstrate SiBBlInGS on synthetic and real-world data to highlight its ability to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex phenomena and its applicability to data in various fields.

Recently, various deep learning-based models predict binding affinity by incorporating the three-dimensional structure of protein-ligand complexes as input and achieving astounding progress. However, due to the scarcity of high-quality training data, the generalization ability of current models is still limited. In addition, different bioassays use varying affinity measurement labels (i.e., IC50, Ki, Kd), and different experimental conditions inevitably introduce systematic noise, which poses a significant challenge to constructing high-precision affinity prediction models. To address these issues, we (1) propose Multi-task Bioassay Pre-training (MBP), a pre-training framework for structure-based PLBA prediction; (2) construct a pre-training dataset called ChEMBL-Dock with more than 300k experimentally measured affinity labels and about 2.8M docked three-dimensional structures. By introducing multi-task pre-training to treat the prediction of different affinity labels as different tasks and classifying relative rankings between samples from the same bioassay, MBP learns robust and transferrable structural knowledge from our new ChEMBL-Dock dataset with varied and noisy labels. Experiments substantiate the capability of MBP as a general framework that can improve and be tailored to mainstream structure-based PLBA prediction tasks. To the best of our knowledge, MBP is the first affinity pre-training model and shows great potential for future development. ",

    "abstract": "The solution of probabilistic inverse problems for which the corresponding forward problem is constrained by physical principles is challenging. This is especially true if the dimension of the inferred vector is large and the prior information about it is in the form of a collection of samples. In this work, a novel deep learning based approach is developed and applied to solving these types of problems. The approach utilizes samples of the inferred vector drawn from the prior distribution and a physics-based forward model to generate training data for a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network (cWGAN). The cWGAN learns the probability distribution for the inferred vector conditioned on the measurement and produces samples from this distribution. The cWGAN developed in this work differs from earlier versions in that its critic is required to be 1-Lipschitz with respect to both the inferred and the measurement vectors and not just the former. This leads to a loss term with the full (and not partial) gradient penalty. It is shown that this rather simple change leads to a stronger notion of convergence for the conditional density learned by the cWGAN and a more robust and accurate sampling strategy. Through numerical examples it is shown that this change also translates to better accuracy when solving inverse problems. The numerical examples considered include illustrative problems where the true distribution and/or statistics are known, and a more complex inverse problem motivated by applications in biomechanics.

This paper introduces a novel pre-training framework that cascades sequential and geometric analyzers for protein primary and tertiary structures. It guides mutational directions toward desired traits by simulating natural selection on wild-type proteins and evaluates the effects of variants based on their fitness to perform the function. We assess the proposed approach using a public database and two new databases for a variety of variant effect prediction tasks, which encompass a diverse set of proteins and assays from different taxa.

As a consequence, it follows that any proper $k$-colouring of a cycle that uses at most $k-3$ distinct colours is safe.

    "abstract": "Efficiently sampling from un-normalized target distributions is a fundamental problem in scientific computing and machine learning. Traditional approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) guarantee asymptotically unbiased samples from such distributions but suffer from computational inefficiency, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional targets, as they require numerous iterations to generate a batch of samples. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable neural implicit sampler that overcomes these limitations. Our sampler can generate large batches of samples with low computational costs by leveraging a neural transformation that directly maps easily sampled latent vectors to target samples without the need for iterative procedures. To train the neural implicit sampler, we introduce two novel methods: the KL training method and the Fisher training method. The former minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence, while the latter minimizes the Fisher divergence. By employing these training methods, we effectively optimize the neural implicit sampler to capture the desired target distribution. To demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our proposed samplers, we evaluate them on three sampling benchmarks with different scales. These benchmarks include sampling from 2D targets, Bayesian inference, and sampling from high-dimensional energy-based models (EBMs). Notably, in the experiment involving high-dimensional EBMs, our sampler produces samples that are comparable to those generated by MCMC-based methods while being more than 100 times more efficient, showcasing the efficiency of our neural sampler. We believe that the theoretical and empirical contributions presented in this work will stimulate further research on developing efficient samplers for various applications beyond the ones explored in this study.

In statistics and machine learning, significant efforts have been put into developing machinery to estimate correlations across variables efficiently. In causal inference, a large body of literature is concerned with the decomposition of causal effects under the rubric of mediation analysis. However, many variations are spurious in nature, including different phenomena throughout the applied sciences. Despite the statistical power to estimate correlations and the identification power to decompose causal effects, there is still little understanding of the properties of spurious associations and how they can be decomposed in terms of the underlying causal mechanisms. In this manuscript, we develop formal tools for decomposing spurious variations in both Markovian and Semi-Markovian models. We prove the first results that allow a non-parametric decomposition of spurious effects and provide sufficient conditions for the identification of such decompositions. The described approach has several applications, ranging from explainable and fair AI to questions in epidemiology and medicine, and we empirically demonstrate its use on a real-world dataset. ",

To address challenges posed by nonlinear and unknown distortion in received signals, two learning-based detection methods, referred to as model-driven and data-driven, are presented. The model-driven method employs a generalized Gaussian distortion model to approximate the conditional distribution of the distorted received signal. By using the outputs of coarse data detection as noisy training data, the model-driven method avoids the need for additional training overhead beyond traditional pilot overhead for channel estimation. An expectation-maximization algorithm is devised to accurately learn the parameters of the distortion model from noisy training data. To resolve a model mismatch problem in the model-driven method, the data-driven method employs a deep neural network (DNN) for approximating a-posteriori probabilities for each received signal. This method uses the outputs of the model-driven method as noisy labels and therefore does not require extra training overhead. To avoid the overfitting problem caused by noisy labels, a robust DNN training algorithm is devised, which involves a warm-up period, sample selection, and loss correction. Simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed methods outperform existing solutions with the same overhead under various hardware impairment scenarios. ",

The inverse problem is a discrete version of the boundary rigidity problem in Riemannian geometry or the inverse travel time problem in geophysics. We will show that this problem has unique solution under certain conditions and develop quantum computing methods to solve it. We prove the following uniqueness result: when $(X,E)$ is a tree and $B$ is the set of leaves of the tree, the graph $(X,E)$ can be uniquely determined in the class of all graphs having a fixed number of vertices. We present a quantum computing algorithm which produces a graph $(X,E)$, or one of those, which has a given number of vertices and the required distances between vertices in $B$. To this end we develop an algorithm that takes in a qubit representation of a graph and combine it with Grover's search algorithm. The algorithm can be implemented using only $O(|X|^2)$ qubits, the same order as the number of elements in the adjacency matrix of $(X,E)$. It also has a quadratic improvement in computational cost compared to standard classical algorithms. Finally, we consider applications in theory of computation, and show that a slight modification of the above inverse problem is NP-complete: all NP-problems can be reduced to a discrete inverse problem we consider.

    "abstract": "We provide an algorithm to compute an effective description of the homology of complex projective hypersurfaces relying on Picard-Lefschetz theory. Next, we use this description to compute high-precision numerical approximations of the periods of the hypersurface. This is an improvement over existing algorithms as this new method allows for the computation of periods of smooth quartic surfaces in an hour on a laptop, which could not be attained with previous methods. The general theory presented in this paper can be generalised to varieties other than just hypersurfaces, such as elliptic fibrations as showcased on an example coming from Feynman graphs. Our algorithm comes with a SageMath implementation. ",

    "title": "Fault Identification of Rotating Machinery Based on Dynamic Feature  Reconstruction Signal Graph",
    "abstract": "To improve the performance in identifying the faults under strong noise for rotating machinery, this paper presents a dynamic feature reconstruction signal graph method, which plays the key role of the proposed end-to-end fault diagnosis model. Specifically, the original mechanical signal is first decomposed by wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) to obtain multiple subbands including coefficient matrix. Then, with originally defined two feature extraction factors MDD and DDD, a dynamic feature selection method based on L2 energy norm (DFSL) is proposed, which can dynamically select the feature coefficient matrix of WPD based on the difference in the distribution of norm energy, enabling each sub-signal to take adaptive signal reconstruction. Next the coefficient matrices of the optimal feature sub-bands are reconstructed and reorganized to obtain the feature signal graphs. Finally, deep features are extracted from the feature signal graphs by 2D-Convolutional neural network (2D-CNN). Experimental results on a public data platform of a bearing and our laboratory platform of robot grinding show that this method is better than the existing methods under different noise intensities.

    "title": "JGAT: a joint spatio-temporal graph attention model for brain decoding",
    "abstract": "The decoding of brain neural networks has been an intriguing topic in neuroscience for a well-rounded understanding of different types of brain disorders and cognitive stimuli. Integrating different types of connectivity, e.g., Functional Connectivity (FC) and Structural Connectivity (SC), from multi-modal imaging techniques can take their complementary information into account and therefore have the potential to get better decoding capability. However, traditional approaches for integrating FC and SC overlook the dynamical variations, which stand a great chance to over-generalize the brain neural network. In this paper, we propose a Joint kernel Graph Attention Network (JGAT), which is a new multi-modal temporal graph attention network framework. It integrates the data from functional Magnetic Resonance Images (fMRI) and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) while preserving the dynamic information at the same time. We conduct brain-decoding tasks with our JGAT on four independent datasets: three of 7T fMRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and one from animal neural recordings. Furthermore, with Attention Scores (AS) and Frame Scores (FS) computed and learned from the model, we can locate several informative temporal segments and build meaningful dynamical pathways along the temporal domain for the HCP datasets.

    "title": "Connectional-Style-Guided Contextual Representation Learning for Brain  Disease Diagnosis",
    "abstract": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has shown great clinical value and has been widely used in deep learning (DL) based computer-aided brain disease diagnosis. Previous approaches focused on local shapes and textures in sMRI that may be significant only within a particular domain. The learned representations are likely to contain spurious information and have a poor generalization ability in other diseases and datasets. To facilitate capturing meaningful and robust features, it is necessary to first comprehensively understand the intrinsic pattern of the brain that is not restricted within a single data/task domain. Considering that the brain is a complex connectome of interlinked neurons, the connectional properties in the brain have strong biological significance, which is shared across multiple domains and covers most pathological information. In this work, we propose a connectional style contextual representation learning model (CS-CRL) to capture the intrinsic pattern of the brain, used for multiple brain disease diagnosis. Specifically, it has a vision transformer (ViT) encoder and leverages mask reconstruction as the proxy task and Gram matrices to guide the representation of connectional information. It facilitates the capture of global context and the aggregation of features with biological plausibility. The results indicate that CS-CRL achieves superior accuracy in multiple brain disease diagnosis tasks across six datasets and three diseases and outperforms state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CS-CRL captures more brain-network-like properties, better aggregates features, is easier to optimize and is more robust to noise, which explains its superiority in theory. Our source code will be released soon. ",

In this paper, we describe our multimodal (electroencephalography, ultrasound tongue imaging, and speech) analysis and synthesis experiments, as a feasibility study. We extend the analysis of brain signals recorded during speech production with ultrasound-based articulation data. From the brain signal measured with EEG, we predict ultrasound images of the tongue with a fully connected deep neural network. The results show that there is a weak but noticeable relationship between EEG and ultrasound tongue images, i.e. the network can differentiate articulated speech and neutral tongue position. ",
