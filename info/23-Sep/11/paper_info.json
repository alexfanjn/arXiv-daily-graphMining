    "abstract": "Pure Edge computing (PEC) aims to bring cloud applications and services to the edge of the network to support the growing user demand for time-sensitive applications and data-driven computing. However, mobility and limited computational capacity of edge devices pose challenges in supporting some urgent and computationally intensive tasks with strict response time demands. If the execution results of these tasks exceed the deadline, they become worthless and can cause severe safety issues. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that edge nodes complete as many latency-sensitive tasks as possible. \\\\In this paper, we propose a Robust Adaptive Workload Orchestration (R-AdWOrch) model to minimize deadline misses and data loss by using priority definition and a reallocation strategy. The results show that R-AdWOrch can minimize deadline misses of urgent tasks while minimizing the data loss of lower priority tasks under all conditions. ",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have revolutionized scene novel view synthesis, offering visually realistic, precise, and robust implicit reconstructions. While recent approaches enable NeRF editing, such as object removal, 3D shape modification, or material property manipulation, the manual annotation prior to such edits makes the process tedious. Additionally, traditional 2D interaction tools lack an accurate sense of 3D space, preventing precise manipulation and editing of scenes. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, called Blueprint Neural Field (BluNF), to address these editing issues. BluNF provides a robust and user-friendly 2D blueprint, enabling intuitive scene editing. By leveraging implicit neural representation, BluNF constructs a blueprint of a scene using prior semantic and depth information. The generated blueprint allows effortless editing and manipulation of NeRF representations. We demonstrate BluNF's editability through an intuitive click-and-change mechanism, enabling 3D manipulations, such as masking, appearance modification, and object removal. Our approach significantly contributes to visual content creation, paving the way for further research in this area. ",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) show impressive performance for the photorealistic free-view rendering of scenes. However, NeRFs require dense sampling of images in the given scene, and their performance degrades significantly when only a sparse set of views are available. Researchers have found that supervising the depth estimated by the NeRF helps train it effectively with fewer views. The depth supervision is obtained either using classical approaches or neural networks pre-trained on a large dataset. While the former may provide only sparse supervision, the latter may suffer from generalization issues. As opposed to the earlier approaches, we seek to learn the depth supervision by designing augmented models and training them along with the NeRF. We design augmented models that encourage simpler solutions by exploring the role of positional encoding and view-dependent radiance in training the few-shot NeRF. The depth estimated by these simpler models is used to supervise the NeRF depth estimates. Since the augmented models can be inaccurate in certain regions, we design a mechanism to choose only reliable depth estimates for supervision. Finally, we add a consistency loss between the coarse and fine multi-layer perceptrons of the NeRF to ensure better utilization of hierarchical sampling. We achieve state-of-the-art view-synthesis performance on two popular datasets by employing the above regularizations.

    "abstract": "Fully-test-time adaptation (F-TTA) can mitigate performance loss due to distribution shifts between train and test data (1) without access to the training data, and (2) without knowledge of the model training procedure. In online F-TTA, a pre-trained model is adapted using a stream of test samples by minimizing a self-supervised objective, such as entropy minimization. However, models adapted with online using entropy minimization, are unstable especially in single sample settings, leading to degenerate solutions, and limiting the adoption of TTA inference strategies. Prior works identify noisy, or unreliable, samples as a cause of failure in online F-TTA. One solution is to ignore these samples, which can lead to bias in the update procedure, slow adaptation, and poor generalization. In this work, we present a general framework for improving robustness of F-TTA to these noisy samples, inspired by self-paced learning and robust loss functions. Our proposed approach, Robust Entropy Adaptive Loss Minimization (REALM), achieves better adaptation accuracy than previous approaches throughout the adaptation process on corruptions of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Given the potential malicious nature in which these LLMs can be used to generate disinformation at scale, it is important to build effective detectors for such AI-generated text. Given the surge in development of new LLMs, acquiring labeled training data for supervised detectors is a bottleneck. However, there might be plenty of unlabeled text data available, without information on which generator it came from. In this work we tackle this data problem, in detecting AI-generated news text, and frame the problem as an unsupervised domain adaptation task. Here the domains are the different text generators, i.e. LLMs, and we assume we have access to only the labeled source data and unlabeled target data. We develop a Contrastive Domain Adaptation framework, called ConDA, that blends standard domain adaptation techniques with the representation power of contrastive learning to learn domain invariant representations that are effective for the final unsupervised detection task. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, resulting in average performance gains of 31.7% from the best performing baselines, and within 0.8% margin of a fully supervised detector.

We observe that these models poorly generalize even when trained on a mixture of domains, making them unsuitable to be deployed under diverse real-world setups. We therefore propose a general-purpose, lightweight Domain Disentanglement Module (DDM) that can be plugged into any self-supervised encoder to effectively perform representation learning on multiple, diverse domains with or without shared classes. During pre-training according to a self-supervised loss, DDM enforces a disentanglement in the representation space by splitting it into a domain-variant and a domain-invariant portion. When domain labels are not available, DDM uses a robust clustering approach to discover pseudo-domains. We show that pre-training with DDM can show up to 3.5% improvement in linear probing accuracy on state-of-the-art self-supervised models including SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, DINO, SimSiam and Barlow Twins on multi-domain benchmarks including PACS, DomainNet and WILDS. Models trained with DDM show significantly improved generalization (7.4%) to unseen domains compared to baselines. Therefore, DDM can efficiently adapt self-supervised encoders to provide high-quality, generalizable representations for diverse multi-domain data. ",

Evaluating and debiasing these datasets and models is especially hard in text datasets where sensitive attributes such as race, gender, and sexual orientation may not be available.

In this paper, we present a dataset coupled with an approach to improve text fairness in classifiers and language models. We create a new, more comprehensive identity lexicon, TIDAL, which includes 15,123 identity terms and associated sense context across three demographic categories. We leverage TIDAL to develop an identity annotation and augmentation tool that can be used to improve the availability of identity context and the effectiveness of ML fairness techniques. We evaluate our approaches using human contributors, and additionally run experiments focused on dataset and model debiasing. Results show our assistive annotation technique improves the reliability and velocity of human-in-the-loop processes. Our dataset and methods uncover more disparities during evaluation, and also produce more fair models during remediation.

In this work, we explore a wide range of techniques to obtain and transfer multiple representations of LLMs into a transducer-based ASR system.

    "abstract": "Image camouflage has been utilized to create clean-label poisoned images for implanting backdoor into a DL model. But there exists a crucial limitation that one attack/poisoned image can only fit a single input size of the DL model, which greatly increases its attack budget when attacking multiple commonly adopted input sizes of DL models. This work proposes to constructively craft an attack image through camouflaging but can fit multiple DL models' input sizes simultaneously, namely OmClic. Thus, through OmClic, we are able to always implant a backdoor regardless of which common input size is chosen by the user to train the DL model given the same attack budget (i.e., a fraction of the poisoning rate). With our camouflaging algorithm formulated as a multi-objective optimization, M=5 input sizes can be concurrently targeted with one attack image, which artifact is retained to be almost visually imperceptible at the same time. Extensive evaluations validate the proposed OmClic can reliably succeed in various settings using diverse types of images. Further experiments on OmClic based backdoor insertion to DL models show that high backdoor performances (i.e., attack success rate and clean data accuracy) are achievable no matter which common input size is randomly chosen by the user to train the model. So that the OmClic based backdoor attack budget is reduced by M$\\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art camouflage based backdoor attack as a baseline. Significantly, the same set of OmClic based poisonous attack images is transferable to different model architectures for backdoor implant. ",

To maintain the usability of scientific data, error-bound lossy compression is proposed and developed as an essential technique for the size reduction of scientific data with constrained data distortion. Among the diverse datasets generated by various scientific simulations, certain datasets cannot be effectively compressed by existing error-bounded lossy compressors with traditional techniques. The recent success of Artificial Intelligence has inspired several researchers to integrate neural networks into error-bounded lossy compressors. However, those works still suffer from limited compression ratios and/or extremely low efficiencies. To address those issues and improve the compression on the hard-to-compress datasets, in this paper, we propose SRN-SZ, which is a deep learning-based scientific error-bounded lossy compressor leveraging the hierarchical data grid expansion paradigm implemented by super-resolution neural networks. SRN-SZ applies the most advanced super-resolution network HAT for its compression, which is free of time-costing per-data training. In experiments compared with various state-of-the-art compressors, SRN-SZ achieves up to 75% compression ratio improvements under the same error bound and up to 80% compression ratio improvements under the same PSNR than the second-best compressor.

We use the principles of causal inference and interventions to study the cause-and-effect relationships in the context of some well-known physical phenomena.

However, their large model size and expensive energy consumption prevent them from being widely deployed on developers' computers to provide real-time assistance. A recent study by Shi et al. can compress the pre-trained models into a small size. However, other important considerations in deploying models to have not been addressed: the model should have fast inference speed and minimal energy consumption. This requirement motivates us to propose Avatar, a novel approach that can reduce the model size as well as inference latency and energy consumption without compromising effectiveness (i.e., prediction accuracy). Avatar trains a surrogate model to predict the performance of a tiny model given only its hyperparameters setting. Moreover, Avatar designs a new fitness function embedding multiple key objectives, maximizing the predicted model accuracy and minimizing the model size, inference latency, and energy consumption. After finding the best model hyperparameters using a tailored genetic algorithm (GA), Avatar employs the knowledge distillation technique to train the tiny model. We evaluate Avatar and the baseline approach from Shi et al. on three datasets for two popular software engineering tasks: vulnerability prediction and clone detection. We use Avatar to compress models to a small size (3 MB), which is 160$\\times$ smaller than the original pre-trained models. Compared with the original models, the inference latency of compressed models is significantly reduced on all three datasets. On average, our approach is capable of reducing the inference latency by 62$\\times$, 53$\\times$, and 186$\\times$.

While there exist graph neural networks that leverage hyperbolic or spherical spaces to learn representations that embed such structures more accurately, these methods are confined under the message-passing paradigm, making the models vulnerable against side-effects such as oversmoothing and oversquashing. More recent work have proposed global attention-based graph Transformers that can easily model long-range interactions, but their extensions towards non-Euclidean geometry are yet unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Fully Product-Stereographic Transformer, a generalization of Transformers towards operating entirely on the product of constant curvature spaces. When combined with tokenized graph Transformers, our model can learn the curvature appropriate for the input graph in an end-to-end fashion, without the need of additional tuning on different curvature initializations. We also provide a kernelized approach to non-Euclidean attention, which enables our model to run in time and memory cost linear to the number of nodes and edges while respecting the underlying geometry. Experiments on graph reconstruction and node classification demonstrate the benefits of generalizing Transformers to the non-Euclidean domain. ",

    "abstract": "The annotation of 3D datasets is required for semantic-segmentation and object detection in scene understanding. In this paper we present a framework for the weakly supervision of a point clouds transformer that is used for 3D object detection. The aim is to decrease the required amount of supervision needed for training, as a result of the high cost of annotating a 3D datasets. We propose an Unsupervised Voting Proposal Module, which learns randomly preset anchor points and uses voting network to select prepared anchor points of high quality. Then it distills information into student and teacher network. In terms of student network, we apply ResNet network to efficiently extract local characteristics. However, it also can lose much global information. To provide the input which incorporates the global and local information as the input of student networks, we adopt the self-attention mechanism of transformer to extract global features, and the ResNet layers to extract region proposals. The teacher network supervises the classification and regression of the student network using the pre-trained model on ImageNet. On the challenging KITTI datasets, the experimental results have achieved the highest level of average precision compared with the most recent weakly supervised 3D object detectors. ",

    "abstract": "Visual odometry (VO) and SLAM have been using multi-view geometry via local structure from motion for decades. These methods have a slight disadvantage in challenging scenarios such as low-texture images, dynamic scenarios, etc. Meanwhile, use of deep neural networks to extract high level features is ubiquitous in computer vision. For VO, we can use these deep networks to extract depth and pose estimates using these high level features. The visual odometry task then can be modeled as an image generation task where the pose estimation is the by-product. This can also be achieved in a self-supervised manner, thereby eliminating the data (supervised) intensive nature of training deep neural networks. Although some works tried the similar approach [1], the depth and pose estimation in the previous works are vague sometimes resulting in accumulation of error (drift) along the trajectory. The goal of this work is to tackle these limitations of past approaches and to develop a method that can provide better depths and pose estimates. To address this, a couple of approaches are explored: 1) Modeling: Using optical flow and recurrent neural networks (RNN) in order to exploit spatio-temporal correlations which can provide more information to estimate depth. 2) Loss function: Generative adversarial network (GAN) [2] is deployed to improve the depth estimation (and thereby pose too), as shown in Figure 1. This additional loss term improves the realism in generated images and reduces artifacts. ",

Existing methods using mixed images learn a representation by maximizing the similarity between the representation of the mixed image and the synthesized representation of the original images. However, few methods consider the synthesis of representations from the perspective of mathematical logic. In this study, we focused on a synthesis method of representations. We proposed a new SSL with mixed images and a new representation format based on many-valued logic. This format can indicate the feature-possession degree, that is, how much of each image feature is possessed by a representation. This representation format and representation synthesis by logic operation realize that the synthesized representation preserves the remarkable characteristics of the original representations. Our method performed competitively with previous representation synthesis methods for image classification tasks. We also examined the relationship between the feature-possession degree and the number of classes of images in the multilabel image classification dataset to verify that the intended learning was achieved. In addition, we discussed image retrieval, which is an application of our proposed representation format using many-valued logic. ",

    "abstract": "Various precoders have been recently studied by the wireless community to combat the channel fading effects. Two prominent precoders are implemented with the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT). The WHT precoder is implemented with less complexity since it does not need complex multiplications. Also, spreading can be applied sparsely to decrease the transceiver complexity, leading to sparse DFT (SDFT) and sparse Walsh-Hadamard (SWH). Another relevant topic is the design of iterative receivers that deal with inter-symbol-interference (ISI). In particular, many detectors based on expectation propagation (EP) have been proposed recently for channels with high levels of ISI. An alternative is the maximum a-posterior (MAP) detector, although it leads to unfeasible high complexity in many cases. In this paper, we provide a relatively low-complexity \\textcolor{black}{computation} of the MAP detector for the SWH. We also propose two \\textcolor{black}{feasible methods} based on the Log-MAP and Max-Log-MAP. Additionally, the DFT, SDFT and SWH precoders are compared using an EP-based receiver with one-tap FD equalization. Lastly, SWH-Max-Log-MAP is compared to the (S)DFT with EP-based receiver in terms of performance and complexity. The results show that the proposed SWH-Max-Log-MAP has a better performance and complexity trade-off for QPSK and 16-QAM under highly selective channels, but has unfeasible complexity for higher QAM orders.

In this paper, the performance of OTSM-based homodyne transceiver is explored under hardware impairments (HIs) including in-phase and quadrature imbalance (IQI), direct current offset (DCO), phase noise, power amplifier non-linearity, carrier frequency offset, and synchronization timing offset. First, the discrete-time baseband signal model is obtained in vector form under the mentioned HIs. Then, the system input-output relations are derived in time, delay-time, and delay-sequency (DS) domains in which the parameters of HIs are incorporated. Analytical studies demonstrate that noise stays white Gaussian and effective channel matrix is sparse in the DS domain under HIs. Also, DCO appears as a DC signal at receiver interfering with only the zero sequency over all delay taps in the DS domain; however, IQI redounds to self-conjugated fully-overlapping sequency interference. Simulation results reveal the fact that with no HI compensation (HIC), not only OTSM outperforms plain SC waveform but it performs close to uncompensated OTFS system; however, HIC is essentially needed for OTSM systems operating in mmWave and beyond frequency bands.

    "abstract": "The problem of phase retrieval (PR) involves recovering an unknown image from limited amplitude measurement data and is a challenge nonlinear inverse problem in computational imaging and image processing. However, many of the PR methods are based on black-box network models that lack interpretability and plug-and-play (PnP) frameworks that are computationally complex and require careful parameter tuning. To address this, we have developed PRISTA-Net, a deep unfolding network (DUN) based on the first-order iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA). This network utilizes a learnable nonlinear transformation to address the proximal-point mapping sub-problem associated with the sparse priors, and an attention mechanism to focus on phase information containing image edges, textures, and structures. Additionally, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to learn global features to enhance local information, and the designed logarithmic-based loss function leads to significant improvements when the noise level is low. All parameters in the proposed PRISTA-Net framework, including the nonlinear transformation, threshold parameters, and step size, are learned end-to-end instead of being manually set. This method combines the interpretability of traditional methods with the fast inference ability of deep learning and is able to handle noise at each iteration during the unfolding stage, thus improving recovery quality. Experiments on Coded Diffraction Patterns (CDPs) measurements demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

However, the costs of training in-domain LLMs for public health are especially expensive. Furthermore, such kinds of in-domain datasets from social media are generally imbalanced.

In the context of autonomous vehicles, certifying the safety of the localization process poses a significant challenge. As robots evolve in a complex world, various types of noise can impact the measurements. Conventionally, this noise has been assumed to be distributed according to a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. However, this assumption does not hold in numerous scenarios, including adverse weather conditions, occlusions caused by dynamic obstacles, or long-term changes in the map. In these cases, the measurements are instead affected by a large, deterministic fault. This paper introduces a closed-form formula approximating the highest pose error caused by corrupted measurements using the ICP algorithm. Using this formula, we develop a metric to certify and pinpoint specific regions within the environment where the robot is more vulnerable to localization failures in the presence of faults in the measurements.

In this paper, we present a federated machine learning (FML) approach that minimizes privacy concerns and enables distributed training, without transferring individual data. We employ collaborative training by considering individuals and organizations under FML, which models both cross-device and cross-silo learning scenarios. Our approach is evaluated on a real-world dataset with non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data among clients, class imbalance and label ambiguity. Our results show that data selection and class imbalance handling techniques significantly improve the predictive accuracy of models trained under FML, demonstrating comparable or superior predictive performance than traditional ML models.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised masked image modeling has shown promising results on natural images. However, directly applying such methods to medical images remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexity and distinct characteristics of lesions compared to natural images, which impedes effective representation learning. Additionally, conventional high fixed masking ratios restrict reconstructing fine lesion details, limiting the scope of learnable information. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised medical image segmentation framework, Adaptive Masking Lesion Patches (AMLP). Specifically, we design a Masked Patch Selection (MPS) strategy to identify and focus learning on patches containing lesions. Lesion regions are scarce yet critical, making their precise reconstruction vital. To reduce misclassification of lesion and background patches caused by unsupervised clustering in MPS, we introduce an Attention Reconstruction Loss (ARL) to focus on hard-to-reconstruct patches likely depicting lesions. We further propose a Category Consistency Loss (CCL) to refine patch categorization based on reconstruction difficulty, strengthening distinction between lesions and background. Moreover, we develop an Adaptive Masking Ratio (AMR) strategy that gradually increases the masking ratio to expand reconstructible information and improve learning. Extensive experiments on two medical segmentation datasets demonstrate AMLP's superior performance compared to existing self-supervised approaches. The proposed strategies effectively address limitations in applying masked modeling to medical images, tailored to capturing fine lesion details vital for segmentation tasks. ",

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the dominant approach for learning on graph data. Instances of graph labeling problems consist of the graph-structure (i.e., the adjacency matrix), along with node-specific feature vectors. In some cases, this graph-structure is non-informative for the predictive task. For instance, molecular properties such as molar mass depend solely on the constituent atoms (node features), and not on the molecular structure. While GNNs have the ability to ignore the graph-structure in such cases, it is not clear that they will. In this work, we show that GNNs actually tend to overfit the graph-structure in the sense that they use it even when a better solution can be obtained by ignoring it. We examine this phenomenon with respect to different graph distributions and find that regular graphs are more robust to this overfitting. We then provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, via analyzing the implicit bias of gradient-descent-based learning of GNNs in this setting. Finally, based on our empirical and theoretical findings, we propose a graph-editing method to mitigate the tendency of GNNs to overfit graph-structures that should be ignored. We show that this method indeed improves the accuracy of GNNs across multiple benchmarks. ",

Qualitatively, our experiments show that the retrieval results are similar to deeply learned methods. Effectively comparing instances of floor plan data is paramount to the success of machine understanding of floor plan data, including the assessment of floor plan generative models and floor plan recommendation systems. Comparing visual floor plan images goes beyond a sole pixel-wise visual examination and is crucially about similarities and differences in the shapes and relations between subdivisions that compose the layout. Currently, deep metric learning approaches are used to learn a pair-wise vector representation space that closely mimics the structural similarity, in which the models are trained on similarity labels that are obtained by Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To compensate for the lack of structural awareness in IoU, graph-based approaches such as Graph Matching Networks (GMNs) are used, which require pairwise inference for comparing data instances, making GMNs less practical for retrieval applications. In this paper, an effective evaluation metric for judging the structural similarity of floor plans, coined SSIG (Structural Similarity by IoU and GED), is proposed based on both image and graph distances. In addition, an efficient algorithm is developed that uses SSIG to rank a large-scale floor plan database. Code will be openly available. ",

However, these optimal set-points can become inoperable due to implementation errors, such as disturbances and noise, at the control layers. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present the Adversarially Robust Real-Time Optimization and Control (ARRTOC) algorithm. ARRTOC draws inspiration from adversarial machine learning, offering an online constrained Adversarially Robust Optimization (ARO) solution applied to the RTO layer. This approach identifies set-points that are both optimal and inherently robust to control layer perturbations. By integrating controller design with RTO, ARRTOC enhances overall system performance and robustness. Importantly, ARRTOC maintains versatility through a loose coupling between the RTO and control layers, ensuring compatibility with various controller architectures and RTO algorithms. To validate our claims, we present three case studies: an illustrative example, a bioreactor case study, and a multi-loop evaporator process. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ARRTOC in achieving the delicate balance between optimality and operability in RTO and control. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenging problem of 3D toonification, which involves transferring the style of an artistic domain onto a target 3D face with stylized geometry and texture. Although fine-tuning a pre-trained 3D GAN on the artistic domain can produce reasonable performance, this strategy has limitations in the 3D domain. In particular, fine-tuning can deteriorate the original GAN latent space, which affects subsequent semantic editing, and requires independent optimization and storage for each new style, limiting flexibility and efficient deployment. To overcome these challenges, we propose DeformToon3D, an effective toonification framework tailored for hierarchical 3D GAN. Our approach decomposes 3D toonification into subproblems of geometry and texture stylization to better preserve the original latent space. Specifically, we devise a novel StyleField that predicts conditional 3D deformation to align a real-space NeRF to the style space for geometry stylization. Thanks to the StyleField formulation, which already handles geometry stylization well, texture stylization can be achieved conveniently via adaptive style mixing that injects information of the artistic domain into the decoder of the pre-trained 3D GAN. Due to the unique design, our method enables flexible style degree control and shape-texture-specific style swap. Furthermore, we achieve efficient training without any real-world 2D-3D training pairs but proxy samples synthesized from off-the-shelf 2D toonification models. ",

    "abstract": "Several domains increasingly rely on machine learning in their applications. The resulting heavy dependence on data has led to the emergence of various laws and regulations around data ethics and privacy and growing awareness of the need for privacy-preserving machine learning (ppML). Current ppML techniques utilize methods that are either purely based on cryptography, such as homomorphic encryption, or that introduce noise into the input, such as differential privacy. The main criticism given to those techniques is the fact that they either are too slow or they trade off a model s performance for improved confidentiality. To address this performance reduction, we aim to leverage robust representation learning as a way of encoding our data while optimizing the privacy-utility trade-off. Our method centers on training autoencoders in a multi-objective manner and then concatenating the latent and learned features from the encoding part as the encoded form of our data. Such a deep learning-powered encoding can then safely be sent to a third party for intensive training and hyperparameter tuning. With our proposed framework, we can share our data and use third party tools without being under the threat of revealing its original form. We empirically validate our results on unimodal and multimodal settings, the latter following a vertical splitting system and show improved performance over state-of-the-art. ",

    "abstract": "Refractive Index Tomography is an inverse problem in which we seek to reconstruct a scene's 3D refractive field from 2D projected image measurements. The refractive field is not visible itself, but instead affects how the path of a light ray is continuously curved as it travels through space. Refractive fields appear across a wide variety of scientific applications, from translucent cell samples in microscopy to fields of dark matter bending light from faraway galaxies. This problem poses a unique challenge because the refractive field directly affects the path that light takes, making its recovery a non-linear problem. In addition, in contrast with traditional tomography, we seek to recover the refractive field using a projected image from only a single viewpoint by leveraging knowledge of light sources scattered throughout the medium. In this work, we introduce a method that uses a coordinate-based neural network to model the underlying continuous refractive field in a scene. We then use explicit modeling of rays' 3D spatial curvature to optimize the parameters of this network, reconstructing refractive fields with an analysis-by-synthesis approach. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated by recovering refractive fields in simulation, and analyzing how recovery is affected by the light source distribution. We then test our method on a simulated dark matter mapping problem, where we recover the refractive field underlying a realistic simulated dark matter distribution. ",

    "title": "On the Actionability of Outcome Prediction",
    "abstract": "Predicting future outcomes is a prevalent application of machine learning in social impact domains. Examples range from predicting student success in education to predicting disease risk in healthcare. Practitioners recognize that the ultimate goal is not just to predict but to act effectively. Increasing evidence suggests that relying on outcome predictions for downstream interventions may not have desired results. In most domains there exists a multitude of possible interventions for each individual, making the challenge of taking effective action more acute. Even when causal mechanisms connecting the individual's latent states to outcomes is well understood, in any given instance (a specific student or patient), practitioners still need to infer -- from budgeted measurements of latent states -- which of many possible interventions will be most effective for this individual. With this in mind, we ask: when are accurate predictors of outcomes helpful for identifying the most suitable intervention? Through a simple model encompassing actions, latent states, and measurements, we demonstrate that pure outcome prediction rarely results in the most effective policy for taking actions, even when combined with other measurements. We find that except in cases where there is a single decisive action for improving the outcome, outcome prediction never maximizes \"action value\", the utility of taking actions. Making measurements of actionable latent states, where specific actions lead to desired outcomes, considerably enhances the action value compared to outcome prediction, and the degree of improvement depends on action costs and the outcome model. This analysis emphasizes the need to go beyond generic outcome prediction in interventional settings by incorporating knowledge of plausible actions and latent states. ",

R2D2, standing for \"{R}esidual-to-{R}esidual {D}NN series for high-{D}ynamic range imaging\", is a model-based data-driven approach relying on hybrid deep neural networks (DNNs) and data-consistency updates. Its reconstruction is built as a series of residual images estimated as the outputs of DNNs, each taking the residual dirty image of the previous iteration as an input. The approach can be interpreted as a learned version of a matching pursuit approach, whereby model components are iteratively identified from residual dirty images, and of which CLEAN is a well-known example. We propose two variants of the R2D2 model, built upon two distinctive DNN architectures: a standard U-Net, and a novel unrolled architecture. We demonstrate their use for monochromatic intensity imaging on highly-sensitive observations of the radio galaxy Cygnus~A at S band, from the Very Large Array (VLA). R2D2 is validated against CLEAN and the recent RI algorithms AIRI and uSARA, which respectively inject a learned implicit regularization and an advanced handcrafted sparsity-based regularization into the RI data. With only few terms in its series, the R2D2 model is able to deliver high-precision imaging, significantly superior to CLEAN and matching the precision of AIRI and uSARA. In terms of computational efficiency, R2D2 runs at a fraction of the cost of AIRI and uSARA, and is also faster than CLEAN, opening the door to real-time precision imaging in RI. ",

In this work, we make an initial attempt towards enabling ChatGPT-like capabilities on drug molecule graphs, by developing a prototype system DrugChat. DrugChat works in a similar way as ChatGPT. Users upload a compound molecule graph and ask various questions about this compound. DrugChat will answer these questions in a multi-turn, interactive manner. The DrugChat system consists of a graph neural network (GNN), a large language model (LLM), and an adaptor. The GNN takes a compound molecule graph as input and learns a representation for this graph. The adaptor transforms the graph representation produced by the GNN into another representation that is acceptable to the LLM. The LLM takes the compound representation transformed by the adaptor and users' questions about this compound as inputs and generates answers. All these components are trained end-to-end. To train DrugChat, we collected instruction tuning datasets which contain 10,834 drug compounds and 143,517 question-answer pairs.

However, estimating binding affinity demands significant financial and computational resources. While state-of-the-art methodologies employ classical machine learning (ML) techniques, emerging hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) models have shown promise for enhanced performance, owing to their inherent parallelism and capacity to manage exponential increases in data dimensionality. Despite these advances, existing models encounter issues related to convergence stability and prediction accuracy. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical deep learning model tailored for binding affinity prediction in drug discovery. Specifically, the proposed model synergistically integrates 3D and spatial graph convolutional neural networks within an optimized quantum architecture. Simulation results demonstrate a 6% improvement in prediction accuracy relative to existing classical models, as well as a significantly more stable convergence performance compared to previous classical approaches.

We evaluate the quality of the obtained forecast distributions in terms of calibration and sharpness, and compare the models against classical and neural network-based benchmark methods. In case studies addressing the postprocessing of surface temperature and wind gust forecasts, we demonstrate state-of-the-art prediction quality. To deepen the understanding of the learned inference process, we further propose a permutation-based importance analysis for ensemble-valued predictors, which highlights specific aspects of the ensemble forecast that are considered important by the trained postprocessing models.
