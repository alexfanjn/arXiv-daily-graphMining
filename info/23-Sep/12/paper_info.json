    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of safety-critical control for non-affine control systems. It has been shown that optimizing quadratic costs subject to state and control constraints can be sub-optimally reduced to a sequence of quadratic programs (QPs) by using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Our recently proposed High Order CBFs (HOCBFs) can accommodate constraints of arbitrary relative degree. The main challenges in this approach are that it requires affine control dynamics and the solution of the CBF-based QP is sub-optimal since it is solved point-wise. To address these challenges, we incorporate higher-order CBFs into neural ordinary differential equation-based learning models as differentiable CBFs to guarantee safety for non-affine control systems. The differentiable CBFs are trainable in terms of their parameters, and thus, they can address the conservativeness of CBFs such that the system state will not stay unnecessarily far away from safe set boundaries. Moreover, the imitation learning model is capable of learning complex and optimal control policies that are usually intractable online. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on LiDAR-based autonomous driving and compare it with existing methods. ",

    "abstract": "The steady-state solution of fluid flow in pipeline infrastructure networks driven by junction/node potentials is a crucial ingredient in various decision support tools for system design and operation. While the non-linear system is known to have a unique solution (when one exists), the absence of a definite result on existence of solutions hobbles the development of computational algorithms, for it is not possible to distinguish between algorithm failure and non-existence of a solution. In this letter we show that a unique solution exists for such non-linear systems if the term \\emph{solution} is interpreted in terms of \\emph{potentials} and flows rather than \\emph{pressures} and flows. The existence result for flow of natural gas in networks also applies to other fluid flow networks such as water distribution networks or networks that transport carbon dioxide in carbon capture and sequestration. Most importantly, by giving a complete answer to the question of existence of solutions, our result enables correct diagnosis of algorithmic failure, problem stiffness and non-convergence in computational algorithms.

In medical practice, respiratory sounds are widely used in medical services to diagnose various respiratory illnesses and lung disorders. The traditional diagnosis of such sounds requires specialized knowledge, which can be costly and reliant on human expertise. Recently, cough audio recordings have been used to automate the process of detecting respiratory conditions. This research aims to examine various acoustic features that enhance the performance of machine learning (ML) models in detecting COVID-19 from cough signals. This study investigates the efficacy of three feature extraction techniques, including Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Chroma, and Spectral Contrast features, on two ML algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and thus proposes an efficient COVID-19 detection system. The proposed system produces a practical solution and demonstrates higher state-of-the-art classification performance on COUGHVID and Virufy datasets for COVID-19 detection. ",

    "abstract": "Gradient inversion attacks are an ubiquitous threat in federated learning as they exploit gradient leakage to reconstruct supposedly private training data. Recent work has proposed to prevent gradient leakage without loss of model utility by incorporating a PRivacy EnhanCing mODulE (PRECODE) based on variational modeling. Without further analysis, it was shown that PRECODE successfully protects against gradient inversion attacks. In this paper, we make multiple contributions. First, we investigate the effect of PRECODE on gradient inversion attacks to reveal its underlying working principle. We show that variational modeling introduces stochasticity into the gradients of PRECODE and the subsequent layers in a neural network. The stochastic gradients of these layers prevent iterative gradient inversion attacks from converging. Second, we formulate an attack that disables the privacy preserving effect of PRECODE by purposefully omitting stochastic gradients during attack optimization. To preserve the privacy preserving effect of PRECODE, our analysis reveals that variational modeling must be placed early in the network. However, early placement of PRECODE is typically not feasible due to reduced model utility and the exploding number of additional model parameters. Therefore, as a third contribution, we propose a novel privacy module -- the Convolutional Variational Bottleneck (CVB) -- that can be placed early in a neural network without suffering from these drawbacks. We conduct an extensive empirical study on three seminal model architectures and six image classification datasets. We find that all architectures are susceptible to gradient leakage attacks, which can be prevented by our proposed CVB. Compared to PRECODE, we show that our novel privacy module requires fewer trainable parameters, and thus computational and communication costs, to effectively preserve privacy. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial progress has been made for infinitely wide networks. In this regime, two disparate theoretical frameworks have been used, in which the network's output is described using kernels: one framework is based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, while the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel assumes a Bayesian framework. However, the relation between these two frameworks has remained elusive. This work unifies these two distinct theories using a Markov proximal learning model for learning dynamics in an ensemble of randomly initialized infinitely wide deep networks. We derive an exact analytical expression for the network input-output function during and after learning, and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels can be derived. We identify two learning phases characterized by different time scales: gradient-driven and diffusive learning. In the initial gradient-driven learning phase, the dynamics is dominated by deterministic gradient descent, and is described by the NTK theory. This phase is followed by the diffusive learning stage, during which the network parameters sample the solution space, ultimately approaching the equilibrium distribution corresponding to NNGP. Combined with numerical evaluations on synthetic and benchmark datasets, we provide novel insights into the different roles of initialization, regularization, and network depth, as well as phenomena such as early stopping and representational drift. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the learning process of deep neural networks in the infinite width limit. ",

Offloading LiDAR perceptions requires compressing the raw sensor data, and lossy compression is used for efficiently reducing the data volume. Lossy compression degrades the quality of LiDAR point clouds, and the perception performance is decreased consequently. In this work, we present an interpolation algorithm improving the quality of a LiDAR point cloud to mitigate the perception performance loss due to lossy compression. The algorithm targets the range image (RI) representation of a point cloud and interpolates points at the RI based on depth gradients. Compared to existing image interpolation algorithms, our algorithm shows a better qualitative result when the point cloud is reconstructed from the interpolated RI. With the preliminary results, we also describe the next steps of the current work. ",

Furthermore, we interpreted our model by overlaying attention maps on input magnetograms and visualized the important regions focused on by the model that led to the eventual decision. The significant findings of this study are: (i) We successfully implemented an attention-based full-disk flare predictor ready for operational forecasting where the candidate model achieves an average TSS=0.54$\\pm$0.03 and HSS=0.37$\\pm$0.07. (ii) we demonstrated that our full-disk model can learn conspicuous features corresponding to active regions from full-disk magnetogram images, and (iii) our experimental evaluation suggests that our model can predict near-limb flares with adept skill and the predictions are based on relevant active regions (ARs) or AR characteristics from full-disk magnetograms.

    "abstract": "Graph structured data are widely existed and applied in the real-world applications, while it is a challenge to handling these diverse data and learning tasks on graph in an efficient manner. When facing the complicated graph learning tasks, experts have designed diverse Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in recent years. They have also implemented AutoML in Graph, also known as AutoGraph, to automatically generate data-specific solutions. Despite their success, they encounter limitations in (1) managing diverse learning tasks at various levels, (2) dealing with different procedures in graph learning beyond architecture design, and (3) the huge requirements on the prior knowledge when using AutoGraph. In this paper, we propose to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents to simplify the learning process on diverse real-world graphs. Specifically, in response to a user request which may contain varying data and learning targets at the node, edge, or graph levels, the complex graph learning task is decomposed into three components following the agent planning, namely, detecting the learning intent, configuring solutions based on AutoGraph, and generating a response. The AutoGraph agents manage crucial procedures in automated graph learning, including data-processing, AutoML configuration, searching architectures, and hyper-parameter fine-tuning. With these agents, those components are processed by decomposing and completing step by step, thereby generating a solution for the given data automatically, regardless of the learning task on node or graph. The proposed method is dubbed Auto$^2$Graph, and the comparable performance on different datasets and learning tasks. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by its comparable performance on different datasets and learning tasks, as well as the human-like decisions made by the agents. ",

Given a large number of molecules, they learn to capture structural knowledge, which is transferable for various downstream property prediction tasks and vital in chemistry, biomedicine, and material science. Previous strategies that randomly select nodes to do attribute masking leverage the information of local neighbors However, the over-reliance of these neighbors inhibits the model's ability to learn from higher-level substructures. For example, the model would learn little from predicting three carbon atoms in a benzene ring based on the other three but could learn more from the inter-connections between the functional groups, or called chemical motifs. In this work, we propose and investigate motif-aware attribute masking strategies to capture inter-motif structures by leveraging the information of atoms in neighboring motifs. Once each graph is decomposed into disjoint motifs, the features for every node within a sample motif are masked. The graph decoder then predicts the masked features of each node within the motif for reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on eight molecular property prediction datasets and demonstrate its advantages. ",

To tackle these challenges, we propose a principled and generic representation-crossing framework to solve self-optimizing feature generation.To achieve hashing representation, we propose a three-step approach: feature discretization, feature hashing, and descriptive summarization. To achieve reinforcement crossing, we develop a hierarchical reinforcement feature crossing approach.We present extensive experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

Digital twins (DTs) have been increasingly studied for this purpose owing to their capability of runtime monitoring and warning, prediction and detection of anomalies, etc. However, constructing a DT for anomaly detection in TCMS necessitates sufficient training data and extracting both chronological and context features with high quality. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel method named KDDT for TCMS anomaly detection. KDDT harnesses a language model (LM) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract contexts and chronological features, respectively. To enrich data volume, KDDT benefits from out-of-domain data with knowledge distillation (KD). We evaluated KDDT with two datasets from our industry partner Alstom and obtained the F1 scores of 0.931 and 0.915, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of KDDT. We also explored individual contributions of the DT model, LM, and KD to the overall performance of KDDT, via a comprehensive empirical study, and observed average F1 score improvements of 12.4%, 3%, and 6.05%, respectively.

To enable robots to capture the underlying distribution of object properties necessary for generalising learnt manipulation tasks to unseen objects, existing Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approaches require a large number of costly human demonstrations. Our proposed semi-supervised LfD approach decouples the learnt model into an haptic representation encoder and a motion generation decoder. This enables us to pre-train the first using large amount of unsupervised data, easily accessible, while using few-shot LfD to train the second, leveraging the benefits of learning skills from humans. We validate the approach on the wiping task using sponges with different stiffness and surface friction. Our results demonstrate that pre-training significantly improves the ability of the LfD model to recognise physical properties and generate desired wiping motions for unseen sponges, outperforming the LfD method without pre-training. We validate the motion generated by our semi-supervised LfD model on the physical robot hardware using the KUKA iiwa robot arm. We also validate that the haptic representation encoder, pre-trained in simulation, captures the properties of real objects, explaining its contribution to improving the generalisation of the downstream task.

Specifically, we propose a feature disentanglement model to segregate the robust features from non-robust features and domain specific features. The extensive experiments on four widely used datasets with different attacks demonstrate that robust features obtained from our model improve the model's adversarial robustness compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the trained domain discriminator is able to identify the domain specific features from the clean images and adversarial examples almost perfectly. This enables adversarial example detection without incurring additional computational costs. With that, we can also specify different classifiers for clean images and adversarial examples, thereby avoiding any drop in clean image accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "The age and stroke-associated decline in musculoskeletal strength degrades the ability to perform daily human tasks using the upper extremities. Although there are a few examples of exoskeletons, they need manual operations due to the absence of sensor feedback and no intention prediction of movements. Here, we introduce an intelligent upper-limb exoskeleton system that uses cloud-based deep learning to predict human intention for strength augmentation. The embedded soft wearable sensors provide sensory feedback by collecting real-time muscle signals, which are simultaneously computed to determine the user's intended movement. The cloud-based deep-learning predicts four upper-limb joint motions with an average accuracy of 96.2% at a 200-250 millisecond response rate, suggesting that the exoskeleton operates just by human intention. In addition, an array of soft pneumatics assists the intended movements by providing 897 newton of force and 78.7 millimeter of displacement at maximum. Collectively, the intent-driven exoskeleton can augment human strength by 5.15 times on average compared to the unassisted exoskeleton. This report demonstrates an exoskeleton robot that augments the upper-limb joint movements by human intention based on a machine-learning cloud computing and sensory feedback. ",

State-of-the-art MPC techniques can be directly leveraged for DNN models that use simple activation functions (AFs) such as ReLU. However, DNN model architectures designed for cutting-edge applications often use complex and highly non-linear AFs. Designing efficient MPC techniques for such complex AFs is an open problem. Towards this, we propose Compact, which produces piece-wise polynomial approximations of complex AFs to enable their efficient use with state-of-the-art MPC techniques. Compact neither requires nor imposes any restriction on model training and results in near-identical model accuracy. We extensively evaluate Compact on four different machine-learning tasks with DNN architectures that use popular complex AFs SiLU, GeLU, and Mish. Our experimental results show that Compact incurs negligible accuracy loss compared to DNN-specific approaches for handling complex non-linear AFs. We also incorporate Compact in two state-of-the-art MPC libraries for privacy-preserving inference and demonstrate that Compact provides 2x-5x speedup in computation compared to the state-of-the-art approximation approach for non-linear functions -- while providing similar or better accuracy for DNN models with large number of hidden layers ",

CFEs can enhance informational fairness and trustworthiness, and provide suggestions for users who receive adverse predictions. However, recent research has shown that multiple CFEs can be offered for the same instance or instances with slight differences. Multiple CFEs provide flexible choices and cover diverse desiderata for user selection. However, individual fairness and model reliability will be damaged if unstable CFEs with different costs are returned. Existing methods fail to exploit flexibility and address the concerns of non-robustness simultaneously. To address these issues, we propose a conceptually simple yet effective solution named Counterfactual Explanations with Minimal Satisfiable Perturbations (CEMSP). Specifically, CEMSP constrains changing values of abnormal features with the help of their semantically meaningful normal ranges. For efficiency, we model the problem as a Boolean satisfiability problem to modify as few features as possible. Additionally, CEMSP is a general framework and can easily accommodate more practical requirements, e.g., casualty and actionability. Compared to existing methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our method provides more robust explanations while preserving flexibility.

A strong baseline for specializing these models for specific languages is Language-Adaptive Pre-Training (LAPT).

In this study, we propose several simple techniques to replace a cross-lingual vocabulary with a compact, language-specific one. Namely, we address strategies for re-initializing the token embedding matrix after vocabulary specialization. We then provide a systematic experimental comparison of our techniques, in addition to the recently-proposed Focus method. We demonstrate that: 1) Embedding-replacement techniques in the monolingual transfer literature are inadequate for adapting multilingual models. 2) Replacing cross-lingual vocabularies with smaller specialized ones provides an efficient method to improve performance in low-resource languages. 3) Simple embedding re-initialization techniques based on script-wise sub-distributions rival techniques such as Focus, which rely on similarity scores obtained from an auxiliary model.

However, most existing methods overlook the inherent relational information among the non-independent and non-identically distributed nodes in a graph. Due to the lack of exploration of relational attributes, the semantic information of the graph-structured data fails to be fully exploited which leads to poor clustering performance. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised deep graph clustering method named Relational Redundancy-Free Graph Clustering (R$^2$FGC) to tackle the problem. It extracts the attribute- and structure-level relational information from both global and local views based on an autoencoder and a graph autoencoder. To obtain effective representations of the semantic information, we preserve the consistent relation among augmented nodes, whereas the redundant relation is further reduced for learning discriminative embeddings. In addition, a simple yet valid strategy is utilized to alleviate the over-smoothing issue. Extensive experiments are performed on widely used benchmark datasets to validate the superiority of our R$^2$FGC over state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "Dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) enables a server to efficiently search and update over encrypted files. To minimize the leakage during updates, a security notion named forward and backward privacy is expected for newly proposed DSSE schemes. Those schemes are generally constructed in a way to break the linkability across search and update queries to a given keyword. However, it remains underexplored whether forward and backward private DSSE is resilient against practical leakage-abuse attacks (LAAs), where an attacker attempts to recover query keywords from the leakage passively collected during queries. In this paper, we aim to be the first to answer this question firmly through two non-trivial efforts. First, we revisit the spectrum of forward and backward private DSSE schemes over the past few years, and unveil some inherent constructional limitations in most schemes. Those limitations allow attackers to exploit query equality and establish a guaranteed linkage among different (refreshed) query tokens surjective to a candidate keyword. Second, we refine volumetric leakage profiles of updates and queries by associating each with a specific operation. By further exploiting update volume and query response volume, we demonstrate that all forward and backward private DSSE schemes can leak the same volumetric information (e.g., insertion volume, deletion volume) as those without such security guarantees. To testify our findings, we realize two generic LAAs, i.e., frequency matching attack and volumetric inference attack, and we evaluate them over various experimental settings in the dynamic context. Finally, we call for new efficient schemes to protect query equality and volumetric information across search and update queries. ",

Existing video-based breast lesion detection approaches typically perform temporal feature aggregation of deep backbone features based on the self-attention operation. We argue that such a strategy struggles to effectively perform deep feature aggregation and ignores the useful local information. To tackle these issues, we propose a spatial-temporal deformable attention based framework, named STNet. Our STNet introduces a spatial-temporal deformable attention module to perform local spatial-temporal feature fusion. The spatial-temporal deformable attention module enables deep feature aggregation in each stage of both encoder and decoder. To further accelerate the detection speed, we introduce an encoder feature shuffle strategy for multi-frame prediction during inference. In our encoder feature shuffle strategy, we share the backbone and encoder features, and shuffle encoder features for decoder to generate the predictions of multiple frames. The experiments on the public breast lesion ultrasound video dataset show that our STNet obtains a state-of-the-art detection performance, while operating twice as fast inference speed.

Underwater object detection methods based on noise reduction and image enhancement usually do not provide images preferred by the detector or require additional datasets.

We design an unsupervised learning loss for the joint training of UnitModule with the detector without additional datasets to improve the interaction between UnitModule and the detector. Furthermore, a color cast predictor with the assisting color cast loss and a data augmentation called Underwater Color Random Transfer (UCRT) are designed to improve the performance of UnitModule on underwater images with different color casts. Extensive experiments are conducted on DUO for different object detection models, where UnitModule achieves the highest performance improvement of 2.6 AP for YOLOv5-S and gains the improvement of 3.3 AP on the brand-new test set (URPCtest). And UnitModule significantly improves the performance of all object detection models we test, especially for models with a small number of parameters. In addition, UnitModule with a small number of parameters of 31K has little effect on the inference speed of the original object detection model. Our quantitative and visual analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of UnitModule in enhancing the input image and improving the perception ability of the detector for object features. ",

EPA achieves these goals by automatically augmenting the demonstrations with multiple sources/targets, where each of them paraphrases each other. This is well motivated as augmenting data via paraphrasing effectively improves neural language models. EPA thus employs paraphrasing as an augmentation method for in-context learning. Extensive experiments indicate that EPA effectively improves both NLU and NLG tasks, covering from natural language inference to machine translation in translating tens of languages.\\footnote{Code and data will be released upon publication.} ",

These methods require sufficiently large labeled data for stable learning, however acquiring high-quality labeled time series data can be costly and potentially infeasible. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved great success in enhancing unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. Nonetheless, to our best knowledge, it remains unclear how effectively GANs can serve as a general-purpose solution to learn representations for time series recognition, i.e., classification and clustering. The above considerations inspire us to introduce a Time-series Convolutional GAN (TCGAN). TCGAN learns by playing an adversarial game between two one-dimensional CNNs (i.e., a generator and a discriminator) in the absence of label information. Parts of the trained TCGAN are then reused to construct a representation encoder to empower linear recognition methods. We conducted comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that TCGAN is faster and more accurate than existing time-series GANs. The learned representations enable simple classification and clustering methods to achieve superior and stable performance. Furthermore, TCGAN retains high efficacy in scenarios with few-labeled and imbalanced-labeled data. Our work provides a promising path to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled time series data. ",

    "abstract": "The prediction of wind in terms of both wind speed and direction, which has a crucial impact on many real-world applications like aviation and wind power generation, is extremely challenging due to the high stochasticity and complicated correlation in the weather data. Existing methods typically focus on a sub-set of influential factors and thus lack a systematic treatment of the problem. In addition, fine-grained forecasting is essential for efficient industry operations, but has been less attended in the literature. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven model, Multi-Horizon SpatioTemporal Network (MHSTN), generally for accurate and efficient fine-grained wind prediction. MHSTN integrates multiple deep neural networks targeting different factors in a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) backbone to effectively extract features from various data sources and produce multi-horizon predictions for all sites within a given region. MHSTN is composed of four major modules. First, a temporal module fuses coarse-grained forecasts derived by Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and historical on-site observation data at stations so as to leverage both global and local atmospheric information. Second, a spatial module exploits spatial correlation by modeling the joint representation of all stations. Third, an ensemble module weighs the above two modules for final predictions. Furthermore, a covariate selection module automatically choose influential meteorological variables as initial input. MHSTN is already integrated into the scheduling platform of one of the busiest international airports of China. The evaluation results demonstrate that our model outperforms competitors by a significant margin. ",

    "abstract": "Starting with small and simple concepts, and gradually introducing complex and difficult concepts is the natural process of human learning. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) aim to mimic the way humans process information, but current SNNs models treat all samples equally, which does not align with the principles of human learning and overlooks the biological plausibility of SNNs. To address this, we propose a CL-SNN model that introduces Curriculum Learning(CL) into SNNs, making SNNs learn more like humans and providing higher biological interpretability. CL is a training strategy that advocates presenting easier data to models before gradually introducing more challenging data, mimicking the human learning process. We use a confidence-aware loss to measure and process the samples with different difficulty levels. By learning the confidence of different samples, the model reduces the contribution of difficult samples to parameter optimization automatically. We conducted experiments on static image datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10, and neuromorphic datasets N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture. The results are promising. To our best knowledge, this is the first proposal to enhance the biologically plausibility of SNNs by introducing CL. ",

However, a fixed augmentation policy may have different effects on each sample in different training stages but existing approaches cannot adjust the policy to be adaptive to each sample and the training model. In this paper, we propose Model Adaptive Data Augmentation (MADAug) that jointly trains an augmentation policy network to teach the model when to learn what. Unlike previous work, MADAug selects augmentation operators for each input image by a model-adaptive policy varying between training stages, producing a data augmentation curriculum optimized for better generalization. In MADAug, we train the policy through a bi-level optimization scheme, which aims to minimize a validation-set loss of a model trained using the policy-produced data augmentations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of MADAug on multiple image classification tasks and network architectures with thorough comparisons to existing DA approaches. MADAug outperforms or is on par with other baselines and exhibits better fairness: it brings improvement to all classes and more to the difficult ones. Moreover, MADAug learned policy shows better performance when transferred to fine-grained datasets. In addition, the auto-optimized policy in MADAug gradually introduces increasing perturbations and naturally forms an easy-to-hard curriculum. ",

Going beyond existing mirror approaches for 3D human pose estimation, we utilize mirrors for learning a complete body model, including shape and dense appearance. Our main contributions are extending articulated neural radiance fields to include a notion of a mirror, making it sample-efficient over potential occlusion regions. Together, our contributions realize a consumer-level 3D motion capture system that starts from off-the-shelf 2D poses by automatically calibrating the camera, estimating mirror orientation, and subsequently lifting 2D keypoint detections to 3D skeleton pose that is used to condition the mirror-aware NeRF.

However, current approaches, relying on full Navier-Stokes equations, are impractical for ultrafast Doppler ultrasound, the state-of-the-art technique for depiction of complex blood flow dynamics \\emph{in vivo} through acquired thousands of frames (or, timestamps) per second. In this article, we first propose a novel training framework of PINN for solving Navier-Stokes equations by discretizing Navier-Stokes equations into steady state and sequentially solving steady-state Navier-Stokes equations with transfer learning. The novel training framework is coined as SeqPINN. Upon the success of SeqPINN, we adopt the idea of averaged constant stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as initialization and propose a parallel training scheme for all timestamps. To ensure an initialization that generalizes well, we borrow the concept of Stochastic Weight Averaging Gaussian to perform uncertainty estimation as an indicator of generalizability of the initialization. This algorithm, named SP-PINN, further expedites training of PINN while achieving comparable accuracy with SeqPINN. Finite-element simulations and \\emph{in vitro} phantoms of single-branch and trifurcate blood vessels are used to evaluate the performance of SeqPINN and SP-PINN. Results show that both SeqPINN and SP-PINN are manyfold faster than the original design of PINN, while respectively achieving Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of 1.01 cm/s and 1.26 cm/s on the straight vessel and 1.91 cm/s and 2.56 cm/s on the trifurcate blood vessel when recovering blood flow velocities.

Such distinct properties of CP enable effective collaborations between human experts and medical AI models, allowing efficient intervention and quality check in clinical decision-making. In this paper, we propose a new method called Reliable-Region-Based Conformal Prediction (RR-CP), which aims to impose a stronger statistical guarantee so that the user-specified error rate (e.g., 0.5\\%) can be achieved in the test time, and under this constraint, the size of the prediction set is optimized (to be small). We consider a small prediction set size an important measure only when the user-specified error rate is achieved. Experiments on five public datasets show that our RR-CP performs well: with a reasonably small-sized prediction set, it achieves the user-specified error rate (e.g., 0.5\\%) significantly more frequently than exiting CP methods.

To protect the copyright of DNNs, backdoor-based ownership verification becomes popular recently, in which the model owner can watermark the model by embedding a specific backdoor behavior before releasing it. The defenders (usually the model owners) can identify whether a suspicious third-party model is ``stolen'' from them based on the presence of the behavior. Unfortunately, these watermarks are proven to be vulnerable to removal attacks even like fine-tuning. To further explore this vulnerability, we investigate the parameter space and find there exist many watermark-removed models in the vicinity of the watermarked one, which may be easily used by removal attacks. Inspired by this finding, we propose a mini-max formulation to find these watermark-removed models and recover their watermark behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves the robustness of the model watermarking against parametric changes and numerous watermark-removal attacks.

Existing methods are mainly targeted at designing complicated modules to implicitly learn latent degradation representation from coupled rainy images. This way, it is hard to decouple the content-independent degradation representation due to the lack of explicit constraint, resulting in over- or under-enhancement problems. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Latent Degradation Representation Constraint Network (LDRCNet) that consists of Direction-Aware Encoder (DAEncoder), UNet Deraining Network, and Multi-Scale Interaction Block (MSIBlock). Specifically, the DAEncoder is proposed to adaptively extract latent degradation representation by using the deformable convolutions to exploit the direction consistency of rain streaks. Next, a constraint loss is introduced to explicitly constraint the degradation representation learning during training. Last, we propose an MSIBlock to fuse with the learned degradation representation and decoder features of the deraining network for adaptive information interaction, which enables the deraining network to remove various complicated rainy patterns and reconstruct image details. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance. ",

Their aim is to decompose a non-stationary signal into quasi-stationary components which reveal better features in the time-frequency analysis. Recently, inspired by deep learning, we proposed a novel method called residual recursive convolutional neural network (RRCNN). Not only RRCNN can achieve more stable decomposition than existing methods while batch processing large-scale signals with low computational cost, but also deep learning provides a unique perspective for non-stationary signal decomposition. In this study, we aim to further improve RRCNN with the help of several nimble techniques from deep learning and optimization to ameliorate the method and overcome some of the limitations of this technique.

Surround Radar/Lidar can provide 360-degree view sampling with the minimal cost, which are promising sensing hardware solutions for autonomous driving systems. However, due to the intrinsic physical constraints, the rotating speed of surround Radar, and thus the frequency to generate Radar data frames, is much lower than surround Lidar. Existing Radar/Lidar fusion methods have to work at the low frequency of surround Radar, which cannot meet the high responsiveness requirement of autonomous driving systems.This paper develops techniques to fuse surround Radar/Lidar with working frequency only limited by the faster surround Lidar instead of the slower surround Radar, based on the state-of-the-art object detection model MVDNet. The basic idea of our approach is simple: we let MVDNet work with temporally unaligned data from Radar/Lidar, so that fusion can take place at any time when a new Lidar data frame arrives, instead of waiting for the slow Radar data frame. However, directly applying MVDNet to temporally unaligned Radar/Lidar data greatly degrades its object detection accuracy. The key information revealed in this paper is that we can achieve high output frequency with little accuracy loss by enhancing the training procedure to explore the temporal redundancy in MVDNet so that it can tolerate the temporal unalignment of input data. We explore several different ways of training enhancement and compare them quantitatively with experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Recent research indicates that the performance of machine learning models can be improved by aligning the geometry of the latent space with the underlying data structure. Rather than relying solely on Euclidean space, researchers have proposed using hyperbolic and spherical spaces with constant curvature, or combinations thereof, to better model the latent space and enhance model performance. However, little attention has been given to the problem of automatically identifying the optimal latent geometry for the downstream task. We mathematically define this novel formulation and coin it as neural latent geometry search (NLGS). More specifically, we introduce a principled method that searches for a latent geometry composed of a product of constant curvature model spaces with minimal query evaluations. To accomplish this, we propose a novel notion of distance between candidate latent geometries based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance from metric geometry. In order to compute the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, we introduce a mapping function that enables the comparison of different manifolds by embedding them in a common high-dimensional ambient space. Finally, we design a graph search space based on the calculated distances between candidate manifolds and use Bayesian optimization to search for the optimal latent geometry in a query-efficient manner. This is a general method which can be applied to search for the optimal latent geometry for a variety of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the efficacy of our method in identifying the optimal latent geometry for multiple machine learning problems. ",

Lack of annotated data prohibits direct inference of 3D semantic priors; instead, current State-of-the-art methods predominantly optimize geometric properties or require varying amounts of manual annotation. To overcome the lack of annotated training data, we distill semantic matches from pre-trained vision models: our method renders the pair of 3D shapes from multiple viewpoints; the resulting renders are then fed into an off-the-shelf image-matching method which leverages a pretrained visual model to produce feature points. This yields semantic correspondences, which can be projected back to the 3D shapes, producing a raw matching that is inaccurate and inconsistent between different viewpoints. These correspondences are refined and distilled into an inter-surface map by a dedicated optimization scheme, which promotes bijectivity and continuity of the output map. We illustrate that our approach can generate semantic surface-to-surface maps, eliminating manual annotations or any 3D training data requirement. Furthermore, it proves effective in scenarios with high semantic complexity, where objects are non-isometrically related, as well as in situations where they are nearly isometric. ",

We propose a novel descriptor, HAct - activation histograms, for OOD detection, that is, probability distributions (approximated by histograms) of output values of neural network layers under the influence of incoming data. We demonstrate that HAct is significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art on multiple OOD image classification benchmarks. For instance, our approach achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of 95% with only 0.05% false-positives using Resnet-50 on standard OOD benchmarks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art by 20.66% in the false positive rate (at the same TPR of 95%). The low computational complexity and the ease of implementation make HAct suitable for online implementation in monitoring deployed neural networks in practice at scale. ",

However, to the best of our knowledge, all the existing methods in human pose forecasting perform predictions at preset, discrete time intervals. Therefore, we introduce AnyPose, a lightweight continuous-time neural architecture that models human behavior dynamics with neural ordinary differential equations. We validate our framework on the Human3.6M, AMASS, and 3DPW dataset and conduct a series of comprehensive analyses towards comparison with existing methods and the intersection of human pose and neural ordinary differential equations. Our results demonstrate that AnyPose exhibits high-performance accuracy in predicting future poses and takes significantly lower computational time than traditional methods in solving anytime prediction tasks.

    "abstract": "Text augmentation is a technique for constructing synthetic data from an under-resourced corpus to improve predictive performance. Synthetic data generation is common in numerous domains. However, recently text augmentation has emerged in natural language processing (NLP) to improve downstream tasks. One of the current state-of-the-art text augmentation techniques is easy data augmentation (EDA), which augments the training data by injecting and replacing synonyms and randomly permuting sentences. One major obstacle with EDA is the need for versatile and complete synonym dictionaries, which cannot be easily found in low-resource languages. To improve the utility of EDA, we propose two extensions, easy distributional data augmentation (EDDA) and type specific similar word replacement (TSSR), which uses semantic word context information and part-of-speech tags for word replacement and augmentation. In an extensive empirical evaluation, we show the utility of the proposed methods, measured by F1 score, on two representative datasets in Swedish as an example of a low-resource language. With the proposed methods, we show that augmented data improve classification performances in low-resource settings. ",

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity of space systems is an emerging topic, but there is no single dataset that documents cyber attacks against space systems that have occurred in the past. These incidents are often scattered in media reports while missing many details, which we dub the missing-data problem. Nevertheless, even \"low-quality\" datasets containing such reports would be extremely valuable because of the dearth of space cybersecurity data and the sensitivity of space systems which are often restricted from disclosure by governments. This prompts a research question: How can we characterize real-world cyber attacks against space systems? In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a framework, including metrics, while also addressing the missing-data problem, by \"extrapolating\" the missing data in a principled fashion. To show the usefulness of the framework, we extract data for 72 cyber attacks against space systems and show how to extrapolate this \"low-quality\" dataset to derive 4,076 attack technique kill chains. Our findings include: cyber attacks against space systems are getting increasingly sophisticated; and, successful protection against on-path and social engineering attacks could have prevented 80% of the attacks.

Despite significant research progress in recommender attack and defense, there is a lack of a widely-recognized benchmarking standard in the field, leading to unfair performance comparison and limited credibility of experiments. To address this, we propose RecAD, a unified library aiming at establishing an open benchmark for recommender attack and defense. RecAD takes an initial step to set up a unified benchmarking pipeline for reproducible research by integrating diverse datasets, standard source codes, hyper-parameter settings, running logs, attack knowledge, attack budget, and evaluation results. The benchmark is designed to be comprehensive and sustainable, covering both attack, defense, and evaluation tasks, enabling more researchers to easily follow and contribute to this promising field. RecAD will drive more solid and reproducible research on recommender systems attack and defense, reduce the redundant efforts of researchers, and ultimately increase the credibility and practical value of recommender attack and defense.

To examine the impact of network connectivity and system dynamics on the emergence of cascading failures, we consider a time-delayed network model of the platoon of vehicles as a benchmark. To study the cascading effects among pairs of vehicles in the platoon, we use the measure of conditional distributionally robust functional. We extend the risk framework to quantify cascading failures by utilizing a bi-variate normal distribution. Our work establishes closed-form risk formulas that illustrate the effects of time-delay, noise statistics, underlying communication graph, and sets of soft failures. The insights gained from our research can be applied to design safe platoons that are robust to the risk of cascading failures. We validate our results through extensive simulations. ",

In contrast, LONER uses LiDAR data to train an MLP to estimate a dense map in real-time, while simultaneously estimating the trajectory of the sensor. To achieve real-time performance, this paper proposes a novel information-theoretic loss function that accounts for the fact that different regions of the map may be learned to varying degrees throughout online training. % different regions of the map having varying degrees of uncertainty during online operation. The proposed method is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on two open-source datasets. This evaluation illustrates that the proposed loss function converges faster and leads to more accurate geometry reconstruction than other loss functions used in depth-supervised neural implicit frameworks. Finally, this paper shows that LONER estimates trajectories competitively with state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM methods, while also producing dense maps competitive with existing real-time implicit mapping methods that use groundtruth poses.

Applications with significant hotspots can benefit from the great computation capacity improvement of Sunway many-core architectures by carefully making intensive manual many-core parallelization efforts. However, some legacy projects with large codebases, such as CESM, ROMS and WRF, contain numerous lines of code and do not have significant hotspots. The cost of manually porting such applications to the Sunway architecture is almost unaffordable. To overcome such a challenge, we have developed a toolkit named O2ATH. O2ATH forwards GNU OpenMP runtime library calls to Sunway's Athread library, which greatly simplifies the parallelization work on the Sunway architecture.O2ATH enables users to write both MPE and CPE code in a single file, and parallelization can be achieved by utilizing OpenMP directives and attributes. In practice, O2ATH has helped us to port two large projects, CESM and ROMS, to the CPEs of the next generation Sunway supercomputers via the OpenMP offload method. In the experiments, kernel speedups range from 3 to 15 times, resulting in 3 to 6 times whole application speedups.Furthermore, O2ATH requires significantly fewer code modifications compared to manually crafting CPE functions.This indicates that O2ATH can greatly enhance development efficiency when porting or optimizing large software projects on Sunway supercomputers.

In particular, it requires the distance distribution of the nearest interferer and the conditional average of the rest of the interference. Using the widely studied fractional path-loss inversion power control and modeling the spatial locations of base stations (BSs) by a Poisson point process (PPP), we obtain the meta distribution based on the proposed method and compare it with the traditional beta approximation, as well as the exact results obtained via Monte-Carlo simulations.

To address the dilemma, we propose to convert the GFSID task into the class incremental learning paradigm. Specifically, we propose a two-stage learning framework, which sequentially learns the knowledge of different intents in various periods via prompt learning. And then we exploit prototypes for categorizing both seen and novel intents. Furthermore, to achieve the transfer knowledge of intents in different stages, for different scenarios we design two knowledge preservation methods which close to realistic applications. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses on two widely used datasets show that our framework based on the class incremental learning paradigm achieves promising performance. ",

    "abstract": "Endowing robots with the human ability to learn a growing set of skills over the course of a lifetime as opposed to mastering single tasks is an open problem in robot learning. While multi-task learning approaches have been proposed to address this problem, they pay little attention to task inference. In order to continually learn new tasks, the robot first needs to infer the task at hand without requiring predefined task representations. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised task inference approach. Our approach learns action and intention embeddings from self-organization of the observed movement and effect parts of unlabeled demonstrations and a higher-level behavior embedding from self-organization of the joint action-intention embeddings. We construct a behavior-matching self-supervised learning objective to train a novel Task Inference Network (TINet) to map an unlabeled demonstration to its nearest behavior embedding, which we use as the task representation. A multi-task policy is built on top of the TINet and trained with reinforcement learning to optimize performance over tasks. We evaluate our approach in the fixed-set and continual multi-task learning settings with a humanoid robot and compare it to different multi-task learning baselines. The results show that our approach outperforms the other baselines, with the difference being more pronounced in the challenging continual learning setting, and can infer tasks from incomplete demonstrations. Our approach is also shown to generalize to unseen tasks based on a single demonstration in one-shot task generalization experiments. ",

Recently, this subject was explored by Chiarelli et al.~[Algorithmica'22] from the classical complexity perspective to draw the boundary between {\\sf NP}-hardness and tractability for a constant number of agents. The problem was shown to be hard even for small constant number of agents and various other restrictions on the underlying graph. Notwithstanding this computational barrier, we notice that there are several parameters that are worth studying: number of agents, number of items, combinatorial structure that defines the conflict among the items, all of which could well be small under specific circumstancs. Our search rules out several parameters (even when taken together) and takes us towards a characterization of families of input instances that are amenable to polynomial time algorithms when the parameters are constant. In addition to this we give a superior $2^{m}|I|^{\\Co{O}(1)}$ algorithm for our problem where $m$ denotes the number of items that significantly beats the exhaustive $\\Oh(m^{m})$ algorithm by cleverly using ideas from FFT based fast polynomial multiplication; and we identify simple graph classes relevant to our problem's motivation that admit efficient algorithms.

However, existing methods are limited to objects and indoor scenes. In this work, we extend the generalization task to outdoor scenes, trained only on object-level datasets. This approach presents two challenges. Firstly, the significant distributional shift between training and testing scenes leads to black artifacts in rendering results. Secondly, viewpoint changes in outdoor scenes cause ghosting or missing regions in rendered images. To address these challenges, we propose a geometric correction module and an appearance correction module based on multi-head attention mechanisms. We normalize rendered depth and combine it with light direction as query in the attention mechanism. Our network effectively corrects varying scene structures and geometric features in outdoor scenes, generalizing well from object-level to unseen outdoor scenes. Additionally, we use appearance correction module to correct appearance features, preventing rendering artifacts like blank borders and ghosting due to viewpoint changes. By combining these modules, our approach successfully tackles the challenges of outdoor scene generalization, producing high-quality rendering results. When evaluated on four datasets (Blender, DTU, LLFF, Spaces), our network outperforms previous methods. Notably, compared to MVSNeRF, our network improves average PSNR from 19.369 to 25.989, SSIM from 0.838 to 0.889, and reduces LPIPS from 0.265 to 0.224 on Spaces outdoor scenes. ",

    "abstract": "Community Question Answering (CQA) in different domains is growing at a large scale because of the availability of several platforms and huge shareable information among users. With the rapid growth of such online platforms, a massive amount of archived data makes it difficult for moderators to retrieve possible duplicates for a new question and identify and confirm existing question pairs as duplicates at the right time. This problem is even more critical in CQAs corresponding to large software systems like askubuntu where moderators need to be experts to comprehend something as a duplicate. Note that the prime challenge in such CQA platforms is that the moderators are themselves experts and are therefore usually extremely busy with their time being extraordinarily expensive. To facilitate the task of the moderators, in this work, we have tackled two significant issues for the askubuntu CQA platform: (1) retrieval of duplicate questions given a new question and (2) duplicate question confirmation time prediction. In the first task, we focus on retrieving duplicate questions from a question pool for a particular newly posted question. In the second task, we solve a regression problem to rank a pair of questions that could potentially take a long time to get confirmed as duplicates. For duplicate question retrieval, we propose a Siamese neural network based approach by exploiting both text and network-based features, which outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline techniques. Our method outperforms DupPredictor and DUPE by 5% and 7% respectively. For duplicate confirmation time prediction, we have used both the standard machine learning models and neural network along with the text and graph-based features. We obtain Spearman's rank correlation of 0.20 and 0.213 (statistically significant) for text and graph based features respectively. ",

While promising performance has been shown on seen noise distributions, existing approaches often suffer from generalisation to unseen noise types or general and real noise. It is understandable as the model is designed to learn paired mapping (e.g. from a noisy image to its clean version). In this paper, we instead propose to learn to disentangle the noisy image, under the intuitive assumption that different corrupted versions of the same clean image share a common latent space. A self-supervised learning framework is proposed to achieve the goal, without looking at the latent clean image. By taking two different corrupted versions of the same image as input, the proposed Multi-view Self-supervised Disentanglement (MeD) approach learns to disentangle the latent clean features from the corruptions and recover the clean image consequently. Extensive experimental analysis on both synthetic and real noise shows the superiority of the proposed method over prior self-supervised approaches, especially on unseen novel noise types. On real noise, the proposed method even outperforms its supervised counterparts by over 3 dB. ",

One such tool that has gained significant attention in the recent years is DNN fault localization. This paper revisits mutation-based fault localization in the context of DNN models and proposes a novel technique, named deepmufl, applicable to a wide range of DNN models. We have implemented deepmufl and have evaluated its effectiveness using 109 bugs obtained from StackOverflow.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the task of zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection, a novel paradigm for identifying HOIs without the need for task-specific annotations. To address this challenging task, we employ CLIP, a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), for knowledge distillation on multiple levels. Specifically, we design a multi-branch neural network that leverages CLIP for learning HOI representations at various levels, including global images, local union regions encompassing human-object pairs, and individual instances of humans or objects. To train our model, CLIP is utilized to generate HOI scores for both global images and local union regions that serve as supervision signals. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel multi-level CLIP knowledge integration strategy. Notably, the model achieves strong performance, which is even comparable with some fully-supervised and weakly-supervised methods on the public HICO-DET benchmark. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting traffic incident risks at granular spatiotemporal levels is challenging. The datasets predominantly feature zero values, indicating no incidents, with sporadic high-risk values for severe incidents. Notably, a majority of current models, especially deep learning methods, focus solely on estimating risk values, overlooking the uncertainties arising from the inherently unpredictable nature of incidents. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Zero-Inflated Tweedie Graph Neural Networks (STZITD-GNNs). Our model merges the reliability of traditional statistical models with the flexibility of graph neural networks, aiming to precisely quantify uncertainties associated with road-level traffic incident risks. This model strategically employs a compound model from the Tweedie family, as a Poisson distribution to model risk frequency and a Gamma distribution to account for incident severity. Furthermore, a zero-inflated component helps to identify the non-incident risk scenarios. As a result, the STZITD-GNNs effectively capture the dataset's skewed distribution, placing emphasis on infrequent but impactful severe incidents. Empirical tests using real-world traffic data from London, UK, demonstrate that our model excels beyond current benchmarks. The forte of STZITD-GNN resides not only in its accuracy but also in its adeptness at curtailing uncertainties, delivering robust predictions over short (7 days) and extended (14 days) timeframes. ",

    "title": "Secure Set-Based State Estimation for Linear Systems under Adversarial  Attacks on Sensors",
    "abstract": "When a strategic adversary can attack multiple sensors of a system and freely choose a different set of sensors at different times, how can we ensure that the state estimate remains uncorrupted by the attacker? The existing literature addressing this problem mandates that the adversary can only corrupt less than half of the total number of sensors. This limitation is fundamental to all point-based secure state estimators because of their dependence on algorithms that rely on majority voting among sensors. However, in reality, an adversary with ample resources may not be limited to attacking less than half of the total number of sensors. This paper avoids the above-mentioned fundamental limitation by proposing a set-based approach that allows attacks on all but one sensor at any given time. We guarantee that the true state is always contained in the estimated set, which is represented by a collection of constrained zonotopes, provided that the system is bounded-input-bounded-state stable and redundantly observable via every combination of sensor subsets with size equal to the number of uncompromised sensors. Additionally, we show that the estimated set is secure and stable irrespective of the attack signals if the process and measurement noises are bounded. To detect the set of attacked sensors at each time, we propose a simple attack detection technique. However, we acknowledge that intelligently designed stealthy attacks may not be detected and, in the worst-case scenario, could even result in exponential growth in the algorithm's complexity. We alleviate this shortcoming by presenting a range of strategies that offer different levels of trade-offs between estimation performance and complexity. ",

Signal temporal logic (STL) has been widely used to systematically and rigorously specify these requirements. However, traditional methods of finding the control policy under those STL requirements are computationally complex and not scalable to high-dimensional or systems with complex nonlinear dynamics. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods can learn the policy to satisfy the STL specifications via hand-crafted or STL-inspired rewards, but might encounter unexpected behaviors due to ambiguity and sparsity in the reward. In this paper, we propose a method to directly learn a neural network controller to satisfy the requirements specified in STL. Our controller learns to roll out trajectories to maximize the STL robustness score in training. In testing, similar to Model Predictive Control (MPC), the learned controller predicts a trajectory within a planning horizon to ensure the satisfaction of the STL requirement in deployment. A backup policy is designed to ensure safety when our controller fails. Our approach can adapt to various initial conditions and environmental parameters. We conduct experiments on six tasks, where our method with the backup policy outperforms the classical methods (MPC, STL-solver), model-free and model-based RL methods in STL satisfaction rate, especially on tasks with complex STL specifications while being 10X-100X faster than the classical methods.

A plethora of works based on adversarial training and regularization-based techniques have been proposed to make these deep networks robust against adversarial attacks. However, these methods require either retraining models or training them from scratch, making them infeasible to defend pre-trained models when access to training data is restricted. To address this problem, we propose a test time Data-free Adversarial Defense (DAD) containing detection and correction frameworks. Moreover, to further improve the efficacy of the correction framework in cases when the detector is under-confident, we propose a soft-detection scheme (dubbed as \"DAD++\"). We conduct a wide range of experiments and ablations on several datasets and network architectures to show the efficacy of our proposed approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach in imparting adversarial defense at test time under data-free (or data-efficient) applications/setups, such as Data-free Knowledge Distillation and Source-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, as well as Semi-supervised classification frameworks. We observe that in all the experiments and applications, our DAD++ gives an impressive performance against various adversarial attacks with a minimal drop in clean accuracy.

SKIL is a loss designed for thin object segmentation that leverages the skeleton of the label. A dataset of rock face images was collected, manually annotated, and augmented with generated data. A new group of metrics, LineAcc, has been proposed for thin object segmentation such that the impact of the object width on the score is minimized. In addition, the metric is less sensitive to translation which can often lead to a score of zero when computing classical metrics such as Dice on thin objects. Our fine-tuned models outperform previous methods on similar thin object segmentation tasks such as blood vessel segmentation and show promise for integration onto a robotic system. ",

While traditional robust learning methods and the recent adversarial training approaches are designed to handle each of the two challenges, to date, no work has been done to develop models that are robust with regard to the low-quality training data and the potential adversarial attack at inference time simultaneously. It is for this reason that we introduce Outlier Robust Adversarial Training (ORAT) in this work. ORAT is based on a bi-level optimization formulation of adversarial training with a robust rank-based loss function. Theoretically, we show that the learning objective of ORAT satisfies the $\\mathcal{H}$-consistency in binary classification, which establishes it as a proper surrogate to adversarial 0/1 loss. Furthermore, we analyze its generalization ability and provide uniform convergence rates in high probability. ORAT can be optimized with a simple algorithm. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ORAT in handling outliers and adversarial attacks.

Second, conformance to the accepted CT code discipline permits two code patterns that are unsafe in the post-Spectre era. Third, once these code patterns are addressed, all Spectre leakage of secrets in CT programs can be attributed to one of four classes of taint primitives--instructions that can transiently assign a secret value to a publicly-typed register. We evaluate Serberus on cryptographic primitives in the OpenSSL, Libsodium, and HACL* libraries.

AV companies typically focus on collecting data from diverse scenarios and locations, but not camera rig configurations, due to cost. As a result, only a small number of rig variations exist across most fleets. In this paper, we study how AV perception models are affected by changes in camera viewpoint and propose a way to scale them across vehicle types without repeated data collection and labeling. Using bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation as a motivating task, we find through extensive experiments that existing perception models are surprisingly sensitive to changes in camera viewpoint. When trained with data from one camera rig, small changes to pitch, yaw, depth, or height of the camera at inference time lead to large drops in performance. We introduce a technique for novel view synthesis and use it to transform collected data to the viewpoint of target rigs, allowing us to train BEV segmentation models for diverse target rigs without any additional data collection or labeling cost. To analyze the impact of viewpoint changes, we leverage synthetic data to mitigate other gaps (content, ISP, etc). Our approach is then trained on real data and evaluated on synthetic data, enabling evaluation on diverse target rigs. We release all data for use in future work. Our method is able to recover an average of 14.7% of the IoU that is otherwise lost when deploying to new rigs. ",

In the case of a general high-order linear agent dynamics, each agent has to estimate exponential evolution of its trajectory characterized by eigenvalues of a system matrix, which is different from single/double integrator or first-order linear agents. Our proposed method deals with exponential behaviors of the agents by tightly evaluating the bounds on matrix exponentials. Based on these bound, we design the self-triggered controller through a cloud which achieves bounded state synchronization of the closed-loop system without exhibiting any Zeno behaviors.

To utilize multiple knowledge bases (KB), previous works merge all KBs into a single graph via entity alignment and reduce the problem to question-answering (QA) over the fused KB.

In addition to the identity between the alignable entities (i.e. full link), unalignable entities expressing the different aspects or types of an abstract concept may also be treated identical in a question (i.e. partial link). Hence, the KB fusion in prior works fails to represent all types of links, restricting their ability to comprehend multi-KBs for QA. In this work, we formulate the novel Multi-KB-QA task that leverages the full and partial links among multiple KBs to derive correct answers, a benchmark with diversified link and query types is also constructed to efficiently evaluate Multi-KB-QA performance. Finally, we propose a method for Multi-KB-QA that encodes all link relations in the KB embedding to score and rank candidate answers.

Existing contrastive learning methods mainly focus on achieving temporal consistency with temporal augmentation and contrasting techniques, aiming to preserve temporal patterns against perturbations for MTS data. However, they overlook spatial consistency that requires the stability of individual sensors and their correlations. As MTS data typically originate from multiple sensors, ensuring spatial consistency becomes essential for the overall performance of contrastive learning on MTS data. Thus, we propose Graph Contextual Contrasting (GCC) for spatial consistency across MTS data. Specifically, we propose graph augmentations including node and edge augmentations to preserve the stability of sensors and their correlations, followed by graph contrasting with both node- and graph-level contrasting to extract robust sensor- and global-level features. We further introduce multi-window temporal contrasting to ensure temporal consistency in the data for each sensor.

In this paper, we take two data augmentation techniques, namely Resizing-Cropping and Splitting-Permuting, to fully exploit the potential of training datasets. Specifically, the original image and the generated two augmented images are fed into the training pipeline simultaneously and we leverage them to conduct self-distillation. Additionally, we introduce the detail-enhanced DepthNet with an extra full-scale branch in the encoder and a grid decoder to enhance the restoration of fine details in depth maps. Experimental results demonstrate our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark, with both raw ground truth and improved ground truth. Moreover, our models also show superior generalization performance when transferring to Make3D and NYUv2 datasets. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Sauf4896/BDEdepth. ",

    "abstract": "Along with the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), optimizing the use of EV charging space can significantly alleviate the growing load on intelligent transportation systems. As the foundation to achieve such an optimization, a spatiotemporal method for EV charging demand prediction in urban areas is required. Although several solutions have been proposed by using data-driven deep learning methods, it can be found that these performance-oriented methods may suffer from misinterpretations to correctly handle the reverse relationship between charging demands and prices. To tackle the emerging challenges of training an accurate and interpretable prediction model, this paper proposes a novel approach that enables the integration of graph and temporal attention mechanisms for feature extraction and the usage of physic-informed meta-learning in the model pre-training step for knowledge transfer. Evaluation results on a dataset of 18,013 EV charging piles in Shenzhen, China, show that the proposed approach, named PAG, can achieve state-of-the-art forecasting performance and the ability in understanding the adaptive changes in charging demands caused by price fluctuations.

    "abstract": "Automated detection of Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) from Ultrasound (US) images is an important problem, which has drawn increased interest from researchers. However, most of these works use difficult-to-acquire information such as bounding box annotations or additional US videos. In this paper, we focus on GBC detection using only image-level labels. Such annotation is usually available based on the diagnostic report of a patient, and do not require additional annotation effort from the physicians. However, our analysis reveals that it is difficult to train a standard image classification model for GBC detection. This is due to the low inter-class variance (a malignant region usually occupies only a small portion of a US image), high intra-class variance (due to the US sensor capturing a 2D slice of a 3D object leading to large viewpoint variations), and low training data availability. We posit that even when we have only the image level label, still formulating the problem as object detection (with bounding box output) helps a deep neural network (DNN) model focus on the relevant region of interest. Since no bounding box annotations is available for training, we pose the problem as weakly supervised object detection (WSOD). Motivated by the recent success of transformer models in object detection, we train one such model, DETR, using multi-instance-learning (MIL) with self-supervised instance selection to suit the WSOD task. Our proposed method demonstrates an improvement of AP and detection sensitivity over the SOTA transformer-based and CNN-based WSOD methods. Project page is at https://gbc-iitd.github.io/wsod-gbc ",

Automated evolutionary mechanisms of biological network structure inspire us to explore efficient architectural optimization for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs).

Locally, the brain region-inspired module consists of multiple neural motifs with excitatory and inhibitory connections; Globally, we evolve free connections among modules, including long-term cross-module feedforward and feedback connections.

Extensive experiments on static datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100) and neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128-Gesture) demonstrate that our proposed model boosts energy efficiency, archiving consistent and remarkable performance.

    "abstract": "Causal discovery is a powerful technique for identifying causal relationships among variables in data. It has been widely used in various applications in software engineering. Causal discovery extensively involves conditional independence (CI) tests. Hence, its output quality highly depends on the performance of CI tests, which can often be unreliable in practice. Moreover, privacy concerns arise when excessive CI tests are performed. Despite the distinct nature between unreliable and excessive CI tests, this paper identifies a unified and principled approach to addressing both of them. Generally, CI statements, the outputs of CI tests, adhere to Pearl's axioms, which are a set of well-established integrity constraints on conditional independence. Hence, we can either detect erroneous CI statements if they violate Pearl's axioms or prune excessive CI statements if they are logically entailed by Pearl's axioms. Holistically, both problems boil down to reasoning about the consistency of CI statements under Pearl's axioms (referred to as CIR problem). We propose a runtime verification tool called CICheck, designed to harden causal discovery algorithms from reliability and privacy perspectives. CICheck employs a sound and decidable encoding scheme that translates CIR into SMT problems. To solve the CIR problem efficiently, CICheck introduces a four-stage decision procedure with three lightweight optimizations that actively prove or refute consistency, and only resort to costly SMT-based reasoning when necessary. Based on the decision procedure to CIR, CICheck includes two variants: ED-CICheck and ED-CICheck, which detect erroneous CI tests (to enhance reliability) and prune excessive CI tests (to enhance privacy), respectively.

To explore useful knowledge from real-world data, both the large-scale encyclopedic HG datasets and corresponding effective learning methods are crucial, but haven't been well investigated. In this paper, we construct a large-scale HG benchmark dataset named UniKG from Wikidata to facilitate knowledge mining and heterogeneous graph representation learning. Overall, UniKG contains more than 77 million multi-attribute entities and 2000 diverse association types, which significantly surpasses the scale of existing HG datasets. To perform effective learning on the large-scale UniKG, two key measures are taken, including (i) the semantic alignment strategy for multi-attribute entities, which projects the feature description of multi-attribute nodes into a common embedding space to facilitate node aggregation in a large receptive field; (ii) proposing a novel plug-and-play anisotropy propagation module (APM) to learn effective multi-hop anisotropy propagation kernels, which extends methods of large-scale homogeneous graphs to heterogeneous graphs. These two strategies enable efficient information propagation among a tremendous number of multi-attribute entities and meantimes adaptively mine multi-attribute association through the multi-hop aggregation in large-scale HGs. We set up a node classification task on our UniKG dataset, and evaluate multiple baseline methods which are constructed by embedding our APM into large-scale homogenous graph learning methods.

While previous methods have focused on using either regularization or rehearsal-based frameworks to alleviate catastrophic forgetting in image classification, they are limited to a single modality and cannot learn compact class-aware cross-modal representations for continual audio-visual learning. To address this gap, we propose a novel class-incremental grouping network (CIGN) that can learn category-wise semantic features to achieve continual audio-visual learning. Our CIGN leverages learnable audio-visual class tokens and audio-visual grouping to continually aggregate class-aware features. Additionally, it utilizes class tokens distillation and continual grouping to prevent forgetting parameters learned from previous tasks, thereby improving the model's ability to capture discriminative audio-visual categories. We conduct extensive experiments on VGGSound-Instruments, VGGSound-100, and VGG-Sound Sources benchmarks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the CIGN achieves state-of-the-art audio-visual class-incremental learning performance. Code is available at https://github.com/stoneMo/CIGN. ",

With its sequential and multi-source (multiple sensors) properties, MTS data inherently exhibits Spatial-Temporal (ST) dependencies, involving temporal correlations between timestamps and spatial correlations between sensors in each timestamp. To effectively leverage this information, Graph Neural Network-based methods (GNNs) have been widely adopted. However, existing approaches separately capture spatial dependency and temporal dependency and fail to capture the correlations between Different sEnsors at Different Timestamps (DEDT). Overlooking such correlations hinders the comprehensive modelling of ST dependencies within MTS data, thus restricting existing GNNs from learning effective representations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method called Fully-Connected Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (FC-STGNN), including two key components namely FC graph construction and FC graph convolution. For graph construction, we design a decay graph to connect sensors across all timestamps based on their temporal distances, enabling us to fully model the ST dependencies by considering the correlations between DEDT. Further, we devise FC graph convolution with a moving-pooling GNN layer to effectively capture the ST dependencies for learning effective representations. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of FC-STGNN on multiple MTS datasets compared to SOTA methods. ",

In this paper, we use a neural network architecture which leverages the long-known Koopman operator theory to embed dynamical systems in latent spaces where their dynamics can be described linearly, enabling a number of appealing features. We introduce methods that enable to train such a model for long-term continuous reconstruction, even in difficult contexts where the data comes in irregularly-sampled time series. The potential for self-supervised learning is also demonstrated, as we show the promising use of trained dynamical models as priors for variational data assimilation techniques, with applications to e.g. time series interpolation and forecasting.

Therefore, it is difficult to train a model to complete these two tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we unify the task of anonymization and visual identity information hiding and propose a novel face privacy protection method based on diffusion models, dubbed Diff-Privacy. Specifically, we train our proposed multi-scale image inversion module (MSI) to obtain a set of SDM format conditional embeddings of the original image.

In step-based analog-valued neural network models (ANNs), the concept is almost absent. In their spiking neuroscience-inspired counterparts, there is hardly a systematic account of their effects on model performance in terms of accuracy and number of synaptic operations.This paper proposes a methodology for accounting for axonal delays in the training loop of deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), intending to efficiently solve machine learning tasks on data with rich temporal dependencies. We then conduct an empirical study of the effects of axonal delays on model performance during inference for the Adding task, a benchmark for sequential regression, and for the Spiking Heidelberg Digits dataset (SHD), commonly used for evaluating event-driven models. Quantitative results on the SHD show that SNNs incorporating axonal delays instead of explicit recurrent synapses achieve state-of-the-art, over 90% test accuracy while needing less than half trainable synapses. Additionally, we estimate the required memory in terms of total parameters and energy consumption of accomodating such delay-trained models on a modern neuromorphic accelerator. These estimations are based on the number of synaptic operations and the reference GF-22nm FDX CMOS technology. As a result, we demonstrate that a reduced parameterization, which incorporates axonal delays, leads to approximately 90% energy and memory reduction in digital hardware implementations for a similar performance in the aforementioned task.

Our method FlowIBR circumvents these issues by integrating a neural image-based rendering method, pre-trained on a large corpus of widely available static scenes, with a per-scene optimized scene flow field. Utilizing this flow field, we bend the camera rays to counteract the scene dynamics, thereby presenting the dynamic scene as if it were static to the rendering network.

    "abstract": "Link prediction is a key aspect of graph machine learning, with applications as diverse as disease prediction, social network recommendations, and drug discovery. It involves predicting new links that may form between network nodes. Despite the clear importance of link prediction, existing models have significant shortcomings. Graph Convolutional Networks, for instance, have been proven to be highly efficient for link prediction on a variety of datasets. However, they encounter severe limitations when applied to short-path networks and ego networks, resulting in poor performance. This presents a critical problem space that this work aims to address. In this paper, we present the Node Centrality and Similarity Based Parameterised Model (NCSM), a novel method for link prediction tasks. NCSM uniquely integrates node centrality and similarity measures as edge features in a customised Graph Neural Network (GNN) layer, effectively leveraging the topological information of large networks. This model represents the first parameterised GNN-based link prediction model that considers topological information. The proposed model was evaluated on five benchmark graph datasets, each comprising thousands of nodes and edges. Experimental results highlight NCSM's superiority over existing state-of-the-art models like Graph Convolutional Networks and Variational Graph Autoencoder, as it outperforms them across various metrics and datasets. This exceptional performance can be attributed to NCSM's innovative integration of node centrality, similarity measures, and its efficient use of topological information. ",

    "title": "Quantized Fourier and Polynomial Features for more Expressive Tensor  Network Models",
    "abstract": "In the context of kernel machines, polynomial and Fourier features are commonly used to provide a nonlinear extension to linear models by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space. Unless one considers the dual formulation of the learning problem, which renders exact large-scale learning unfeasible, the exponential increase of model parameters in the dimensionality of the data caused by their tensor-product structure prohibits to tackle high-dimensional problems. One of the possible approaches to circumvent this exponential scaling is to exploit the tensor structure present in the features by constraining the model weights to be an underparametrized tensor network. In this paper we quantize, i.e. further tensorize, polynomial and Fourier features. Based on this feature quantization we propose to quantize the associated model weights, yielding quantized models. We show that, for the same number of model parameters, the resulting quantized models have a higher bound on the VC-dimension as opposed to their non-quantized counterparts, at no additional computational cost while learning from identical features. We verify experimentally how this additional tensorization regularizes the learning problem by prioritizing the most salient features in the data and how it provides models with increased generalization capabilities. We finally benchmark our approach on large regression task, achieving state-of-the-art results on a laptop computer. ",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the works of Goldreich and Ron (J. ACM, 2017) and Nakar and Ron (ICALP, 2021), we initiate the study of property testing in dynamic environments with arbitrary topologies. Our focus is on the simplest non-trivial rule that can be tested, which corresponds to the 1-BP rule of bootstrap percolation and models a simple spreading behavior: Every \"infected\" node stays infected forever, and each \"healthy\" node becomes infected if and only if it has at least one infected neighbor. We show various results for both the case where we test a single time step of evolution and where the evolution spans several time steps. In the first, we show that the worst-case query complexity is $O(\\Delta/\\varepsilon)$ or $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}/\\varepsilon)$ (whichever is smaller), where $\\Delta$ and $n$ are the maximum degree of a node and number of vertices, respectively, in the underlying graph, and we also show lower bounds for both one- and two-sided error testers that match our upper bounds up to $\\Delta = o(\\sqrt{n})$ and $\\Delta = O(n^{1/3})$, respectively. In the second setting of testing the environment over $T$ time steps, we show upper bounds of $O(\\Delta^{T-1}/\\varepsilon T)$ and $\\tilde{O}(|E|/\\varepsilon T)$, where $E$ is the set of edges of the underlying graph. All of our algorithms are one-sided error, and all of them are also time-conforming and non-adaptive, with the single exception of the more complex $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}/\\varepsilon)$-query tester for the case $T = 2$.

Different from the existing work, our research focuses on investigating the zero-shot learning on extracting this information together by providing minimum information to the GPT model. We utilize de-identified real-world clinical notes annotated for demographics, various social determinants, and family history information. Given that the GPT model might provide text different from the text in the original data, we explore two sets of evaluation metrics, including the traditional NER evaluation metrics and semantic similarity evaluation metrics, to completely understand the performance. Our results show that the GPT-3.5 method achieved an average of 0.975 F1 on demographics extraction, 0.615 F1 on social determinants extraction, and 0.722 F1 on family history extraction. We believe these results can be further improved through model fine-tuning or few-shots learning. Through the case studies, we also identified the limitations of the GPT models, which need to be addressed in future research. ",

However, surveys show that performance of recent AL methods is very sensitive to the choice of dataset and training setting, making them unsuitable for general application. In order to tackle this problem, the field Learning Active Learning (LAL) suggests to learn the active learning strategy itself, allowing it to adapt to the given setting. In this work, we propose a novel LAL method for classification that exploits symmetry and independence properties of the active learning problem with an Attentive Conditional Neural Process model. Our approach is based on learning from a myopic oracle, which gives our model the ability to adapt to non-standard objectives, such as those that do not equally weight the error on all data points. We experimentally verify that our Neural Process model outperforms a variety of baselines in these settings. Finally, our experiments show that our model exhibits a tendency towards improved stability to changing datasets. However, performance is sensitive to choice of classifier and more work is necessary to reduce the performance the gap with the myopic oracle and to improve scalability. We present our work as a proof-of-concept for LAL on nonstandard objectives and hope our analysis and modelling considerations inspire future LAL work. ",

Among the potential threats are physical attacks, including those orchestrated by malicious insiders within data centers where the quantum computers are located, which could compromise the integrity of computations and resulting data.

This work first introduces a classification of fault-injection attacks and strategies, including the domain of fault-injection attacks, the fault targets, and fault manifestations in quantum computers. The resulting classification highlights the potential threats that exist.

Transformer-based pre-trained models like BERT and RoBERTa have shown success in various NLP tasks, but they are not tailored for crisis-related texts. Furthermore, general-purpose sentence encoders are used to generate sentence embeddings, regardless of the textual complexities in crisis-related texts. Advances in applications like text classification, semantic search, and clustering contribute to effective processing of crisis-related texts, which is essential for emergency responders to gain a comprehensive view of a crisis event, whether historical or real-time. To address these gaps in crisis informatics literature, this study introduces CrisisTransformers, an ensemble of pre-trained language models and sentence encoders trained on an extensive corpus of over 15 billion word tokens from tweets associated with more than 30 crisis events, including disease outbreaks, natural disasters, conflicts, and other critical incidents. We evaluate existing models and CrisisTransformers on 18 crisis-specific public datasets. Our pre-trained models outperform strong baselines across all datasets in classification tasks, and our best-performing sentence encoder improves the state-of-the-art by 17.43% in sentence encoding tasks. Additionally, we investigate the impact of model initialization on convergence and evaluate the significance of domain-specific models in generating semantically meaningful sentence embeddings. All models are publicly released (https://huggingface.co/crisistransformers), with the anticipation that they will serve as a robust baseline for tasks involving the analysis of crisis-related social media texts.

    "abstract": "Repeated parameter sharing in federated learning causes significant information leakage about private data, thus defeating its main purpose: data privacy. Mitigating the risk of this information leakage, using state of the art differentially private algorithms, also does not come for free. Randomized mechanisms can prevent convergence of models on learning even the useful representation functions, especially if there is more disagreement between local models on the classification functions (due to data heterogeneity). In this paper, we consider a representation federated learning objective that encourages various parties to collaboratively refine the consensus part of the model, with differential privacy guarantees, while separately allowing sufficient freedom for local personalization (without releasing it). We prove that in the linear representation setting, while the objective is non-convex, our proposed new algorithm \\DPFEDREP\\ converges to a ball centered around the \\emph{global optimal} solution at a linear rate, and the radius of the ball is proportional to the reciprocal of the privacy budget. With this novel utility analysis, we improve the SOTA utility-privacy trade-off for this problem by a factor of $\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the input dimension. We empirically evaluate our method with the image classification task on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and EMNIST, and observe a significant performance improvement over the prior work under the same small privacy budget.

Despite their crucial role, the development of smart contracts may introduce vulnerabilities and potentially lead to severe consequences, such as financial losses. Meanwhile, large language models, represented by ChatGPT, have gained great attentions, showcasing great capabilities in code analysis tasks. In this paper, we presented an empirical study to investigate the performance of ChatGPT in identifying smart contract vulnerabilities. Initially, we evaluated ChatGPT's effectiveness using a publicly available smart contract dataset. Our findings discover that while ChatGPT achieves a high recall rate, its precision in pinpointing smart contract vulnerabilities is limited. Furthermore, ChatGPT's performance varies when detecting different vulnerability types. We delved into the root causes for the false positives generated by ChatGPT, and categorized them into four groups. Second, by comparing ChatGPT with other state-of-the-art smart contract vulnerability detection tools, we found that ChatGPT's F-score is lower than others for 3 out of the 7 vulnerabilities. In the case of the remaining 4 vulnerabilities, ChatGPT exhibits a slight advantage over these tools. Finally, we analyzed the limitation of ChatGPT in smart contract vulnerability detection, revealing that the robustness of ChatGPT in this field needs to be improved from two aspects: its uncertainty in answering questions; and the limited length of the detected code. In general, our research provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of employing large language models, specifically ChatGPT, for the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities. ",

Despite the available literature on designing control barrier certificates, there has been unfortunately no consideration of wireless communication networks to capture potential packet losses and end-to-end delays, which is absolutely crucial in safety-critical real-world applications. In our proposed setting, the key objective is to construct a control barrier certificate together with a safety controller while providing a lower bound on the satisfaction probability of the safety property over a finite time horizon. We propose a systematic approach in the form of sum-of-squares optimization and matrix inequalities for the synthesis of CBC and its associated controller. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a permanent magnet synchronous motor. For the application of automotive electric steering under a wireless communication network, we design a CBC together with a safety controller to maintain the electrical current of the motor in a safe set within a finite time horizon while providing a formal probabilistic guarantee.

Specifically, we first design the Learnable cross-Modal Association (LMA) module to automatically fuse voxel-view and range-view features with image features, which fully utilize the rich semantic information of images and are robust to calibration errors. Then, the enhanced voxel-view and range-view features are transformed to the point space,where three views of point cloud features are further fused adaptively by the Learnable cross-View Association module (LVA). Notably, UniSeg achieves promising results in three public benchmarks, i.e., SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset (WOD); it ranks 1st on two challenges of two benchmarks, including the LiDAR semantic segmentation challenge of nuScenes and panoptic segmentation challenges of SemanticKITTI.

Currently, ESG is determined using self-reported corporate filings, which allows companies to portray themselves in an artificially positive light. As a result, ESG evaluation is subjective and inconsistent across raters, giving executives mixed signals on what to improve. This project aims to create a data-driven ESG evaluation system that can provide better guidance and more systemized scores by incorporating social sentiment. Social sentiment allows for more balanced perspectives which directly highlight public opinion, helping companies create more focused and impactful initiatives. To build this, Python web scrapers were developed to collect data from Wikipedia, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google News for the S&P 500 companies. Data was then cleaned and passed through NLP algorithms to obtain sentiment scores for ESG subcategories. Using these features, machine-learning algorithms were trained and calibrated to S&P Global ESG Ratings to test their predictive capabilities. The Random-Forest model was the strongest model with a mean absolute error of 13.4% and a correlation of 26.1% (p-value 0.0372), showing encouraging results. Overall, measuring ESG social sentiment across sub-categories can help executives focus efforts on areas people care about most. Furthermore, this data-driven methodology can provide ratings for companies without coverage, allowing more socially responsible firms to thrive. ",

    "abstract": "Multimodal stock trading volume movement prediction with stock-related news is one of the fundamental problems in the financial area. Existing multimodal works that train models from scratch face the problem of lacking universal knowledge when modeling financial news. In addition, the models ability may be limited by the lack of domain-related knowledge due to insufficient data in the datasets. To handle this issue, we propose the Prompt-based MUltimodal Stock volumE prediction model (ProMUSE) to process text and time series modalities. We use pre-trained language models for better comprehension of financial news and adopt prompt learning methods to leverage their capability in universal knowledge to model textual information. Besides, simply fusing two modalities can cause harm to the unimodal representations. Thus, we propose a novel cross-modality contrastive alignment while reserving the unimodal heads beside the fusion head to mitigate this problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ProMUSE outperforms existing baselines. Comprehensive analyses further validate the effectiveness of our architecture compared to potential variants and learning mechanisms. ",

    "abstract": "Most current approaches for protecting privacy in machine learning (ML) assume that models exist in a vacuum, when in reality, ML models are part of larger systems that include components for training data filtering, output monitoring, and more. In this work, we introduce privacy side channels: attacks that exploit these system-level components to extract private information at far higher rates than is otherwise possible for standalone models. We propose four categories of side channels that span the entire ML lifecycle (training data filtering, input preprocessing, output post-processing, and query filtering) and allow for either enhanced membership inference attacks or even novel threats such as extracting users' test queries. For example, we show that deduplicating training data before applying differentially-private training creates a side-channel that completely invalidates any provable privacy guarantees. Moreover, we show that systems which block language models from regenerating training data can be exploited to allow exact reconstruction of private keys contained in the training set -- even if the model did not memorize these keys. Taken together, our results demonstrate the need for a holistic, end-to-end privacy analysis of machine learning. ",

    "abstract": "We present GeGnn, a learning-based method for computing the approximate geodesic distance between two arbitrary points on discrete polyhedra surfaces with constant time complexity after fast precomputation. Previous relevant methods either focus on computing the geodesic distance between a single source and all destinations, which has linear complexity at least or require a long precomputation time. Our key idea is to train a graph neural network to embed an input mesh into a high-dimensional embedding space and compute the geodesic distance between a pair of points using the corresponding embedding vectors and a lightweight decoding function. To facilitate the learning of the embedding, we propose novel graph convolution and graph pooling modules that incorporate local geodesic information and are verified to be much more effective than previous designs. After training, our method requires only one forward pass of the network per mesh as precomputation. Then, we can compute the geodesic distance between a pair of points using our decoding function, which requires only several matrix multiplications and can be massively parallelized on GPUs. We verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method on ShapeNet and demonstrate that our method is faster than existing methods by orders of magnitude while achieving comparable or better accuracy. Additionally, our method exhibits robustness on noisy and incomplete meshes and strong generalization ability on out-of-distribution meshes.

Despite the fact that significant progress has been made in solving the fruit detection problem, the lack of publicly available datasets has complicated direct comparison of results. For instance, citrus detection has long been of interest in the agricultural research community, yet there is an absence of work, particularly involving public datasets of citrus affected by HLB. To address this issue, we enhance state-of-the-art object detection methods for use in typical orchard settings. Concretely, we provide high-resolution images of citrus trees located in an area known to be highly affected by HLB, along with high-quality bounding box annotations of citrus fruit. Fruit on both the trees and the ground are labeled to allow for identification of fruit location, which contributes to advancements in yield estimation and potential measure of HLB impact via fruit drop. The dataset consists of over 32,000 bounding box annotations for fruit instances contained in 579 high-resolution images. In summary, our contributions are the following: (i) we introduce a novel dataset along with baseline performance benchmarks on multiple contemporary object detection algorithms, (ii) we show the ability to accurately capture fruit location on tree or on ground, and finally (ii) we present a correlation of our results with yield estimations.

Distributed Denial of Service attacks are one of the most harmful of these threats in today's internet, disrupting the availability of essential services. This project presents a novel deep learning-based approach for detecting DDoS attacks in network traffic using the industry-recognized DDoS evaluation dataset from the University of New Brunswick, which contains packet captures from real-time DDoS attacks, creating a broader and more applicable model for the real world. The algorithm employed in this study exploits the properties of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and common deep learning algorithms to build a novel mitigation technique that classifies benign and malicious traffic. The proposed model preprocesses the data by extracting packet flows and normalizing them to a fixed length which is fed into a custom architecture containing layers regulating node dropout, normalization, and a sigmoid activation function to out a binary classification. This allows for the model to process the flows effectively and look for the nodes that contribute to DDoS attacks while dropping the \"noise\" or the distractors. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in detecting DDOS attacks, achieving an accuracy of .9883 on 2000 unseen flows in network traffic, while being scalable for any network environment.

While CSP can be addressed by employing currently-prevailing generative models (e.g. diffusion models), this task encounters unique challenges owing to the symmetric geometry of crystal structures -- the invariance of translation, rotation, and periodicity. To incorporate the above symmetries, this paper proposes DiffCSP, a novel diffusion model to learn the structure distribution from stable crystals. To be specific, DiffCSP jointly generates the lattice and atom coordinates for each crystal by employing a periodic-E(3)-equivariant denoising model, to better model the crystal geometry. Notably, different from related equivariant generative approaches, DiffCSP leverages fractional coordinates other than Cartesian coordinates to represent crystals, remarkably promoting the diffusion and the generation process of atom positions. Extensive experiments verify that our DiffCSP significantly outperforms existing CSP methods, with a much lower computation cost in contrast to DFT-based methods. Moreover, the superiority of DiffCSP is also observed when it is extended for ab initio crystal generation. ",

In this paper, a generalized minimum error with fiducial points criterion (GMEEF) is presented by adopting the Generalized Gaussian Density (GGD) function as kernel. The GGD extends the Gaussian distribution by introducing a shape parameter that provides more control over the tail behavior and peakedness. In addition, due to the high computational complexity of GMEEF criterion, the quantized idea is introduced to notably lower the computational load of the GMEEF-type algorithm. Finally, the proposed criterions are introduced to the domains of adaptive filter, kernel recursive algorithm, and multilayer perceptron. Several numerical simulations, which contain system identification, acoustic echo cancellation, times series prediction, and supervised classification, indicate that the novel algorithms' performance performs excellently.

To resolve these issues, we propose a novel semi-supervised hybrid NAS network for accurate medical image segmentation termed SSHNN. In SSHNN, we creatively use convolution operation in layer-wise feature fusion instead of normalized scalars to avoid losing details, making NAS a stronger encoder. Moreover, Transformers are introduced for the compensation of global context and U-shaped decoder is designed to efficiently connect global context with local features. Specifically, we implement a semi-supervised algorithm Mean-Teacher to overcome the limited volume problem of labeled medical image dataset. Extensive experiments on CAMUS echocardiography dataset demonstrate that SSHNN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and realizes accurate segmentation. Code will be made publicly available. ",

A detection algorithm is developed to verify whether a (noisy) quantum algorithm is differentially private and automatically generate bugging information when the violation of differential privacy is reported. The information consists of a pair of quantum states that violate the privacy, to illustrate the cause of the violation. Our algorithm is equipped with Tensor Networks, a highly efficient data structure, and executed both on TensorFlow Quantum and TorchQuantum which are the quantum extensions of famous machine learning platforms -- TensorFlow and PyTorch, respectively.

    "abstract": "Computed Tomography (CT) is a medical imaging modality that can generate more informative 3D images than 2D X-rays. However, this advantage comes at the expense of more radiation exposure, higher costs, and longer acquisition time. Hence, the reconstruction of 3D CT images using a limited number of 2D X-rays has gained significant importance as an economical alternative. Nevertheless, existing methods primarily prioritize minimizing pixel/voxel-level intensity discrepancies, often neglecting the preservation of textural details in the synthesized images. This oversight directly impacts the quality of the reconstructed images and thus affects the clinical diagnosis. To address the deficits, this paper presents a new self-driven generative adversarial network model (SdCT-GAN), which is motivated to pay more attention to image details by introducing a novel auto-encoder structure in the discriminator. In addition, a Sobel Gradient Guider (SGG) idea is applied throughout the model, where the edge information from the 2D X-ray image at the input can be integrated. Moreover, LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) evaluation metric is adopted that can quantitatively evaluate the fine contours and textures of reconstructed images better than the existing ones. Finally, the qualitative and quantitative results of the empirical studies justify the power of the proposed model compared to mainstream state-of-the-art baselines. ",

Recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely recognized for their ability to perform fast end-to-end registration. However, DNN-based registration needs to explore the spatial information of each image and fuse this information to characterize spatial correspondence. This raises an essential question: what is the optimal fusion strategy to characterize spatial correspondence? Existing fusion strategies (e.g., early fusion, late fusion) were empirically designed to fuse information by manually defined prior knowledge, which inevitably constrains the registration performance within the limits of empirical designs. In this study, we depart from existing empirically-designed fusion strategies and develop a data-driven fusion strategy for deformable image registration. To achieve this, we propose an Automatic Fusion network (AutoFuse) that provides flexibility to fuse information at many potential locations within the network. A Fusion Gate (FG) module is also proposed to control how to fuse information at each potential network location based on training data. Our AutoFuse can automatically optimize its fusion strategy during training and can be generalizable to both unsupervised registration (without any labels) and semi-supervised registration (with weak labels provided for partial training data). Extensive experiments on two well-benchmarked medical registration tasks (inter- and intra-patient registration) with eight public datasets show that our AutoFuse outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised registration methods.

In this paper, we demonstrated a novel approach to predict disruption in a future tokamak only using a few discharges based on a domain adaptation algorithm called CORAL. It is the first attempt at applying domain adaptation in the disruption prediction task. In this paper, this disruption prediction approach aligns a few data from the future tokamak (target domain) and a large amount of data from the existing tokamak (source domain) to train a machine learning model in the existing tokamak. To simulate the existing and future tokamak case, we selected J-TEXT as the existing tokamak and EAST as the future tokamak. To simulate the lack of disruptive data in future tokamak, we only selected 100 non-disruptive discharges and 10 disruptive discharges from EAST as the target domain training data. We have improved CORAL to make it more suitable for the disruption prediction task, called supervised CORAL. Compared to the model trained by mixing data from the two tokamaks, the supervised CORAL model can enhance the disruption prediction performance for future tokamaks (AUC value from 0.764 to 0.890). Through interpretable analysis, we discovered that using the supervised CORAL enables the transformation of data distribution to be more similar to future tokamak. An assessment method for evaluating whether a model has learned a trend of similar features is designed based on SHAP analysis. It demonstrates that the supervised CORAL model exhibits more similarities to the model trained on large data sizes of EAST. FTDP provides a light, interpretable, and few-data-required way by aligning features to predict disruption using small data sizes from the future tokamak. ",

    "abstract": "Generalisation -- the ability of a model to perform well on unseen data -- is crucial for building reliable deep fake detectors. However, recent studies have shown that the current audio deep fake models fall short of this desideratum. In this paper we show that pretrained self-supervised representations followed by a simple logistic regression classifier achieve strong generalisation capabilities, reducing the equal error rate from 30% to 8% on the newly introduced In-the-Wild dataset. Importantly, this approach also produces considerably better calibrated models when compared to previous approaches. This means that we can trust our model's predictions more and use these for downstream tasks, such as uncertainty estimation. In particular, we show that the entropy of the estimated probabilities provides a reliable way of rejecting uncertain samples and further improving the accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Diffuse gliomas are malignant brain tumors that grow widespread through the brain. The complex interactions between neoplastic cells and normal tissue, as well as the treatment-induced changes often encountered, make glioma tumor growth modeling challenging. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end network capable of generating future tumor masks and realistic MRIs of how the tumor will look at any future time points for different treatment plans. Our model is built upon cutting-edge diffusion probabilistic models and deep-segmentation neural networks. We extended a diffusion model to include sequential multi-parametric MRI and treatment information as conditioning input to guide the generative diffusion process. This allows us to estimate tumor growth at any given time point. We trained the model using real-world postoperative longitudinal MRI data with glioma tumor growth trajectories represented as tumor segmentation maps over time. The model has demonstrated promising performance across a range of tasks, including the generation of high-quality synthetic MRIs with tumor masks, time-series tumor segmentations, and uncertainty estimation. Combined with the treatment-aware generated MRIs, the tumor growth predictions with uncertainty estimates can provide useful information for clinical decision-making. ",

Our solution builds on an existing diffusion-based motion synthesis model. We propose a contrastive speech and motion pretraining (CSMP) module, which learns a joint embedding for speech and gesture with the aim to learn a semantic coupling between these modalities. The output of the CSMP module is used as a conditioning signal in the diffusion-based gesture synthesis model in order to achieve semantically-aware co-speech gesture generation. Our entry achieved highest human-likeness and highest speech appropriateness rating among the submitted entries. This indicates that our system is a promising approach to achieve human-like co-speech gestures in agents that carry semantic meaning. ",

A good outlier detection algorithm should be computationally efficient, robust to tuning parameter selection, and perform consistently well across diverse underlying data distributions. We introduce One-Class Boundary Peeling, an unsupervised outlier detection algorithm. One-class Boundary Peeling uses the average signed distance from iteratively-peeled, flexible boundaries generated by one-class support vector machines. One-class Boundary Peeling has robust hyperparameter settings and, for increased flexibility, can be cast as an ensemble method. In synthetic data simulations One-Class Boundary Peeling outperforms all state of the art methods when no outliers are present while maintaining comparable or superior performance in the presence of outliers, as compared to benchmark methods. One-Class Boundary Peeling performs competitively in terms of correct classification, AUC, and processing time using common benchmark data sets. ",
