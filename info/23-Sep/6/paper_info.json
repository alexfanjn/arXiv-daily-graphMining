    "title": "A Simulation--Based Optimization approach for analyzing the ambulance  diversion phenomenon in an Emergency-Department network",
    "abstract": "Ambulance Diversion (AD) is one of the possible strategies for relieving the worldwide phenomenon of Emergency Department (ED) overcrowding. It can be carried out when an ED is overloaded and consists of redirecting incoming by ambulance patients to neighboring EDs. Properly implemented, AD should result in reducing delays of patient treatment, ensuring safety and rescue of life-threatening patients. From an operational point of view, AD corresponds to a resource pooling policy among EDs in a network. In this paper we propose a novel model for studying the effectiveness of AD strategies, based on the Simulation-Based Optimization (SBO) approach. In particular, we developed a discrete event simulation model for reproducing the ED network operation. Then, for each AD policy considered, we formulate and solve an optimal resources allocation problem consisting of a bi-objective SBO problem where the target is the minimization of the non-value added time spent by patients and the overall cost incurred by the ED network. A set of optimal points belonging to the Pareto frontier is obtained for each policy. To show the reliability of the proposed approach, a real case study consisting of six large EDs in the Lazio region of Italy is considered, analyzing the effects of adopting different AD policies. ",

    "abstract": "Depth completion aims to recover dense depth maps from sparse ones, where color images are often used to facilitate this task. Recent depth methods primarily focus on image guided learning frameworks. However, blurry guidance in the image and unclear structure in the depth still impede their performance. To tackle these challenges, we explore an efficient repetitive design in our image guided network to gradually and sufficiently recover depth values. Specifically, the efficient repetition is embodied in both the image guidance branch and depth generation branch. In the former branch, we design a dense repetitive hourglass network to extract discriminative image features of complex environments, which can provide powerful contextual instruction for depth prediction. In the latter branch, we introduce a repetitive guidance module based on dynamic convolution, in which an efficient convolution factorization is proposed to reduce the complexity while modeling high-frequency structures progressively. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach achieves superior or competitive results on KITTI, VKITTI, NYUv2, 3D60, and Matterport3D datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Geosynchronous satellite (GEO) networks are a crucial option for users beyond terrestrial connectivity. However, unlike terrestrial networks, GEO networks exhibit high latency and deploy TCP proxies and traffic shapers. The deployment of proxies effectively mitigates the impact of high network latency in GEO networks, while traffic shapers help realize customer-controlled data-saver options that optimize data usage. It is unclear how the interplay between GEO networks' high latency, TCP proxies, and traffic-shaping policies affects the quality of experience (QoE) for commonly used video applications. To fill this gap, we analyze the quality of over $2$k YouTube video sessions streamed across a production GEO network with a $900$Kbps shaping rate. Given the average bit rates for the selected videos, we expected seamless streaming at $360$p or lower resolutions. However, our analysis reveals that this is not the case: $28\\%$ of TCP sessions and $18\\%$ of gQUIC sessions experience rebuffering events, while the median average resolution is only $380$p for TCP and $299$p for gQUIC. Our analysis identifies two key factors contributing to sub-optimal performance: (i)unlike TCP, gQUIC only utilizes $63\\%$ of network capacity; and (ii)YouTube's imperfect chunk request pipelining. As a result of our study, the partner GEO ISP discontinued support for the low-bandwidth data-saving option in U.S. business and residential markets to avoid potential degradation of video quality -- highlighting the practical significance of our findings.

This makes investing in technologies during this phase unjustifiable. Technology forecasting is a critical tool for research and development to determine the future direction of technology. Based on registered patents, this study examined the trends of IOT technologies. A total of 3697 patents related to the Internet of Things from the last six years of patenting have been gathered using lens.org for this purpose. The main people and companies were identified through the creation of the IOT patent registration cooperation network, and the main groups active in patent registration were identified by the community detection technique. The patents were then divided into six technology categories: Safety and Security, Information Services, Public Safety and Environment Monitoring, Collaborative Aware Systems, Smart Homes/Buildings, and Smart Grid. And their technical maturity was identified and examined using the Sigma Plot program. Based on the findings, information services technologies are in the saturation stage, while both smart homes/buildings, and smart grid technologies are in the saturation stage.

Though graph neural networks (GNNs) have been the dominant architecture for analyzing various graph-structured data like social networks, their predicting on gene networks often exhibits subpar performance. In this paper, we formally investigate the gene network representation learning problem and characterize a notion of \\textit{universal graph normalization}, where graph normalization can be applied in an universal manner to maximize the expressive power of GNNs while maintaining the stability. We propose a novel UNGNN (Universal Normalized GNN) framework, which leverages universal graph normalization in both the message passing phase and readout layer to enhance the performance of a base GNN. UNGNN has a plug-and-play property and can be combined with any GNN backbone in practice. A comprehensive set of experiments on gene-network-based bioinformatical tasks demonstrates that our UNGNN model significantly outperforms popular GNN benchmarks and provides an overall performance improvement of 16 $\\%$ on average compared to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. Furthermore, we also evaluate our theoretical findings on other graph datasets where the universal graph normalization is solvable, and we observe that UNGNN consistently achieves the superior performance.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel control design for voltage tracking of an islanded AC microgrid in the presence of {nonlinear} loads and parametric uncertainties at the primary level of control. The proposed method is based on the Tube-Based Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC), an online optimization-based method which can handle the constraints and uncertainties as well. The challenge with this method is the conservativeness imposed by designing the tube based on the worst-case scenario of the uncertainties. This weakness is amended in this paper by employing a combination of a learning-based Gaussian Process (GP) regression and RMPC. The advantage of using GP is that both the mean and variance of the loads are predicted at each iteration based on the real data, and the resulted values of mean and the bound of confidence are utilized to design the tube in RMPC. The theoretical results are also provided to prove the recursive feasibility and stability of the proposed learning based RMPC. Finally, the simulation results are carried out on both single and multiple DG (Distributed Generation) units. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present an approach to identify sub-tasks within a demonstrated robot trajectory using language instructions. We identify these sub-tasks using language provided during demonstrations as guidance to identify sub-segments of a longer robot trajectory. Given a sequence of natural language instructions and a long trajectory consisting of image frames and discrete actions, we want to map an instruction to a smaller fragment of the trajectory. Unlike previous instruction following works which directly learn the mapping from language to a policy, we propose a language-conditioned change-point detection method to identify sub-tasks in a problem. Our approach learns the relationship between constituent segments of a long language command and corresponding constituent segments of a trajectory. These constituent trajectory segments can be used to learn subtasks or sub-goals for planning or options as demonstrated by previous related work. Our insight in this work is that the language-conditioned robot change-point detection problem is similar to the existing video moment retrieval works used to identify sub-segments within online videos. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate a $1.78_{\\pm 0.82}\\%$ improvement over a baseline approach in accurately identifying sub-tasks within a trajectory using our proposed method. Moreover, we present a comprehensive study investigating sample complexity requirements on learning this mapping, between language and trajectory sub-segments, to understand if the video retrieval-based methods are realistic in real robot scenarios.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal regression is important in forecasting nonstationary processes or with a complex mixture of distributions. It can be tackled with multiple hypotheses frameworks but with the difficulty of combining them efficiently in a learning model. A Structured Radial Basis Function Network is presented as an ensemble of multiple hypotheses predictors for regression problems. The predictors are regression models of any type that can form centroidal Voronoi tessellations which are a function of their losses during training. It is proved that this structured model can efficiently interpolate this tessellation and approximate the multiple hypotheses target distribution and is equivalent to interpolating the meta-loss of the predictors, the loss being a zero set of the interpolation error. This model has a fixed-point iteration algorithm between the predictors and the centers of the basis functions. Diversity in learning can be controlled parametrically by truncating the tessellation formation with the losses of individual predictors. A closed-form solution with least-squares is presented, which to the authors knowledge, is the fastest solution in the literature for multiple hypotheses and structured predictions. Superior generalization performance and computational efficiency is achieved using only two-layer neural networks as predictors controlling diversity as a key component of success. A gradient-descent approach is introduced which is loss-agnostic regarding the predictors. The expected value for the loss of the structured model with Gaussian basis functions is computed, finding that correlation between predictors is not an appropriate tool for diversification. The experiments show outperformance with respect to the top competitors in the literature. ",

While several SNE methods based on graph convolutional networks (GCN) have been proposed for this problem, we point out that they significantly rely on the assumption that the decades-old balance theory always holds in the real-world. To address this limitation, we propose a novel GCN-based SNE approach, named as TrustSGCN, which corrects for incorrect embedding propagation in GCN by utilizing the trustworthiness on edge signs for high-order relationships inferred by the balance theory. The proposed approach consists of three modules: (M1) generation of each node's extended ego-network; (M2) measurement of trustworthiness on edge signs; and (M3) trustworthiness-aware propagation of embeddings. Furthermore, TrustSGCN learns the node embeddings by leveraging two well-known societal theories, i.e., balance and status. The experiments on four real-world signed network datasets demonstrate that TrustSGCN consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art GCN-based SNE methods.

This research proposes a novel Semi-Supervised Graph Learning SSGL algorithm tailored for DR detection, which capitalizes on the relationships between labelled and unlabeled data to enhance accuracy. The work begins by investigating data augmentation and preprocessing techniques to address the challenges of image quality and feature variations. Techniques such as image cropping, resizing, contrast adjustment, normalization, and data augmentation are explored to optimize feature extraction and improve the overall quality of retinal images. Moreover, apart from detection and diagnosis, this work delves into applying ML algorithms for predicting the risk of developing DR or the likelihood of disease progression. Personalized risk scores for individual patients are generated using comprehensive patient data encompassing demographic information, medical history, and retinal images. The proposed Semi-Supervised Graph learning algorithm is rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets and is benchmarked against existing methods. Results indicate significant improvements in classification accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity while demonstrating robustness against noise and outlie rs.Notably, the proposed algorithm addresses the challenge of imbalanced datasets, common in medical image analysis, further enhancing its practical applicability.

    "abstract": "The fitness level method is a popular tool for analyzing the computation time of elitist evolutionary algorithms. Its idea is to divide the search space into multiple fitness levels and estimate lower and upper bounds on the computation time using transition probabilities between fitness levels. However, the lower bound generated from this method is often not tight. To improve the lower bound, this paper rigorously studies an open question about the fitness level method: what are the tightest lower and upper time bounds that can be constructed based on fitness levels? To answer this question, drift analysis with fitness levels is developed, and the tightest bound problem is formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem subject to fitness level constraints. The tightest metric bounds from fitness levels are constructed and proven for the first time. Then the metric bounds are converted into linear bounds, where existing linear bounds are special cases. This paper establishes a general framework that can cover various linear bounds from trivial to best coefficients. It is generic and promising, as it can be used not only to draw the same bounds as existing ones, but also to draw tighter bounds, especially on fitness landscapes where shortcuts exist. This is demonstrated in the case study of the (1+1) EA maximizing the TwoPath function. ",

    "abstract": "The marketplace system connecting demands and supplies has been explored to develop unbiased decision-making in valuing properties. Real estate appraisal serves as one of the high-cost property valuation tasks for financial institutions since it requires domain experts to appraise the estimation based on the corresponding knowledge and the judgment of the market. Existing automated valuation models reducing the subjectivity of domain experts require a large number of transactions for effective evaluation, which is predominantly limited to not only the labeling efforts of transactions but also the generalizability of new developing and rural areas. To learn representations from unlabeled real estate sets, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) for tabular data neglects various important features, and fails to incorporate domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose DoRA, a Domain-based self-supervised learning framework for low-resource Real estate Appraisal. DoRA is pre-trained with an intra-sample geographic prediction as the pretext task based on the metadata of the real estate for equipping the real estate representations with prior domain knowledge. Furthermore, inter-sample contrastive learning is employed to generalize the representations to be robust for limited transactions of downstream tasks. Our benchmark results on three property types of real-world transactions show that DoRA significantly outperforms the SSL baselines for tabular data, the graph-based methods, and the supervised approaches in the few-shot scenarios by at least 7.6% for MAPE, 11.59% for MAE, and 3.34% for HR10%. We expect DoRA to be useful to other financial practitioners with similar marketplace applications who need general models for properties that are newly built and have limited records.

    "title": "DeepScaler: Holistic Autoscaling for Microservices Based on  Spatiotemporal GNN with Adaptive Graph Learning",
    "abstract": "Autoscaling functions provide the foundation for achieving elasticity in the modern cloud computing paradigm. It enables dynamic provisioning or de-provisioning resources for cloud software services and applications without human intervention to adapt to workload fluctuations. However, autoscaling microservice is challenging due to various factors. In particular, complex, time-varying service dependencies are difficult to quantify accurately and can lead to cascading effects when allocating resources. This paper presents DeepScaler, a deep learning-based holistic autoscaling approach for microservices that focus on coping with service dependencies to optimize service-level agreements (SLA) assurance and cost efficiency. DeepScaler employs (i) an expectation-maximization-based learning method to adaptively generate affinity matrices revealing service dependencies and (ii) an attention-based graph convolutional network to extract spatio-temporal features of microservices by aggregating neighbors' information of graph-structural data. Thus DeepScaler can capture more potential service dependencies and accurately estimate the resource requirements of all services under dynamic workloads. It allows DeepScaler to reconfigure the resources of the interacting services simultaneously in one resource provisioning operation, avoiding the cascading effect caused by service dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method implements a more effective autoscaling mechanism for microservice that not only allocates resources accurately but also adapts to dependencies changes, significantly reducing SLA violations by an average of 41% at lower costs.

    "abstract": "The expansion of the open source community and the rise of large language models have raised ethical and security concerns on the distribution of source code, such as misconduct on copyrighted code, distributions without proper licenses, or misuse of the code for malicious purposes. Hence it is important to track the ownership of source code, in wich watermarking is a major technique. Yet, drastically different from natural languages, source code watermarking requires far stricter and more complicated rules to ensure the readability as well as the functionality of the source code. Hence we introduce SrcMarker, a watermarking system to unobtrusively encode ID bitstrings into source code, without affecting the usage and semantics of the code. To this end, SrcMarker performs transformations on an AST-based intermediate representation that enables unified transformations across different programming languages. The core of the system utilizes learning-based embedding and extraction modules to select rule-based transformations for watermarking. In addition, a novel feature-approximation technique is designed to tackle the inherent non-differentiability of rule selection, thus seamlessly integrating the rule-based transformations and learning-based networks into an interconnected system to enable end-to-end training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SrcMarker over existing methods in various watermarking requirements. ",

We consider the sharp-interface motion of compressible two-component flow, and propose a heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) to describe the flow fields accurately. The multiscale approach combines a hyperbolic system of balance laws on the continuum scale with molecular-dynamics simulations on the microscale level. Notably, the multiscale approach is necessary to compute the interface dynamics because there is -- at present -- no closed continuum-scale model. The basic HMM relies on a moving-mesh finite-volume method, and has been introduced recently for compressible one-component flow with phase transitions in [Magiera and Rohde, JCP. 469 (2022)]. To overcome the numerical complexity of the molecular-dynamics microscale model a deep neural network is employed as an efficient surrogate model. The entire approach is finally applied to simulate droplet dynamics for argon-methane mixtures in several space-dimensions. Up to our knowledge such compressible two-phase dynamics accounting for microscale phase-change transfer rates have not yet been computed. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely used recently for sound event detection and classification. Its success is linked to the availability of sufficiently large datasets, possibly with corresponding annotations when supervised learning is considered. In bioacoustic applications, most tasks come with few labelled training data, because annotating long recordings is time consuming and costly. Therefore supervised learning is not the best suited approach to solve bioacoustic tasks. The bioacoustic community recasted the problem of sound event detection within the framework of few-shot learning, i.e. training a system with only few labeled examples. The few-shot bioacoustic sound event detection task in the DCASE challenge focuses on detecting events in long audio recordings given only five annotated examples for each class of interest. In this paper, we show that learning a rich feature extractor from scratch can be achieved by leveraging data augmentation using a supervised contrastive learning framework. We highlight the ability of this framework to transfer well for five-shot event detection on previously unseen classes in the training data. We obtain an F-score of 63.46\\% on the validation set and 42.7\\% on the test set, ranking second in the DCASE challenge. We provide an ablation study for the critical choices of data augmentation techniques as well as for the learning strategy applied on the training set. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples pose a security threat to many critical systems built on neural networks (such as face recognition systems, and self-driving cars). While many methods have been proposed to build robust models, how to build certifiably robust yet accurate neural network models remains an open problem. For example, adversarial training improves empirical robustness, but they do not provide certification of the model's robustness. On the other hand, certified training provides certified robustness but at the cost of a significant accuracy drop. In this work, we propose a novel approach that aims to achieve both high accuracy and certified probabilistic robustness. Our method has two parts, i.e., a probabilistic robust training method with an additional goal of minimizing variance in terms of divergence and a runtime inference method for certified probabilistic robustness of the prediction. The latter enables efficient certification of the model's probabilistic robustness at runtime with statistical guarantees. This is supported by our training objective, which minimizes the variance of the model's predictions in a given vicinity, derived from a general definition of model robustness. Our approach works for a variety of perturbations and is reasonably efficient. Our experiments on multiple models trained on different datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both certification rate and accuracy. ",

The introduction of language models such as BERT led to adaptations for the (bio)medical domain like PubMedBERT and ClinicalBERT. These models rely on large databases of archived medical documents. While performing well in terms of accuracy, both the lack of interpretability and limitations to transfer across languages limit their use in clinical setting. We introduce a novel light-weight graph-based embedding method specifically catering radiology reports. It takes into account the structure and composition of the report, while also connecting medical terms in the report through the multi-lingual SNOMED Clinical Terms knowledge base. The resulting graph embedding uncovers the underlying relationships among clinical terms, achieving a representation that is better understandable for clinicians and clinically more accurate, without reliance on large pre-training datasets. We show the use of this embedding on two tasks namely disease classification of X-ray reports and image classification. For disease classification our model is competitive with its BERT-based counterparts, while being magnitudes smaller in size and training data requirements. For image classification, we show the effectiveness of the graph embedding leveraging cross-modal knowledge transfer and show how this method is usable across different languages. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, transformer-based methods have shown exceptional performance in monocular 3D object detection, which can predict 3D attributes from a single 2D image. These methods typically use visual and depth representations to generate query points on objects, whose quality plays a decisive role in the detection accuracy. However, current unsupervised attention mechanisms without any geometry appearance awareness in transformers are susceptible to producing noisy features for query points, which severely limits the network performance and also makes the model have a poor ability to detect multi-category objects in a single training process. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel \"Supervised Shape&Scale-perceptive Deformable Attention\" (S$^3$-DA) module for monocular 3D object detection. Concretely, S$^3$-DA utilizes visual and depth features to generate diverse local features with various shapes and scales and predict the corresponding matching distribution simultaneously to impose valuable shape&scale perception for each query. Benefiting from this, S$^3$-DA effectively estimates receptive fields for query points belonging to any category, enabling them to generate robust query features. Besides, we propose a Multi-classification-based Shape$\\&$Scale Matching (MSM) loss to supervise the above process. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo Open datasets demonstrate that S$^3$-DA significantly improves the detection accuracy, yielding state-of-the-art performance of single-category and multi-category 3D object detection in a single training process compared to the existing approaches.

    "abstract": "As a type of biometric identification, a speaker identification (SID) system is confronted with various kinds of attacks. The spoofing attacks typically imitate the timbre of the target speakers, while the adversarial attacks confuse the SID system by adding a well-designed adversarial perturbation to an arbitrary speech. Although the spoofing attack copies a similar timbre as the victim, it does not exploit the vulnerability of the SID model and may not make the SID system give the attacker's desired decision. As for the adversarial attack, despite the SID system can be led to a designated decision, it cannot meet the specified text or speaker timbre requirements for the specific attack scenarios. In this study, to make the attack in SID not only leverage the vulnerability of the SID model but also reserve the timbre of the target speaker, we propose a timbre-reserved adversarial attack in the speaker identification. We generate the timbre-reserved adversarial audios by adding an adversarial constraint during the different training stages of the voice conversion (VC) model. Specifically, the adversarial constraint is using the target speaker label to optimize the adversarial perturbation added to the VC model representations and is implemented by a speaker classifier joining in the VC model training. The adversarial constraint can help to control the VC model to generate the speaker-wised audio. Eventually, the inference of the VC model is the ideal adversarial fake audio, which is timbre-reserved and can fool the SID system. ",

    "abstract": "Monocular and binocular self-supervised depth estimations are two important and related tasks in computer vision, which aim to predict scene depths from single images and stereo image pairs respectively. In literature, the two tasks are usually tackled separately by two different kinds of models, and binocular models generally fail to predict depth from single images, while the prediction accuracy of monocular models is generally inferior to binocular models. In this paper, we propose a Two-in-One self-supervised depth estimation network, called TiO-Depth, which could not only compatibly handle the two tasks, but also improve the prediction accuracy. TiO-Depth employs a Siamese architecture and each sub-network of it could be used as a monocular depth estimation model. For binocular depth estimation, a Monocular Feature Matching module is proposed for incorporating the stereo knowledge between the two images, and the full TiO-Depth is used to predict depths. We also design a multi-stage joint-training strategy for improving the performances of TiO-Depth in both two tasks by combining the relative advantages of them. Experimental results on the KITTI, Cityscapes, and DDAD datasets demonstrate that TiO-Depth outperforms both the monocular and binocular state-of-the-art methods in most cases, and further verify the feasibility of a two-in-one network for monocular and binocular depth estimation.

However, current human parsers trained with clean data are easily confused by numerous image corruptions such as blur and noise. To improve the robustness of human parsers, in this paper, we construct three corruption robustness benchmarks, termed LIP-C, ATR-C, and Pascal-Person-Part-C, to assist us in evaluating the risk tolerance of human parsing models. Inspired by the data augmentation strategy, we propose a novel heterogeneous augmentation-enhanced mechanism to bolster robustness under commonly corrupted conditions. Specifically, two types of data augmentations from different views, i.e., image-aware augmentation and model-aware image-to-image transformation, are integrated in a sequential manner for adapting to unforeseen image corruptions. The image-aware augmentation can enrich the high diversity of training images with the help of common image operations. The model-aware augmentation strategy that improves the diversity of input data by considering the model's randomness. The proposed method is model-agnostic, and it can plug and play into arbitrary state-of-the-art human parsing frameworks. The experimental results show that the proposed method demonstrates good universality which can improve the robustness of the human parsing models and even the semantic segmentation models when facing various image common corruptions.

However, this task is very challenging due to the small sizes of surgical instrument tips, and significant variance of surgical scenes across different procedures. Although much effort has been made on visual-based methods, existing segmentation models still suffer from low robustness thus not usable in practice. Fortunately, kinematics data from the robotic system can provide reliable prior for instrument location, which is consistent regardless of different surgery types. To make use of such multi-modal information, we propose a novel visual-kinematics graph learning framework to accurately segment the instrument tip given various surgical procedures. Specifically, a graph learning framework is proposed to encode relational features of instrument parts from both image and kinematics. Next, a cross-modal contrastive loss is designed to incorporate robust geometric prior from kinematics to image for tip segmentation. We have conducted experiments on a private paired visual-kinematics dataset including multiple procedures, i.e., prostatectomy, total mesorectal excision, fundoplication and distal gastrectomy on cadaver, and distal gastrectomy on porcine. The leave-one-procedure-out cross validation demonstrated that our proposed multi-modal segmentation method significantly outperformed current image-based state-of-the-art approaches, exceeding averagely 11.2% on Dice.

To bridge this gap, we posit that, by harnessing the orthogonality of input vectors, pure message-passing can indeed capture joint structural features. Specifically, we study the proficiency of MPNNs in approximating CN heuristics. Based on our findings, we introduce the Message Passing Link Predictor (MPLP), a novel link prediction model. MPLP taps into quasi-orthogonal vectors to estimate link-level structural features, all while preserving the node-level complexities. Moreover, our approach demonstrates that leveraging message-passing to capture structural features could offset MPNNs' expressiveness limitations at the expense of estimation variance. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets from various domains, where our method consistently outperforms the baseline methods. ",

    "abstract": "The reason behind the remarkable properties of High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs) is rooted in the diverse phases and the crystal structures they contain. In the realm of material informatics, employing machine learning (ML) techniques to classify phases and crystal structures of HEAs has gained considerable significance. In this study, we assembled a new collection of 1345 HEAs with varying compositions to predict phases. Within this collection, there were 705 sets of data that were utilized to predict the crystal structures with the help of thermodynamics and electronic configuration. Our study introduces a methodical framework i.e., the Pearson correlation coefficient that helps in selecting the strongly co-related features to increase the prediction accuracy. This study employed five distinct boosting algorithms to predict phases and crystal structures, offering an enhanced guideline for improving the accuracy of these predictions. Among all these algorithms, XGBoost gives the highest accuracy of prediction (94.05%) for phases and LightGBM gives the highest accuracy of prediction of crystal structure of the phases (90.07%). The quantification of the influence exerted by parameters on the model's accuracy was conducted and a new approach was made to elucidate the contribution of individual parameters in the process of phase prediction and crystal structure prediction.

    "abstract": "Using videos to analyze pitchers in baseball can play a vital role in strategizing and injury prevention. Computer vision-based pose analysis offers a time-efficient and cost-effective approach. However, the use of accessible broadcast videos, with a 30fps framerate, often results in partial body motion blur during fast actions, limiting the performance of existing pose keypoint estimation models. Previous works have primarily relied on fixed backgrounds, assuming minimal motion differences between frames, or utilized multiview data to address this problem. To this end, we propose a synthetic data augmentation pipeline to enhance the model's capability to deal with the pitcher's blurry actions. In addition, we leverage in-the-wild videos to make our model robust under different real-world conditions and camera positions. By carefully optimizing the augmentation parameters, we observed a notable reduction in the loss by 54.2% and 36.2% on the test dataset for 2D and 3D pose estimation respectively. By applying our approach to existing state-of-the-art pose estimators, we demonstrate an average improvement of 29.2%. The findings highlight the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the challenges posed by motion blur, thereby enhancing the overall quality of pose estimation. ",

DeepONets are constructed by two sub-networks, namely the branch and trunk networks. Typically, the two sub-networks are trained simultaneously, which amounts to solving a complex optimization problem in a high dimensional space. In addition, the nonconvex and nonlinear nature makes training very challenging. To tackle such a challenge, we propose a two-step training method that trains the trunk network first and then sequentially trains the branch network. The core mechanism is motivated by the divide-and-conquer paradigm and is the decomposition of the entire complex training task into two subtasks with reduced complexity. Therein the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process is introduced which significantly improves stability and generalization ability. On the theoretical side, we establish a generalization error estimate in terms of the number of training data, the width of DeepONets, and the number of input and output sensors. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two-step training method, including Darcy flow in heterogeneous porous media. ",

Hamiltonian systems are one such fundamental and ubiquitous class of dynamical systems. Hamiltonian neural networks are state-of-the-art models that unsupervised-ly regress the Hamiltonian of a dynamical system from discrete observations of its vector field under the learning bias of Hamilton's equations. Yet Hamiltonian dynamics are often complicated, especially in higher dimensions where the state space of the Hamiltonian system is large relative to the number of samples. A recently discovered remedy to alleviate the complexity between state variables in the state space is to leverage the additive separability of the Hamiltonian system and embed that additive separability into the Hamiltonian neural network. Following the nomenclature of physics-informed machine learning, we propose three separable Hamiltonian neural networks. These models embed additive separability within Hamiltonian neural networks. The first model uses additive separability to quadratically scale the amount of data for training Hamiltonian neural networks. The second model embeds additive separability within the loss function of the Hamiltonian neural network. The third model embeds additive separability through the architecture of the Hamiltonian neural network using conjoined multilayer perceptions. We empirically compare the three models against state-of-the-art Hamiltonian neural networks, and demonstrate that the separable Hamiltonian neural networks, which alleviate complexity between the state variables, are more effective at regressing the Hamiltonian and its vector field.

Previous approaches have used adversarial training to align features at both image-level and instance-level. At the instance level, finding a suitable source sample that aligns with a target sample is crucial. A source sample is considered suitable if it differs from the target sample only in domain, without differences in unimportant characteristics such as orientation and color, which can hinder the model's focus on aligning the domain difference. However, existing instance-level feature alignment methods struggle to find suitable source instances because their search scope is limited to mini-batches. Mini-batches are often so small in size that they do not always contain suitable source instances. The insufficient diversity of mini-batches becomes problematic particularly when the target instances have high intra-class variance. To address this issue, we propose a memory-based instance-level domain adaptation framework. Our method aligns a target instance with the most similar source instance of the same category retrieved from a memory storage. Specifically, we introduce a memory module that dynamically stores the pooled features of all labeled source instances, categorized by their labels. Additionally, we introduce a simple yet effective memory retrieval module that retrieves a set of matching memory slots for target instances. Our experiments on various domain shift scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing non-memory-based methods significantly. ",

In this paper, we propose to explore fundamental affordances rather than object categories, i.e., common attributes that enable different objects to accomplish the same task. Moreover, we propose a novel multi-level chain-of-thought prompting (MLCoT) to extract the affordance knowledge from large language models, which contains multi-level reasoning steps from task to object examples to essential visual attributes with rationales. Furthermore, to fully exploit knowledge to benefit object recognition and localization, we propose a knowledge-conditional detection framework, namely CoTDet. It conditions the detector from the knowledge to generate object queries and regress boxes. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoTDet outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently and significantly (+15.6 box AP and +14.8 mask AP) and can generate rationales for why objects are detected to afford the task.

Data marketplaces are essential for trading high-quality, private-domain data not publicly available online. However, due to growing data privacy concerns, direct data exchange is inappropriate. Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that exchanges data utilities (in form of local models or gradients) among multiple parties without directly sharing the raw data. However, several challenges exist when applying existing FL architectures to construct a data marketplace: (i) In existing FL architectures, Data Acquirers (DAs) cannot privately evaluate local models from Data Providers (DPs) prior to trading; (ii) Model aggregation protocols in existing FL designs struggle to exclude malicious DPs without \"overfitting\" to the DA's (possibly biased) root dataset; (iii) Prior FL designs lack a proper billing mechanism to enforce the DA to fairly allocate the reward according to contributions made by different DPs. To address above challenges, we propose martFL, the first federated learning architecture that is specifically designed to enable a secure utility-driven data marketplace. At a high level, martFL is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a quality-aware model aggregation protocol that achieves robust local model aggregation even when the DA's root dataset is biased; (ii) a verifiable data transaction protocol that enables the DA to prove, both succinctly and in zero-knowledge, that it has faithfully aggregates the local models submitted by different DPs according to the committed aggregation weights, based on which the DPs can unambiguously claim the corresponding reward. We implement a prototype of martFL and evaluate it extensively over various tasks. The results show that martFL can improve the model accuracy by up to 25% while saving up to 64% data acquisition cost. ",

In this work, we propose a bi-level adversarial framework to promote the robustness of detection in the presence of distinct corruptions. We first propose a bi-level optimization formulation to introduce dynamic adversarial learning. Specifically, it is composited by the learnable generation of corruptions to maximize the losses as the lower-level objective and the robustness promotion of detectors as the upper-level one. We also provide a hierarchical reinforced learning strategy to discover the most detrimental corruptions and balance the performance between robustness and accuracy. To better disentangle the corruptions from salient features, we also propose a spatial-frequency interaction network for target detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate our scheme remarkably improves 21.96% IOU across a wide array of corruptions and notably promotes 4.97% IOU on the general benchmark.

Orthogonal to homogeneous graphs, the types of nodes and edges in heterogeneous graphs are diverse so that specialized graph contrastive learning methods are required. Most existing methods for heterogeneous graph contrastive learning are implemented by transforming heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous graphs, which may lead to ramifications that the valuable information carried by non-target nodes is undermined thereby exacerbating the performance of contrastive learning models. Additionally, current heterogeneous graph contrastive learning methods are mainly based on initial meta-paths given by the dataset, yet according to our deep-going exploration, we derive empirical conclusions: only initial meta-paths cannot contain sufficiently discriminative information; and various types of meta-paths can effectively promote the performance of heterogeneous graph contrastive learning methods. To this end, we propose a new multi-scale meta-path integrated heterogeneous graph contrastive learning (M2HGCL) model, which discards the conventional heterogeneity-homogeneity transformation and performs the graph contrastive learning in a joint manner. Specifically, we expand the meta-paths and jointly aggregate the direct neighbor information, the initial meta-path neighbor information and the expanded meta-path neighbor information to sufficiently capture discriminative information. A specific positive sampling strategy is further imposed to remedy the intrinsic deficiency of contrastive learning, i.e., the hard negative sample sampling issue.

    "title": "Turn Fake into Real: Adversarial Head Turn Attacks Against Deepfake  Detection",
    "abstract": "Malicious use of deepfakes leads to serious public concerns and reduces people's trust in digital media. Although effective deepfake detectors have been proposed, they are substantially vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To evaluate the detector's robustness, recent studies have explored various attacks. However, all existing attacks are limited to 2D image perturbations, which are hard to translate into real-world facial changes. In this paper, we propose adversarial head turn (AdvHeat), the first attempt at 3D adversarial face views against deepfake detectors, based on face view synthesis from a single-view fake image. Extensive experiments validate the vulnerability of various detectors to AdvHeat in realistic, black-box scenarios. For example, AdvHeat based on a simple random search yields a high attack success rate of 96.8% with 360 searching steps. When additional query access is allowed, we can further reduce the step budget to 50. Additional analyses demonstrate that AdvHeat is better than conventional attacks on both the cross-detector transferability and robustness to defenses. The adversarial images generated by AdvHeat are also shown to have natural looks. Our code, including that for generating a multi-view dataset consisting of 360 synthetic views for each of 1000 IDs from FaceForensics++, is available at https://github.com/twowwj/AdvHeaT. ",

Despite the advancements in detection accuracy and efficiency, these models tend to fail when faced with such attacks, rendering them ineffective. Therefore, bolstering the adversarial robustness of 3D detection models has become a crucial issue that demands immediate attention and innovative solutions. To mitigate this issue, we propose a depth-aware robust adversarial training method for monocular 3D object detection, dubbed DART3D. Specifically, we first design an adversarial attack that iteratively degrades the 2D and 3D perception capabilities of 3D object detection models(IDP), serves as the foundation for our subsequent defense mechanism. In response to this attack, we propose an uncertainty-based residual learning method for adversarial training. Our adversarial training approach capitalizes on the inherent uncertainty, enabling the model to significantly improve its robustness against adversarial attacks. We conducted extensive experiments on the KITTI 3D datasets, demonstrating that DART3D surpasses direct adversarial training (the most popular approach) under attacks in 3D object detection $AP_{R40}$ of car category for the Easy, Moderate, and Hard settings, with improvements of 4.415%, 4.112%, and 3.195%, respectively.

They are often created through copy-and-paste practices during development and maintenance activities. Since code clones may require consistent updates and coherent management, they present a challenging issue in software maintenance. Therefore, many studies have been conducted to find various types of clones with accuracy, scalability, or performance. However, the exploration of the nature of code clones has been limited. Even the fundamental question of whether code snippets in the same clone set were written by the same author or different authors has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of code clones with a focus on authorship. We analyzed the authorship of code clones at the line-level granularity for Java files in 153 Apache projects stored on GitHub and addressed three research questions. Based on these research questions, we found that there are a substantial number of clone lines across all projects (an average of 18.5\\% for all projects). Furthermore, authors who contribute to many non-clone lines also contribute to many clone lines. Additionally, we found that one-third of clone sets are primarily contributed to by multiple leading authors. These results confirm our intuitive understanding of clone characteristics, although no previous publications have provided empirical validation data from multiple projects. As the results could assist in designing better clone management techniques, we will explore the implications of developing an effective clone management tool. ",

This approach is based on a hierarchical construction of an ANNs tree. The power system is divided into multiple clusters, with a modular architecture. For each cluster an ANN is constructed, were the ANNs of the different clusters are organized in a hierarchical manner in which the data from a lower-level layer is fed into an upper layer in accordance with the electric correlation between the clusters. The solution time is fast as it is based on the neural networks predictions and also enables parallel computing of all clusters in any given layer. The various clusters have a uniform designed single-hidden-layer ANNs, thus providing a straightforward, simple and generic architectural implementation. The suggested methodology is an important milestone for bypassing power flow classical methods and introducing a novel machine learning based approach. The solution for three-phase unbalance IEEE-123 system as well as EPRI Ckt5 system are presented. The predictions of the ANNs of the hierarchical structures are compared to the solution as calculated by OpenDSS simulation software, with very promising results. ",

The protocol enables nodes to predict the time (or the number of interactions) needed to estimate the global average with the desired accuracy. Consequently, nodes can make informed decisions on their use of measured and estimated data while gaining awareness of the global structure of the network, as well as their role in it.

Existing methods leverage CLIP's strong zero-shot recognition ability to align object-level embeddings with textual embeddings of categories. However, we observe that using CLIP for object-level alignment results in overfitting to base categories, i.e., novel categories most similar to base categories have particularly poor performance as they are recognized as similar base categories. In this paper, we first identify that the loss of critical fine-grained local image semantics hinders existing methods from attaining strong base-to-novel generalization. Then, we propose Early Dense Alignment (EDA) to bridge the gap between generalizable local semantics and object-level prediction. In EDA, we use object-level supervision to learn the dense-level rather than object-level alignment to maintain the local fine-grained semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance to competing approaches under the same strict setting and without using external training resources, i.e., improving the +8.4% novel box AP50 on COCO and +3.9% rare mask AP on LVIS.

Models that generate graphs with arbitrary features are important basic technologies in repeated simulations of networks and prediction of topology changes.

Previously, we have proposed GraphTune, a generative model for graphs that continuously tune specific graph features of generated graphs while maintaining most of the features of a given graph dataset. However, the tuning accuracy of graph features in GraphTune has not been sufficient for practical applications. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the accuracy of GraphTune by adding a new mechanism to feed back errors of graph features of generated graphs and by training them alternately and independently. Experiments on a real-world graph dataset showed that the features in the generated graphs are accurately tuned compared with conventional models. ",

In either case we lose potentially relevant information which could have otherwise been exploited by our learning methods. We propose a multimodal message passing network which not only learns end-to-end from the structure of graphs, but also from their possibly divers set of multimodal node features. Our model uses dedicated (neural) encoders to naturally learn embeddings for node features belonging to five different types of modalities, including numbers, texts, dates, images and geometries, which are projected into a joint representation space together with their relational information. We implement and demonstrate our model on node classification and link prediction for artificial and real-worlds datasets, and evaluate the effect that each modality has on the overall performance in an inverse ablation study. Our results indicate that end-to-end multimodal learning from any arbitrary knowledge graph is indeed possible, and that including multimodal information can significantly affect performance, but that much depends on the characteristics of the data.

Moreover, as the network environment becomes more complex, HTTP-based Trojan is more concealed than others. At present, many intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are increasingly difficult to effectively detect such Trojan traffic due to the inherent shortcomings of the methods used and the backwardness of training data. Classical anomaly detection and traditional machine learning-based (TML-based) anomaly detection are highly dependent on expert knowledge to extract features artificially, which is difficult to implement in HTTP-based Trojan traffic detection. Deep learning-based (DL-based) anomaly detection has been locally applied to IDSs, but it cannot be transplanted to HTTP-based Trojan traffic detection directly. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a neural network detection model (HSTF-Model) based on hierarchical spatiotemporal features of traffic. Meanwhile, we combine deep learning algorithms with expert knowledge through feature encoders and statistical characteristics to improve the self-learning ability of the model. Experiments indicate that F1 of HSTF-Model can reach 99.4% in real traffic. In addition, we present a dataset BTHT consisting of HTTP-based benign and Trojan traffic to facilitate related research in the field. ",

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Cognition-Mode Aware Variational Representation Learning Framework (CMVF) that can be directly applied to existing KT methods. Our framework uses a probabilistic model to generate a distribution for each student, accounting for uncertainty in those with limited practice records, and estimate the student's distribution via variational inference (VI).

At last, extensive experimental results confirm that CMVF can effectively aid existing KT methods in learning more robust student representations.

However, despite technical advances -- for every new application domain, we need to train an NCF model from scratch. In contrast, pre-trained vision and language models are routinely applied to diverse applications directly (zero-shot) or with limited fine-tuning. Inspired by the impact of pre-trained models, we explore the possibility of pre-trained recommender models that support building recommender systems in new domains, with minimal or no retraining, without the use of any auxiliary user or item information. Zero-shot recommendation without auxiliary information is challenging because we cannot form associations between users and items across datasets when there are no overlapping users or items. Our fundamental insight is that the statistical characteristics of the user-item interaction matrix are universally available across different domains and datasets. Thus, we use the statistical characteristics of the user-item interaction matrix to identify dataset-independent representations for users and items. We show how to learn universal (i.e., supporting zero-shot adaptation without user or item auxiliary information) representations for nodes and edges from the bipartite user-item interaction graph. We learn representations by exploiting the statistical properties of the interaction data, including user and item marginals, and the size and density distributions of their clusters. ",

To identify when these hallucination scenarios occur, we examine the properties of the generated text in the embedding space. Specifically, we draw inspiration from the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) tool in analyzing the pattern evolution of text embeddings across sentences. We empirically demonstrate how the spectrum of sentence embeddings over paragraphs is constantly low-rank for the generated text, unlike that of the ground-truth text. Importantly, we find that evaluation cases having LLM hallucinations correspond to ground-truth embedding patterns with a higher number of modes being poorly approximated by the few modes associated with LLM embedding patterns. In analogy to near-field electromagnetic evanescent waves, the embedding DMD eigenmodes of the generated text with hallucinations vanishes quickly across sentences as opposed to those of the ground-truth text. This suggests that the hallucinations result from both the generation techniques and the underlying representation. ",

    "abstract": "As advanced image manipulation techniques emerge, detecting the manipulation becomes increasingly important. Despite the success of recent learning-based approaches for image manipulation detection, they typically require expensive pixel-level annotations to train, while exhibiting degraded performance when testing on images that are differently manipulated compared with training images. To address these limitations, we propose weakly-supervised image manipulation detection, such that only binary image-level labels (authentic or tampered with) are required for training purpose. Such a weakly-supervised setting can leverage more training images and has the potential to adapt quickly to new manipulation techniques. To improve the generalization ability, we propose weakly-supervised self-consistency learning (WSCL) to leverage the weakly annotated images. Specifically, two consistency properties are learned: multi-source consistency (MSC) and inter-patch consistency (IPC). MSC exploits different content-agnostic information and enables cross-source learning via an online pseudo label generation and refinement process. IPC performs global pair-wise patch-patch relationship reasoning to discover a complete region of manipulation. Extensive experiments validate that our WSCL, even though is weakly supervised, exhibits competitive performance compared with fully-supervised counterpart under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluations, as well as reasonable manipulation localization ability.

We consider networked discrete-time uncertain nonlinear systems with additive stochastic noise and model parametric uncertainty. Such settings arise when multiple systems interact in an uncertain environment and only observational data is available. We address two limitations of existing approaches for formal synthesis of controllers for networks of uncertain systems satisfying complex temporal specifications. Firstly, whilst existing approaches rely on the stochasticity to be Gaussian, the heterogeneous nature of composed systems typically yields a more complex stochastic behavior. Secondly, exact models of the systems involved are generally not available or difficult to acquire. To address these challenges, we show how abstraction-based control synthesis for uncertain systems based on sub-probability couplings can be extended to networked systems. We design controllers based on parameter uncertainty sets identified from observational data and approximate possibly arbitrary noise distributions using Gaussian mixture models whilst quantifying the incurred stochastic coupling. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a nonlinear package delivery case study with a complex specification, and a platoon of cars. ",

However, the accuracy of current methods suffers from the bottleneck of less-efficient network architecture and lack of motion rigidity for regularization. In this paper, we propose a superior model named EMR-MSF by borrowing the advantages of network architecture design under the scope of supervised learning. We further impose explicit and robust geometric constraints with an elaborately constructed ego-motion aggregation module where a rigidity soft mask is proposed to filter out dynamic regions for stable ego-motion estimation using static regions. Moreover, we propose a motion consistency loss along with a mask regularization loss to fully exploit static regions. Several efficient training strategies are integrated including a gradient detachment technique and an enhanced view synthesis process for better performance. Our proposed method outperforms the previous self-supervised works by a large margin and catches up to the performance of supervised methods. On the KITTI scene flow benchmark, our approach improves the SF-all metric of the state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular method by 44% and demonstrates superior performance across sub-tasks including depth and visual odometry, amongst other self-supervised single-task or multi-task methods.

Due to low aggregation, the electricity demands can be highly stochastic and point estimates would lead to inflated errors. Interval estimation in this scenario, would provide a range of values within which the future values might lie and helps quantify the errors around the point estimates. This paper introduces a residual bootstrap algorithm to generate interval estimates of day-ahead electricity demand. A machine learning algorithm is used to obtain the point estimates of electricity demand and respective residuals on the training set. The obtained residuals are stored in memory and the memory is further partitioned. Days with similar demand patterns are grouped in clusters using an unsupervised learning algorithm and these clusters are used to partition the memory. The point estimates for test day are used to find the closest cluster of similar days and the residuals are bootstrapped from the chosen cluster. This algorithm is evaluated on the real electricity demand data from EULR(End Use Load Research) and is compared to other bootstrapping methods for varying confidence intervals. ",

Although there are extensive works on image-level attacks, most are restricted to 2D pixel spaces, and such attacks are not always physically realistic in our 3D world. Here we present Adv3D, the first exploration of modeling adversarial examples as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Advances in NeRF provide photorealistic appearances and 3D accurate generation, yielding a more realistic and realizable adversarial example. We train our adversarial NeRF by minimizing the surrounding objects' confidence predicted by 3D detectors on the training set. Then we evaluate Adv3D on the unseen validation set and show that it can cause a large performance reduction when rendering NeRF in any sampled pose. To generate physically realizable adversarial examples, we propose primitive-aware sampling and semantic-guided regularization that enable 3D patch attacks with camouflage adversarial texture. Experimental results demonstrate that the trained adversarial NeRF generalizes well to different poses, scenes, and 3D detectors. Finally, we provide a defense method to our attacks that involves adversarial training through data augmentation. Project page: https://len-li.github.io/adv3d-web ",

(2) Despite having large inter-frame correlations in a video, collecting annotations for a large number of frames per video is expensive, time-consuming, and often redundant. (3) Existing semi-supervised techniques on static images can hardly exploit the temporal motion dynamics inherently present in videos.

In particular, we introduce cross-IoU and cross-divergence based selection methods over a set of estimated predictions to include robust pseudo-labels for bounding boxes and class labels, respectively. To strike a balance between confirmation bias and uncertainty noise in pseudo-labels, we propose confidence threshold based combination of hard and soft pseudo-labels.

They are commonly defined as 1D or 2D functions that map simple features to these optical properties. As the process of designing a transfer function is typically tedious and unintuitive, several approaches have been proposed for their interactive specification. In this paper, we present a novel method to define transfer functions for volume rendering by leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of self-supervised pre-trained vision transformers. To design a transfer function, users simply select the structures of interest in a slice viewer, and our method automatically selects similar structures based on the high-level features extracted by the neural network. Contrary to previous learning-based transfer function approaches, our method does not require training of models and allows for quick inference, enabling an interactive exploration of the volume data. Our approach reduces the amount of necessary annotations by interactively informing the user about the current classification, so they can focus on annotating the structures of interest that still require annotation. In practice, this allows users to design transfer functions within seconds, instead of minutes. We compare our method to existing learning-based approaches in terms of annotation and compute time, as well as with respect to segmentation accuracy.

Within these communities the prosumers can engage in peer-to-peer trading, fostering local collaborations and increasing awareness about energy usage and flexible consumption. However, even under these favorable conditions, prosumer engagement levels remain low, requiring trading mechanisms that are aligned with their social values and expectations. In this paper, we introduce an innovative hedonic game coordination and cooperation model for P2P energy trading among prosumers which considers the social relationships within an energy community to create energy coalitions and facilitate energy transactions among them. We defined a heuristic that optimizes the prosumers coalitions, considering their social and energy price preferences and balancing the energy demand and supply within the community. We integrated the proposed hedonic game model into a state-of-the-art blockchain-based P2P energy flexibility market and evaluated its performance within an energy community of prosumers. The evaluation results on a blockchain-based P2P energy flexibility market show the effectiveness in considering social factors when creating coalitions, increasing the total amount of energy transacted in a market session by 5% compared with other game theory-based solutions. Finally, it shows the importance of the social dimensions of P2P energy transactions, the positive social dynamics in the energy community increasing the amount of energy transacted by more than 10% while contributing to a more balanced energy demand and supply within the community.

Specifically, we first propose a new sequential multi-scale perception (SMSP) algorithm to predict user skeleton based on the channel state information (CSI) extracted from wireless signals. This prediction then guides GAI to provide users with AIGC, such as virtual character generation. To ensure the efficient operation of the proposed framework in resource constrained networks, we further design a pricing-based incentive mechanism and introduce a diffusion model based approach to generate an optimal pricing strategy for the service provisioning. The strategy maximizes the user's utility while enhancing the participation of the virtual service provider (VSP) in AIGC provision.

We employ the visual encoder of FastSAM, an efficient variant of the SAM, to extract visual representations in RS scenes. To adapt FastSAM to focus on some specific ground objects in the RS scenes, we propose a convolutional adaptor to aggregate the task-oriented change information. Moreover, to utilize the semantic representations that are inherent to SAM features, we introduce a task-agnostic semantic learning branch to model the semantic latent in bi-temporal RSIs. The resulting method, SAMCD, obtains superior accuracy compared to the SOTA methods and exhibits a sample-efficient learning ability that is comparable to semi-supervised CD methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that adapts VFMs for the CD of HR RSIs. ",

However, IRS faces significant challenges in providing accurate recommendations under limited observations, especially in the context of interactive collaborative filtering. These problems are exacerbated by the cold start problem and data sparsity problem. Existing Multi-Armed Bandit methods, despite their carefully designed exploration strategies, often struggle to provide satisfactory results in the early stages due to the lack of interaction data. Furthermore, these methods are computationally intractable when applied to non-linear models, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, the Interactive Graph Convolutional Filtering model. Our proposed method extends interactive collaborative filtering into the graph model to enhance the performance of collaborative filtering between users and items. We incorporate variational inference techniques to overcome the computational hurdles posed by non-linear models. Furthermore, we employ Bayesian meta-learning methods to effectively address the cold-start problem and derive theoretical regret bounds for our proposed method, ensuring a robust performance guarantee. Extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets validate our method and demonstrate its superiority over existing baselines. ",

These practices are encompassed within the term \"DevOps.\" This descriptive approach to an information system or application, alongside the configuration of its constituent components, has necessitated the development of descriptive languages paired with specialized engines for automating systems administration tasks. Among these, the tandem of Ansible (engine) and YAML (descriptive language) stands out as the two most prevalent tools in the market, facing notable competition mainly from Terraform. The current document presents an inquiry into a solution for generating and managing Ansible YAML roles and playbooks, utilizing Generative LLMs (Language Models) to translate human descriptions into code. Our efforts are focused on identifying plausible directions and outlining the potential industrial applications.

    "abstract": "Interpretable machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence have become essential in many applications. The trade-off between interpretability and model performance is the traitor to developing intrinsic and model-agnostic interpretation methods. Although model explanation approaches have achieved significant success in vision and natural language domains, explaining time series remains challenging. The complex pattern in the feature domain, coupled with the additional temporal dimension, hinders efficient interpretation. Saliency maps have been applied to interpret time series windows as images. However, they are not naturally designed for sequential data, thus suffering various issues. This paper extensively analyzes the consistency and robustness of saliency maps for time series features and temporal attribution. Specifically, we examine saliency explanations from both perturbation-based and gradient-based explanation models in a time series classification task. Our experimental results on five real-world datasets show that they all lack consistent and robust performances to some extent. By drawing attention to the flawed saliency explanation models, we motivate to develop consistent and robust explanations for time series classification. ",

In practical NISQA scenarios, untrusted third-party resources are often employed during deep neural network training to reduce costs. However, it would introduce a potential security vulnerability as specially designed untrusted resources can launch backdoor attacks against NISQA systems. Existing backdoor attacks primarily focus on classification tasks and are not directly applicable to NISQA which is a regression task. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack on NISQA tasks, leveraging presence events as triggers to achieving highly stealthy attacks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted experiments on four benchmark datasets and employed two state-of-the-art NISQA models. The results demonstrate that the proposed backdoor attack achieved an average attack success rate of up to 99% with a poisoning rate of only 3%. ",

    "abstract": "Implementing neural networks for clinical use in medical applications necessitates the ability for the network to detect when input data differs significantly from the training data, with the aim of preventing unreliable predictions. The community has developed several methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, within which distance-based approaches - such as Mahalanobis distance - have shown potential. This paper challenges the prevailing community understanding that there is an optimal layer, or combination of layers, of a neural network for applying Mahalanobis distance for detection of any OOD pattern. Using synthetic artefacts to emulate OOD patterns, this paper shows the optimum layer to apply Mahalanobis distance changes with the type of OOD pattern, showing there is no one-fits-all solution. This paper also shows that separating this OOD detector into multiple detectors at different depths of the network can enhance the robustness for detecting different OOD patterns. These insights were validated on real-world OOD tasks, training models on CheXpert chest X-rays with no support devices, then using scans with unseen pacemakers (we manually labelled 50% of CheXpert for this research) and unseen sex as OOD cases. The results inform best-practices for the use of Mahalanobis distance for OOD detection.

This paper presents NFork, a system that helps NF domain experts to productively develop concurrent NFs by abstracting away concurrency from developers. The key scheme behind NFork's design is to exploit NF characteristics to overcome the limitations of prior work on concurrency programming. Developers write NFs as sequential programs, and during runtime, NFork performs transparent parallelization by processing packets in different cores. Exploiting NF characteristics, NFork leverages transactional memory and develops efficient concurrent data structures to achieve scalability and guarantee the absence of concurrency bugs. Since NFork manages concurrency, it further provides (i) a profiler that reveals the root causes of scalability bottlenecks inherent to the NF's semantics and (ii) actionable recipes for developers to mitigate these root causes by relaxing the NF's semantics. We show that NFs developed with NFork achieve competitive scalability with those in Cisco VPP [16], and NFork's profiler and recipes can effectively aid developers in optimizing NF scalability. ",

To enjoy the advantages of both, we propose a novel 3D representation, Neural Vector Fields (NVF), which adopts the explicit learning process to manipulate meshes and implicit unsigned distance function (UDF) representation to break the barriers in resolution and topology. This is achieved by directly predicting the displacements from surface queries and modeling shapes as Vector Fields, rather than relying on network differentiation to obtain direction fields as most existing UDF-based methods do. In this way, our approach is capable of encoding both the distance and the direction fields so that the calculation of direction fields is differentiation-free, circumventing the non-trivial surface extraction step. Furthermore, building upon NVFs, we propose to incorporate two types of shape codebooks, \\ie, NVFs (Lite or Ultra), to promote cross-category reconstruction through encoding cross-object priors. Moreover, we propose a new regularization based on analyzing the zero-curl property of NVFs, and implement this through the fully differentiable framework of our NVF (ultra). We evaluate both NVFs on four surface reconstruction scenarios, including watertight vs non-watertight shapes, category-agnostic reconstruction vs category-unseen reconstruction, category-specific, and cross-domain reconstruction.

Although there have been many efforts to mine meaningful logical rules over KGs, existing methods suffer from the computationally intensive searches over the rule space and a lack of scalability for large-scale KGs. Besides, they often ignore the semantics of relations which is crucial for uncovering logical connections. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in the field of natural language processing and various applications, owing to their emergent ability and generalizability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, ChatRule, unleashing the power of large language models for mining logical rules over knowledge graphs. Specifically, the framework is initiated with an LLM-based rule generator, leveraging both the semantic and structural information of KGs to prompt LLMs to generate logical rules. To refine the generated rules, a rule ranking module estimates the rule quality by incorporating facts from existing KGs. Last, a rule validator harnesses the reasoning ability of LLMs to validate the logical correctness of ranked rules through chain-of-thought reasoning. ChatRule is evaluated on four large-scale KGs, w.r.t. different rule quality metrics and downstream tasks, showing the effectiveness and scalability of our method. ",

Such limitation amplifies the complexity and deployment costs in practical applications. To overcome this deficiency, in this paper, we propose a Cross-consistent Deep Unfolding Network (CDUN) for All-In-One VR, which enables the employment of a single model to remove diverse degradations for the first time. Specifically, the proposed CDUN accomplishes a novel iterative optimization framework, capable of restoring frames corrupted by corresponding degradations according to the degradation features given in advance. To empower the framework for eliminating diverse degradations, we devise a Sequence-wise Adaptive Degradation Estimator (SADE) to estimate degradation features for the input corrupted video. By orchestrating these two cascading procedures, CDUN achieves adaptive processing for diverse degradation. In addition, we introduce a window-based inter-frame fusion strategy to utilize information from more adjacent frames. This strategy involves the progressive stacking of temporal windows in multiple iterations, effectively enlarging the temporal receptive field and enabling each frame's restoration to leverage information from distant frames.

In this paper, we generalize this approach to cellular complexes and introduce the cell inference optimization problem, i.e., the problem of augmenting the observed graph by a set of cells, such that the eigenvectors of the associated Hodge Laplacian provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed edge flows on the graph. We show that this problem is NP-hard and introduce an efficient approximation algorithm for its solution.

The presented system provides complementary information to other sensors such as LiDAR and camera, and can be used in a wide range of applications beyond autonomous racing. ",

    "title": "Evolving linguistic divergence on polarizing social media",
    "abstract": "Language change is influenced by many factors, but often starts from synchronic variation, where multiple linguistic patterns or forms coexist, or where different speech communities use language in increasingly different ways. Besides regional or economic reasons, communities may form and segregate based on political alignment. The latter, referred to as political polarization, is of growing societal concern across the world. Here we map and quantify linguistic divergence across the partisan left-right divide in the United States, using social media data. We develop a general methodology to delineate (social) media users by their political preference, based on which (potentially biased) news media accounts they do and do not follow on a given platform. Our data consists of 1.5M short posts by 10k users (about 20M words) from the social media platform Twitter (now \"X\"). Delineating this sample involved mining the platform for the lists of followers (n=422M) of 72 large news media accounts. We quantify divergence in topics of conversation and word frequencies, messaging sentiment, and lexical semantics of words and emoji. We find signs of linguistic divergence across all these aspects, especially in topics and themes of conversation, in line with previous research. While US American English remains largely intelligible within its large speech community, our findings point at areas where miscommunication may eventually arise given ongoing polarization and therefore potential linguistic divergence. Our methodology - combining data mining, lexicostatistics, machine learning, large language models and a systematic human annotation approach - is largely language and platform agnostic. In other words, while we focus here on US political divides and US English, the same approach is applicable to other countries, languages, and social media platforms. ",

    "abstract": "Instruction-tuning has become an integral part of training pipelines for Large Language Models (LLMs) and has been shown to yield strong performance gains. In an orthogonal line of research, Annotation Error Detection (AED) has emerged as a tool for detecting quality issues of gold-standard labels. But so far, the application of AED methods is limited to discriminative settings. It is an open question how well AED methods generalize to generative settings which are becoming widespread via generative LLMs. In this work, we present a first and new benchmark for AED on instruction-tuning data: Donkii. It encompasses three instruction-tuning datasets enriched with annotations by experts and semi-automatic methods. We find that all three datasets contain clear-cut errors that sometimes directly propagate into instruction-tuned LLMs. We propose four AED baselines for the generative setting and evaluate them comprehensively on the newly introduced dataset. Our results demonstrate that choosing the right AED method and model size is indeed crucial, thereby deriving practical recommendations. To gain insights, we provide a first case-study to examine how the quality of the instruction-tuning datasets influences downstream performance. ",

Existing studies often concentrate solely on features acquired from limited normal data, disregarding the latent prior knowledge present in extensive natural image datasets. To address this constraint, we propose a Prior Knowledge Guided Network(PKG-Net) for the VAD task. First, an auto-encoder network is incorporated into a teacher-student architecture to learn two designated proxy tasks: future frame prediction and teacher network imitation, which can provide better generalization ability on unknown samples. Second, knowledge distillation on proper feature blocks is also proposed to increase the multi-scale detection ability of the model. In addition, prediction error and teacher-student feature inconsistency are combined to evaluate anomaly scores of inference samples more comprehensively. Experimental results on three public benchmarks validate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method, which surpasses recent state-of-the-arts. ",

    "abstract": "With the boom of Large Language Models (LLMs), the research of solving Math Word Problem (MWP) has recently made great progress. However, there are few studies to examine the security of LLMs in math solving ability. Instead of attacking prompts in the use of LLMs, we propose a MathAttack model to attack MWP samples which are closer to the essence of security in solving math problems. Compared to traditional text adversarial attack, it is essential to preserve the mathematical logic of original MWPs during the attacking. To this end, we propose logical entity recognition to identify logical entries which are then frozen. Subsequently, the remaining text are attacked by adopting a word-level attacker. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset RobustMath to evaluate the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability. Extensive experiments on our RobustMath and two another math benchmark datasets GSM8K and MultiAirth show that MathAttack could effectively attack the math solving ability of LLMs. In the experiments, we observe that (1) Our adversarial samples from higher-accuracy LLMs are also effective for attacking LLMs with lower accuracy (e.g., transfer from larger to smaller-size LLMs, or from few-shot to zero-shot prompts); (2) Complex MWPs (such as more solving steps, longer text, more numbers) are more vulnerable to attack; (3) We can improve the robustness of LLMs by using our adversarial samples in few-shot prompts. Finally, we hope our practice and observation can serve as an important attempt towards enhancing the robustness of LLMs in math solving ability. We will release our code and dataset. ",

    "abstract": "We study online classification in the presence of noisy labels. The noise mechanism is modeled by a general kernel that specifies, for any feature-label pair, a (known) set of distributions over noisy labels. At each time step, an adversary selects an unknown distribution from the distribution set specified by the kernel based on the actual feature-label pair, and generates the noisy label from the selected distribution. The learner then makes a prediction based on the actual features and noisy labels observed thus far, and incurs loss $1$ if the prediction differs from the underlying truth (and $0$ otherwise). The prediction quality is quantified through minimax risk, which computes the cumulative loss over a finite horizon $T$. We show that for a wide range of natural noise kernels, adversarially selected features, and finite class of labeling functions, minimax risk can be upper bounded independent of the time horizon and logarithmic in the size of labeling function class. We then extend these results to inifinite classes and stochastically generated features via the concept of stochastic sequential covering. Our results extend and encompass findings of Ben-David et al.

To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical investigation to evaluate the efficacy of diverse post-hoc GNN explainers under varying degrees of label noise.

Secondly, even minor levels of label noise, inconsequential to GNN performance, harm the quality of generated explanations substantially.

    "abstract": "The edge processing of deep neural networks (DNNs) is becoming increasingly important due to its ability to extract valuable information directly at the data source to minimize latency and energy consumption. Frequency-domain model compression, such as with the Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT), has been identified as an efficient alternative. However, the benefits of frequency-domain processing are often offset by the increased multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations required. This paper proposes a novel approach to an energy-efficient acceleration of frequency-domain neural networks by utilizing analog-domain frequency-based tensor transformations. Our approach offers unique opportunities to enhance computational efficiency, resulting in several high-level advantages, including array micro-architecture with parallelism, ADC/DAC-free analog computations, and increased output sparsity. Our approach achieves more compact cells by eliminating the need for trainable parameters in the transformation matrix. Moreover, our novel array micro-architecture enables adaptive stitching of cells column-wise and row-wise, thereby facilitating perfect parallelism in computations. Additionally, our scheme enables ADC/DAC-free computations by training against highly quantized matrix-vector products, leveraging the parameter-free nature of matrix multiplications. Another crucial aspect of our design is its ability to handle signed-bit processing for frequency-based transformations. This leads to increased output sparsity and reduced digitization workload. On a 16$\\times$16 crossbars, for 8-bit input processing, the proposed approach achieves the energy efficiency of 1602 tera operations per second per Watt (TOPS/W) without early termination strategy and 5311 TOPS/W with early termination strategy at VDD = 0.8 V.

By reverse-engineering a set of trained RNNs, we find that gradient descent in practice discovers our construction. In particular, we examine RNNs trained to solve simple in-context learning tasks on which Transformers are known to excel and find that gradient descent instills in our RNNs the same attention-based in-context learning algorithm used by Transformers. Our findings highlight the importance of multiplicative interactions in neural networks and suggest that certain RNNs might be unexpectedly implementing attention under the hood. ",

Although the past decade has witnessed an explosion of excellent work studying algorithm biases, achieving fairness in real-world AI production systems has remained a challenging task. Most existing works fail to excel in practical applications since either they have conflicting measurement techniques and/ or heavy assumptions, or require code-access of the production models, whereas real systems demand an easy-to-implement measurement framework and a systematic way to correct the detected sources of bias. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in causal inference and interpretable machine learning to present an algorithm-agnostic framework (MIIF) to Measure, Interpret, and Improve the Fairness of an algorithmic decision. We measure the algorithm bias using randomized experiments, which enables the simultaneous measurement of disparate treatment, disparate impact, and economic value. Furthermore, using modern interpretability techniques, we develop an explainable machine learning model which accurately interprets and distills the beliefs of a blackbox algorithm. Altogether, these techniques create a simple and powerful toolset for studying algorithm fairness, especially for understanding the cost of fairness in practical applications like e-commerce and targeted advertising, where industry A/B testing is already abundant.

Clinical data analysis plays a crucial role in predicting the survival of colorectal cancer patients, enabling clinicians to make informed treatment decisions. However, utilizing clinical data can be challenging, especially when dealing with imbalanced outcomes. This paper focuses on developing algorithms to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival of colorectal cancer patients using clinical datasets, with particular emphasis on the highly imbalanced 1-year survival prediction task. To address this issue, we propose a method that creates a pipeline of some of standard balancing techniques to increase the true positive rate. Evaluation is conducted on a colorectal cancer dataset from the SEER database. Methods: The pre-processing step consists of removing records with missing values and merging categories. The minority class of 1-year and 3-year survival tasks consists of 10% and 20% of the data, respectively. Edited Nearest Neighbor, Repeated edited nearest neighbor (RENN), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Techniques (SMOTE), and pipelines of SMOTE and RENN approaches were used and compared for balancing the data with tree-based classifiers. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Extra Tree, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting (LGBM) are used in this article. Method. Results: The performance evaluation utilizes a 5-fold cross-validation approach. In the case of highly imbalanced datasets (1-year), our proposed method with LGBM outperforms other sampling methods with the sensitivity of 72.30%. For the task of imbalance (3-year survival), the combination of RENN and LGBM achieves a sensitivity of 80.81%, indicating that our proposed method works best for highly imbalanced datasets. Conclusions: Our proposed method significantly improves mortality prediction for the minority class of colorectal cancer patients. ",

To overcome these challenges, we propose a safe and robust backdoor-based watermark injection technique that leverages the diverse knowledge from a single out-of-distribution (OoD) image, which serves as a secret key for IP verification. The independence of training data makes it agnostic to third-party promises of IP security. We induce robustness via random perturbation of model parameters during watermark injection to defend against common watermark removal attacks, including fine-tuning, pruning, and model extraction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermarking approach is not only time- and sample-efficient without training data, but also robust against the watermark removal attacks above.

Existing methods combine various regularization terms, such as the Eikonal and Laplacian energy terms, to enforce the learned neural function to possess the properties of a Signed Distance Function (SDF). However, inferring the actual topology and geometry of the underlying surface from poor-quality unoriented point clouds remains challenging. In accordance with Differential Geometry, the Hessian of the SDF is singular for points within the differential thin-shell space surrounding the surface. Our approach enforces the Hessian of the neural implicit function to have a zero determinant for points near the surface. This technique aligns the gradients for a near-surface point and its on-surface projection point, producing a rough but faithful shape within just a few iterations. By annealing the weight of the singular-Hessian term, our approach ultimately produces a high-fidelity reconstruction result. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively suppresses ghost geometry and recovers details from unoriented point clouds with better expressiveness than existing fitting-based methods.

Deployment of the necessary network sensors requires careful sensor placement, focusing, and calibration with significant volumes of network observations.

The run-time performance on a real-world data set confirms previously observed real-time processing rates for high-bandwidth links while achieving significant data compression. The output of the analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of these procedures at focusing the traffic matrix and revealing the underlying stable heavy-tail statistical distributions that are necessary for anomaly detection. A simple model of the corresponding probability of detection ($p_{\\rm d}$) and probability of false alarm ($p_{\\rm fa}$) for these distributions highlights the criticality of network sensor focusing and calibration. Once a sensor is properly focused and calibrated it is then in a position to carry out two of the central tenets of good cybersecurity: (1) continuous observation of the network and (2) minimizing unbrokered network connections.

    "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have emerged as an effective method for novel-view synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction. However, conventional training methods require access to all training views during scene optimization. This assumption may be prohibitive in continual learning scenarios, where new data is acquired in a sequential manner and a continuous update of the NeRF is desired, as in automotive or remote sensing applications. When naively trained in such a continual setting, traditional scene representation frameworks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is corrupted after training on new data. Prior works in alleviating forgetting with NeRFs suffer from low reconstruction quality and high latency, making them impractical for real-world application. We propose a continual learning framework for training NeRFs that leverages replay-based methods combined with a hybrid explicit--implicit scene representation. Our method outperforms previous methods in reconstruction quality when trained in a continual setting, while having the additional benefit of being an order of magnitude faster. ",

However, the learning accuracy decreases due to the heterogeneity of devices data, and the computation and communication latency increase when updating large scale learning models on devices with limited computational capability and wireless resources. To overcome these challenges, we consider a novel FL framework with partial model pruning and personalization. This framework splits the learning model into a global part with model pruning shared with all devices to learn data representations and a personalized part to be fine tuned for a specific device, which adapts the model size during FL to reduce both computation and communication overhead and minimize the overall training time, and increases the learning accuracy for the device with non independent and identically distributed (non IID) data. Then, the computation and communication latency and the convergence analysis of the proposed FL framework are mathematically analyzed. Based on the convergence analysis, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the convergence rate under a latency threshold by jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation. By decoupling the optimization problem and deploying Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions, we derive the closed form solutions of pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FL framework achieves a remarkable reduction of approximately 50 percents computation and communication latency compared with the scheme only with model personalization.

State-of-the-art computer vision techniques rely on large Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that are usually too power-hungry to be deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. Many techniques improve the efficiency of DNNs by using sparsity or quantization. However, the accuracy and efficiency of these techniques cannot be adapted for diverse edge applications with different hardware constraints and accuracy requirements. This paper presents a novel technique to allow DNNs to adapt their accuracy and energy consumption during run-time, without the need for any re-training. Our technique called AdaptiveActivation introduces a hyper-parameter that controls the output range of the DNNs' activation function to dynamically adjust the sparsity and precision in the DNN. AdaptiveActivation can be applied to any existing pre-trained DNN to improve their deployability in diverse edge environments. We conduct experiments on popular edge devices and show that the accuracy is within 1.5% of the baseline. We also show that our approach requires 10%--38% less memory than the baseline techniques leading to more accuracy-efficiency tradeoff options ",

    "abstract": "Model stealing attacks have become a serious concern for deep learning models, where an attacker can steal a trained model by querying its black-box API. This can lead to intellectual property theft and other security and privacy risks. The current state-of-the-art defenses against model stealing attacks suggest adding perturbations to the prediction probabilities. However, they suffer from heavy computations and make impracticable assumptions about the adversary. They often require the training of auxiliary models. This can be time-consuming and resource-intensive which hinders the deployment of these defenses in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective and efficient defense alternative. We introduce a heuristic approach to perturb the output probabilities. The proposed defense can be easily integrated into models without additional training. We show that our defense is effective in defending against three state-of-the-art stealing attacks. We evaluate our approach on large and quantized (i.e., compressed) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on several vision datasets. Our technique outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses with a $\\times37$ faster inference latency without requiring any additional model and with a low impact on the model's performance. We validate that our defense is also effective for quantized CNNs targeting edge devices. ",

Therefore, this paper investigates the uncertainty of various deep neural networks, including ResNet-50, VGG16, DenseNet121, AlexNet, and GoogleNet, when dealing with such data. Our approach includes three experiments. First, we used the pretrained models to classify OOD images generated via DALL-E to assess their performance. Second, we built an ensemble from the models' predictions using probabilistic averaging for consensus due to its advantages over plurality or majority voting. The ensemble's uncertainty was quantified using average probabilities, variance, and entropy metrics. Our results showed that while ResNet-50 was the most accurate single model for OOD images, the ensemble performed even better, correctly classifying all images. Third, we tested model robustness by adding perturbations (filters, rotations, etc.) to new epistemic images from DALL-E or real-world captures. ResNet-50 was chosen for this being the best performing model. While it classified 4 out of 5 unperturbed images correctly, it misclassified all of them post-perturbation, indicating a significant vulnerability. These misclassifications, which are clear to human observers, highlight AI models' limitations. Using saliency maps, we identified regions of the images that the model considered important for their decisions. ",

While much attention has been given to the convergence and long-term behavior of this model, an open question remains: How does the underlying graph structure influence network dynamics? While similar papers have been carried out for threshold networks (as well as for other networks) these have largely focused on unsigned networks. However, the signed graph model finds applications in various real-world domains like gene regulation and social networks. By studying a graph parameter that we call \"stability index,\" we search to establish a connection between the structure and the dynamics of threshold network. Interestingly, this parameter is related to the concepts of frustration and balance in signed graphs. We show that graphs that present negative stability index exhibit stable dynamics, meaning that the dynamics converges to fixed points regardless of threshold parameters. Conversely, if at least one subgraph has positive stability index, oscillations in long term behavior may appear. Finally, we generalize the analysis to network dynamics under periodic update schemes and we explore the case in which the stability index is positive for some subgraph finding that attractors with superpolynomial period on the size of the network may appear.

    "abstract": "With rich annotation information, object detection-based automated plant disease diagnosis systems (e.g., YOLO-based systems) often provide advantages over classification-based systems (e.g., EfficientNet-based), such as the ability to detect disease locations and superior classification performance. One drawback of these detection systems is dealing with unannotated healthy data with no real symptoms present. In practice, healthy plant data appear to be very similar to many disease data. Thus, those models often produce mis-detected boxes on healthy images. In addition, labeling new data for detection models is typically time-consuming. Hard-sample mining (HSM) is a common technique for re-training a model by using the mis-detected boxes as new training samples. However, blindly selecting an arbitrary amount of hard-sample for re-training will result in the degradation of diagnostic performance for other diseases due to the high similarity between disease and healthy data. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective training strategy called hard-sample re-mining (HSReM), which is designed to enhance the diagnostic performance of healthy data and simultaneously improve the performance of disease data by strategically selecting hard-sample training images at an appropriate level. Experiments based on two practical in-field eight-class cucumber and ten-class tomato datasets (42.7K and 35.6K images) show that our HSReM training strategy leads to a substantial improvement in the overall diagnostic performance on large-scale unseen data. Specifically, the object detection model trained using the HSReM strategy not only achieved superior results as compared to the classification-based state-of-the-art EfficientNetV2-Large model and the original object detection model, but also outperformed the model using the HSM strategy.

    "abstract": "In traditional blockchain networks, transaction fees are only allocated to full nodes (i.e., miners) regardless of the contribution of forwarding behaviors of light nodes. However, the lack of forwarding incentive reduces the willingness of light nodes to relay transactions, especially in the energy-constrained Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET). This paper proposes a novel dual auction mechanism to allocate transaction fees for forwarding and validation behaviors in the wireless blockchain network. The dual auction mechanism consists of two auction models: the forwarding auction and the validation auction. In the forwarding auction, forwarding nodes use Generalized First Price (GFP) auction to choose transactions to forward. Besides, forwarding nodes adjust the forwarding probability through a no-regret algorithm to improve efficiency. In the validation auction, full nodes select transactions using Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (VCG) mechanism to construct the block. We prove that the designed dual auction mechanism is Incentive Compatibility (IC), Individual Rationality (IR), and Computational Efficiency (CE). Especially, we derive the upper bound of the social welfare difference between the social optimal auction and our proposed one. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dual auction mechanism decreases energy and spectrum resource consumption and effectively improves social welfare without sacrificing the throughput and the security of the wireless blockchain network.

However, recent Transformer-based methods struggle to learn the interaction between two hands as they directly utilize two hand features as input tokens, which results in distant token problem. The distant token problem represents that input tokens are in heterogeneous spaces, leading Transformer to fail in capturing correlation between input tokens. Previous Transformer-based methods suffer from the problem especially when poses of two hands are very different as they project features from a backbone to separate left and right hand-dedicated features. We present EANet, extract-and-adaptation network, with EABlock, the main component of our network. Rather than directly utilizing two hand features as input tokens, our EABlock utilizes two complementary types of novel tokens, SimToken and JoinToken, as input tokens. Our two novel tokens are from a combination of separated two hand features; hence, it is much more robust to the distant token problem. Using the two type of tokens, our EABlock effectively extracts interaction feature and adapts it to each hand.

    "abstract": "Agent-based models have been extensively used to simulate the behavior of travelers in transportation systems because they allow for realistic and versatile modeling of interactions. However, traditional agent-based models suffer from high computational costs and rely on tracking physical locations, raising privacy concerns. This paper proposes an efficient formulation for the agent-based bathtub model (AB2M) in the relative space, where each agent's trajectory is represented by a time series of the remaining distance to its destination. The AB2M can be understood as a microscopic model that tracks individual trips' initiation, progression, and completion and is an exact numerical solution of the bathtub model for generic (time-dependent) trip distance distributions. The model can be solved for a deterministic set of trips with a given demand pattern (defined by the start time of each trip and its distance), or it can be used to run Monte Carlo simulations to capture the average behavior and variation stochastic demand patterns, described by probabilistic distributions of trip distances and departure times. To enhance the computational efficiency, we introduce a priority queue formulation, eliminating the need to update trip positions at each time step and allowing us to run large-scale scenarios with millions of individual trips in seconds. We systematically explore the scaling properties and discuss the introduction of biases and numerical errors. The systematic exploration of scaling properties of the modeling of individual agents in the relative space with the AB2M further enhances its applicability to large-scale transportation systems and opens up opportunities for studying travel time reliability, scheduling, and mode choices.

    "abstract": "Predicting vehicle trajectories is crucial for ensuring automated vehicle operation efficiency and safety, particularly on congested multi-lane highways. In such dynamic environments, a vehicle's motion is determined by its historical behaviors as well as interactions with surrounding vehicles. These intricate interactions arise from unpredictable motion patterns, leading to a wide range of driving behaviors that warrant in-depth investigation. This study presents the Graph-based Interaction-aware Multi-modal Trajectory Prediction (GIMTP) framework, designed to probabilistically predict future vehicle trajectories by effectively capturing these interactions. Within this framework, vehicles' motions are conceptualized as nodes in a time-varying graph, and the traffic interactions are represented by a dynamic adjacency matrix. To holistically capture both spatial and temporal dependencies embedded in this dynamic adjacency matrix, the methodology incorporates the Diffusion Graph Convolutional Network (DGCN), thereby providing a graph embedding of both historical states and future states. Furthermore, we employ a driving intention-specific feature fusion, enabling the adaptive integration of historical and future embeddings for enhanced intention recognition and trajectory prediction. This model gives two-dimensional predictions for each mode of longitudinal and lateral driving behaviors and offers probabilistic future paths with corresponding probabilities, addressing the challenges of complex vehicle interactions and multi-modality of driving behaviors. Validation using real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates the efficiency and potential. ",

    "abstract": "Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is an important paradigm for learning representations from unlabelled data, and SSL with neural networks has been highly successful in practice. However current theoretical analysis of SSL is mostly restricted to generalisation error bounds. In contrast, learning dynamics often provide a precise characterisation of the behaviour of neural networks based models but, so far, are mainly known in supervised settings. In this paper, we study the learning dynamics of SSL models, specifically representations obtained by minimising contrastive and non-contrastive losses. We show that a naive extension of the dymanics of multivariate regression to SSL leads to learning trivial scalar representations that demonstrates dimension collapse in SSL. Consequently, we formulate SSL objectives with orthogonality constraints on the weights, and derive the exact (network width independent) learning dynamics of the SSL models trained using gradient descent on the Grassmannian manifold. We also argue that the infinite width approximation of SSL models significantly deviate from the neural tangent kernel approximations of supervised models. We numerically illustrate the validity of our theoretical findings, and discuss how the presented results provide a framework for further theoretical analysis of contrastive and non-contrastive SSL.

    "abstract": "Continuous-time dynamic graph modeling is a crucial task for many real-world applications, such as financial risk management and fraud detection. Though existing dynamic graph modeling methods have achieved satisfactory results, they still suffer from three key limitations, hindering their scalability and further applicability. i) Indiscriminate updating. For incoming edges, existing methods would indiscriminately deal with them, which may lead to more time consumption and unexpected noisy information. ii) Ineffective node-wise long-term modeling. They heavily rely on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a backbone, which has been demonstrated to be incapable of fully capturing node-wise long-term dependencies in event sequences. iii) Neglect of re-occurrence patterns. Dynamic graphs involve the repeated occurrence of neighbors that indicates their importance, which is disappointedly neglected by existing methods. In this paper, we present iLoRE, a novel dynamic graph modeling method with instant node-wise Long-term modeling and Re-occurrence preservation. To overcome the indiscriminate updating issue, we introduce the Adaptive Short-term Updater module that will automatically discard the useless or noisy edges, ensuring iLoRE's effectiveness and instant ability. We further propose the Long-term Updater to realize more effective node-wise long-term modeling, where we innovatively propose the Identity Attention mechanism to empower a Transformer-based updater, bypassing the limited effectiveness of typical RNN-dominated designs. Finally, the crucial re-occurrence patterns are also encoded into a graph module for informative representation learning, which will further improve the expressiveness of our method. Our experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our iLoRE for dynamic graph modeling. ",

However, real-world dynamic graphs typically contain diverse and intricate noise. Noise can significantly degrade the quality of representation generation, impeding the effectiveness of TGNs in downstream tasks. Though structure learning is widely applied to mitigate noise in static graphs, its adaptation to dynamic graph settings poses two significant challenges. i) Noise dynamics. Existing structure learning methods are ill-equipped to address the temporal aspect of noise, hampering their effectiveness in such dynamic and ever-changing noise patterns. ii) More severe noise. Noise may be introduced along with multiple interactions between two nodes, leading to the re-pollution of these nodes and consequently causing more severe noise compared to static graphs. In this paper, we present RDGSL, a representation learning method in continuous-time dynamic graphs. Meanwhile, we propose dynamic graph structure learning, a novel supervisory signal that empowers RDGSL with the ability to effectively combat noise in dynamic graphs. To address the noise dynamics issue, we introduce the Dynamic Graph Filter, where we innovatively propose a dynamic noise function that dynamically captures both current and historical noise, enabling us to assess the temporal aspect of noise and generate a denoised graph. We further propose the Temporal Embedding Learner to tackle the challenge of more severe noise, which utilizes an attention mechanism to selectively turn a blind eye to noisy edges and hence focus on normal edges, enhancing the expressiveness for representation generation that remains resilient to noise.

In this paper, we focus on MHPs with exponential decay kernels and estimate connectivity graphs, which represent the Granger causal relations between their components. We approach this inference problem by proposing an optimization criterion and model selection algorithm based on the minimum message length (MML) principle. MML compares Granger causal models using the Occam's razor principle in the following way: even when models have a comparable goodness-of-fit to the observed data, the one generating the most concise explanation of the data is preferred. While most of the state-of-art methods using lasso-type penalization tend to overfitting in scenarios with short time horizons, the proposed MML-based method achieves high F1 scores in these settings. We conduct a numerical study comparing the proposed algorithm to other related classical and state-of-art methods, where we achieve the highest F1 scores in specific sparse graph settings.

Our proposed Diff3Det migrates the diffusion model to proposal generation for 3D object detection by considering the detection boxes as generative targets. During training, the object boxes diffuse from the ground truth boxes to the Gaussian distribution, and the decoder learns to reverse this noise process. In the inference stage, the model progressively refines a set of random boxes to the prediction results.

To address these limitations, we propose a Scenario-Aware Hierarchical Dynamic Network for Multi-Scenario Recommendations (HierRec), which perceives implicit patterns adaptively and conducts explicit and implicit scenario modeling jointly. In particular, HierRec designs a basic scenario-oriented module based on the dynamic weight to capture scenario-specific information. Then the hierarchical explicit and implicit scenario-aware modules are proposed to model hybrid-grained scenario information. The multi-head implicit modeling design contributes to perceiving distinctive patterns from different perspectives.

However, in real-world scenarios the shifts are usually unknown and varied, making it difficult to estimate in advance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel but more difficult challenge, RSQS, focusing on Realistic Support-Query Shift few-shot learning. The key feature of RSQS is that the individual samples in a meta-task are subjected to multiple distribution shifts in each meta-task. In addition, we propose a unified adversarial feature alignment method called DUal adversarial ALignment framework (DuaL) to relieve RSQS from two aspects, i.e., inter-domain bias and intra-domain variance. On the one hand, for the inter-domain bias, we corrupt the original data in advance and use the synthesized perturbed inputs to train the repairer network by minimizing distance in the feature level. On the other hand, for intra-domain variance, we proposed a generator network to synthesize hard, i.e., less similar, examples from the support set in a self-supervised manner and introduce regularized optimal transportation to derive a smooth optimal transportation plan. Lastly, a benchmark of RSQS is built with several state-of-the-art baselines among three datasets (CIFAR100, mini-ImageNet, and Tiered-Imagenet).

One example of an analog computing scheme for NNs is Integrate-and-Fire (IF) Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, to achieve high inference accuracy in IF-SNNs, the analog hardware needs to represent current-based multiply-accumulate (MAC) levels as spike times, for which a large membrane capacitor needs to be charged for a certain amount of time. A large capacitor results in high energy use, considerable area cost, and long latency, constituting one of the major bottlenecks in analog IF-SNN implementations. In this work, we propose a HW/SW Codesign method, called CapMin, for capacitor size minimization in analog computing IF-SNNs. CapMin minimizes the capacitor size by reducing the number of spike times needed for accurate operation of the HW, based on the absolute frequency of MAC level occurrences in the SW. To increase the operation of IF-SNNs to current variation, we propose the method CapMin-V, which trades capacitor size for protection based on the reduced capacitor size found in CapMin. In our experiments, CapMin achieves more than a 14$\\times$ reduction in capacitor size over the state of the art, while CapMin-V achieves increased variation tolerance in the IF-SNN operation, requiring only a small increase in capacitor size.

Our approach involves training machine learning on subjective aesthetics to generate culturally relevant content. Interactive AI media can also boost tourism while preserving heritage. This pioneering research puts forth original perspectives on the intersection of AI and aesthetics to invigorate rural culture. It advocates holistic integration of technology and emphasizes AI's potential as a creative enabler versus replacement. Ultimately, it lays the groundwork for further exploration of leveraging AI innovations to empower rural communities. This timely study contributes to growing interest in emerging technologies to address critical issues facing rural China. ",

    "abstract": "To study the overall connectivity in device-to-device networks in cities, we incorporate a signal-to-interference-plus-noise connectivity model into a Poisson-Voronoi tessellation model representing the streets of a city. Relays are located at crossroads (or street intersections), whereas (user) devices are scattered along streets. Between any two adjacent relays, we assume data can be transmitted either directly between the relays or through users, given they share a common street. Our simulation results reveal that the network connectivity is ensured when the density of users (on the streets) exceeds a certain critical value. But then the network connectivity disappears when the user density exceeds a second critical value. The intuition is that for longer streets, where direct relay-to-relay communication is not possible, users are needed to transmit data between relays, but with too many users the interference becomes too strong, eventually reducing the overall network connectivity. This observation on the user density evokes previous results based on another wireless network model, where transmitter-receivers were scattered across the plane. This effect disappears when interference is removed from the model, giving a variation of the classic Gilbert model and recalling the lesson that neglecting interference in such network models can give overly optimistic results. For physically reasonable model parameters, we show that crowded streets (with more than six users on a typical street) lead to a sudden drop in connectivity. We also give numerical results outlining a relationship between the user density and the strength of any interference reduction techniques. ",

These systems intrinsically learn how to handle and remove noise conditions from speech. Previous research has shown, that it is possible to extract the denoising capabilities of these models into a preprocessor network, which can be used as a frontend for downstream ASR models. However, the proposed methods were limited to specific fully convolutional architectures. In this work, we propose a novel method to extract the denoising capabilities, that can be applied to any encoder-decoder architecture. We propose the Cleancoder preprocessor architecture that extracts hidden activations from the Conformer ASR model and feeds them to a decoder to predict denoised spectrograms. We train our pre-processor on the Noisy Speech Database (NSD) to reconstruct denoised spectrograms from noisy inputs. Then, we evaluate our model as a frontend to a pretrained Conformer ASR model as well as a frontend to train smaller Conformer ASR models from scratch. We show that the Cleancoder is able to filter noise from speech and that it improves the total Word Error Rate (WER) of the downstream model in noisy conditions for both applications. ",

    "abstract": "The advent of satellite-borne machine learning hardware accelerators has enabled the on-board processing of payload data using machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNN). A notable example is using a CNN to detect the presence of clouds in hyperspectral data captured on Earth observation (EO) missions, whereby only clear sky data is downlinked to conserve bandwidth. However, prior to deployment, new missions that employ new sensors will not have enough representative datasets to train a CNN model, while a model trained solely on data from previous missions will underperform when deployed to process the data on the new missions. This underperformance stems from the domain gap, i.e., differences in the underlying distributions of the data generated by the different sensors in previous and future missions. In this paper, we address the domain gap problem in the context of on-board hyperspectral cloud detection. Our main contributions lie in formulating new domain adaptation tasks that are motivated by a concrete EO mission, developing a novel algorithm for bandwidth-efficient supervised domain adaptation, and demonstrating test-time adaptation algorithms on space deployable neural network accelerators. Our contributions enable minimal data transmission to be invoked (e.g., only 1% of the weights in ResNet50) to achieve domain adaptation, thereby allowing more sophisticated CNN models to be deployed and updated on satellites without being hampered by domain gap and bandwidth limitations.

    "abstract": "Model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL), which builds a supervised transition model with logging dataset to avoid costly interactions with the online environment, has been a promising approach for offline policy optimization. As the discrepancy between the logging data and online environment may result in a distributional shift problem, many prior works have studied how to build robust transition models conservatively and estimate the model uncertainty accurately. However, the over-conservatism can limit the exploration of the agent, and the uncertainty estimates may be unreliable. In this work, we propose a novel Model-based Offline policy optimization framework with Adversarial Network (MOAN). The key idea is to use adversarial learning to build a transition model with better generalization, where an adversary is introduced to distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. Moreover, the adversary can naturally provide a quantification of the model's uncertainty with theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments showed that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines on widely studied offline RL benchmarks. It can also generate diverse in-distribution samples, and quantify the uncertainty more accurately. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are known to be vulnerable to a number of attacks that target the integrity of their predictions or the privacy of their training data. To carry out these attacks, a black-box adversary must typically possess the ability to query the model and observe its outputs (e.g., labels). In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to enhance such decision-based attacks. To accomplish this, we present an approach that exploits a novel side channel in which the adversary simply measures the execution time of the algorithm used to post-process the predictions of the ML model under attack. The leakage of inference-state elements into algorithmic timing side channels has never been studied before, and we have found that it can contain rich information that facilitates superior timing attacks that significantly outperform attacks based solely on label outputs. In a case study, we investigate leakage from the non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm, which plays a crucial role in the operation of object detectors. In our examination of the timing side-channel vulnerabilities associated with this algorithm, we identified the potential to enhance decision-based attacks. We demonstrate attacks against the YOLOv3 detector, leveraging the timing leakage to successfully evade object detection using adversarial examples, and perform dataset inference. Our experiments show that our adversarial examples exhibit superior perturbation quality compared to a decision-based attack. In addition, we present a new threat model in which dataset inference based solely on timing leakage is performed. To address the timing leakage vulnerability inherent in the NMS algorithm, we explore the potential and limitations of implementing constant-time inference passes as a mitigation strategy. ",

We use our novel hyper-parameter exploration technique to explore a variety of architectural parameters and build an optimal transformer-based architecture specifically tailored for text-to-GLOSS translation.

    "abstract": "Code clones can detrimentally impact software maintenance and manually detecting them in very large codebases is impractical. Additionally, automated approaches find detection of Type 3 and Type 4 (inexact) clones very challenging. While the most recent artificial deep neural networks (for example BERT-based artificial neural networks) seem to be highly effective in detecting such clones, their pairwise comparison of every code pair in the target system(s) is inefficient and scales poorly on large codebases. We therefore introduce SSCD, a BERT-based clone detection approach that targets high recall of Type 3 and Type 4 clones at scale (in line with our industrial partner's requirements). It does so by computing a representative embedding for each code fragment and finding similar fragments using a nearest neighbour search. SSCD thus avoids the pairwise-comparison bottleneck of other Neural Network approaches while also using parallel, GPU-accelerated search to tackle scalability. This paper details the approach and an empirical assessment towards configuring and evaluating that approach in industrial setting. The configuration analysis suggests that shorter input lengths and text-only based neural network models demonstrate better efficiency in SSCD, while only slightly decreasing effectiveness. The evaluation results suggest that SSCD is more effective than state-of-the-art approaches like SAGA and SourcererCC. It is also highly efficient: in its optimal setting, SSCD effectively locates clones in the entire 320 million LOC BigCloneBench (a standard clone detection benchmark) in just under three hours. ",

In particular, we make use of this architecture to extract several concepts related to COVID-19 from an on-line medical forum. We use a sample from the forum to manually curate one dictionary for each concept. In addition, we use MetaMap, which is a tool for extracting biomedical concepts, to identify a small number of semantic concepts. For a supervised concept extraction task on the forum data, our best model achieved a macro $F_1$ score of 90\\%. A major difficulty in medical concept extraction is obtaining labelled data from which to build supervised models. We investigate the utility of our models to transfer to data derived from a different source in two ways. First for producing labels via weak learning and second to perform concept extraction. The dataset we use in this case comprises COVID-19 related tweets and we achieve an $F_1$ score 81\\% for symptom concept extraction trained on weakly labelled data. The utility of our dictionaries is compared with a COVID-19 symptom dictionary that was constructed directly from Twitter. Further experiments that incorporate BERT and a COVID-19 version of BERTweet demonstrate that the dictionaries provide a commensurate result. Our results show that incorporating small domain dictionaries to deep learning models can improve concept extraction tasks. Moreover, models built using dictionaries generalize well and are transferable to different datasets on a similar task. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the complexity of modern computer systems, novel and unexpected behaviors frequently occur. Such deviations are either normal occurrences, such as software updates and new user activities, or abnormalities, such as misconfigurations, latency issues, intrusions, and software bugs. Regardless, novel behaviors are of great interest to developers, and there is a genuine need for efficient and effective methods to detect them. Nowadays, researchers consider system calls to be the most fine-grained and accurate source of information to investigate the behavior of computer systems. Accordingly, this paper introduces a novelty detection methodology that relies on a probability distribution over sequences of system calls, which can be seen as a language model. Language models estimate the likelihood of sequences, and since novelties deviate from previously observed behaviors by definition, they would be unlikely under the model. Following the success of neural networks for language models, three architectures are evaluated in this work: the widespread LSTM, the state-of-the-art Transformer, and the lower-complexity Longformer. However, large neural networks typically require an enormous amount of data to be trained effectively, and to the best of our knowledge, no massive modern datasets of kernel traces are publicly available. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a new open-source dataset of kernel traces comprising over 2 million web requests with seven distinct behaviors. The proposed methodology requires minimal expert hand-crafting and achieves an F-score and AuROC greater than 95% on most novelties while being data- and task-agnostic. The source code and trained models are publicly available on GitHub while the datasets are available on Zenodo. ",

    "abstract": "Underwater image restoration has been a challenging problem for decades since the advent of underwater photography. Most solutions focus on shallow water scenarios, where the scene is uniformly illuminated by the sunlight. However, the vast majority of uncharted underwater terrain is located beyond 200 meters depth where natural light is scarce and artificial illumination is needed. In such cases, light sources co-moving with the camera, dynamically change the scene appearance, which make shallow water restoration methods inadequate. In particular for multi-light source systems (composed of dozens of LEDs nowadays), calibrating each light is time-consuming, error-prone and tedious, and we observe that only the integrated illumination within the viewing volume of the camera is critical, rather than the individual light sources. The key idea of this paper is therefore to exploit the appearance changes of objects or the seafloor, when traversing the viewing frustum of the camera. Through new constraints assuming Lambertian surfaces, corresponding image pixels constrain the light field in front of the camera, and for each voxel a signal factor and a backscatter value are stored in a volumetric grid that can be used for very efficient image restoration of camera-light platforms, which facilitates consistently texturing large 3D models and maps that would otherwise be dominated by lighting and medium artifacts. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets. The results of these experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach in restoring the true albedo of objects, while mitigating the influence of lighting and medium effects. Furthermore, we demonstrate our approach can be readily extended to other scenarios, including in-air imaging with artificial illumination or other similar cases. ",

The second evaluates the algorithm's performance with imperfect images, like those that are blurry, of low quality, or compressed.

Specifications are necessary to determine the correctness of software, to develop error-free software and to write complete tests. Several attempts have been made to teach students to write specifications before writing code. So far, that has not proven to be very successful: Students do not like to write a specification and do not see the benefits of writing specifications. In this paper we focus on the use of informal specifications. Instead of teaching students how to write specifications, we teach them how to use informal specifications to develop correct software. The results were surprising: the number of errors in software and the completeness of tests both improved considerably and, most importantly, students really appreciate the specifications.

The results demonstrate that DCP-Net outperforms the existing methods comprehensively, improving mIoU by 2.61%~16.89% at the highest collaboration efficiency, which promotes the performance to a state-of-the-art level.

    "abstract": "Singing voice synthesis and singing voice conversion have significantly advanced, revolutionizing musical experiences. However, the rise of \"Deepfake Songs\" generated by these technologies raises concerns about authenticity. Unlike Audio DeepFake Detection (ADD), the field of song deepfake detection lacks specialized datasets or methods for song authenticity verification. In this paper, we initially construct a Chinese Fake Song Detection (FSD) dataset to investigate the field of song deepfake detection. The fake songs in the FSD dataset are generated by five state-of-the-art singing voice synthesis and singing voice conversion methods. Our initial experiments on FSD revealed the ineffectiveness of existing speech-trained ADD models for the task of Song DeepFake Detection. Thus, we employ the FSD dataset for the training of ADD models. We subsequently evaluate these models under two scenarios: one with the original songs and another with separated vocal tracks. Experiment results show that song-trained ADD models exhibit an approximate 38.58% reduction in average equal error rate compared to speech-trained ADD models on the FSD test set. ",

    "abstract": "Three major challenges in reinforcement learning are the complex dynamical systems with large state spaces, the costly data acquisition processes, and the deviation of real-world dynamics from the training environment deployment. To overcome these issues, we study distributionally robust Markov decision processes with continuous state spaces under the widely used Kullback-Leibler, chi-square, and total variation uncertainty sets. We propose a model-based approach that utilizes Gaussian Processes and the maximum variance reduction algorithm to efficiently learn multi-output nominal transition dynamics, leveraging access to a generative model (i.e., simulator). We further demonstrate the statistical sample complexity of the proposed method for different uncertainty sets. These complexity bounds are independent of the number of states and extend beyond linear dynamics, ensuring the effectiveness of our approach in identifying near-optimal distributionally-robust policies. The proposed method can be further combined with other model-free distributionally robust reinforcement learning methods to obtain a near-optimal robust policy. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm to distributional shifts and its superior performance in terms of the number of samples needed. ",

Representing mid to long-term seasonal climate forecasts is challenging as seasonal climate predictions are uncertain, and encoding spatio-temporal relationship of climate forecasts with demand is complex. We propose a novel modeling framework that efficiently encodes seasonal climate predictions to provide robust and reliable time-series forecasting for supply chain functions. The encoding framework enables effective learning of latent representations -- be it uncertain seasonal climate prediction or other time-series data (e.g., buyer patterns) -- via a modular neural network architecture. Our extensive experiments indicate that learning such representations to model seasonal climate forecast results in an error reduction of approximately 13\\% to 17\\% across multiple real-world data sets compared to existing demand forecasting methods.

Second, the efficiency limitations of graph construction and graph sampling in large-scale systems make it difficult to adapt quickly to new real-time interests. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Graph Interaction Network.

Such real-world data is massive, diverse, multivariate and temporal in nature, therefore requiring modelling of the testee behaviour. We propose a variational autoencoder with multi-head attention (MA-VAE), which, when trained on unlabelled data, not only provides very few false positives but also manages to detect the majority of the anomalies presented. In addition to that, the approach offers a novel way to avoid the bypass phenomenon, an undesirable behaviour investigated in literature. Lastly, the approach also introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a continuous time series. The results are presented in the context of a real-world industrial data set and several experiments are undertaken to further investigate certain aspects of the proposed model. When configured properly, it is 9% of the time wrong when an anomaly is flagged and discovers 67% of the anomalies present. Also, MA-VAE has the potential to perform well with only a fraction of the training and validation subset, however, to extract it, a more sophisticated threshold estimation method is required. ",

We present MAFIA, a microarchitecture protection against fault injection attacks. MAFIA ensures integrity of pipeline control signals through a signature-based mechanism, and ensures fine-grained control-flow integrity with a complete indirect branch support and code authenticity. We analyse the security properties of two different implementations with different security/overhead trade-offs: one with a CBC-MAC/Prince signature function, and another one with a CRC32. We present our implementation of MAFIA in a RISC-V processor, supported by a dedicated compiler toolchain based on LLVM/Clang. We report a hardware area overhead of 23.8 % and 6.5 % for the CBC-MAC/Prince and CRC32 respectively. The average code size and execution time overheads are 29.4 % and 18.4 % respectively for the CRC32 implementation and are 50 % and 39 % for the CBC-MAC/Prince. ",

    "abstract": "Given a graph $G$ with a fixed vertex order $\\prec$, one obtains a circle graph $H$ whose vertices are the edges of $G$ and where two such edges are adjacent if and only if their endpoints are pairwise distinct and alternate in $\\prec$. Therefore, the problem of determining whether $G$ has a $k$-page book embedding with spine order $\\prec$ is equivalent to deciding whether $H$ can be colored with $k$ colors. Finding a $k$-coloring for a circle graph is known to be NP-complete for $k \\geq 4$ and trivial for $k \\leq 2$. For $k = 3$, Unger (1992) claims an efficient algorithm that finds a 3-coloring in $O(n \\log n)$ time, if it exists. Given a circle graph $H$, Unger's algorithm (1) constructs a 3-\\textsc{Sat} formula $\\Phi$ that is satisfiable if and only if $H$ admits a 3-coloring and (2) solves $\\Phi$ by a backtracking strategy that relies on the structure imposed by the circle graph. However, the extended abstract misses several details and Unger refers to his PhD thesis (in German) for details. In this paper we argue that Unger's algorithm for 3-coloring circle graphs is not correct and that 3-coloring circle graphs should be considered as an open problem. We show that step (1) of Unger's algorithm is incorrect by exhibiting a circle graph whose formula $\\Phi$ is satisfiable but that is not 3-colorable. We further show that Unger's backtracking strategy for solving $\\Phi$ in step (2) may produce incorrect results and give empirical evidence that it exhibits a runtime behaviour that is not consistent with the claimed running time.

    "abstract": "An important initial step in fault detection for complex industrial systems is gaining an understanding of their health condition. Subsequently, continuous monitoring of this health condition becomes crucial to observe its evolution, track changes over time, and isolate faults. As faults are typically rare occurrences, it is essential to perform this monitoring in an unsupervised manner. Various approaches have been proposed not only to detect faults in an unsupervised manner but also to distinguish between different potential fault types. In this study, we perform a comprehensive comparison between two residual-based approaches: autoencoders, and the input-output models that establish a mapping between operating conditions and sensor readings. We explore the sensor-wise residuals and aggregated residuals for the entire system in both methods. The performance evaluation focuses on three tasks: health indicator construction, fault detection, and health indicator interpretation. To perform the comparison, we utilize the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dynamical model, specifically a subset of the turbofan engine dataset containing three different fault types. All models are trained exclusively on healthy data. Fault detection is achieved by applying a threshold that is determined based on the healthy condition. The detection results reveal that both models are capable of detecting faults with an average delay of around 20 cycles and maintain a low false positive rate. While the fault detection performance is similar for both models, the input-output model provides better interpretability regarding potential fault types and the possible faulty components. ",

Existing inference problems in sub-populations operate on the premise that the given data distributions originate from the entire population, thus, cannot tackle the s-ID problem. To address this gap, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions that must hold in the causal graph for a causal effect in a sub-population to be identifiable from the observational distribution of that sub-population.

We construct a new panoptic scene graph dataset and a set of metrics that are designed as a benchmark for the predictive performance especially on rare predicate classes. To construct the new dataset, we propose a model-assisted annotation pipeline that efficiently finds rare predicate classes that are hidden in a large set of images like needles in a haystack. Contrary to prior scene graph datasets, Haystack contains explicit negative annotations, i.e. annotations that a given relation does not have a certain predicate class. Negative annotations are helpful especially in the field of scene graph generation and open up a whole new set of possibilities to improve current scene graph generation models. Haystack is 100% compatible with existing panoptic scene graph datasets and can easily be integrated with existing evaluation pipelines.

In this paper, we show that the observation-intervention trade-off can be formulated as a non-myopic optimal stopping problem which permits an efficient solution. We give theoretical results detailing the structure of the optimal stopping times and demonstrate the generality of our approach by showing that it can be integrated with existing causal Bayesian optimisation algorithms.

    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has recently emerged as a promising approach for graph representation learning. Some existing methods adopt the 1-vs-K scheme to construct one positive and K negative samples for each graph, but it is difficult to set K. For those methods that do not use negative samples, it is often necessary to add additional strategies to avoid model collapse, which could only alleviate the problem to some extent. All these drawbacks will undoubtedly have an adverse impact on the generalizability and efficiency of the model. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a novel graph self-contrast framework GraphSC, which only uses one positive and one negative sample, and chooses triplet loss as the objective. Specifically, self-contrast has two implications. First, GraphSC generates both positive and negative views of a graph sample from the graph itself via graph augmentation functions of various intensities, and use them for self-contrast. Second, GraphSC uses Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to factorize the representations into multiple factors and proposes a masked self-contrast mechanism to better separate positive and negative samples. Further, Since the triplet loss only optimizes the relative distance between the anchor and its positive/negative samples, it is difficult to ensure the absolute distance between the anchor and positive sample. Therefore, we explicitly reduced the absolute distance between the anchor and positive sample to accelerate convergence. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of GraphSC against 19 other state-of-the-art methods in both unsupervised and transfer learning settings. ",

In this study, we build six models: RoBERTaJIT, CodeBERTJIT, BARTJIT, PLBARTJIT, GPT2JIT, and CodeGPTJIT, each with a distinct pre-trained model as its backbone. We systematically explore the differences and connections between these models. Specifically, we investigate the performance of the models when using Commit code and Commit message as inputs, as well as the relationship between training efficiency and model distribution among these six models. Additionally, we conduct an ablation experiment to explore the sensitivity of each model to inputs. Furthermore, we investigate how the models perform in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Our findings indicate that each model based on different backbones shows improvements, and when the backbone's pre-training model is similar, the training resources that need to be consumed are much more closer. We also observe that Commit code plays a significant role in defect detection, and different pre-trained models demonstrate better defect detection ability with a balanced dataset under few-shot scenarios. These results provide new insights for optimizing JIT defect prediction tasks using pre-trained models and highlight the factors that require more attention when constructing such models. Additionally, CodeGPTJIT and GPT2JIT achieved better performance than DeepJIT and CC2Vec on the two datasets respectively under 2000 training samples. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of transformer-based pre-trained models in JIT defect prediction tasks, especially in scenarios with limited training data. ",

The heart of almost all current research into code summarization is the encoder-decoder neural architecture, and the encoder input is almost always a single subroutine or other short code snippet. The problem with this setup is that the information needed to describe the code is often not present in the code itself -- that information often resides in other nearby code. In this paper, we revisit the idea of ``file context'' for code summarization. File context is the idea of encoding select information from other subroutines in the same file. We propose a novel modification of the Transformer architecture that is purpose-built to encode file context and demonstrate its improvement over several baselines.

We provide a theoretical analysis of the effects of this scheme on the closed-loop performance, and prove that stability properties are preserved. Additionally, we show that the proposed approach makes it difficult for an eavesdropper to reconstruct the watermarking parameters, both in terms of the associated computational complexity and from a systems theoretic perspective.

    "title": "Empirical Review of Smart Contract and DeFi Security: Vulnerability  Detection and Automated Repair",
    "abstract": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is emerging as a peer-to-peer financial ecosystem, enabling participants to trade products on a permissionless blockchain. Built on blockchain and smart contracts, the DeFi ecosystem has experienced explosive growth in recent years. Unfortunately, smart contracts hold a massive amount of value, making them an attractive target for attacks. So far, attacks against smart contracts and DeFi protocols have resulted in billions of dollars in financial losses, severely threatening the security of the entire DeFi ecosystem. Researchers have proposed various security tools for smart contracts and DeFi protocols as countermeasures. However, a comprehensive investigation of these efforts is still lacking, leaving a crucial gap in our understanding of how to enhance the security posture of the smart contract and DeFi landscape. To fill the gap, this paper reviews the progress made in the field of smart contract and DeFi security from the perspective of both vulnerability detection and automated repair. First, we analyze the DeFi smart contract security issues and challenges. Specifically, we lucubrate various DeFi attack incidents and summarize the attacks into six categories. Then, we present an empirical study of 42 state-of-the-art techniques that can detect smart contract and DeFi vulnerabilities. In particular, we evaluate the effectiveness of traditional smart contract bug detection tools in analyzing complex DeFi protocols. Additionally, we investigate 8 existing automated repair tools for smart contracts and DeFi protocols, providing insight into their advantages and disadvantages. To make this work useful for as wide of an audience as possible, we also identify several open issues and challenges in the DeFi ecosystem that should be addressed in the future. ",

As a result of these disruptions, pervasive in indoor spaces, magnetic field data is often omitted from navigation algorithms in indoor environments. This paper leverages the spatially-varying disruptions to Earth's magnetic field to extract positional information for use in indoor navigation algorithms. The algorithm uses a rate gyro and an array of four magnetometers to estimate the robot's pose. Additionally, the magnetometer array is used to compute attitude-invariant measurements associated with the magnetic field and its gradient. These measurements are used to detect loop closure points. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can estimate the pose of a ground robot in an indoor environment within meter accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Signed graphs are well-suited for modeling social networks as they capture both positive and negative relationships. Signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) are commonly employed to predict link signs (i.e., positive and negative) in such graphs due to their ability to handle the unique structure of signed graphs. However, real-world signed graphs are vulnerable to malicious attacks by manipulating edge relationships, and existing adversarial graph attack methods do not consider the specific structure of signed graphs. SGNNs often incorporate balance theory to effectively model the positive and negative links. Surprisingly, we find that the balance theory that they rely on can ironically be exploited as a black-box attack. In this paper, we propose a novel black-box attack called balance-attack that aims to decrease the balance degree of the signed graphs. We present an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve this NP-hard optimization problem. We conduct extensive experiments on five popular SGNN models and four real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and wide applicability of our proposed attack method. By addressing these challenges, our research contributes to a better understanding of the limitations and resilience of robust models when facing attacks on SGNNs. This work contributes to enhancing the security and reliability of signed graph analysis in social network modeling.

After the force applied was large enough to move the system, the force was applied to move the system at a constant speed. Since the net force acting on the system is zero while the system is stationary and moving with a constant speed, in these cases the magnitudes of force read through the sensor are equal to the static and kinetic friction forces acting on the object. Using these static and kinetic friction forces values, the maximum value of the static friction coefficient and the kinetic friction coefficient were calculated as 0.484 and 0.313, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Developing a generative model of realistic order flow in financial markets is a challenging open problem, with numerous applications for market participants. Addressing this, we propose the first end-to-end autoregressive generative model that generates tokenized limit order book (LOB) messages. These messages are interpreted by a Jax-LOB simulator, which updates the LOB state. To handle long sequences efficiently, the model employs simplified structured state-space layers to process sequences of order book states and tokenized messages. Using LOBSTER data of NASDAQ equity LOBs, we develop a custom tokenizer for message data, converting groups of successive digits to tokens, similar to tokenization in large language models. Out-of-sample results show promising performance in approximating the data distribution, as evidenced by low model perplexity. Furthermore, the mid-price returns calculated from the generated order flow exhibit a significant correlation with the data, indicating impressive conditional forecast performance. Due to the granularity of generated data, and the accuracy of the model, it offers new application areas for future work beyond forecasting, e.g. acting as a world model in high-frequency financial reinforcement learning applications. Overall, our results invite the use and extension of the model in the direction of autoregressive large financial models for the generation of high-frequency financial data and we commit to open-sourcing our code to facilitate future research.

Our proposed analysis method includes investigations on both generalization error and approximation error. We then establish non-asymptotic upper bounds for the adversarial excess risk associated with Lipschitz loss functions. In addition, we apply our general results to adversarial training for classification and regression problems. For the quadratic loss in nonparametric regression, we show that the adversarial excess risk bound can be improved over those for a general loss. ",

    "abstract": "Causal machine learning methods which flexibly generate heterogeneous treatment effect estimates could be very useful tools for governments trying to make and implement policy. However, as the critical artificial intelligence literature has shown, governments must be very careful of unintended consequences when using machine learning models. One way to try and protect against unintended bad outcomes is with AI Fairness methods which seek to create machine learning models where sensitive variables like race or gender do not influence outcomes. In this paper we argue that standard AI Fairness approaches developed for predictive machine learning are not suitable for all causal machine learning applications because causal machine learning generally (at least so far) uses modelling to inform a human who is the ultimate decision-maker while AI Fairness approaches assume a model that is making decisions directly. We define these scenarios as indirect and direct decision-making respectively and suggest that policy-making is best seen as a joint decision where the causal machine learning model usually only has indirect power. We lay out a definition of fairness for this scenario - a model that provides the information a decision-maker needs to accurately make a value judgement about just policy outcomes - and argue that the complexity of causal machine learning models can make this difficult to achieve. The solution here is not traditional AI Fairness adjustments, but careful modelling and awareness of some of the decision-making biases that these methods might encourage which we describe. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate automatic segmentation of medical images typically requires large datasets with high-quality annotations, making it less applicable in clinical settings due to limited training data. One-shot segmentation based on learned transformations (OSSLT) has shown promise when labeled data is extremely limited, typically including unsupervised deformable registration, data augmentation with learned registration, and segmentation learned from augmented data. However, current one-shot segmentation methods are challenged by limited data diversity during augmentation, and potential label errors caused by imperfect registration. To address these issues, we propose a novel one-shot medical image segmentation method with adversarial training and label error rectification (AdLER), with the aim of improving the diversity of generated data and correcting label errors to enhance segmentation performance. Specifically, we implement a novel dual consistency constraint to ensure anatomy-aligned registration that lessens registration errors. Furthermore, we develop an adversarial training strategy to augment the atlas image, which ensures both generation diversity and segmentation robustness. We also propose to rectify potential label errors in the augmented atlas images by estimating segmentation uncertainty, which can compensate for the imperfect nature of deformable registration and improve segmentation authenticity. Experiments on the CANDI and ABIDE datasets demonstrate that the proposed AdLER outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 0.7% (CANDI), 3.6% (ABIDE \"seen\"), and 4.9% (ABIDE \"unseen\") in segmentation based on Dice scores, respectively.

While such models have achieved enormous success in machine learning, particularly for generative modeling and density estimation, little is known about their statistical properties. This work establishes the first general nonparametric statistical convergence analysis for distribution learning via ODE models trained through likelihood maximization. We first prove a convergence theorem applicable to arbitrary velocity field classes $\\mathcal{F}$ satisfying certain simple boundary constraints. This general result captures the trade-off between approximation error (`bias') and the complexity of the ODE model (`variance'). We show that the latter can be quantified via the $C^1$-metric entropy of the class $\\mathcal F$. We then apply this general framework to the setting of $C^k$-smooth target densities, and establish nearly minimax-optimal convergence rates for two relevant velocity field classes $\\mathcal F$: $C^k$ functions and neural networks. The latter is the practically important case of neural ODEs. Our proof techniques require a careful synthesis of (i) analytical stability results for ODEs, (ii) classical theory for sieved M-estimators, and (iii) recent results on approximation rates and metric entropies of neural network classes. The results also provide theoretical insight on how the choice of velocity field class, and the dependence of this choice on sample size $n$ (e.g., the scaling of width, depth, and sparsity of neural network classes), impacts statistical performance.

    "abstract": "$ $Acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) involves mapping from the acoustic space to the articulatory space. Signal-processing features like the MFCCs, have been widely used for the AAI task. For subjects with dysarthric speech, AAI is challenging because of an imprecise and indistinct pronunciation. In this work, we perform AAI for dysarthric speech using representations from pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models. We demonstrate the impact of different pre-trained features on this challenging AAI task, at low-resource conditions. In addition, we also condition x-vectors to the extracted SSL features to train a BLSTM network. In the seen case, we experiment with three AAI training schemes (subject-specific, pooled, and fine-tuned). The results, consistent across training schemes, reveal that DeCoAR, in the fine-tuned scheme, achieves a relative improvement of the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (CC) by ${\\sim}$1.81\\% and ${\\sim}$4.56\\% for healthy controls and patients, respectively, over MFCCs. In the unseen case, we observe similar average trends for different SSL features. Overall, SSL networks like wav2vec, APC, and DeCoAR, which are trained with feature reconstruction or future timestep prediction tasks, perform well in predicting dysarthric articulatory trajectories.

However, conventional methods of detecting financial fraud have limited effectiveness, necessitating the need for new approaches to improve detection rates. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting financial fraud using Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs). QGNNs are a type of neural network that can process graph-structured data and leverage the power of Quantum Computing (QC) to perform computations more efficiently than classical neural networks. Our approach uses Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) to enhance the performance of the QGNN. In order to evaluate the efficiency of our proposed method, we compared the performance of QGNNs to Classical Graph Neural Networks using a real-world financial fraud detection dataset. The results of our experiments showed that QGNNs achieved an AUC of $0.85$, which outperformed classical GNNs. Our research highlights the potential of QGNNs and suggests that QGNNs are a promising new approach for improving financial fraud detection. ",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tasks often involve multiple contrasts. Recently, numerous deep learning-based multi-contrast MRI super-resolution (SR) and reconstruction methods have been proposed to explore the complementary information from the multi-contrast images. However, these methods either construct parameter-sharing networks or manually design fusion rules, failing to accurately model the correlations between multi-contrast images and lacking certain interpretations. In this paper, we propose a multi-contrast convolutional dictionary (MC-CDic) model under the guidance of the optimization algorithm with a well-designed data fidelity term. Specifically, we bulid an observation model for the multi-contrast MR images to explicitly model the multi-contrast images as common features and unique features. In this way, only the useful information in the reference image can be transferred to the target image, while the inconsistent information will be ignored. We employ the proximal gradient algorithm to optimize the model and unroll the iterative steps into a deep CDic model. Especially, the proximal operators are replaced by learnable ResNet. In addition, multi-scale dictionaries are introduced to further improve the model performance. We test our MC-CDic model on multi-contrast MRI SR and reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MC-CDic model against existing SOTA methods. Code is available at https://github.com/lpcccc-cv/MC-CDic. ",

Secondly, a distributed upper bounding procedure is proposed, which is based on iteratively approximating the DRCO by restricting the constraints right-hand side with a proper positive parameter and enforcing the compact uncertainty set at finitely many points. The lower and upper bounds of the global optimal objective for the DRCO are obtained from these two procedures. Thirdly, two distributed termination methods are proposed to make all agents stop updating simultaneously by exploring whether the gap between the upper and the lower bounds reaches a certain accuracy. Fourthly, it is proved that all the agents finite-time converge to a feasible consensus solution that satisfies global optimality within a certain accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for Few-Shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (FSUDA), where only a limited number of unlabeled target domain samples are available for training. To accomplish this challenging task, first, a spectral sensitivity map is introduced to characterize the generalization weaknesses of models in the frequency domain. We then developed a Sensitivity-guided Spectral Adversarial MixUp (SAMix) method to generate target-style images to effectively suppresses the model sensitivity, which leads to improved model generalizability in the target domain.

In this article, we take a step in this direction by establishing an implicit regularization of deep residual networks towards neural ODEs, for nonlinear networks trained with gradient flow. We prove that if the network is initialized as a discretization of a neural ODE, then such a discretization holds throughout training. Our results are valid for a finite training time, and also as the training time tends to infinity provided that the network satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Importantly, this condition holds for a family of residual networks where the residuals are two-layer perceptrons with an overparameterization in width that is only linear, and implies the convergence of gradient flow to a global minimum.

Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial as most Alzheimer's patients are unaware of having it until the effects become detrimental. AI has been known to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose Alzheimer's. However, models which produce low rates of false diagnoses are critical to prevent unnecessary treatments. Thus, we trained supervised Random Forest models with segmented brain volumes and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) outputs to classify different Alzheimer's stages. We then applied out-of-distribution (OOD) detection to the CNN model, enabling it to report OOD if misclassification is likely, thereby reducing false diagnoses. With an accuracy of 98% for detection and 95% for classification, our model based on CNN results outperformed our segmented volume model, which had detection and classification accuracies of 93% and 87%, respectively. Applying OOD detection to the CNN model enabled it to flag brain tumor images as OOD with 96% accuracy and minimal overall accuracy reduction. By using OOD detection to enhance the reliability of MRI classification using CNNs, we lowered the rate of false positives and eliminated a significant disadvantage of using Machine Learning models for healthcare tasks.

In this work, we propose a locally stationary graph process (LSGP) model that aims to extend the classical concept of local stationarity to irregular graph domains. We characterize local stationarity by expressing the overall process as the combination of a set of component processes such that the extent to which the process adheres to each component varies smoothly over the graph. We propose an algorithm for computing LSGP models from realizations of the process, and also study the approximation of LSGPs locally with WSS processes.

Numerous penalized regression methods have been introduced as modern methods for analyzing high-dimensional data. Disproportionate attention has been paid to the challenge (ii) though. Penalized regression methods can do their job very well and are expected to handle the challenge (ii) simultaneously. Most of them, however, can break down by a single outlier (or single adversary contaminated point) as revealed in this article. The latter systematically examines leading penalized regression methods in the literature in terms of their robustness, provides quantitative assessment, and reveals that most of them can break down by a single outlier. Consequently, a novel robust penalized regression method based on the least sum of squares of depth trimmed residuals is proposed and studied carefully. Experiments with simulated and real data reveal that the newly proposed method can outperform some leading competitors in estimation and prediction accuracy in the cases considered. ",

We consider a common setting where a short sequence is read out repeatedly using a high-throughput long-read platform to generate multiple subreads, or noisy observations of the same sequence. Denoising these subreads with alignment-based approaches often fails when too few subreads are available or error rates are too high. In this paper, we propose a novel method for blindly denoising sets of sequences without directly observing clean source sequence labels. Our method, Self-Supervised Set Learning (SSSL), gathers subreads together in an embedding space and estimates a single set embedding as the midpoint of the subreads in both the latent and sequence spaces. This set embedding represents the \"average\" of the subreads and can be decoded into a prediction of the clean sequence. In experiments on simulated long-read DNA data, SSSL methods denoise small reads of $\\leq 6$ subreads with 17% fewer errors and large reads of $>6$ subreads with 8% fewer errors compared to the best baseline. On a real dataset of antibody sequences, SSSL improves over baselines on two self-supervised metrics, with a significant improvement on difficult small reads that comprise over 60% of the test set. By accurately denoising these reads, SSSL promises to better realize the potential of high-throughput DNA sequencing data for downstream scientific applications. ",

This means that the trajectories are anti-persistent or 'mean-reverting' with short-term memory, and they can be adequately captured by a fractional Brownian motion process. The observed behavior can be qualitatively reproduced in synthetic networks that possess a latent geometric space, but not in networks that lack such space, suggesting that the observed subdiffusive dynamics are inherently linked to the hidden geometry of real networks.

Derived from its classical counterpart, QCNN is prone to overfitting. Overfitting is a typical shortcoming of ML models that are trained too closely to the availed training dataset and perform relatively poorly on unseen datasets for a similar problem. In this work we study the adaptation of one of the most successful overfitting mitigation method, knows as the (post-training) dropout method, to the quantum setting. We find that a straightforward implementation of this method in the quantum setting leads to a significant and undesirable consequence: a substantial decrease in success probability of the QCNN. We argue that this effect exposes the crucial role of entanglement in QCNNs and the vulnerability of QCNNs to entanglement loss. To handle overfitting, we proposed a softer version of the dropout method. We find that the proposed method allows us to handle successfully overfitting in the test cases. ",

In addition, we provide regression and classification outputs to supplement the parton assignment. We explore the performance of the extended capability of SPANet in the context of semi-leptonic decays of top quark pairs as well as top quark pairs produced in association with a Higgs boson. We find significant improvements in the power of three representative studies: search for ttH, measurement of the top quark mass and a search for a heavy Z' decaying to top quark pairs. We present ablation studies to provide insight on what the network has learned in each case. ",

    "title": "Dynamic Brain Transformer with Multi-level Attention for Functional  Brain Network Analysis",
    "abstract": "Recent neuroimaging studies have highlighted the importance of network-centric brain analysis, particularly with functional magnetic resonance imaging. The emergence of Deep Neural Networks has fostered a substantial interest in predicting clinical outcomes and categorizing individuals based on brain networks. However, the conventional approach involving static brain network analysis offers limited potential in capturing the dynamism of brain function. Although recent studies have attempted to harness dynamic brain networks, their high dimensionality and complexity present substantial challenges. This paper proposes a novel methodology, Dynamic bRAin Transformer (DART), which combines static and dynamic brain networks for more effective and nuanced brain function analysis. Our model uses the static brain network as a baseline, integrating dynamic brain networks to enhance performance against traditional methods. We innovatively employ attention mechanisms, enhancing model explainability and exploiting the dynamic brain network's temporal variations. The proposed approach offers a robust solution to the low signal-to-noise ratio of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals, a recurring issue in direct DNN modeling. It also provides valuable insights into which brain circuits or dynamic networks contribute more to final predictions. As such, DRAT shows a promising direction in neuroimaging studies, contributing to the comprehensive understanding of brain organization and the role of neural circuits. ",

We present a simple general approach to determining the boxicity of a graph based on studying its ``interval-order subgraphs''. The power of the method is first tested on the boxicity of some popular graphs that have resisted previous attempts: the boxicity of the Petersen graph is $3$, and more generally, that of the Kneser-graphs $K(n,2)$ is $n-2$ if $n\\ge 5$, confirming a conjecture of Caoduro and Lichev [Discrete Mathematics, Vol. 346, 5, 2023]. Since every line graph is an induced subgraph of the complement of $K(n,2)$, the developed tools show furthermore that line graphs have only a polynomial number of edge-maximal interval-order subgraphs. This opens the way to polynomial-time algorithms for problems that are in general $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard: for the existence and optimization of interval-order subgraphs of line-graphs, or of interval-completions of their complement.

    "abstract": "The process of identifying and characterizing B-cell epitopes, which are the portions of antigens recognized by antibodies, is important for our understanding of the immune system, and for many applications including vaccine development, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Computational epitope prediction is challenging yet rewarding as it significantly reduces the time and cost of laboratory work. Most of the existing tools do not have satisfactory performance and only discriminate epitopes from non-epitopes. This paper presents a new deep learning-based multi-task framework for linear B-cell epitope prediction as well as antibody type-specific epitope classification. Specifically, a sequenced-based neural network model using recurrent layers and Transformer blocks is developed. We propose an amino acid encoding method based on eigen decomposition to help the model learn the representations of epitopes. We introduce modifications to standard cross-entropy loss functions by extending a logit adjustment technique to cope with the class imbalance. Experimental results on data curated from the largest public epitope database demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods and the superior performance compared to competing ones. ",

When scaling quantum networks to many nodes, requiring a dedicated intermediary device for every pair of nodes introduces high costs. Here, we propose a cost-effective architecture to connect many quantum network nodes via a central quantum network hub called an Entanglement Generation Switch (EGS). The EGS allows multiple quantum nodes to be connected at a fixed resource cost, by sharing the resources needed to make entanglement. We propose an algorithm called the Rate Control Protocol (RCP) which moderates the level of competition for access to the hub's resources between sets of users. We proceed to prove a convergence theorem for rates yielded by the algorithm. To derive the algorithm we work in the framework of Network Utility Maximization (NUM) and make use of the theory of Lagrange multipliers and Lagrangian duality. Our EGS architecture lays the groundwork for developing control architectures compatible with other types of quantum network hubs as well as system models of greater complexity. ",

Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have shown to enhance radiologists' ability to interpret chest X-ray (CXR) images accurately and with fewer errors, leading to a better diagnosis of this disease. However, little work has been done to develop models capable of diagnosing TB that offer good performance while being efficient, fast and computationally inexpensive. In this work, we propose LightTBNet, a novel lightweight, fast and efficient deep convolutional network specially customized to detect TB from CXR images. Using a total of 800 frontal CXR images from two publicly available datasets, our solution yielded an accuracy, F1 and area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.906, 0.907 and 0.961, respectively, on an independent test subset. The proposed model demonstrates outstanding performance while delivering a rapid prediction, with minimal computational and memory requirements, making it highly suitable for deployment in handheld devices that can be used in low-resource areas with high TB prevalence.

In this study, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN), entitled InceptNet, in the scope of medical image processing, for early disease detection and segmentation of medical images in order to enhance precision and performance. We also investigate the interaction of users with the InceptNet application to present a comprehensive application including the background processes, and foreground interactions with users. Fast InceptNet is shaped by the prominent Unet architecture, and it seizes the power of an Inception module to be fast and cost effective while aiming to approximate an optimal local sparse structure. Adding Inception modules with various parallel kernel sizes can improve the network's ability to capture the variations in the scaled regions of interest. To experiment, the model is tested on four benchmark datasets, including retina blood vessel segmentation, lung nodule segmentation, skin lesion segmentation, and breast cancer cell detection. The improvement was more significant on images with small scale structures. The proposed method improved the accuracy from 0.9531, 0.8900, 0.9872, and 0.9881 to 0.9555, 0.9510, 0.9945, and 0.9945 on the mentioned datasets, respectively, which show outperforming of the proposed method over the previous works. Furthermore, by exploring the procedure from start to end, individuals who have utilized a trial edition of InceptNet, in the form of a complete application, are presented with thirteen multiple choice questions in order to assess the proposed method.

However, there are no dedicated tools to automatically characterise LA motion in 3D. Thus, we propose a tool that automatically segments the LA and extracts the displacement fields across the cardiac cycle. The pipeline is able to accurately track the LA wall across the cardiac cycle with an average Hausdorff distance of $2.51 \\pm 1.3~mm$ and Dice score of $0.96 \\pm 0.02$. ",

This paper utilizes data from multiple sources and introduces a group distributionally robust prediction model defined to optimize an adversarial reward about explained variance with respect to a class of target distributions. Compared to classical empirical risk minimization, the proposed robust prediction model improves the prediction accuracy for target populations with distribution shifts. We show that our group distributionally robust prediction model is a weighted average of the source populations' conditional outcome models. We leverage this key identification result to robustify arbitrary machine learning algorithms, including, for example, random forests and neural networks. We devise a novel bias-corrected estimator to estimate the optimal aggregation weight for general machine-learning algorithms and demonstrate its improvement in the convergence rate. Our proposal can be seen as a distributionally robust federated learning approach that is computationally efficient and easy to implement using arbitrary machine learning base algorithms, satisfies some privacy constraints, and has a nice interpretation of different sources' importance for predicting a given target covariate distribution. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed group distributionally robust method on simulated and real data with random forests and neural networks as base-learning algorithms. ",

We use a lightweight ($<$ 30k parameters) Siamese neural network that takes as inputs two different pitch-shifted versions of the same audio represented by its Constant-Q Transform. To prevent the model from collapsing in an encoder-only setting, we propose a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective which captures pitch information. Furthermore, we design the architecture of our network to be transposition-preserving by introducing learnable Toeplitz matrices. We evaluate our model for the two tasks of singing voice and musical instrument pitch estimation and show that our model is able to generalize across tasks and datasets while being lightweight, hence remaining compatible with low-resource devices and suitable for real-time applications. In particular, our results surpass self-supervised baselines and narrow the performance gap between self-supervised and supervised methods for pitch estimation. ",

However, these methods largely assume the existence of a normal training set (i.e., uncontaminated by anomalies) or even a completely labeled training set. In many complex engineering systems, such as particle accelerators, labels are sparse and expensive; in order to perform anomaly detection in these cases, we must drop these assumptions and utilize a completely unsupervised method. This paper introduces the Resilient Variational Autoencoder (ResVAE), a deep generative model specifically designed for anomaly detection. ResVAE exhibits resilience to anomalies present in the training data and provides feature-level anomaly attribution. During the training process, ResVAE learns the anomaly probability for each sample as well as each individual feature, utilizing these probabilities to effectively disregard anomalous examples in the training data. We apply our proposed method to detect anomalies in the accelerator status at the SLAC Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). By utilizing shot-to-shot data from the beam position monitoring system, we demonstrate the exceptional capability of ResVAE in identifying various types of anomalies that are visible in the accelerator.

Inspired by recent work that connects what are known as functions of $\\textit{Radon bounded variation}$ (RBV) and neural networks (Parhi and Nowak, 2021, 2023), we study the MMD defined by taking $\\mathcal{F}$ to be the unit ball in the RBV space of a given smoothness order $k \\geq 0$. This test, which we refer to as the $\\textit{Radon-Kolmogorov-Smirnov}$ (RKS) test, can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known and classical Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to multiple dimensions and higher orders of smoothness. It is also intimately connected to neural networks: we prove that the witness in the RKS test -- the function $f$ achieving the maximum mean difference -- is always a ridge spline of degree $k$, i.e., a single neuron in a neural network. This allows us to leverage the power of modern deep learning toolkits to (approximately) optimize the criterion that underlies the RKS test. We prove that the RKS test has asymptotically full power at distinguishing any distinct pair $P \\not= Q$ of distributions, derive its asymptotic null distribution, and carry out extensive experiments to elucidate the strengths and weakenesses of the RKS test versus the more traditional kernel MMD test.
