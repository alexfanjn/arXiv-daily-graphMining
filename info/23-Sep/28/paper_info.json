    "title": "From Asset Flow to Status, Action and Intention Discovery: Early Malice  Detection in Cryptocurrency",
    "abstract": "Cryptocurrency has been subject to illicit activities probably more often than traditional financial assets due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of its transacting entities. An ideal detection model is expected to achieve all three critical properties of (I) early detection, (II) good interpretability, and (III) versatility for various illicit activities. However, existing solutions cannot meet all these requirements, as most of them heavily rely on deep learning without interpretability and are only available for retrospective analysis of a specific illicit type. To tackle all these challenges, we propose Intention-Monitor for early malice detection in Bitcoin (BTC), where the on-chain record data for a certain address are much scarcer than other cryptocurrency platforms. We first define asset transfer paths with the Decision-Tree based feature Selection and Complement (DT-SC) to build different feature sets for different malice types. Then, the Status/Action Proposal Module (S/A-PM) and the Intention-VAE module generate the status, action, intent-snippet, and hidden intent-snippet embedding. With all these modules, our model is highly interpretable and can detect various illegal activities. Moreover, well-designed loss functions further enhance the prediction speed and model's interpretability. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, additional case studies justify our model can not only explain existing illicit patterns but can also find new suspicious characters. ",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction has been substantially advanced by recent progress in neural fields. However, most existing methods train a separate network from scratch for each individual scene. This is not scalable, inefficient, and unable to yield good results given limited views. While learning-based multi-view stereo methods alleviate this issue to some extent, their multi-view setting makes it less flexible to scale up and to broad applications. Instead, we introduce training generalizable Neural Fields incorporating scene Priors (NFPs). The NFP network maps any single-view RGB-D image into signed distance and radiance values. A complete scene can be reconstructed by merging individual frames in the volumetric space WITHOUT a fusion module, which provides better flexibility. The scene priors can be trained on large-scale datasets, allowing for fast adaptation to the reconstruction of a new scene with fewer views. NFP not only demonstrates SOTA scene reconstruction performance and efficiency, but it also supports single-image novel-view synthesis, which is underexplored in neural fields.

    "abstract": "Stance detection is the process of inferring a person's position or standpoint on a specific issue to deduce prevailing perceptions toward topics of general or controversial interest, such as health policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing models for stance detection are trained to perform well for a single domain (e.g., COVID-19) and a specific target topic (e.g., masking protocols), but are generally ineffectual in other domains or targets due to distributional shifts in the data. However, constructing high-performing, domain-specific stance detection models requires an extensive corpus of labeled data relevant to the targeted domain, yet such datasets are not readily available. This poses a challenge as the process of annotating data is costly and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel stance detection model coined domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation (STANCE-C3) that uses counterfactual data augmentation to enhance domain-adaptive training by enriching the target domain dataset during the training process and requiring significantly less information from the new domain. We also propose a modified self-supervised contrastive learning as a component of STANCE-C3 to prevent overfitting for the existing domain and target and enable cross-target stance detection. Through experiments on various datasets, we show that STANCE-C3 shows performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are essential tools in various domains, but their performance can degrade over time due to changes in data distribution or other factors. On one hand, detecting and addressing such degradations is crucial for maintaining the models' reliability. On the other hand, given enough data, any arbitrary small change of quality can be detected. As interventions, such as model re-training or replacement, can be expensive, we argue that they should only be carried out when changes exceed a given threshold. We propose a sequential monitoring scheme to detect these relevant changes. The proposed method reduces unnecessary alerts and overcomes the multiple testing problem by accounting for temporal dependence of the measured model quality. Conditions for consistency and specified asymptotic levels are provided. Empirical validation using simulated and real data demonstrates the superiority of our approach in detecting relevant changes in model quality compared to benchmark methods. Our research contributes a practical solution for distinguishing between minor fluctuations and meaningful degradations in machine learning model performance, ensuring their reliability in dynamic environments.

Modern algorithms rely on anchor-based detectors, which are then followed by a label assignment process to categorize training detections as positive or negative instances based on learned geometric attributes. The current methods, however, have limitations and might not be optimal since they rely on predefined classical cost functions that are based on a low-dimensional model. Our research introduces MatchNet, a deep learning sub-module-based approach aimed at enhancing the label assignment process. Integrated into a state-of-the-art lane detection network like the Cross Layer Refinement Network for Lane Detection (CLRNet), MatchNet replaces the conventional label assignment process with a sub-module network. This integration results in significant improvements in scenarios involving curved lanes, with remarkable improvement across all backbones of +2.8% for ResNet34, +2.3% for ResNet101, and +2.96% for DLA34. In addition, it maintains or even improves comparable results in other sections. Our method boosts the confidence level in lane detection, allowing an increase in the confidence threshold.

A lot of research has gone into studying microbial communities in various environments and how their interactions and relationships can provide insights into various diseases. Co-occurrence network inference algorithms help us understand the complex associations of micro-organisms, especially bacteria. Existing network inference algorithms employ techniques such as correlation, regularized linear regression, and conditional dependence, which have different hyper-parameters that determine the sparsity of the network. Previous methods for evaluating the quality of the inferred network include using external data, and network consistency across sub-samples, both which have several drawbacks that limit their applicability in real microbiome composition data sets. We propose a novel cross-validation method to evaluate co-occurrence network inference algorithms, and new methods for applying existing algorithms to predict on test data. Our empirical study shows that the proposed method is useful for hyper-parameter selection (training) and comparing the quality of the inferred networks between different algorithms (testing). ",

Geospatial data comprises of acquired and derived heterogeneous data modalities that we transform to semantically meaningful, image-like tensors to address the challenges of representation, alignment, and fusion of multimodal data. SeMAnD is comprised of (i) a simple data augmentation strategy, called RandPolyAugment, capable of generating diverse augmentations of vector geometries, and (ii) a self-supervised training objective with three components that incentivize learning representations of multimodal data that are discriminative to local changes in one modality which are not corroborated by the other modalities. Detecting local defects is crucial for geospatial anomaly detection where even small anomalies (e.g., shifted, incorrectly connected, malformed, or missing polygonal vector geometries like roads, buildings, landcover, etc.) are detrimental to the experience and safety of users of geospatial applications like mapping, routing, search, and recommendation systems. Our empirical study on test sets of different types of real-world geometric geospatial anomalies across 3 diverse geographical regions demonstrates that SeMAnD is able to detect real-world defects and outperforms domain-agnostic anomaly detection strategies by 4.8-19.7% as measured using anomaly classification AUC. We also show that model performance increases (i) up to 20.4% as the number of input modalities increase and (ii) up to 22.9% as the diversity and strength of training data augmentations increase. ",

    "abstract": "In vehicle trajectory prediction, physics models and data-driven models are two predominant methodologies. However, each approach presents its own set of challenges: physics models fall short in predictability, while data-driven models lack interpretability. Addressing these identified shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel framework, the Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) model. PERL integrates the strengths of physics-based and data-driven methods for traffic state prediction. PERL contains a physics model and a residual learning model. Its prediction is the sum of the physics model result and a predicted residual as a correction to it. It preserves the interpretability inherent to physics-based models and has reduced data requirements compared to data-driven methods. Experiments were conducted using a real-world vehicle trajectory dataset. We proposed a PERL model, with the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) as its physics car-following model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as its residual learning model. We compare this PERL model with the physics car-following model, data-driven model, and other physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The result reveals that PERL achieves better prediction with a small dataset, compared to the physics model, data-driven model, and PINN model. Second, the PERL model showed faster convergence during training, offering comparable performance with fewer training samples than the data-driven model and PINN model. Sensitivity analysis also proves comparable performance of PERL using another residual learning model and a physics car-following model. ",

Towards endowing robots with terrain awareness without these limitations, we introduce Self-supervised TErrain Representation LearnING (STERLING), a novel approach for learning terrain representations that relies solely on easy-to-collect, unconstrained (e.g., non-expert), and unlabelled robot experience, with no additional constraints on data collection. STERLING employs a novel multi-modal self-supervision objective through non-contrastive representation learning to learn relevant terrain representations for terrain-aware navigation. Through physical robot experiments in off-road environments, we evaluate STERLING features on the task of preference-aligned visual navigation and find that STERLING features perform on par with fully supervised approaches and outperform other state-of-the-art methods with respect to preference alignment. Additionally, we perform a large-scale experiment of autonomously hiking a 3-mile long trail which STERLING completes successfully with only two manual interventions, demonstrating its robustness to real-world off-road conditions.

However, such methods typically lack a systematic strategy to prioritize interactions while controlling confidence levels, making them difficult to apply in practice for scientific discovery and hypothesis validation. In this paper, we introduce a method, called DeepROCK, to address this limitation by using knockoffs, which are dummy variables that are designed to mimic the dependence structure of a given set of features while being conditionally independent of the response. Together with a novel DNN architecture involving a pairwise-coupling layer, DeepROCK jointly controls the false discovery rate (FDR) and maximizes statistical power. In addition, we identify a challenge in correctly controlling FDR using off-the-shelf feature interaction importance measures. DeepROCK overcomes this challenge by proposing a calibration procedure applied to existing interaction importance measures to make the FDR under control at a target level. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of DeepROCK through extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets. ",

Existing methods for vulnerability detection remain suboptimal. Traditional techniques are both time-consuming and labor-intensive, while machine-learning-based approaches often underperform when applied to complex datasets, due to their inability to capture high-dimensional relationships. Previous deep-learning strategies also fall short in capturing sufficient feature information. Although self-attention mechanisms can process information over long distances, they fail to capture structural information. In this paper, we introduce DefectHunter, an innovative model for vulnerability identification that employs the Conformer mechanism. This mechanism fuses self-attention with convolutional networks to capture both local, position-wise features and global, content-based interactions. Furthermore, we optimize the self-attention mechanisms to mitigate the issue of excessive attention heads introducing extraneous noise by adjusting the denominator. We evaluated DefectHunter against ten baseline methods using six industrial and two highly complex datasets. On the QEMU dataset, DefectHunter exhibited a 20.62\\% improvement in accuracy over Pongo-70B, and for the CWE-754 dataset, its accuracy was 14.64\\% higher. To investigate how DefectHunter comprehends vulnerabilities, we conducted a case study, which revealed that our model effectively understands the mechanisms underlying vulnerabilities. ",

Numerical simulations present an alternative to physical experiments, but are usually infeasible for complex real-world domains due to the computational requirements of existing numerical methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a potential paradigm shift through the development of fast data-driven surrogate models. In particular, an AI framework, known as neural operators, presents a principled framework for learning mappings between functions defined on continuous domains, e.g., spatiotemporal processes and partial differential equations (PDE). They can extrapolate and predict solutions at new locations unseen during training, i.e., perform zero-shot super-resolution. Neural operators can augment or even replace existing simulators in many applications, such as computational fluid dynamics, weather forecasting, and material modeling, while being 4-5 orders of magnitude faster. Further, neural operators can be integrated with physics and other domain constraints enforced at finer resolutions to obtain high-fidelity solutions and good generalization. Since neural operators are differentiable, they can directly optimize parameters for inverse design and other inverse problems. We believe that neural operators present a transformative approach to simulation and design, enabling rapid research and development. ",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of deformable scenes from endoscopic videos is important for many applications such as intraoperative navigation, surgical visual perception, and robotic surgery. It is a foundational requirement for realizing autonomous robotic interventions for minimally invasive surgery. However, previous approaches in this domain have been limited by their modular nature and are confined to specific camera and scene settings. Our work adopts the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) approach to learning 3D implicit representations of scenes that are both dynamic and deformable over time, and furthermore with unknown camera poses. We demonstrate this approach on endoscopic surgical scenes from robotic surgery. This work removes the constraints of known camera poses and overcomes the drawbacks of the state-of-the-art unstructured dynamic scene reconstruction technique, which relies on the static part of the scene for accurate reconstruction. Through several experimental datasets, we demonstrate the versatility of our proposed model to adapt to diverse camera and scene settings, and show its promise for both current and future robotic surgical systems.

    "abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) networks bring computing and storage capabilities closer to edge devices, which reduces latency and improves network performance. However, to further reduce transmission and computation costs while satisfying user-perceived quality of experience, a joint optimization in computing, pushing, and caching is needed. In this paper, we formulate the joint-design problem in MEC networks as an infinite-horizon discounted-cost Markov decision process and solve it using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework that enables the dynamic orchestration of computing, pushing, and caching. Through the deep networks embedded in the DRL structure, our framework can implicitly predict user future requests and push or cache the appropriate content to effectively enhance system performance. One issue we encountered when considering three functions collectively is the curse of dimensionality for the action space. To address it, we relaxed the discrete action space into a continuous space and then adopted soft actor-critic learning to solve the optimization problem, followed by utilizing a vector quantization method to obtain the desired discrete action. Additionally, an action correction method was proposed to compress the action space further and accelerate the convergence. Our simulations under the setting of a general single-user, single-server MEC network with dynamic transmission link quality demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively decreases transmission bandwidth and computing cost by proactively pushing data on future demand to users and jointly optimizing the three functions. We also conduct extensive parameter tuning analysis, which shows that our approach outperforms the baselines under various parameter settings. ",

    "abstract": "An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a medical test that measures the heart's electrical activity. ECGs are often used to diagnose and monitor a wide range of heart conditions, including arrhythmias, heart attacks, and heart failure. On the one hand, the conventional ECG requires clinical measurement, which restricts its deployment to medical facilities. On the other hand, single-lead ECG has become popular on wearable devices using administered procedures. An alternative to ECG is Photoplethysmography (PPG), which uses non-invasive, low-cost optical methods to measure cardiac physiology, making it a suitable option for capturing vital heart signs in daily life. As a result, it has become increasingly popular in health monitoring and is used in various clinical and commercial wearable devices. While ECG and PPG correlate strongly, the latter does not offer significant clinical diagnostic value. Here, we propose a subject-independent attention-based deep state-space model to translate PPG signals to corresponding ECG waveforms. The model is highly data-efficient by incorporating prior knowledge in terms of probabilistic graphical models. Notably, the model enables the detection of atrial fibrillation (AFib), the most common heart rhythm disorder in adults, by complementing ECG's accuracy with continuous PPG monitoring. We evaluated the model on 55 subjects from the MIMIC III database. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. ",

However, much of the current research evaluates a deep AD algorithm holistically, failing to understand the contributions of individual design choices like loss functions and network architectures. Consequently, the importance of prerequisite steps, such as preprocessing, might be overshadowed by the spotlight on novel loss functions and architectures. In this paper, we address these oversights by posing two questions: (i) Which components (i.e., design choices) of deep AD methods are pivotal in detecting anomalies? (ii) How can we construct tailored AD algorithms for specific datasets by selecting the best design choices automatically, rather than relying on generic, pre-existing solutions? To this end, we introduce ADGym, the first platform designed for comprehensive evaluation and automatic selection of AD design elements in deep methods. Extensive experiments reveal that merely adopting existing leading methods is not ideal. Models crafted using ADGym markedly surpass current state-of-the-art techniques. ",

We propose a hierarchical robotic manipulation system that learns the underlying relationships and maximizes the collaborative power of its diverse skills (e.g., pick-place, push) for rearranging adversarial objects in constrained environments. The high-level coordinator employs a heterogeneous graph neural network (HetGNN), which reasons about the current objects, goal objects, and environmental constraints; the low-level 3D Convolutional Neural Network-based actors execute the action primitives.

Directional Change (DC) is an alternative approach to sampling price data, highlighting significant points while blurring out noise details in price movements. However, traditional DC treated the thresholds of upward and downward trends with distinct intrinsic patterns as equivalent and preset them as fixed values, which are dependent on the subjective judgment of traders. To enhance the generalization performance of this methodology, we improved DC by introducing a modified threshold selection technique. Specifically, we addressed upward and downward trends distinctly by incorporating a decay coefficient. Further, we simultaneously optimized the threshold and decay coefficient using the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA). Additionally, we recognized the abnormal market state by regime change detection based on the Hidden Markov Model (RCD-HMM) to reduce the risk. Our Intelligent Trading Algorithm (ITA) was constructed based on above methods and the experiments were carried out on tick data from diverse currency pairs in the forex market. The experimental results showed a significant increase in profit and reduction in risk of DC-based trading strategies, which demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods. ",

We provide an empirical demonstration of the fragility of ResNet-like models to Gaussian noise perturbations, where the model performance deteriorates sharply and its F1-score drops to near insignificance at 0.008 with a Gaussian noise of only 0.5 standard deviation. We also highlight a concerning discrepancy where the explanations provided by ResNet-like models do not reflect the inherent periodicity in the input data, a crucial attribute in URE detection from stable devices. In response to these findings, we propose a novel application of Neural SDEs to build models for URE classification that are not only robust to noise but also provide more meaningful and intuitive explanations. Neural SDE models maintain a high F1-score of 0.93 even when exposed to Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.5, demonstrating superior resilience to ResNet models. Neural SDE models successfully recover the time-invariant or periodic horizontal bands from the input data, a feature that was conspicuously missing in the explanations generated by ResNet-like models. This advancement presents a small but significant step in the development of robust and interpretable models for real-world URE applications where data is inherently noisy and assurance arguments demand interpretable machine learning predictions.

    "abstract": "Robust multisensor fusion of multi-modal measurements such as IMUs, wheel encoders, cameras, LiDARs, and GPS holds great potential due to its innate ability to improve resilience to sensor failures and measurement outliers, thereby enabling robust autonomy. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to develop a consistent tightly-coupled Multisensor-aided Inertial Navigation System (MINS) that is capable of fusing the most common navigation sensors in an efficient filtering framework, by addressing the particular challenges of computational complexity, sensor asynchronicity, and intra-sensor calibration. In particular, we propose a consistent high-order on-manifold interpolation scheme to enable efficient asynchronous sensor fusion and state management strategy (i.e. dynamic cloning). The proposed dynamic cloning leverages motion-induced information to adaptively select interpolation orders to control computational complexity while minimizing trajectory representation errors. We perform online intrinsic and extrinsic (spatiotemporal) calibration of all onboard sensors to compensate for poor prior calibration and/or degraded calibration varying over time. Additionally, we develop an initialization method with only proprioceptive measurements of IMU and wheel encoders, instead of exteroceptive sensors, which is shown to be less affected by the environment and more robust in highly dynamic scenarios. We extensively validate the proposed MINS in simulations and large-scale challenging real-world datasets, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art methods, in terms of localization accuracy, consistency, and computation efficiency.

We first theoretically demonstrate that the proposed T&R system is globally stable and robust while considering the uncertainties of the closed-loop system. When deployed on a Clearpath Jackal robot, we then show the global stability of the proposed system in both indoor and outdoor environments covering different terrains, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average trajectory error and stability in these challenging environments. This paper makes an important step towards long-term autonomous T&R navigation with ensured safety guarantees. ",

State-of-the-art neural fields typically rely on grid-based representations for storing local neural features and N-dimensional linear kernels for interpolating features at continuous query points. The spatial positions of their neural features are fixed on grid nodes and cannot well adapt to target signals. Our method instead builds upon general radial bases with flexible kernel position and shape, which have higher spatial adaptivity and can more closely fit target signals. To further improve the channel-wise capacity of radial basis functions, we propose to compose them with multi-frequency sinusoid functions. This technique extends a radial basis to multiple Fourier radial bases of different frequency bands without requiring extra parameters, facilitating the representation of details. Moreover, by marrying adaptive radial bases with grid-based ones, our hybrid combination inherits both adaptivity and interpolation smoothness. We carefully designed weighting schemes to let radial bases adapt to different types of signals effectively. Our experiments on 2D image and 3D signed distance field representation demonstrate the higher accuracy and compactness of our method than prior arts. When applied to neural radiance field reconstruction, our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality, with small model size and comparable training speed. ",

    "abstract": "Generic event boundary detection aims to localize the generic, taxonomy-free event boundaries that segment videos into chunks. Existing methods typically require video frames to be decoded before feeding into the network, which contains significant spatio-temporal redundancy and demands considerable computational power and storage space. To remedy these issues, we propose a novel compressed video representation learning method for event boundary detection that is fully end-to-end leveraging rich information in the compressed domain, i.e., RGB, motion vectors, residuals, and the internal group of pictures (GOP) structure, without fully decoding the video. Specifically, we use lightweight ConvNets to extract features of the P-frames in the GOPs and spatial-channel attention module (SCAM) is designed to refine the feature representations of the P-frames based on the compressed information with bidirectional information flow. To learn a suitable representation for boundary detection, we construct the local frames bag for each candidate frame and use the long short-term memory (LSTM) module to capture temporal relationships. We then compute frame differences with group similarities in the temporal domain. This module is only applied within a local window, which is critical for event boundary detection. Finally a simple classifier is used to determine the event boundaries of video sequences based on the learned feature representation. To remedy the ambiguities of annotations and speed up the training process, we use the Gaussian kernel to preprocess the ground-truth event boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves considerable improvements compared to previous end-to-end approach while running at the same speed.

Different from traditional end-to-end learning approaches, our HL policy takes insights from the angular momentum-based linear inverted pendulum (ALIP) to carefully design the observation and action spaces of the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This simple yet effective design creates an insightful mapping between a low-dimensional state that effectively captures the complex dynamics of bipedal locomotion and a set of task space outputs that shape the walking gait of the robot. The HL policy is agnostic to the task space LL controller, which increases the flexibility of the design and generalization of the framework to other bipedal robots. This hierarchical design results in a learning-based framework with improved performance, data efficiency, and robustness compared with the ALIP model-based approach and state-of-the-art learning-based frameworks for bipedal locomotion. The proposed hierarchical controller is tested in three different robots, Rabbit, a five-link underactuated planar biped; Walker2D, a seven-link fully-actuated planar biped; and Digit, a 3D humanoid robot with 20 actuated joints. The trained policy naturally learns human-like locomotion behaviors and is able to effectively track a wide range of walking speeds while preserving the robustness and stability of the walking gait even under adversarial conditions.

    "abstract": "Legged locomotion is a complex control problem that requires both accuracy and robustness to cope with real-world challenges. Legged systems have traditionally been controlled using trajectory optimization with inverse dynamics. Such hierarchical model-based methods are appealing due to intuitive cost function tuning, accurate planning, and most importantly, the insightful understanding gained from more than one decade of extensive research. However, model mismatch and violation of assumptions are common sources of faulty operation and may hinder successful sim-to-real transfer. Simulation-based reinforcement learning, on the other hand, results in locomotion policies with unprecedented robustness and recovery skills. Yet, all learning algorithms struggle with sparse rewards emerging from environments where valid footholds are rare, such as gaps or stepping stones. In this work, we propose a hybrid control architecture that combines the advantages of both worlds to simultaneously achieve greater robustness, foot-placement accuracy, and terrain generalization. Our approach utilizes a model-based planner to roll out a reference motion during training. A deep neural network policy is trained in simulation, aiming to track the optimized footholds. We evaluate the accuracy of our locomotion pipeline on sparse terrains, where pure data-driven methods are prone to fail. Furthermore, we demonstrate superior robustness in the presence of slippery or deformable ground when compared to model-based counterparts. Finally, we show that our proposed tracking controller generalizes across different trajectory optimization methods not seen during training. In conclusion, our work unites the predictive capabilities and optimality guarantees of online planning with the inherent robustness attributed to offline learning. ",

CCBERT perceives fine-grained code changes at the token level by learning from the old and new versions of the content, along with the edit actions. Our experiments demonstrate that CCBERT significantly outperforms CC2Vec or the state-of-the-art approaches of the downstream tasks by 7.7\\%--14.0\\% in terms of different metrics and tasks. CCBERT consistently outperforms large pre-trained code models, such as CodeBERT, while requiring 6--10$\\times$ less training time, 5--30$\\times$ less inference time, and 7.9$\\times$ less GPU memory.

Traditional EEG classification models, however, have often overlooked or inadequately leveraged the brain's topological information. Recognizing this shortfall, there has been a burgeoning interest in recent years in harnessing the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to exploit the topological information by modeling features selected from each EEG channel in a graph structure. To further facilitate research in this direction, we introduce GNN4EEG, a versatile and user-friendly toolkit for GNN-based modeling of EEG signals. GNN4EEG comprises three components: (i)A large benchmark constructed with four EEG classification tasks based on EEG data collected from 123 participants. (ii)Easy-to-use implementations on various state-of-the-art GNN-based EEG classification models, e.g., DGCNN, RGNN, etc. (iii)Implementations of comprehensive experimental settings and evaluation protocols, e.g., data splitting protocols, and cross-validation protocols.

    "abstract": "In order to assess the risks of a network system, it is important to investigate the behaviors of attackers after successful exploitation, which is called post-exploitation. Although there are various efficient tools supporting post-exploitation implementation, no application can automate this process. Most of the steps of this process are completed by experts who have profound knowledge of security, known as penetration testers or pen-testers. To this end, our study proposes the Raij\\=u framework, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven automation approach that assists pen-testers in quickly implementing the process of post-exploitation for security-level evaluation in network systems. We implement two RL algorithms, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train specialized agents capable of making intelligent actions, which are Metasploit modules to automatically launch attacks of privileges escalation, gathering hashdump, and lateral movement. By leveraging RL, we aim to empower these agents with the ability to autonomously select and execute actions that can exploit vulnerabilities in target systems. This approach allows us to automate certain aspects of the penetration testing workflow, making it more efficient and responsive to emerging threats and vulnerabilities. The experiments are performed in four real environments with agents trained in thousands of episodes. The agents automatically select actions and launch attacks on the environments and achieve over 84\\% of successful attacks with under 55 attack steps given. Moreover, the A2C algorithm has proved extremely effective in the selection of proper actions for automation of post-exploitation. ",

    "abstract": "Infrared detection is an emerging technique for safety-critical tasks owing to its remarkable anti-interference capability. However, recent studies have revealed that it is vulnerable to physically-realizable adversarial patches, posing risks in its real-world applications. To address this problem, we are the first to investigate defense strategies against adversarial patch attacks on infrared detection, especially human detection. We have devised a straightforward defense strategy, patch-based occlusion-aware detection (POD), which efficiently augments training samples with random patches and subsequently detects them. POD not only robustly detects people but also identifies adversarial patch locations. Surprisingly, while being extremely computationally efficient, POD easily generalizes to state-of-the-art adversarial patch attacks that are unseen during training. Furthermore, POD improves detection precision even in a clean (i.e., no-patch) situation due to the data augmentation effect. Evaluation demonstrated that POD is robust to adversarial patches of various shapes and sizes. The effectiveness of our baseline approach is shown to be a viable defense mechanism for real-world infrared human detection systems, paving the way for exploring future research directions. ",

In this study, we propose a novel view-fusion model named self-attention fusion network (SAF-Net) to detect MI from multi-view echocardiography recordings. The proposed framework utilizes apical 2-chamber (A2C) and apical 4-chamber (A4C) view echocardiography recordings for classification. Three reference frames are extracted from each recording of both views and deployed pre-trained deep networks to extract highly representative features. The SAF-Net model utilizes a self-attention mechanism to learn dependencies in extracted feature vectors. The proposed model is computationally efficient thanks to its compact architecture having three main parts: a feature embedding to reduce dimensionality, self-attention for view-pooling, and dense layers for the classification. Experimental evaluation is performed using the HMC-QU-TAU dataset which consists of 160 patients with A2C and A4C view echocardiography recordings. The proposed SAF-Net model achieves a high-performance level with 88.26% precision, 77.64% sensitivity, and 78.13% accuracy. The results demonstrate that the SAF-Net model achieves the most accurate MI detection over multi-view echocardiography recordings. ",

    "abstract": "Given a new $6DoF$ camera pose in an indoor environment, we study the challenging problem of predicting the view from that pose based on a set of reference RGBD views. Existing explicit or implicit 3D geometry construction methods are computationally expensive while those based on learning have predominantly focused on isolated views of object categories with regular geometric structure. Differing from the traditional \\textit{render-inpaint} approach to new view synthesis in the real indoor environment, we propose a conditional generative adversarial neural network (P2I-NET) to directly predict the new view from the given pose. P2I-NET learns the conditional distribution of the images of the environment for establishing the correspondence between the camera pose and its view of the environment, and achieves this through a number of innovative designs in its architecture and training lost function. Two auxiliary discriminator constraints are introduced for enforcing the consistency between the pose of the generated image and that of the corresponding real world image in both the latent feature space and the real world pose space. Additionally a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced to further reinforce this consistency in the pixel space. We have performed extensive new view synthesis experiments on real indoor datasets. Results show that P2I-NET has superior performance against a number of NeRF based strong baseline models. In particular, we show that P2I-NET is 40 to 100 times faster than these competitor techniques while synthesising similar quality images. Furthermore, we contribute a new publicly available indoor environment dataset containing 22 high resolution RGBD videos where each frame also has accurate camera pose parameters. ",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification is crucial for the deployment of image restoration models in safety-critical domains, like autonomous driving and biological imaging. To date, methods for uncertainty visualization have mainly focused on per-pixel estimates. However, a heatmap of per-pixel variances is typically of little practical use, as it does not capture the strong correlations between pixels. A more natural measure of uncertainty corresponds to the variances along the principal components (PCs) of the posterior distribution. Theoretically, the PCs can be computed by applying PCA on samples generated from a conditional generative model for the input image. However, this requires generating a very large number of samples at test time, which is painfully slow with the current state-of-the-art (diffusion) models. In this work, we present a method for predicting the PCs of the posterior distribution for any input image, in a single forward pass of a neural network. Our method can either wrap around a pre-trained model that was trained to minimize the mean square error (MSE), or can be trained from scratch to output both a predicted image and the posterior PCs. We showcase our method on multiple inverse problems in imaging, including denoising, inpainting, super-resolution, and biological image-to-image translation. Our method reliably conveys instance-adaptive uncertainty directions, achieving uncertainty quantification comparable with posterior samplers while being orders of magnitude faster.

In this paper, our focus is on generating highly accurate and low-latency SNNs specifically for object detection. Firstly, we systematically derive the conversion between SNNs and ANNs and analyze how to improve the consistency between them: improving the spike firing rate and reducing the quantization error. Then we propose a structural replacement, quantization of ANN activation and residual fix to allevicate the disparity. We evaluate our method on challenging dataset MS COCO, PASCAL VOC and our spike dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and lower latency compared to previous work Spiking-YOLO.

    "abstract": "Multi-label aspect category detection is intended to detect multiple aspect categories occurring in a given sentence. Since aspect category detection often suffers from limited datasets and data sparsity, the prototypical network with attention mechanisms has been applied for few-shot aspect category detection. Nevertheless, most of the prototypical networks used so far calculate the prototypes by taking the mean value of all the instances in the support set. This seems to ignore the variations between instances in multi-label aspect category detection. Also, several related works utilize label text information to enhance the attention mechanism. However, the label text information is often short and limited, and not specific enough to discern categories. In this paper, we first introduce support set attention along with the augmented label information to mitigate the noise at word-level for each support set instance. Moreover, we use a sentence-level attention mechanism that gives different weights to each instance in the support set in order to compute prototypes by weighted averaging. Finally, the calculated prototypes are further used in conjunction with query instances to compute query attention and thereby eliminate noises from the query set. Experimental results on the Yelp dataset show that our proposed method is useful and outperforms all baselines in four different scenarios. ",

Based on our empirical study, we propose a novel Knowledge-driven Prompt Chaining-based code generation approach, name KPC, which decomposes code generation into an AI chain with iterative check-rewrite steps and chains fine-grained knowledge-driven prompts to assist LLMs in considering exception-handling specifications. We evaluate our KPC-based approach with 3,079 code generation tasks extracted from the Java official API documentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the KPC-based approach has considerable potential to ameliorate the quality of code generated by LLMs. It achieves this through proficiently managing exceptions and obtaining remarkable enhancements of 109.86% and 578.57% with static evaluation methods, as well as a reduction of 18 runtime bugs in the sampled dataset with dynamic validation.

    "title": "Illuminating Router Vendor Diversity Within Providers and Along Network  Paths",
    "abstract": "The Internet architecture has facilitated a multi-party, distributed, and heterogeneous physical infrastructure where routers from different vendors connect and inter-operate via IP. Such vendor heterogeneity can have important security and policy implications. For example, a security vulnerability may be specific to a particular vendor and implementation, and thus will have a disproportionate impact on particular networks and paths if exploited. From a policy perspective, governments are now explicitly banning particular vendors, or have threatened to do so. Despite these critical issues, the composition of router vendors across the Internet remains largely opaque. Remotely identifying router vendors is challenging due to their strict security posture, indistinguishability due to code sharing across vendors, and noise due to vendor mergers. We make progress in overcoming these challenges by developing LFP, a tool that improves the coverage, accuracy, and efficiency of router fingerprinting as compared to the current state-of-the-art. We leverage LFP to characterize the degree of router vendor homogeneity within networks and the regional distribution of vendors. We then take a path-centric view and apply LFP to better understand the potential for correlated failures and fate-sharing. Finally, we perform a case study on inter- and intra-United States data paths to explore the feasibility to make vendor-based routing policy decisions, i.e., whether it is possible to avoid a particular vendor given the current infrastructure.

In this paper, we propose a new graph representation of the event data and couple it with a Graph Transformer to perform accurate neuromorphic classification.

    "abstract": "Residual neural networks are widely used in computer vision tasks. They enable the construction of deeper and more accurate models by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. Their main innovation is the residual block which allows the output of one layer to bypass one or more intermediate layers and be added to the output of a later layer. Their complex structure and the buffering required by the residual block make them difficult to implement on resource-constrained platforms. We present a novel design flow for implementing deep learning models for field programmable gate arrays optimized for ResNets, using a strategy to reduce their buffering overhead to obtain a resource-efficient implementation of the residual layer. Our high-level synthesis (HLS)-based flow encompasses a thorough set of design principles and optimization strategies, exploiting in novel ways standard techniques such as temporal reuse and loop merging to efficiently map ResNet models, and potentially other skip connection-based NN architectures, into FPGA. The models are quantized to 8-bit integers for both weights and activations, 16-bit for biases, and 32-bit for accumulations. The experimental results are obtained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using ResNet8 and ResNet20 implemented with Xilinx FPGAs using HLS on the Ultra96-V2 and Kria KV260 boards. Compared to the state-of-the-art on the Kria KV260 board, our ResNet20 implementation achieves 2.88X speedup with 0.5% higher accuracy of 91.3%, while ResNet8 accuracy improves by 2.8% to 88.7%. The throughputs of ResNet8 and ResNet20 are 12971 FPS and 3254 FPS on the Ultra96 board, and 30153 FPS and 7601 FPS on the Kria KV26, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a novel and effective \\textit{graph neural network (GNN)-based path embedding framework} (GNN-PE), which allows efficient exact subgraph matching without introducing false dismissals. Unlike traditional GNN-based graph embeddings that only produce approximate subgraph matching results, in this paper, we carefully devise GNN-based embeddings for paths, such that: if two paths (and 1-hop neighbors of vertices on them) have the subgraph relationship, their corresponding GNN-based embedding vectors will strictly follow the dominance relationship. With such a newly designed property of path dominance embeddings, we are able to propose effective pruning strategies based on path label/dominance embeddings and guarantee no false dismissals for subgraph matching. We build multidimensional indexes over path embedding vectors, and develop an efficient subgraph matching algorithm by traversing indexes over graph partitions in parallel and applying our pruning methods. We also propose a cost-model-based query plan that obtains query paths from the query graph with low query cost. Through extensive experiments, we confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GNN-PE approach for exact subgraph matching on both real and synthetic graph data. ",

However, many state-of-the-art SGGs do not scale well with the graph size. Indeed, in the generation process, all the possible edges for a fixed number of nodes must often be considered, which scales in $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, with $N$ being the number of nodes in the graph. For this reason, many state-of-the-art SGGs are not applicable to large graphs. In this paper, we present SANGEA, a sizeable synthetic graph generation framework which extends the applicability of any SGG to large graphs. By first splitting the large graph into communities, SANGEA trains one SGG per community, then links the community graphs back together to create a synthetic large graph. Our experiments show that the graphs generated by SANGEA have high similarity to the original graph, in terms of both topology and node feature distribution. Additionally, these generated graphs achieve high utility on downstream tasks such as link prediction. Finally, we provide a privacy assessment of the generated graphs to show that, even though they have excellent utility, they also achieve reasonable privacy scores. ",

By shifting computation to the network edge, FL offers robust and responsive edge-AI solutions and enhance privacy-preservation. However, deploying deep FL models within edge environments is often hindered by communication bottlenecks, data heterogeneity, and memory limitations. To address these challenges jointly, we introduce FeDEQ, a pioneering FL framework that effectively employs deep equilibrium learning and consensus optimization to exploit a compact shared data representation across edge nodes, allowing the derivation of personalized models specific to each node. We delve into a unique model structure composed of an equilibrium layer followed by traditional neural network layers. Here, the equilibrium layer functions as a global feature representation that edge nodes can adapt to personalize their local layers. Capitalizing on FeDEQ's compactness and representation power, we present a novel distributed algorithm rooted in the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) consensus optimization and theoretically establish its convergence for smooth objectives. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that FeDEQ achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art personalized methods while employing models of up to 4 times smaller in communication size and 1.5 times lower memory footprint during training.

To validate the effectiveness and potential of this perspective, we propose a pilot method that leverages the kinematic features of the skeleton pose, with a specific focus on the walking stride, skeleton displacement at feet level, and neck level. Following this, the method employs a normalizing flow model to estimate density and detect anomalies based on the estimated density.

However, learning semantic 3D scene graphs in a fully supervised manner is inherently difficult as it requires not only object-level annotations but also relationship labels. While pre-training approaches have helped to boost the performance of many methods in various fields, pre-training for 3D scene graph prediction has received little attention. Furthermore, we find in this paper that classical contrastive point cloud-based pre-training approaches are ineffective for 3D scene graph learning. To this end, we present SGRec3D, a novel self-supervised pre-training method for 3D scene graph prediction. We propose to reconstruct the 3D input scene from a graph bottleneck as a pretext task. Pre-training SGRec3D does not require object relationship labels, making it possible to exploit large-scale 3D scene understanding datasets, which were off-limits for 3D scene graph learning before. Our experiments demonstrate that in contrast to recent point cloud-based pre-training approaches, our proposed pre-training improves the 3D scene graph prediction considerably, which results in SOTA performance, outperforming other 3D scene graph models by +10% on object prediction and +4% on relationship prediction. Additionally, we show that only using a small subset of 10% labeled data during fine-tuning is sufficient to outperform the same model without pre-training. ",

This reduced dimensional state representation is then used as states for training a robust RL-based gait policy, eliminating the need for heuristic state selections or the use of template models for gait planning. The results demonstrate that the learned latent variables are disentangled and directly correspond to different gaits or speeds, such as moving forward, backward, or walking in place.

    "abstract": "In the domain of semi-supervised learning, the current approaches insufficiently exploit the potential of considering inter-instance relationships among (un)labeled data. In this work, we address this limitation by providing an approach for inferring latent graphs that capture the intrinsic data relationships. By leveraging graph-based representations, our approach facilitates the seamless propagation of information throughout the graph, enabling the effective incorporation of global and local knowledge. Through evaluations on biomedical tabular datasets, we compare the capabilities of our approach to other contemporary methods. Our work demonstrates the significance of inter-instance relationship discovery as practical means for constructing robust latent graphs to enhance semi-supervised learning techniques. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on three biomedical datasets. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a method for adapting neural networks to distribution shifts at test-time. In contrast to training-time robustness mechanisms that attempt to anticipate and counter the shift, we create a closed-loop system and make use of a test-time feedback signal to adapt a network on the fly. We show that this loop can be effectively implemented using a learning-based function, which realizes an amortized optimizer for the network. This leads to an adaptation method, named Rapid Network Adaptation (RNA), that is notably more flexible and orders of magnitude faster than the baselines. Through a broad set of experiments using various adaptation signals and target tasks, we study the efficiency and flexibility of this method. We perform the evaluations using various datasets (Taskonomy, Replica, ScanNet, Hypersim, COCO, ImageNet), tasks (depth, optical flow, semantic segmentation, classification), and distribution shifts (Cross-datasets, 2D and 3D Common Corruptions) with promising results. We end with a discussion on general formulations for handling distribution shifts and our observations from comparing with similar approaches from other domains. ",

Together with scaling up the real-world deployment of autonomous vehicles, it is of critical importance to automatically find simulation scenarios where the driving policies will fail. We propose a method that efficiently generates adversarial simulation scenarios for autonomous driving by solving an optimal control problem that aims to maximally perturb the policy from its nominal trajectory. Given an image-based driving policy, we show that we can inject new objects in a neural rendering representation of the deployment scene, and optimize their texture in order to generate adversarial sensor inputs to the policy. We demonstrate that adversarial scenarios discovered purely in the neural renderer (surrogate scene) can often be successfully transferred to the deployment scene, without further optimization. We demonstrate this transfer occurs both in simulated and real environments, provided the learned surrogate scene is sufficiently close to the deployment scene. ",

Existing template-free machine learning-based models typically utilize transformer structures and represent molecules as ID sequences. However, these methods often face challenges in fully leveraging the extensive topological information of the molecule and aligning atoms between the production and reactants, leading to results that are not as competitive as those of semi-template models. Our proposed method, Node-Aligned Graph-to-Graph (NAG2G), also serves as a transformer-based template-free model but utilizes 2D molecular graphs and 3D conformation information. Furthermore, our approach simplifies the incorporation of production-reactant atom mapping alignment by leveraging node alignment to determine a specific order for node generation and generating molecular graphs in an auto-regressive manner node-by-node. This method ensures that the node generation order coincides with the node order in the input graph, overcoming the difficulty of determining a specific node generation order in an auto-regressive manner. Our extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that the proposed NAG2G can outperform the previous state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics. ",

    "abstract": "In computer vision, 2D convolution is arguably the most important operation performed by a ConvNet. Unsurprisingly, it has been the focus of intense software and hardware optimization and enjoys highly efficient implementations. In this work, we ask an intriguing question: can we make a ConvNet work without 2D convolutions? Surprisingly, we find that the answer is yes -- we show that a ConvNet consisting entirely of 1D convolutions can do just as well as 2D on ImageNet classification. Specifically, we find that one key ingredient to a high-performing 1D ConvNet is oriented 1D kernels: 1D kernels that are oriented not just horizontally or vertically, but also at other angles. Our experiments show that oriented 1D convolutions can not only replace 2D convolutions but also augment existing architectures with large kernels, leading to improved accuracy with minimal FLOPs increase. A key contribution of this work is a highly-optimized custom CUDA implementation of oriented 1D kernels, specialized to the depthwise convolution setting. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our custom CUDA implementation almost perfectly realizes the theoretical advantage of 1D convolution: it is faster than a native horizontal convolution for any arbitrary angle.

The data encompassed a wide array of clinical parameters, such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels, patient demographics, comorbidities, and treatment histories. Rigorous data preprocessing and feature selection processes were implemented to optimize the dataset for machine learning analysis. Various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and gradient boosting, were deployed to construct predictive models. These models exhibited promising results, showcasing high accuracy and precision in the identification of patients with persistent inflammation. The findings of this study underscore the potential of machine learning in automating the detection of persistent inflammatory biomarkers in post-COVID-19 patients.

LLMs might \"lie\", for example, when instructed to output misinformation. Here, we develop a simple lie detector that requires neither access to the LLM's activations (black-box) nor ground-truth knowledge of the fact in question. The detector works by asking a predefined set of unrelated follow-up questions after a suspected lie, and feeding the LLM's yes/no answers into a logistic regression classifier. Despite its simplicity, this lie detector is highly accurate and surprisingly general. When trained on examples from a single setting -- prompting GPT-3.5 to lie about factual questions -- the detector generalises out-of-distribution to (1) other LLM architectures, (2) LLMs fine-tuned to lie, (3) sycophantic lies, and (4) lies emerging in real-life scenarios such as sales. These results indicate that LLMs have distinctive lie-related behavioural patterns, consistent across architectures and contexts, which could enable general-purpose lie detection. ",

However, these feature grids come at the expense of large memory consumption which can be a bottleneck for storage and streaming applications. In this work, we propose SHACIRA, a simple yet effective task-agnostic framework for compressing such feature grids with no additional post-hoc pruning/quantization stages. We reparameterize feature grids with quantized latent weights and apply entropy regularization in the latent space to achieve high levels of compression across various domains.

In this paper, we delve into the neural scaling behaviors of MRL from a data-centric viewpoint, examining four key dimensions: (1) data modalities, (2) dataset splitting, (3) the role of pre-training, and (4) model capacity. Our empirical studies confirm a consistent power-law relationship between data volume and MRL performance across these dimensions. Additionally, through detailed analysis, we identify potential avenues for improving learning efficiency. To challenge these scaling laws, we adapt seven popular data pruning strategies to molecular data and benchmark their performance.

The complex networks that support these services do not always guarantee an acceptable quality on the end-user side. In this paper, the impact of temporal interruptions on the reproduction of audio streaming and the users preference in relation to audio contents are studied. In order to determine the key parameters in the audio streaming service, subjective tests were conducted, and their results show that users Quality-of-Experience (QoE) is highly correlated with the following application parameters, the number of temporal interruptions or stalls, its frequency and length, and the temporal location in which they occur. However, most important, experimental results demonstrated that users preference for audio content plays an important role in users QoE. Thus, a Preference Factor (PF) function is defined and considered in the formulation of the proposed metric named Audio streaming Quality Metric (AsQM). Considering that multimedia service providers are based on web servers, a framework to obtain user information is proposed. Furthermore, results show that the AsQM implemented in the audio player of an end users device presents a low impact on energy, processing and memory consumption. ",

Elastic motions were excited by hammer impacts at multiple points and received by an accelerometer at a fixed point. Reciprocity in elastodynamics is only valid under certain conditions. Its validity under given experimental conditions was derived from the elastodynamic reciprocity theorem. Based on this, the dynamic motion of the structural component was obtained for fixed-point excitation from measurements performed using multipoint excitations. In the visualized eigenmodes, significant additional deformation was observed at the wall thinning inserted as an artificial defect. To prevent the dependence of defect detection on its position within the mode shape, another approach was proposed based on the extraction of guided wave modes immediately after impact excitation.

Naturally, the potential flood of generated content raises the need for synthetic speech detection and watermarking. Recently, considerable research effort in synthetic speech detection has been related to the Automatic Speaker Verification and Spoofing Countermeasure Challenge (ASVspoof), which focuses on passive countermeasures. This paper takes a complementary view to generated speech detection: a synthesis system should make an active effort to watermark the generated speech in a way that aids detection by another machine, but remains transparent to a human listener. We propose a collaborative training scheme for synthetic speech watermarking and show that a HiFi-GAN neural vocoder collaborating with the ASVspoof 2021 baseline countermeasure models consistently improves detection performance over conventional classifier training. Furthermore, we demonstrate how collaborative training can be paired with augmentation strategies for added robustness against noise and time-stretching. Finally, listening tests demonstrate that collaborative training has little adverse effect on perceptual quality of vocoded speech. ",

Methods: We propose VMI-Net for conversion of SECT to 70, 120, and 200 keV VMIs. In addition, EAN-Net and RED-Net were also developed to convert SECT to EAN and RED. We trained and validated our model using 67 patients collected between 2019 and 2020. SECT images with 120 kVp acquired by the DECT (IQon spectral CT, Philips) were used as input, while the VMIs, EAN, and RED acquired by the same device were used as target. The performance of the DL framework was evaluated by absolute difference (AD) and relative difference (RD). Results: The VMI-Net converted 120 kVp SECT to the VMIs with AD of 9.02 Hounsfield Unit, and RD of 0.41% compared to the ground truth VMIs. The ADs of the converted EAN and RED were 0.29 and 0.96, respectively, while the RDs were 1.99% and 0.50% for the converted EAN and RED, respectively. Conclusions: SECT images were directly converted to the three parametric maps of DECT (i.e., VMIs, EAN, and RED). By using this model, one can generate the parametric information from SECT images without DECT device. Our model can help investigate the parametric information from SECT retrospectively. Advances in knowledge: Deep learning framework enables converting SECT to various high-quality parametric maps of DECT. ",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a pipeline that incorporates a novel style transfer model and a simultaneous super-resolution and segmentation model. The proposed pipeline aims to enhance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images by translating them into the late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) domain, which offers a larger amount of data with high-resolution and distinct highlighting of myocardium infarction (MI) areas. Subsequently, the segmentation task is performed on the LGE style image. An end-to-end super-resolution segmentation model is introduced to generate high-resolution mask from low-resolution LGE style DTI image. Further, to enhance the performance of the model, a multi-task self-supervised learning strategy is employed to pre-train the super-resolution segmentation model, allowing it to acquire more representative knowledge and improve its segmentation performance after fine-tuning. https: github.com/wlc2424762917/Med_Img ",

    "title": "Exciton-Polariton Condensates: A Fourier Neural Operator Approach",
    "abstract": "Advancements in semiconductor fabrication over the past decade have catalyzed extensive research into all-optical devices driven by exciton-polariton condensates. Preliminary validations of such devices, including transistors, have shown encouraging results even under ambient conditions. A significant challenge still remains for large scale application however: the lack of a robust solver that can be used to simulate complex nonlinear systems which require an extended period of time to stabilize. Addressing this need, we propose the application of a machine-learning-based Fourier Neural Operator approach to find the solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equations coupled with extra exciton rate equations. This work marks the first direct application of Neural Operators to an exciton-polariton condensate system. Our findings show that the proposed method can predict final-state solutions to a high degree of accuracy almost 1000 times faster than CUDA-based GPU solvers. Moreover, this paves the way for potential all-optical chip design workflows by integrating experimental data. ",

    "abstract": "With translation equivariance, convolution neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in retinal vessel segmentation. However, some other symmetries of the vascular morphology are not characterized by CNNs, such as rotation and scale symmetries. To embed more equivariance into CNNs and achieve the accuracy requirement for retinal vessel segmentation, we construct a novel convolution operator (FRS-Conv), which is Fourier parameterized and equivariant to rotation and scaling. Specifically, we first adopt a new parameterization scheme, which enables convolutional filters to arbitrarily perform transformations with high accuracy. Secondly, we derive the formulations for the rotation and scale equivariant convolution mapping. Finally, we construct FRS-Conv following the proposed formulations and replace the traditional convolution filters in U-Net and Iter-Net with FRS-Conv (FRS-Nets). We faithfully reproduce all compared methods and conduct comprehensive experiments on three public datasets under both in-dataset and cross-dataset settings. With merely 13.9% parameters of corresponding baselines, FRS-Nets have achieved state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperform all compared methods. It demonstrates the remarkable accuracy, generalization, and clinical application potential of FRS-Nets. ",

We simulate the dynamics of a complex quantum many-body system -- specifically, the kicked Ising experiment considered recently by IBM in Nature 618, p. 500-505 (2023) -- using graph-based Projected Entangled Pair States (gPEPS), which was proposed by some of us in PRB 99, 195105 (2019). Our results show that simple tensor updates are already sufficient to achieve very large unprecedented accuracy with remarkably low computational resources for this model. Apart from simulating the original experiment for 127 qubits, we also extend our results to 433 and 1121 qubits, thus setting a benchmark for the newest IBM quantum machines. We also report accurate simulations for infinitely-many qubits. Our results show that gPEPS are a natural tool to efficiently simulate quantum computers with an underlying lattice-based qubit connectivity, such as all quantum processors based on superconducting qubits.

    "abstract": "Treatment effect heterogeneity (TEH), or variability in treatment effect for different subgroups within a population, is of significant interest in clinical trial analysis. Causal forests (Wager and Athey, 2018) is a highly popular method for this problem, but like many other methods for detecting TEH, its criterion for separating subgroups focuses on differences in absolute risk. This can dilute statistical power by masking nuance in the relative risk, which is often a more appropriate quantity of clinical interest. In this work, we propose and implement a methodology for modifying causal forests to target relative risk using a novel node-splitting procedure based on generalized linear model (GLM) comparison. We present results on simulated and real-world data that suggest relative risk causal forests can capture otherwise unobserved sources of heterogeneity. ",
