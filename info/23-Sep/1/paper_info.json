    "abstract": "Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) mainly has two scenarios: classification of the discrete labels and regression of the continuously tagged labels. Although many algorithms were proposed for classification tasks, there are only a few methods for regression tasks. For emotion regression, the label is continuous in time. A natural method is to learn the temporal dynamic patterns. In previous studies, long short-term memory (LSTM) and temporal convolutional neural networks (TCN) were utilized to learn the temporal contextual information from feature vectors of EEG. However, the spatial patterns of EEG were not effectively extracted. To enable the spatial learning ability of TCN towards better regression and classification performances, we propose a novel unified model, named MASA-TCN, for EEG emotion regression and classification tasks. The space-aware temporal layer enables TCN to additionally learn from spatial relations among EEG electrodes. Besides, a novel multi-anchor block with attentive fusion is proposed to learn dynamic temporal dependencies. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show MASA-TCN achieves higher results than the state-of-the-art methods for both EEG emotion regression and classification tasks.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of active mapping with a continually-learned neural scene representation, namely Active Neural Mapping. The key lies in actively finding the target space to be explored with efficient agent movement, thus minimizing the map uncertainty on-the-fly within a previously unseen environment. In this paper, we examine the weight space of the continually-learned neural field, and show empirically that the neural variability, the prediction robustness against random weight perturbation, can be directly utilized to measure the instant uncertainty of the neural map. Together with the continuous geometric information inherited in the neural map, the agent can be guided to find a traversable path to gradually gain knowledge of the environment. We present for the first time an active mapping system with a coordinate-based implicit neural representation for online scene reconstruction. Experiments in the visually-realistic Gibson and Matterport3D environment demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of agent selection in causal strategic learning under multiple decision makers and address two key challenges that come with it. Firstly, while much of prior work focuses on studying a fixed pool of agents that remains static regardless of their evaluations, we consider the impact of selection procedure by which agents are not only evaluated, but also selected. When each decision maker unilaterally selects agents by maximising their own utility, we show that the optimal selection rule is a trade-off between selecting the best agents and providing incentives to maximise the agents' improvement. Furthermore, this optimal selection rule relies on incorrect predictions of agents' outcomes. Hence, we study the conditions under which a decision maker's optimal selection rule will not lead to deterioration of agents' outcome nor cause unjust reduction in agents' selection chance. To that end, we provide an analytical form of the optimal selection rule and a mechanism to retrieve the causal parameters from observational data, under certain assumptions on agents' behaviour. Secondly, when there are multiple decision makers, the interference between selection rules introduces another source of biases in estimating the underlying causal parameters. To address this problem, we provide a cooperative protocol which all decision makers must collectively adopt to recover the true causal parameters. Lastly, we complement our theoretical results with simulation studies. Our results highlight not only the importance of causal modeling as a strategy to mitigate the effect of gaming, as suggested by previous work, but also the need of a benevolent regulator to enable it.

However, the classification of anomalies detected on network Key Performance Indicators (KPI) has received less attention, resulting in a lack of information about anomaly characteristics and classification processes. To address this gap, this paper proposes a modular anomaly classification framework. The framework assumes separate entities for the anomaly classifier and the detector, allowing for a distinct treatment of anomaly detection and classification tasks on time series. The objectives of this study are (1) to develop a time series simulator that generates synthetic time series resembling real-world network KPI behavior, (2) to build a detection model to identify anomalies in the time series, (3) to build classification models that accurately categorize detected anomalies into predefined classes (4) to evaluate the classification framework performance on simulated and real-world network KPI time series. This study has demonstrated the good performance of the anomaly classification models trained on simulated anomalies when applied to real-world network time series data. ",

    "abstract": "We present a framework for the multiscale modeling of finite strain magneto-elasticity based on physics-augmented neural networks (NNs). By using a set of problem specific invariants as input, an energy functional as the output and by adding several non-trainable expressions to the overall total energy density functional, the model fulfills multiple physical principles by construction, e.g., thermodynamic consistency and material symmetry. Three NN-based models with varying requirements in terms of an extended polyconvexity condition of the magneto-elastic potential are presented. First, polyconvexity, which is a global concept, is enforced via input convex neural networks (ICNNs). Afterwards, we formulate a relaxed local version of the polyconvexity and fulfill it in a weak sense by adding a tailored loss term. As an alternative, a loss term to enforce the weaker requirement of strong ellipticity locally is proposed, which can be favorable to obtain a better trade-off between compatibility with data and physical constraints. Databases for training of the models are generated via computational homogenization for both compressible and quasi-incompressible magneto-active polymers (MAPs). Thereby, to reduce the computational cost, 2D statistical volume elements and an invariant-based sampling technique for the pre-selection of relevant states are used. All models are calibrated by using the database, whereby interpolation and extrapolation are considered separately. Furthermore, the performance of the NN models is compared to a conventional model from the literature. The numerical study suggests that the proposed physics-augmented NN approach is advantageous over the conventional model for MAPs. Thereby, the two more flexible NN models in combination with the weakly enforced local polyconvexity lead to good results, whereas the model based only on ICNNs has proven to be too restrictive. ",

Consisting of a discriminative network and a generative network engaged in a Minimax game, GANs have revolutionized the field of generative modeling. In February 2018, GAN secured the leading spot on the ``Top Ten Global Breakthrough Technologies List'' issued by the Massachusetts Science and Technology Review. Over the years, numerous advancements have been proposed, leading to a rich array of GAN variants, such as conditional GAN, Wasserstein GAN, CycleGAN, and StyleGAN, among many others. This survey aims to provide a general overview of GANs, summarizing the latent architecture, validation metrics, and application areas of the most widely recognized variants. We also delve into recent theoretical developments, exploring the profound connection between the adversarial principle underlying GAN and Jensen-Shannon divergence, while discussing the optimality characteristics of the GAN framework. The efficiency of GAN variants and their model architectures will be evaluated along with training obstacles as well as training solutions. In addition, a detailed discussion will be provided, examining the integration of GANs with newly developed deep learning frameworks such as Transformers, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Large Language models, and Diffusion models.

In this paper, we propose Distributionally Robust Safe Corridor Constraints (DRSCCs) to consider the uncertainty of the safe corridor. Then, we integrate DRSCCs into the trajectory optimization framework using Bernstein basis polynomials. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that the trajectory optimization problem incorporating DRSCCs is equivalent to a computationally efficient, convex quadratic program.

The existing community detection methods in attributed networks mostly focus on only using network structure, while the methods of integrating node attributes is mainly for the traditional community structures, and cannot detect multipartite structures and mixture structures in network. In addition, the model-based community detection methods currently proposed for attributed networks do not fully consider unique topology information of nodes, such as betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient. Therefore, a stochastic block model that integrates betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient of nodes for community detection in attributed networks, named BCSBM, is proposed in this paper. Different from other generative models for attributed networks, the generation process of links and attributes in BCSBM model follows the Poisson distribution, and the probability between community is considered based on the stochastic block model. Moreover, the betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient of nodes are introduced into the process of links and attributes generation. Finally, the expectation maximization algorithm is employed to estimate the parameters of the BCSBM model, and the node-community memberships is obtained through the hard division process, so the community detection is completed. By experimenting on six real-work networks containing different network structures, and comparing with the community detection results of five algorithms, the experimental results show that the BCSBM model not only inherits the advantages of the stochastic block model and can detect various network structures, but also has good data fitting ability due to introducing the betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient of nodes. Overall, the performance of this model is superior to other five compared algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of blockchain has led to more and more funding pouring into the cryptocurrency market, which also attracted cybercriminals' interest in recent years. The Ponzi scheme, an old-fashioned fraud, is now popular on the blockchain, causing considerable financial losses to many crypto-investors. A few Ponzi detection methods have been proposed in the literature, most of which detect a Ponzi scheme based on its smart contract source code or opcode. The contract-code-based approach, while achieving very high accuracy, is not robust: first, the source codes of a majority of contracts on Ethereum are not available, and second, a Ponzi developer can fool a contract-code-based detection model by obfuscating the opcode or inventing a new profit distribution logic that cannot be detected (since these models were trained on existing Ponzi logics only). A transaction-based approach could improve the robustness of detection because transactions, unlike smart contracts, are harder to be manipulated. However, the current transaction-based detection models achieve fairly low accuracy. We address this gap in the literature by developing new detection models that rely only on the transactions, hence guaranteeing the robustness, and moreover, achieve considerably higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score than existing transaction-based models. This is made possible thanks to the introduction of novel time-dependent features that capture Ponzi behaviours characteristics derived from our comprehensive data analyses on Ponzi and non-Ponzi data from the XBlock-ETH repository ",

    "abstract": "Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a promising technique to enable versatile applications for future wireless communications.To realize the huge potential performance gain, accurate channel state information is a fundamental technical prerequisite. In conventional massive MIMO, the channel is often modeled by the far-field planar-wavefront with rich sparsity in the angular domain that facilitates the design of low-complexity channel estimation. However, this sparsity is not conspicuous in XL-MIMO systems due to the non-negligible near-field spherical-wavefront. To address the inherent performance loss of the angular-domain channel estimation schemes, we first propose the polar-domain multiple residual dense network (P-MRDN) for XL-MIMO systems based on the polar-domain sparsity of the near-field channel by improving the existing MRDN scheme. Furthermore, a polar-domain multi-scale residual dense network (P-MSRDN) is designed to improve the channel estimation accuracy. Finally, simulation results reveal the superior performance of the proposed schemes compared with existing benchmark schemes and the minimal influence of the channel sparsity on the proposed schemes.

Some embedding methods aim to capture global structures, while others attempt to preserve local neighborhoods. Few methods attempt to do both, and it is not always possible to capture well both local and global information in two dimensions, which is where most graph drawing live. The choice of using a local or a global embedding for visualization depends not only on the task but also on the structure of the underlying data, which may not be known in advance. For a given graph, LGS aims to find a good balance between the local and global structure to preserve. We evaluate the performance of LGS with synthetic and real-world datasets and our results indicate that it is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods, using established quality metrics such as stress and neighborhood preservation. We introduce a novel quality metric, cluster distance preservation, to assess intermediate structure capture. All source-code, datasets, experiments and analysis are available online. ",

A graph convolution network is further constructed to fuse the character features and landmark features, and then performs semantic reasoning to enhance the discrimination for different characters.

    "abstract": "The electronic design automation of analog circuits has been a longstanding challenge in the integrated circuit field due to the huge design space and complex design trade-offs among circuit specifications. In the past decades, intensive research efforts have mostly been paid to automate the transistor sizing with a given circuit topology. By recognizing the graph nature of circuits, this paper presents a Circuit Graph Neural Network (CktGNN) that simultaneously automates the circuit topology generation and device sizing based on the encoder-dependent optimization subroutines. Particularly, CktGNN encodes circuit graphs using a two-level GNN framework (of nested GNN) where circuits are represented as combinations of subgraphs in a known subgraph basis. In this way, it significantly improves design efficiency by reducing the number of subgraphs to perform message passing. Nonetheless, another critical roadblock to advancing learning-assisted circuit design automation is a lack of public benchmarks to perform canonical assessment and reproducible research. To tackle the challenge, we introduce Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB), an open-sourced dataset that contains $10$K distinct operational amplifiers with carefully-extracted circuit specifications. OCB is also equipped with communicative circuit generation and evaluation capabilities such that it can help to generalize CktGNN to design various analog circuits by producing corresponding datasets. Experiments on OCB show the extraordinary advantages of CktGNN through representation-based optimization frameworks over other recent powerful GNN baselines and human experts' manual designs. Our work paves the way toward a learning-based open-sourced design automation for analog circuits. Our source code is available at \\url{https://github.com/zehao-dong/CktGNN}. ",

Secondly, due to the limitation of built-in computation resources, cameras perform encoding and transmitting frames to the edge. The edge executes neural enhancement to process low contrast, detail loss, and color distortion on low-light videos before inference. Finally, an adaptive controller is designed at the edge to select quantization parameters and scales of neural enhancement networks, aiming to improve the inference accuracy and meet the latency requirements.

    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial issue in recommendation systems. There has been an emergence of various public CTR datasets. However, existing datasets primarily suffer from the following limitations. Firstly, users generally click different types of items from multiple scenarios, and modeling from multiple scenarios can provide a more comprehensive understanding of users. Existing datasets only include data for the same type of items from a single scenario. Secondly, multi-modal features are essential in multi-scenario prediction as they address the issue of inconsistent ID encoding between different scenarios. The existing datasets are based on ID features and lack multi-modal features. Third, a large-scale dataset can provide a more reliable evaluation of models, fully reflecting the performance differences between models. The scale of existing datasets is around 100 million, which is relatively small compared to the real-world CTR prediction. To address these limitations, we propose AntM$^{2}$C, a Multi-Scenario Multi-Modal CTR dataset based on industrial data from Alipay. Specifically, AntM$^{2}$C provides the following advantages: 1) It covers CTR data of 5 different types of items, providing insights into the preferences of users for different items, including advertisements, vouchers, mini-programs, contents, and videos. 2) Apart from ID-based features, AntM$^{2}$C also provides 2 multi-modal features, raw text and image features, which can effectively establish connections between items with different IDs. 3) AntM$^{2}$C provides 1 billion CTR data with 200 features, including 200 million users and 6 million items. It is currently the largest-scale CTR dataset available. Based on AntM$^{2}$C, we construct several typical CTR tasks and provide comparisons with baseline methods.

Although adversarial training (AT) improves robustness, it degrades the standard accuracy, thus yielding the tradeoff. To mitigate this tradeoff, we propose a novel AT method called ARREST, which comprises three components: (i) adversarial finetuning (AFT), (ii) representation-guided knowledge distillation (RGKD), and (iii) noisy replay (NR). AFT trains a DNN on adversarial examples by initializing its parameters with a DNN that is standardly pretrained on clean examples. RGKD and NR respectively entail a regularization term and an algorithm to preserve latent representations of clean examples during AFT. RGKD penalizes the distance between the representations of the standardly pretrained and AFT DNNs. NR switches input adversarial examples to nonadversarial ones when the representation changes significantly during AFT. By combining these components, ARREST achieves both high standard accuracy and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ARREST mitigates the tradeoff more effectively than previous AT-based methods do. ",

DM-GNN is capable of learning informative representations for node classification that are also transferrable across networks. Firstly, a GNN encoder is constructed by dual feature extractors to separate ego-embedding learning from neighbor-embedding learning so as to jointly capture commonality and discrimination between connected nodes. Secondly, a label propagation node classifier is proposed to refine each node's label prediction by combining its own prediction and its neighbors' prediction. In addition, a label-aware propagation scheme is devised for the labeled source network to promote intra-class propagation while avoiding inter-class propagation, thus yielding label-discriminative source embeddings. Thirdly, conditional adversarial domain adaptation is performed to take the neighborhood-refined class-label information into account during adversarial domain adaptation, so that the class-conditional distributions across networks can be better matched.

While over-smoothing eliminates the differences between nodes making them indistinguishable, over-squashing refers to the inability of GNNs to propagate information over long distances, as exponentially many node states are squashed into fixed-size representations. Both phenomena share similar causes, as both are largely induced by the graph topology. To mitigate these problems in graph classification tasks, we propose CurvPool, a novel pooling method. CurvPool exploits the notion of curvature of a graph to adaptively identify structures responsible for both over-smoothing and over-squashing. By clustering nodes based on the Balanced Forman curvature, CurvPool constructs a graph with a more suitable structure, allowing deeper models and the combination of distant information. We compare it to other state-of-the-art pooling approaches and establish its competitiveness in terms of classification accuracy, computational complexity, and flexibility. CurvPool outperforms several comparable methods across all considered tasks. The most consistent results are achieved by pooling densely connected clusters using the sum aggregation, as this allows additional information about the size of each pool. ",

    "abstract": "Lidar point clouds, as a type of data with accurate distance perception, can effectively represent the motion and posture of objects in three-dimensional space. However, the sparsity and disorderliness of point clouds make it challenging to extract features directly from them. Many studies have addressed this issue by transforming point clouds into regular voxel representations. However, these methods often lead to the loss of fine-grained local feature information due to downsampling. Moreover, the sparsity of point clouds poses difficulties in efficiently aggregating features in 3D feature layers using voxel-based two-stage methods. To address these issues, this paper proposes a two-stage 3D detection framework called MS$^{2}$3D. In MS$^{2}$3D, we utilize small-sized voxels to extract fine-grained local features and large-sized voxels to capture long-range local features. Additionally, we propose a method for constructing 3D feature layers using multi-scale semantic feature points, enabling the transformation of sparse 3D feature layers into more compact representations. Furthermore, we compute the offset between feature points in the 3D feature layers and the centroid of objects, aiming to bring them as close as possible to the object's center. It significantly enhances the efficiency of feature aggregation. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluated our method on the KITTI dataset and ONCE dataset together. ",

    "abstract": "Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) extends object detection problem to a realistic and dynamic scenario, where a detection model is required to be capable of detecting both known and unknown objects and incrementally learning newly introduced knowledge. Current OWOD models, such as ORE and OW-DETR, focus on pseudo-labeling regions with high objectness scores as unknowns, whose performance relies heavily on the supervision of known objects. While they can detect the unknowns that exhibit similar features to the known objects, they suffer from a severe label bias problem that they tend to detect all regions (including unknown object regions) that are dissimilar to the known objects as part of the background. To eliminate the label bias, this paper proposes a novel approach that learns an unsupervised discriminative model to recognize true unknown objects from raw pseudo labels generated by unsupervised region proposal methods. The resulting model can be further refined by a classification-free self-training method which iteratively extends pseudo unknown objects to the unlabeled regions. Experimental results show that our method 1) significantly outperforms the prior SOTA in detecting unknown objects while maintaining competitive performance of detecting known object classes on the MS COCO dataset, and 2) achieves better generalization ability on the LVIS and Objects365 datasets.

    "abstract": "We propose augmenting the empathetic capacities of social robots by integrating non-verbal cues. Our primary contribution is the design and labeling of four types of empathetic non-verbal cues, abbreviated as SAFE: Speech, Action (gesture), Facial expression, and Emotion, in a social robot. These cues are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM). We developed an LLM-based conversational system for the robot and assessed its alignment with social cues as defined by human counselors. Preliminary results show distinct patterns in the robot's responses, such as a preference for calm and positive social emotions like 'joy' and 'lively', and frequent nodding gestures. Despite these tendencies, our approach has led to the development of a social robot capable of context-aware and more authentic interactions. Our work lays the groundwork for future studies on human-robot interactions, emphasizing the essential role of both verbal and non-verbal cues in creating social and empathetic robots. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the proliferation of malware, defenders are increasingly turning to automation and machine learning as part of the malware detection tool-chain. However, machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, requiring the testing of model and product robustness. Meanwhile, attackers also seek to automate malware generation and evasion of antivirus systems, and defenders try to gain insight into their methods. This work proposes a new algorithm that combines Malware Evasion and Model Extraction (MEME) attacks. MEME uses model-based reinforcement learning to adversarially modify Windows executable binary samples while simultaneously training a surrogate model with a high agreement with the target model to evade. To evaluate this method, we compare it with two state-of-the-art attacks in adversarial malware creation, using three well-known published models and one antivirus product as targets. Results show that MEME outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of evasion capabilities in almost all cases, producing evasive malware with an evasion rate in the range of 32-73%. It also produces surrogate models with a prediction label agreement with the respective target models between 97-99%. The surrogate could be used to fine-tune and improve the evasion rate in the future. ",

Although inter-utterance linguistic information can influence the speech interpretation of the target utterance, previous works on PSP mainly focus on utilizing intrautterance linguistic information of the current utterance only. This work proposes to use inter-utterance linguistic information to improve the performance of PSP. Multi-level contextual information, which includes both inter-utterance and intrautterance linguistic information, is extracted by a hierarchical encoder from character level, utterance level and discourse level of the input text. Then a multi-task learning (MTL) decoder predicts prosodic boundaries from multi-level contextual information. Objective evaluation results on two datasets show that our method achieves better F1 scores in predicting prosodic word (PW), prosodic phrase (PPH) and intonational phrase (IPH). It demonstrates the effectiveness of using multi-level contextual information for PSP. Subjective preference tests also indicate the naturalness of synthesized speeches are improved. ",

    "abstract": "Global sustainability requires low-carbon urban transport systems, shaped by adequate infrastructure, deployment of low-carbon transport modes and shifts in travel behavior. To adequately implement alterations in infrastructure, it's essential to grasp the location-specific cause-and-effect mechanisms that the constructed environment has on travel. Yet, current research falls short in representing causal relationships between the 6D urban form variables and travel, generalizing across different regions, and modeling urban form effects at high spatial resolution. Here, we address all three gaps by utilizing a causal discovery and an explainable machine learning framework to detect urban form effects on intra-city travel based on high-resolution mobility data of six cities across three continents. We show that both distance to city center, demographics and density indirectly affect other urban form features. By considering the causal relationships, we find that location-specific influences align across cities, yet vary in magnitude. In addition, the spread of the city and the coverage of jobs across the city are the strongest determinants of travel-related emissions, highlighting the benefits of compact development and associated benefits. Differences in urban form effects across the cities call for a more holistic definition of 6D measures. Our work is a starting point for location-specific analysis of urban form effects on mobility behavior using causal discovery approaches, which is highly relevant for city planners and municipalities across continents.

    "abstract": "Graph classification, aiming at learning the graph-level representations for effective class assignments, has received outstanding achievements, which heavily relies on high-quality datasets that have balanced class distribution. In fact, most real-world graph data naturally presents a long-tailed form, where the head classes occupy much more samples than the tail classes, it thus is essential to study the graph-level classification over long-tailed data while still remaining largely unexplored. However, most existing long-tailed learning methods in visions fail to jointly optimize the representation learning and classifier training, as well as neglect the mining of the hard-to-classify classes. Directly applying existing methods to graphs may lead to sub-optimal performance, since the model trained on graphs would be more sensitive to the long-tailed distribution due to the complex topological characteristics. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel long-tailed graph-level classification framework via Collaborative Multi-expert Learning (CoMe) to tackle the problem. To equilibrate the contributions of head and tail classes, we first develop balanced contrastive learning from the view of representation learning, and then design an individual-expert classifier training based on hard class mining. In addition, we execute gated fusion and disentangled knowledge distillation among the multiple experts to promote the collaboration in a multi-expert framework. Comprehensive experiments are performed on seven widely-used benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method CoMe over state-of-the-art baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Owing to its significant success, the prior imposed on gradient maps has consistently been a subject of great interest in the field of image processing. Total variation (TV), one of the most representative regularizers, is known for its ability to capture the sparsity of gradient maps. Nonetheless, TV and its variants often underestimate the gradient maps, leading to the weakening of edges and details whose gradients should not be zero in the original image. Recently, total deep variation (TDV) has been introduced, assuming the sparsity of feature maps, which provides a flexible regularization learned from large-scale datasets for a specific task. However, TDV requires retraining when the image or task changes, limiting its versatility. In this paper, we propose a neural gradient regularizer (NGR) that expresses the gradient map as the output of a neural network. Unlike existing methods, NGR does not rely on the sparsity assumption, thereby avoiding the underestimation of gradient maps. NGR is applicable to various image types and different image processing tasks, functioning in a zero-shot learning fashion, making it a versatile and plug-and-play regularizer. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of NGR over state-of-the-art counterparts for a range of different tasks, further validating its effectiveness and versatility. ",

    "abstract": "In 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES), the earlier approach adopts a two-stage paradigm, extracting segmentation proposals and then matching them with referring expressions. However, this conventional paradigm encounters significant challenges, most notably in terms of the generation of lackluster initial proposals and a pronounced deceleration in inference speed. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an innovative end-to-end Superpoint-Text Matching Network (3D-STMN) that is enriched by dependency-driven insights. One of the keystones of our model is the Superpoint-Text Matching (STM) mechanism. Unlike traditional methods that navigate through instance proposals, STM directly correlates linguistic indications with their respective superpoints, clusters of semantically related points. This architectural decision empowers our model to efficiently harness cross-modal semantic relationships, primarily leveraging densely annotated superpoint-text pairs, as opposed to the more sparse instance-text pairs. In pursuit of enhancing the role of text in guiding the segmentation process, we further incorporate the Dependency-Driven Interaction (DDI) module to deepen the network's semantic comprehension of referring expressions. Using the dependency trees as a beacon, this module discerns the intricate relationships between primary terms and their associated descriptors in expressions, thereby elevating both the localization and segmentation capacities of our model. Comprehensive experiments on the ScanRefer benchmark reveal that our model not only set new performance standards, registering an mIoU gain of 11.7 points but also achieve a staggering enhancement in inference speed, surpassing traditional methods by 95.7 times.

A malicious adversary selects a single vertex on which to conduct a stealthy data injection attack to maximally disrupt the local performance while remaining undetected. On the other hand, a defender selects several vertices on which to allocate defense resources against the adversary. First, the objectives of the adversary and the defender with uncertain targets are formulated in probabilistic ways, resulting in an expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks. Next, we provide a graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition under which the cost for the defender and the expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks are bounded. This condition enables the defender to restrict the admissible actions to a subset of available vertex sets. Then, we cast the problem of security allocation in a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework. Finally, the contribution of this paper is highlighted by utilizing the proposed admissible actions of the defender in the context of large-scale networks. A numerical example of a 50-vertex networked control system is presented to validate the obtained results. ",

    "abstract": "The vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks have recently threatened the trustworthiness of machine learning models in practical applications. Conventional wisdom suggests that not everyone can be an attacker since the process of designing the trigger generation algorithm often involves significant effort and extensive experimentation to ensure the attack's stealthiness and effectiveness. Alternatively, this paper shows that there exists a more severe backdoor threat: anyone can exploit an easily-accessible algorithm for silent backdoor attacks. Specifically, this attacker can employ the widely-used lossy image compression from a plethora of compression tools to effortlessly inject a trigger pattern into an image without leaving any noticeable trace; i.e., the generated triggers are natural artifacts. One does not require extensive knowledge to click on the \"convert\" or \"save as\" button while using tools for lossy image compression. Via this attack, the adversary does not need to design a trigger generator as seen in prior works and only requires poisoning the data. Empirically, the proposed attack consistently achieves 100% attack success rate in several benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, GTSRB and CelebA. More significantly, the proposed attack can still achieve almost 100% attack success rate with very small (approximately 10%) poisoning rates in the clean label setting. The generated trigger of the proposed attack using one lossy compression algorithm is also transferable across other related compression algorithms, exacerbating the severity of this backdoor threat. This work takes another crucial step toward understanding the extensive risks of backdoor attacks in practice, urging practitioners to investigate similar attacks and relevant backdoor mitigation methods.

For Masked Language Modeling (MLM), we propose a cross-distillation method to generate soft labels to enhance the robustness of model, which alleviates the problem of treating synonyms of masked words as negative samples in one-hot labels. For Image-Text Matching (ITM), we leverage the current language encoder to synthesize hard negatives based on the context of language input, encouraging the model to learn high-quality representations by increasing the difficulty of the ITM task. By leveraging the above techniques, our ViLTA can achieve better performance on various vision-language tasks.

Recently, physical attacks such as fault injection have shown worrying efficiency against the integrity and confidentiality of embedded models. We focus on embedded deep neural network models on 32-bit microcontrollers, a widespread family of hardware platforms in IoT, and the use of a standard fault injection strategy - Safe Error Attack (SEA) - to perform a model extraction attack with an adversary having a limited access to training data. Since the attack strongly depends on the input queries, we propose a black-box approach to craft a successful attack set. For a classical convolutional neural network, we successfully recover at least 90% of the most significant bits with about 1500 crafted inputs.

Students take an average of 5 years to pass these subjects. Using the DoWhy and Causal Discovery Toolbox tools, we looked to identify the underlying causes of these delays. The analysis revealed that the regulatory structure of the program and the evaluation methods play a crucial role in this delay.

    "abstract": "Partial Label Learning (PLL) is a type of weakly supervised learning where each training instance is assigned a set of candidate labels, but only one label is the ground-truth. However, this idealistic assumption may not always hold due to potential annotation inaccuracies, meaning the ground-truth may not be present in the candidate label set. This is known as Unreliable Partial Label Learning (UPLL) that introduces an additional complexity due to the inherent unreliability and ambiguity of partial labels, often resulting in a sub-optimal performance with existing methods. To address this challenge, we propose the Unreliability-Robust Representation Learning framework (URRL) that leverages unreliability-robust contrastive learning to help the model fortify against unreliable partial labels effectively. Concurrently, we propose a dual strategy that combines KNN-based candidate label set correction and consistency-regularization-based label disambiguation to refine label quality and enhance the ability of representation learning within the URRL framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art PLL methods on various datasets with diverse degrees of unreliability and ambiguity. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of our approach from the perspective of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Upon acceptance, we pledge to make the code publicly accessible. ",

    "abstract": "Web apps are built by using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While building modern web apps, it is common practice to make use of third-party libraries and frameworks, as to improve developers' productivity and code quality. Alongside these benefits, the adoption of such libraries results in the introduction of JavaScript dead code, i.e., code implementing unused functionalities. The costs for downloading and parsing dead code can negatively contribute to the loading time and resource usage of web apps. The goal of our study is two-fold. First, we present Lacuna, an approach for automatically detecting and eliminating JavaScript dead code from web apps. The proposed approach supports both static and dynamic analyses, it is extensible and can be applied to any JavaScript code base, without imposing constraints on the coding style or on the use of specific JavaScript constructs. Secondly, by leveraging Lacuna we conduct an experiment to empirically evaluate the run-time overhead of JavaScript dead code in terms of energy consumption, performance, network usage, and resource usage in the context of mobile web apps. We applied Lacuna four times on 30 mobile web apps independently developed by third-party developers, each time eliminating dead code according to a different optimization level provided by Lacuna. Afterward, each different version of the web app is executed on an Android device, while collecting measures to assess the potential run-time overhead caused by dead code. Experimental results, among others, highlight that the removal of JavaScript dead code has a positive impact on the loading time of mobile web apps, while significantly reducing the number of bytes transferred over the network.

This omission becomes pronounced in tasks such as stance detection, where the external background knowledge plays a pivotal role. Additionally, the large-scale architecture of LLMs inevitably present efficiency challenges during deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce the Ladder-of-Thought (LoT) for stance detection. Grounded in a dual-phase Cascaded Optimization framework, LoT directs the model to incorporate high-quality external knowledge, enhancing the intermediate rationales it generates. These bolstered rationales subsequently serve as the foundation for more precise predictions - akin to how a ladder facilitates reaching elevated goals. LoT achieves a balance between efficiency and accuracy, making it an adaptable and efficient framework for stance detection.

These indicators, achieved by representing feed-forward structures as component graphs through one-hot encoding, face a limitation: their inability to evaluate architecture performance across varying search spaces. In contrast, handcrafted performance indicators (zero-shot NAS), which use the same architecture with random initialization, can generalize across multiple search spaces. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel approach for zero-shot NAS using deep learning. Our method employs Fourier sum of sines encoding for convolutional kernels, enabling the construction of a computational feed-forward graph with a structure similar to the architecture under evaluation. These encodings are learnable and offer a comprehensive view of the architecture's topological information. An accompanying multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then ranks these architectures based on their encodings. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses previous methods using graph convolutional networks in terms of correlation on the NAS-Bench-201 dataset and exhibits a higher convergence rate. Moreover, our extracted feature representation trained on each NAS-Benchmark is transferable to other NAS-Benchmarks, showing promising generalizability across multiple search spaces.

We show the prevalence of invariant subspaces, demonstrating a fixed relative behavior that is unaffected by feature transformations. Our work clarifies recent observations related to convergence to a constant state and a potential over-separation of node states, as the amplification of subspaces only depends on the spectrum of the aggregation function. In linear scenarios, this leads to node representations being dominated by a low-dimensional subspace with an asymptotic convergence rate independent of the feature transformations. This causes a rank collapse of the node representations, resulting in over-smoothing when smooth vectors span this subspace, and over-correlation even when over-smoothing is avoided. Guided by our theory, we propose a sum of Kronecker products as a beneficial property that can provably prevent over-smoothing, over-correlation, and rank collapse. We empirically extend our insights to the non-linear case, demonstrating the inability of existing models to capture linearly independent features. ",

    "abstract": "A new method is proposed for human motion prediction by learning temporal and spatial dependencies. Recently, multiscale graphs have been developed to model the human body at higher abstraction levels, resulting in more stable motion prediction. Current methods however predetermine scale levels and combine spatially proximal joints to generate coarser scales based on human priors, even though movement patterns in different motion sequences vary and do not fully comply with a fixed graph of spatially connected joints. Another problem with graph convolutional methods is mode collapse, in which predicted poses converge around a mean pose with no discernible movements, particularly in long-term predictions. To tackle these issues, we propose ResChunk, an end-to-end network which explores dynamically correlated body components based on the pairwise relationships between all joints in individual sequences. ResChunk is trained to learn the residuals between target sequence chunks in an autoregressive manner to enforce the temporal connectivities between consecutive chunks. It is hence a sequence-to-sequence prediction network which considers dynamic spatio-temporal features of sequences at multiple levels. Our experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets, CMU Mocap and Human3.6M, demonstrate that our proposed method is able to effectively model the sequence information for motion prediction and outperform other techniques to set a new state-of-the-art.

However, due to the irregular traffic time series produced by intelligent intersections, the traffic forecasting task becomes much more intractable and imposes three major new challenges: 1) asynchronous spatial dependency, 2) irregular temporal dependency among traffic data, and 3) variable-length sequence to be predicted, which severely impede the performance of current traffic forecasting methods. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) to predict the traffic states of the lanes entering intelligent intersections in a future time window. Specifically, by linking lanes via a traffic diffusion graph, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to model the asynchronous spatial dependency between the time-misaligned traffic state measurements of lanes. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequence, a learnable personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time for each lane. Then we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network that learns meta-filters to derive time-aware convolution filters with transformable filter sizes for efficient temporal convolution on the irregular sequence. Furthermore, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network consisting of a state evolution unit and a semiautoregressive predictor is designed to effectively and efficiently predict variable-length traffic state sequences.

The question of which one can adapt most quickly to a domain shift is of significant importance in many fields. Specifically, consider an original distribution p that changes due to an unknown intervention, resulting in a modified distribution p*. In aligning p with p*, several factors can affect the adaptation rate, including the causal dependencies between variables in p. In real-life scenarios, however, we have to consider the fairness of the training process, and it is particularly crucial to involve a sensitive variable (bias) present between a cause and an effect variable. To explore this scenario, we examine a simple structural causal model (SCM) with a cause-bias-effect structure, where variable A acts as a sensitive variable between cause (X) and effect (Y). The two models, respectively, exhibit consistent and contrary cause-effect directions in the cause-bias-effect SCM. After conducting unknown interventions on variables within the SCM, we can simulate some kinds of domain shifts for analysis. We then compare the adaptation speeds of two models across four shift scenarios. Additionally, we prove the connection between the adaptation speeds of the two models across all interventions. ",

Specifically, with the receiver distortion at the base station (BS), conventional methods are employed to extract the amplitude feature of uplink CSI. Then, learning along the direction of the uplink wireless propagation channel, a dedicated and lightweight distortion-learning network (Dist-LeaNet) is designed to restrain the receiver distortion and calibrate the amplitude reciprocity between the uplink and downlink CSI. Subsequently, by cascading, a single hidden layer-based amplitude-prediction network (Amp-PreNet) is developed to accomplish amplitude prediction of downlink CSI based on the strong amplitude reciprocity. Simulation results show that, considering the receiver distortion in FDD systems, the proposed scheme effectively improves the amplitude prediction accuracy of downlink CSI while reducing the transmission and processing delay.

The dense nature of the prediction space has rendered existing efficient 2D-projection-based methods (e.g., bird's eye view, range view, etc.) ineffective, as they can only describe a subspace of the 3D scene. To address this, we propose a cylindrical tri-perspective view to represent point clouds effectively and comprehensively and a PointOcc model to process them efficiently. Considering the distance distribution of LiDAR point clouds, we construct the tri-perspective view in the cylindrical coordinate system for more fine-grained modeling of nearer areas. We employ spatial group pooling to maintain structural details during projection and adopt 2D backbones to efficiently process each TPV plane. Finally, we obtain the features of each point by aggregating its projected features on each of the processed TPV planes without the need for any post-processing. Extensive experiments on both 3D occupancy prediction and LiDAR segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed PointOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance with much faster speed. Specifically, despite only using LiDAR, PointOcc significantly outperforms all other methods, including multi-modal methods, with a large margin on the OpenOccupancy benchmark.

Our method enjoys the advantage of sparse training and naturally constrains the generation space of our motion generator with the inversion network guided by the initial frame, eliminating the need for heavy discriminators.

Whereas in VPINNs the loss depends upon the selected basis functions of a given test space, herein we minimize a loss based on the residual in the discrete dual norm, which is independent of the test space's choice of test basis functions. We demonstrate that this loss is a reliable and efficient estimator of the true error in the energy norm. The proposed loss function requires computation of the Gram matrix inverse, similar to what occurs in traditional residual minimization methods. To validate our theoretical findings, we test the performance and robustness of our algorithm in several advection-dominated-diffusion problems in one spatial dimension. We conclude that RVPINNs is a robust method. ",

The first step towards enabling quantum networks is the integration of quantum repeaters into optical networks. However, the expenses and intrinsic noise inherent in quantum hardware underscore the need for an efficient deployment strategy that optimizes the allocation of quantum repeaters and memories. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for network planning, aiming to efficiently distributing quantum repeaters across existing infrastructure, with the objective of maximizing quantum network utility within an entanglement distribution network. We apply our framework to several cases including a preliminary illustration of a dumbbell network topology and real-world cases of the SURFnet and ESnet. We explore the effect of quantum memory multiplexing within quantum repeaters, as well as the influence of memory coherence time on quantum network utility. We further examine the effects of different fairness assumptions on network planning, uncovering their impacts on real-time network performance. ",

Yeast has 159 genes that encode protein kinases and phosphatases, and 136 of these have counterparts in humans. Therefore any insight in this model organism could potentially offer indications of mechanisms of action in the human kinome. The study utilises a Prolog-based approach, data from a yeast kinase deletions strains study and publicly available kinase-protein associations. Prolog, a programming language that is well-suited for symbolic reasoning is used to reason over the data and infer compensatory kinase networks. This approach is based on the idea that when a kinase is knocked out, other kinases may compensate for this loss of activity. Background knowledge on kinases targeting proteins is used to guide the analysis. This knowledge is used to infer the potential compensatory interactions between kinases based on the changes in phosphorylation observed in the phosphoproteomics data from the yeast study. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Prolog-based approach in analysing complex cell signalling mechanisms in yeast. The inferred compensatory kinase networks provide new insights into the regulation of cell signalling in yeast and may aid in the identification of potential therapeutic targets for modulating signalling pathways in yeast and other organisms.

While matched filtering-based techniques are known for their computational demands, existing deep learning-based methods primarily handle time-domain data and are often constrained by data duration and SNR. In addition, most existing work ignores time-delay interferometry (TDI) and applies the long-wavelength approximation in detector response calculations, thus limiting their ability to handle laser frequency noise. In this study, we introduce DECODE, an end-to-end model focusing on EMRI signal detection by sequence modeling in the frequency domain. Centered around a dilated causal convolutional neural network, trained on synthetic data considering TDI-1.5 detector response, DECODE can efficiently process a year's worth of multichannel TDI data with an SNR of around 50. We evaluate our model on 1-year data with accumulated SNR ranging from 50 to 120 and achieve a true positive rate of 96.3% at a false positive rate of 1%, keeping an inference time of less than 0.01 seconds. With the visualization of three showcased EMRI signals for interpretability and generalization, DECODE exhibits strong potential for future space-based gravitational wave data analyses. ",

Pit and fissure sealing is one of the most effective methods that is widely used in prevention of pit and fissure caries. However, current detection of pits and fissures or caries depends primarily on the experienced dentists, which ordinary parents do not have, and children may miss the remedial treatment without timely detection. To address this issue, we present a method to autodetect caries and pit and fissure sealing requirements using oral photos taken by smartphones.

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation methods often rely on fully supervised approaches to achieve excellent performance, which is contingent upon having an extensive set of labeled images for training. However, annotating medical images is both expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised learning offers a solution by leveraging numerous unlabeled images alongside a limited set of annotated ones. In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised medical image segmentation method based on the mean-teacher model, referred to as Dual-Decoder Consistency via Pseudo-Labels Guided Data Augmentation (DCPA). This method combines consistency regularization, pseudo-labels, and data augmentation to enhance the efficacy of semi-supervised segmentation. Firstly, the proposed model comprises both student and teacher models with a shared encoder and two distinct decoders employing different up-sampling strategies. Minimizing the output discrepancy between decoders enforces the generation of consistent representations, serving as regularization during student model training. Secondly, we introduce mixup operations to blend unlabeled data with labeled data, creating mixed data and thereby achieving data augmentation. Lastly, pseudo-labels are generated by the teacher model and utilized as labels for mixed data to compute unsupervised loss. We compare the segmentation results of the DCPA model with six state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods on three publicly available medical datasets. Beyond classical 10\\% and 20\\% semi-supervised settings, we investigate performance with less supervision (5\\% labeled data). Experimental outcomes demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods across the three semi-supervised settings. ",

However, the diagnoses of these images largely hinge on the expertise of medical practitioners, rendering the process susceptible to misdiagnoses. Although rapidly developing deep learning has substantially improved the diagnoses of diverse ultrasound images, there remains a conspicuous research gap concerning cervical lymph nodes. The objective of our work is to accurately diagnose cervical lymph node lesions by leveraging a deep learning model. To this end, we first collected 3392 images containing normal lymph nodes, benign lymph node lesions, malignant primary lymph node lesions, and malignant metastatic lymph node lesions. Given that ultrasound images are generated by the reflection and scattering of sound waves across varied bodily tissues, we proposed the Conv-FFT Block. It integrates convolutional operations with the fast Fourier transform to more astutely model the images. Building upon this foundation, we designed a novel architecture, named US-SFNet. This architecture not only discerns variances in ultrasound images from the spatial domain but also adeptly captures microstructural alterations across various lesions in the frequency domain. To ascertain the potential of US-SFNet, we benchmarked it against 12 popular architectures through five-fold cross-validation. The results show that US-SFNet is SOTA and can achieve 92.89% accuracy, 90.46% precision, 89.95% sensitivity and 97.49% specificity, respectively. ",

The sample complexity of learning a DAG's structure is well-studied for static systems, where the samples of nodal states are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, such a study is less explored for DAGs with dynamical systems, where the nodal states are temporally correlated. We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as \\emph{dynamical} DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics are driven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary (WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same {power spectral density (PSD)}. Inspired by the static settings, a metric and an algorithm based on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstruct the DDAG. The equal noise PSD assumption can be relaxed such that identifiability conditions for DDAG reconstruction are not violated. For the LDS with WSS (sub) Gaussian exogenous noise sources, it is shown that the optimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn the DDAG is $n=\\Theta(q\\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the maximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound, a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two different sampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano's inequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposed algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a severe neurological disease characterized by inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system. Hence, predicting inflammatory disease activity is crucial for disease assessment and treatment. However, MS lesions can occur throughout the brain and vary in shape, size and total count among patients. The high variance in lesion load and locations makes it challenging for machine learning methods to learn a globally effective representation of whole-brain MRI scans to assess and predict disease. Technically it is non-trivial to incorporate essential biomarkers such as lesion load or spatial proximity. Our work represents the first attempt to utilize graph neural networks (GNN) to aggregate these biomarkers for a novel global representation. We propose a two-stage MS inflammatory disease activity prediction approach. First, a 3D segmentation network detects lesions, and a self-supervised algorithm extracts their image features. Second, the detected lesions are used to build a patient graph. The lesions act as nodes in the graph and are initialized with image features extracted in the first stage. Finally, the lesions are connected based on their spatial proximity and the inflammatory disease activity prediction is formulated as a graph classification task. Furthermore, we propose a self-pruning strategy to auto-select the most critical lesions for prediction. Our proposed method outperforms the existing baseline by a large margin (AUCs of 0.67 vs. 0.61 and 0.66 vs. 0.60 for one-year and two-year inflammatory disease activity, respectively). Finally, our proposed method enjoys inherent explainability by assigning an importance score to each lesion for the overall prediction. Code is available at https://github.com/chinmay5/ms_ida.git ",

The strategy exploits the separation of characteristic times between coarse-grained particle evolution on the monomer scale and slow morphological evolution over mesoscopic scales. In contrast to empirical continuum models, the proposed approach learns stochastically driven defect annihilation processes directly from particle-based simulations. A UNet architecture that respects different boundary conditions is adopted, thereby allowing periodic and fixed substrate boundary conditions of arbitrary shape. Physical concepts are also introduced via the loss function and symmetries are incorporated via data augmentation. The model is validated using three different use cases. Explainable artificial intelligence methods are applied to visualize the morphology evolution over time. This approach enables the generation of large system sizes and long trajectories to investigate defect densities and their evolution under different types of confinement. As an application, we demonstrate the importance of accessing late-stage morphologies for understanding particle diffusion inside a single block.
