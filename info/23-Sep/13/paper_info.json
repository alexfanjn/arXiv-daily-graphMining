    "abstract": "The increasing availability of large clinical datasets collected from patients can enable new avenues for computational characterization of complex diseases using different analytic algorithms. One of the promising new methods for extracting knowledge from large clinical datasets involves temporal pattern mining integrated with machine learning workflows. However, mining these temporal patterns is a computational intensive task and has memory repercussions. Current algorithms, such as the temporal sequence pattern mining (tSPM) algorithm, are already providing promising outcomes, but still leave room for optimization. In this paper, we present the tSPM+ algorithm, a high-performance implementation of the tSPM algorithm, which adds a new dimension by adding the duration to the temporal patterns. We show that the tSPM+ algorithm provides a speed up to factor 980 and a up to 48 fold improvement in memory consumption. Moreover, we present a docker container with an R-package, We also provide vignettes for an easy integration into already existing machine learning workflows and use the mined temporal sequences to identify Post COVID-19 patients and their symptoms according to the WHO definition.

    "abstract": "Effectively medication recommendation with complex multimorbidity conditions is a critical task in healthcare. Most existing works predicted medications based on longitudinal records, which assumed the information transmitted patterns of learning longitudinal sequence data are stable and intra-visit medical events are serialized. However, the following conditions may have been ignored: 1) A more compact encoder for intra-relationship in the intra-visit medical event is urgent; 2) Strategies for learning accurate representations of the variable longitudinal sequences of patients are different. In this paper, we proposed a novel Sample-adaptive Hierarchical medicAtion Prediction nEtwork, termed SHAPE, to tackle the above challenges in the medication recommendation task. Specifically, we design a compact intra-visit set encoder to encode the relationship in the medical event for obtaining visit-level representation and then develop an inter-visit longitudinal encoder to learn the patient-level longitudinal representation efficiently. To endow the model with the capability of modeling the variable visit length, we introduce a soft curriculum learning method to assign the difficulty of each sample automatically by the visit length. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset verify the superiority of our model compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. ",

Existing mainstream research and continuoual learning-based methods all require training on complete datasets, leading to poor prediction accuracy when sudden changes in scenarios occur and failing to promptly respond and update the model. Whether these methods can make a prediction in real-time and use data instances to update the model immediately(i.e., online learning settings) remains a question. The problem of gradient explosion or vanishing caused by data instance streams also needs to be addressed. Inspired by Hedge Propagation algorithm, we propose Expert Attention Network, a complete online learning framework for trajectory prediction. We introduce expert attention, which adjusts the weights of different depths of network layers, avoiding the model updated slowly due to gradient problem and enabling fast learning of new scenario's knowledge to restore prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a short-term motion trend kernel function which is sensitive to scenario change, allowing the model to respond quickly. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to address the online learning problem in trajectory prediction. The experimental results indicate that traditional methods suffer from gradient problems and that our method can quickly reduce prediction errors and reach the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy.

While reduced-order models (ROMs) are frequently employed in model-based control schemes, dimensionality reduction introduces model uncertainty which can potentially compromise the stability and safety of the original high-dimensional system. In this work, we propose a novel reduced-order model predictive control (ROMPC) scheme to solve constrained optimal control problems for nonlinear, high-dimensional systems. To address the challenges of using ROMs in predictive control schemes, we derive an error bounding system that dynamically accounts for model reduction error. Using these bounds, we design a robust MPC scheme that ensures robust constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility, and asymptotic stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in simulations on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states. ",

However, they rely on an extensive amount of document data to learn their pretext objectives in a ``pre-train-then-fine-tune'' paradigm and thus, suffer a significant performance drop in real-world online industrial settings. One major reason is the over-reliance on OCR engines to extract local positional information within a document page. Therefore, this hinders the model's generalizability, flexibility and robustness due to the lack of capturing global information within a document image. We introduce TransferDoc, a cross-modal transformer-based architecture pre-trained in a self-supervised fashion using three novel pretext objectives. TransferDoc learns richer semantic concepts by unifying language and visual representations, which enables the production of more transferable models. Besides, two novel downstream tasks have been introduced for a ``closer-to-real'' industrial evaluation scenario where TransferDoc outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Hypergraphs can naturally model group-wise relations (e.g., a group of users who co-purchase an item) as hyperedges. Hyperedge prediction is to predict future or unobserved hyperedges, which is a fundamental task in many real-world applications (e.g., group recommendation). Despite the recent breakthrough of hyperedge prediction methods, the following challenges have been rarely studied: (C1) How to aggregate the nodes in each hyperedge candidate for accurate hyperedge prediction? and (C2) How to mitigate the inherent data sparsity problem in hyperedge prediction? To tackle both challenges together, in this paper, we propose a novel hyperedge prediction framework (CASH) that employs (1) context-aware node aggregation to precisely capture complex relations among nodes in each hyperedge for (C1) and (2) self-supervised contrastive learning in the context of hyperedge prediction to enhance hypergraph representations for (C2). Furthermore, as for (C2), we propose a hyperedge-aware augmentation method to fully exploit the latent semantics behind the original hypergraph and consider both node-level and group-level contrasts (i.e., dual contrasts) for better node and hyperedge representations. Extensive experiments on six real-world hypergraphs reveal that CASH consistently outperforms all competing methods in terms of the accuracy in hyperedge prediction and each of the proposed strategies is effective in improving the model accuracy of CASH.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly proposed as models of human vision, bolstered by their impressive performance on image classification and object recognition tasks. Yet, the extent to which DNNs capture fundamental aspects of human vision such as color perception remains unclear. Here, we develop novel experiments for evaluating the perceptual coherence of color embeddings in DNNs, and we assess how well these algorithms predict human color similarity judgments collected via an online survey. We find that state-of-the-art DNN architectures $-$ including convolutional neural networks and vision transformers $-$ provide color similarity judgments that strikingly diverge from human color judgments of (i) images with controlled color properties, (ii) images generated from online searches, and (iii) real-world images from the canonical CIFAR-10 dataset. We compare DNN performance against an interpretable and cognitively plausible model of color perception based on wavelet decomposition, inspired by foundational theories in computational neuroscience. While one deep learning model $-$ a convolutional DNN trained on a style transfer task $-$ captures some aspects of human color perception, our wavelet algorithm provides more coherent color embeddings that better predict human color judgments compared to all DNNs we examine. These results hold when altering the high-level visual task used to train similar DNN architectures (e.g., image classification versus image segmentation), as well as when examining the color embeddings of different layers in a given DNN architecture. These findings break new ground in the effort to analyze the perceptual representations of machine learning algorithms and to improve their ability to serve as cognitively plausible models of human vision. Implications for machine learning, human perception, and embodied cognition are discussed. ",

The success of deep neural networks heavily relies on the availability of large-scale high-quality labeled data. However, the process of data labeling is time-consuming and unscalable, leading to shortages in labeled data. SSL aims to tackle this problem by leveraging additional unlabeled data in the training process. One of the popular SSL algorithms, FixMatch, trains identical weight-sharing teacher and student networks simultaneously using a siamese neural network (SNN). However, it is prone to performance degradation when the pseudo labels are heavily noisy in the early training stage. We present KD-FixMatch, a novel SSL algorithm that addresses the limitations of FixMatch by incorporating knowledge distillation. The algorithm utilizes a combination of sequential and simultaneous training of SNNs to enhance performance and reduce performance degradation. Firstly, an outer SNN is trained using labeled and unlabeled data. After that, the network of the well-trained outer SNN generates pseudo labels for the unlabeled data, from which a subset of unlabeled data with trusted pseudo labels is then carefully created through high-confidence sampling and deep embedding clustering. Finally, an inner SNN is trained with the labeled data, the unlabeled data, and the subset of unlabeled data with trusted pseudo labels. Experiments on four public data sets demonstrate that KD-FixMatch outperforms FixMatch in all cases. Our results indicate that KD-FixMatch has a better training starting point that leads to improved model performance compared to FixMatch. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the transition to cloud-based platforms in the IT sector has emphasized the significance of cloud incident root cause analysis to ensure service reliability and maintain customer trust. Central to this process is the efficient determination of root causes, a task made challenging due to the complex nature of contemporary cloud infrastructures. Despite the proliferation of AI-driven tools for root cause identification, their applicability remains limited by the inconsistent quality of their outputs. This paper introduces a method for enhancing confidence estimation in root cause analysis tools by prompting retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs). This approach operates in two phases. Initially, the model evaluates its confidence based on historical incident data, considering its assessment of the evidence strength. Subsequently, the model reviews the root cause generated by the predictor. An optimization step then combines these evaluations to determine the final confidence assignment. Experimental results illustrate that our method enables the model to articulate its confidence effectively, providing a more calibrated score. We address research questions evaluating the ability of our method to produce calibrated confidence scores using LLMs, the impact of domain-specific retrieved examples on confidence estimates, and its potential generalizability across various root cause analysis models. Through this, we aim to bridge the confidence estimation gap, aiding on-call engineers in decision-making and bolstering the efficiency of cloud incident management. ",

Model-based computational MSK models can interpret the dynamic interaction between the neural drive to muscles, muscle dynamics, body and joint kinematics, and kinetics. Still, such a set of solutions suffers from high computational time and muscle recruitment problems, especially in complex modeling. In recent years, data-driven methods have emerged as a promising alternative due to the benefits of flexibility and adaptability. However, a large amount of labeled training data is not easy to be acquired. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep learning method based on MSK modeling to predict joint motion and muscle forces. The MSK model is embedded into the neural network as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) loss function with physiological parameters of muscle activation dynamics and muscle contraction dynamics to be identified. These parameters are automatically estimated during the training process which guides the prediction of muscle forces combined with the MSK forward dynamics model. Experimental validations on two groups of data, including one benchmark dataset and one self-collected dataset from six healthy subjects, are performed. The results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning method can effectively identify subject-specific MSK physiological parameters and the trained physics-informed forward-dynamics surrogate yields accurate motion and muscle forces predictions.

    "abstract": "Face verification (FV) using deep neural network models has made tremendous progress in recent years, surpassing human accuracy and seeing deployment in various applications such as border control and smartphone unlocking. However, FV systems are vulnerable to Adversarial Attacks, which manipulate input images to deceive these systems in ways usually unnoticeable to humans. This paper provides an in-depth study of attacks on FV systems. We introduce the DodgePersonation Attack that formulates the creation of face images that impersonate a set of given identities while avoiding being identified as any of the identities in a separate, disjoint set. A taxonomy is proposed to provide a unified view of different types of Adversarial Attacks against FV systems, including Dodging Attacks, Impersonation Attacks, and Master Face Attacks. Finally, we propose the ''One Face to Rule Them All'' Attack which implements the DodgePersonation Attack with state-of-the-art performance on a well-known scenario (Master Face Attack) and which can also be used for the new scenarios introduced in this paper. While the state-of-the-art Master Face Attack can produce a set of 9 images to cover 43.82% of the identities in their test database, with 9 images our attack can cover 57.27% to 58.5% of these identifies while giving the attacker the choice of the identity to use to create the impersonation. Moreover, the 9 generated attack images appear identical to a casual observer. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is at the center of mainstream technology and outperforms classical approaches to handcrafted feature design. Aside from its learning process for artificial feature extraction, it has an end-to-end paradigm from input to output, reaching outstandingly accurate results. However, security concerns about its robustness to malicious and imperceptible perturbations have drawn attention since its prediction can be changed entirely. Salient object detection is a research area where deep convolutional neural networks have proven effective but whose trustworthiness represents a significant issue requiring analysis and solutions to hackers' attacks. Brain programming is a kind of symbolic learning in the vein of good old-fashioned artificial intelligence. This work provides evidence that symbolic learning robustness is crucial in designing reliable visual attention systems since it can withstand even the most intense perturbations. We test this evolutionary computation methodology against several adversarial attacks and noise perturbations using standard databases and a real-world problem of a shorebird called the Snowy Plover portraying a visual attention task. We compare our methodology with five different deep learning approaches, proving that they do not match the symbolic paradigm regarding robustness. All neural networks suffer significant performance losses, while brain programming stands its ground and remains unaffected. Also, by studying the Snowy Plover, we remark on the importance of security in surveillance activities regarding wildlife protection and conservation. ",

    "abstract": "Deepfake has recently raised a plethora of societal concerns over its possible security threats and dissemination of fake information. Much research on deepfake detection has been undertaken. However, detecting low quality as well as simultaneously detecting different qualities of deepfakes still remains a grave challenge. Most SOTA approaches are limited by using a single specific model for detecting certain deepfake video quality type. When constructing multiple models with prior information about video quality, this kind of strategy incurs significant computational cost, as well as model and training data overhead. Further, it cannot be scalable and practical to deploy in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a universal intra-model collaborative learning framework to enable the effective and simultaneous detection of different quality of deepfakes. That is, our approach is the quality-agnostic deepfake detection method, dubbed QAD . In particular, by observing the upper bound of general error expectation, we maximize the dependency between intermediate representations of images from different quality levels via Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. In addition, an Adversarial Weight Perturbation module is carefully devised to enable the model to be more robust against image corruption while boosting the overall model's performance. Extensive experiments over seven popular deepfake datasets demonstrate the superiority of our QAD model over prior SOTA benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Despite encryption, the packet size is still visible, enabling observers to infer private information in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment (e.g., IoT device identification). Packet padding obfuscates packet-length characteristics with a high data overhead because it relies on adding noise to the data. This paper proposes a more data-efficient approach that randomizes packet sizes without adding noise. We achieve this by splitting large TCP segments into random-sized chunks; hence, the packet length distribution is obfuscated without adding noise data. Our client-server implementation using TCP sockets demonstrates the feasibility of our approach at the application level. We realize our packet size control by adjusting two local socket-programming parameters. First, we enable the TCP_NODELAY option to send out each packet with our specified length. Second, we downsize the sending buffer to prevent the sender from pushing out more data than can be received, which could disable our control of the packet sizes. We simulate our defense on a network trace of four IoT devices and show a reduction in device classification accuracy from 98% to 63%, close to random guessing. Meanwhile, the real-world data transmission experiments show that the added latency is reasonable, less than 21%, while the added packet header overhead is only about 5%. ",

    "abstract": "As social media becomes increasingly popular, more and more public health activities emerge, which is worth noting for pandemic monitoring and government decision-making. Current techniques for public health analysis involve popular models such as BERT and large language models (LLMs). Although recent progress in LLMs has shown a strong ability to comprehend knowledge by being fine-tuned on specific domain datasets, the costs of training an in-domain LLM for every specific public health task are especially expensive. Furthermore, such kinds of in-domain datasets from social media are generally highly imbalanced, which will hinder the efficiency of LLMs tuning. To tackle these challenges, the data imbalance issue can be overcome by sophisticated data augmentation methods for social media datasets. In addition, the ability of the LLMs can be effectively utilised by prompting the model properly. In light of the above discussion, in this paper, a novel ALEX framework is proposed for social media analysis on public health. Specifically, an augmentation pipeline is developed to resolve the data imbalance issue. Furthermore, an LLMs explanation mechanism is proposed by prompting an LLM with the predicted results from BERT models. Extensive experiments conducted on three tasks at the Social Media Mining for Health 2023 (SMM4H) competition with the first ranking in two tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed ALEX method.

Although various methods have been proposed to detect anomalies in log sequences, they often overlook the significance of considering relations among system components, such as services and users, which can be identified from log contents. Understanding these relations is vital for detecting anomalies and their underlying causes. To address this issue, we introduce GLAD, a Graph-based Log Anomaly Detection framework designed to detect relational anomalies in system logs. GLAD incorporates log semantics, relational patterns, and sequential patterns into a unified framework for anomaly detection. Specifically, GLAD first introduces a field extraction module that utilizes prompt-based few-shot learning to identify essential fields from log contents. Then GLAD constructs dynamic log graphs for sliding windows by interconnecting extracted fields and log events parsed from the log parser. These graphs represent events and fields as nodes and their relations as edges. Subsequently, GLAD utilizes a temporal-attentive graph edge anomaly detection model for identifying anomalous relations in these dynamic log graphs. This model employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based encoder enhanced with transformers to capture content, structural and temporal features. We evaluate our proposed method on three datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of GLAD in detecting anomalies indicated by varying relational patterns. ",

The recently proposed neural moving horizon estimation (NeuroMHE), which uses a portable neural network to model the MHE's weightings, shows promise in this context. Currently, NeuroMHE is trained through gradient descent, with its gradient computed recursively using a Kalman filter. This paper proposes a trust-region policy optimization method for training NeuroMHE. We achieve this by providing the second-order derivatives of MHE, referred to as the MHE Hessian. Remarkably, we establish that much of computation already used to obtain the gradient, especially the Kalman filter, can be efficiently reused to compute the MHE Hessian. This offers linear computational complexity relative to the MHE horizon. Through validation with an open-source real quadrotor flight dataset, our approach demonstrates data-efficient training (<5 min) and outperforms a state-of-the-art neural estimator by up to 68.1% in force estimation accuracy, utilizing only 1.4% of its network parameters. Furthermore, our method showcases enhanced robustness to network initialization compared to the gradient descent counterpart. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a new paradigm to automatically generate training data with accurate labels at scale using the text-to-image synthesis frameworks (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.). The proposed approach1 decouples training data generation into foreground object generation, and contextually coherent background generation. To generate foreground objects, we employ a straightforward textual template, incorporating the object class name as input prompts. This is fed into a text-to-image synthesis framework, producing various foreground images set against isolated backgrounds. A foreground-background segmentation algorithm is then used to generate foreground object masks. To generate context images, we begin by creating language descriptions of the context. This is achieved by applying an image captioning method to a small set of images representing the desired context. These textual descriptions are then transformed into a diverse array of context images via a text-to-image synthesis framework. Subsequently, we composite these with the foreground object masks produced in the initial step, utilizing a cut-and-paste method, to formulate the training data. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach on five object detection and segmentation datasets, including Pascal VOC and COCO. We found that detectors trained solely on synthetic data produced by our method achieve performance comparable to those trained on real data (Fig. 1). Moreover, a combination of real and synthetic data yields even much better results. Further analysis indicates that the synthetic data distribution complements the real data distribution effectively. Additionally, we emphasize the compositional nature of our data generation approach in out-of-distribution and zero-shot data generation scenarios.

In the proposed method, features are extracted as codes in a motion codebook without the use of human knowledge, and the relationship between these codes can be visualized on a graph. Since the codes are expected to be temporally sparse compared to the captured frame rate and can be shared by multiple sequences, the proposed network model also addresses the need for training constraints. Specifically, the model consists of self-attention layers and a vector clustering block. The attention layers contribute to finding sparse keyframes and discrete features as motion codes, which are then extracted by vector clustering. The constraints are realized as training losses so that the same motion codes can be as contiguous as possible and can be shared by multiple sequences. In addition, we propose the use of causal self-attention as a method by which to calculate attention for long sequences consisting of numerous frames. In our experiments, the sparse structures of motion codes were used to compile a graph that facilitates visualization of the relationship between the codes and the differences between sequences. We then evaluated the effectiveness of the extracted motion codes by applying them to multiple recognition tasks and found that performance levels comparable to task-optimized methods could be achieved by linear probing.

This is achieved by encoding samples into short packets/codewords for transmission, with potential decoding errors. We consider a broadcasting base station (BS) that samples information from multiple sources and transmits to respective destinations/users, using short-blocklength cyclic and deep learning (DL) based codes for error correction, and cyclic-redundancy-check (CRC) codes for error detection. We use a metric called reported age of information (AoI), abbreviated as RAoI, to measure the freshness of information, which increases from an initial value if the CRC reports a failure, else is reset. We minimize long-term average expected RAoI, subject to constraints on transmission power and distortion, for which we obtain age-agnostic randomized and age-aware drift-plus-penalty policies that decide which user to transmit to, with what message-word length and transmit power, and derive bounds on their performance. Simulations show that longer CRC codes lead to higher RAoI, but the RAoI achieved is closer to the true, genie-aided AoI. DL-based codes achieve lower RAoI. Finally, we conclude that prior AoI optimization literature with finite blocklengths substantially underestimates AoI because they assume that all errors can be detected perfectly without using CRC.

In this context, the automatic detection and segmentation of polyps from various colonoscopy images has emerged as a significant problem that has attracted broad attention. Current polyp segmentation techniques face several challenges: firstly, polyps vary in size, texture, color, and pattern; secondly, the boundaries between polyps and mucosa are usually blurred, existing studies have focused on learning the local features of polyps while ignoring the long-range dependencies of the features, and also ignoring the local context and global contextual information of the combined features. To address these challenges, we propose FLDNet (Foreground-Long-Distance Network), a Transformer-based neural network that captures long-distance dependencies for accurate polyp segmentation. Specifically, the proposed model consists of three main modules: a pyramid-based Transformer encoder, a local context module, and a foreground-Aware module. Multilevel features with long-distance dependency information are first captured by the pyramid-based transformer encoder. On the high-level features, the local context module obtains the local characteristics related to the polyps by constructing different local context information. The coarse map obtained by decoding the reconstructed highest-level features guides the feature fusion process in the foreground-Aware module of the high-level features to achieve foreground enhancement of the polyps. Our proposed method, FLDNet, was evaluated using seven metrics on common datasets and demonstrated superiority over state-of-the-art methods on widely-used evaluation measures. ",

The first level distinguishes whether domain shift exists in the image by leveraging global low-level features, while the second level identifies pixels with semantic shift by utilizing dense high-level feature maps. In this way, we can selectively adapt the model to unseen domains as well as enhance model's capacity in detecting novel classes. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method on several OOD segmentation benchmarks, including those with significant domain shifts and those without, observing consistent performance improvements across various baseline models.

Therefore, the task of fine-grained extraction of surface features from high-resolution satellite imagery has emerged as a critical challenge in remote sensing image processing. In this work, we propose the Feature Aggregation Network (FANet), concentrating on extracting both global and local features, thereby enabling the refined extraction of landmark buildings from high-resolution satellite remote sensing imagery. The Pyramid Vision Transformer captures these global features, which are subsequently refined by the Feature Aggregation Module and merged into a cohesive representation by the Difference Elimination Module. In addition, to ensure a comprehensive feature map, we have incorporated the Receptive Field Block and Dual Attention Module, expanding the receptive field and intensifying attention across spatial and channel dimensions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets have validated the outstanding capability of FANet in extracting features from high-resolution satellite images.

The precision of the online operators can be tuned at run-time, making them extremely useful in situations where accuracy can be compromised for power and energy savings. The proposed design has been implemented on Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA and is compared with state-of-the-art Stripes on various performance metrics. The results show the proposed design presents power savings, has shorter cycle time, and approximately 50% higher OPS per watt. ",

    "abstract": "In different wireless network scenarios, multiple network entities need to cooperate in order to achieve a common task with minimum delay and energy consumption. Future wireless networks mandate exchanging high dimensional data in dynamic and uncertain environments, therefore implementing communication control tasks becomes challenging and highly complex. Multi-agent reinforcement learning with emergent communication (EC-MARL) is a promising solution to address high dimensional continuous control problems with partially observable states in a cooperative fashion where agents build an emergent communication protocol to solve complex tasks. This paper articulates the importance of EC-MARL within the context of future 6G wireless networks, which imbues autonomous decision-making capabilities into network entities to solve complex tasks such as autonomous driving, robot navigation, flying base stations network planning, and smart city applications. An overview of EC-MARL algorithms and their design criteria are provided while presenting use cases and research opportunities on this emerging topic. ",

Therefore, to address these problems, we propose a federated learning pipeline for large-scale modeling with NeRF. We tailor the model aggregation pipeline in federated learning for NeRF, thereby allowing local updates of NeRF. In the aggregation step, the accuracy of the clients' global pose is critical.

    "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in machine learning and data mining. Recent works have mainly focused on how to capture richer information to improve the quality of node embeddings for GAD. Despite their significant advances in detection performance, there is still a relative dearth of research on the properties of the task. GAD aims to discern the anomalies that deviate from most nodes. However, the model is prone to learn the pattern of normal samples which make up the majority of samples. Meanwhile, anomalies can be easily detected when their behaviors differ from normality. Therefore, the performance can be further improved by enhancing the ability to learn the normal pattern. To this end, we propose a normality learning-based GAD framework via multi-scale contrastive learning networks (NLGAD for abbreviation). Specifically, we first initialize the model with the contrastive networks on different scales. To provide sufficient and reliable normal nodes for normality learning, we design an effective hybrid strategy for normality selection. Finally, the model is refined with the only input of reliable normal nodes and learns a more accurate estimate of normality so that anomalous nodes can be more easily distinguished. Eventually, extensive experiments on six benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our normality learning-based scheme on GAD. Notably, the proposed algorithm improves the detection performance (up to 5.89% AUC gain) compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The source code is released at https://github.com/FelixDJC/NLGAD.

    "abstract": "In-context learning, i.e., learning from in-context samples, is an impressive ability of Transformer. However, the mechanism driving the in-context learning is not yet fully understood. In this study, we aim to investigate from an underexplored perspective of representation learning. The representation is more complex for in-context learning senario, where the representation can be impacted by both model weights and in-context samples. We refer the above two conceptually aspects of representation as in-weight component and in-context component, respectively. To study how the two components affect in-context learning capabilities, we construct a novel synthetic task, making it possible to device two probes, in-weights probe and in-context probe, to evaluate the two components, respectively. We demonstrate that the goodness of in-context component is highly related to the in-context learning performance, which indicates the entanglement between in-context learning and representation learning. Furthermore, we find that a good in-weights component can actually benefit the learning of the in-context component, indicating that in-weights learning should be the foundation of in-context learning. To further understand the the in-context learning mechanism and importance of the in-weights component, we proof by construction that a simple Transformer, which uses pattern matching and copy-past mechanism to perform in-context learning, can match the in-context learning performance with more complex, best tuned Transformer under the perfect in-weights component assumption. In short, those discoveries from representation learning perspective shed light on new approaches to improve the in-context capacity. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have led to unprecedented progress in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Owing to limited data and computation resources, using third-party data and models has become a new paradigm for adapting various tasks. However, research shows that it has some potential security vulnerabilities because attackers can manipulate the training process and data source. Such a way can set specific triggers, making the model exhibit expected behaviors that have little inferior influence on the model's performance for primitive tasks, called backdoor attacks. Hence, it could have dire consequences, especially considering that the backdoor attack surfaces are broad. To get a precise grasp and understanding of this problem, a systematic and comprehensive review is required to confront various security challenges from different phases and attack purposes. Additionally, there is a dearth of analysis and comparison of the various emerging backdoor countermeasures in this situation.In this paper, we conduct a timely review of backdoor attacks and countermeasures to sound the red alarm for the NLP security community. According to the affected stage of the machine learning pipeline, the attack surfaces are recognized to be wide and then formalized into three categorizations: attacking pre-trained model with fine-tuning (APMF) or prompt-tuning (APMP), and attacking final model with training (AFMT), where AFMT can be subdivided into different attack aims. Thus, attacks under each categorization are combed. The countermeasures are categorized into two general classes: sample inspection and model inspection. Overall, the research on the defense side is far behind the attack side, and there is no single defense that can prevent all types of backdoor attacks. An attacker can intelligently bypass existing defenses with a more invisible attack. ...... ",

This is often an unrealistic assumption, as different sources of data come with different privacy requirements; as a result, known closeness testing algorithms might be unnecessarily conservative, ``paying'' too high a privacy budget for half of the data.

Our results demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge into the GNN connectivity leads to better performance than using the same connectivity as the KG or allowing unconstrained embedding propagation.

As a result, existing CURL methods using SSL can learn high-quality representations without any labels, but with a notable performance drop when learning on a many-tasks data stream. We hypothesize that this is caused by the regularization losses that are imposed to prevent forgetting, leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off: they either do not adapt fully to the incoming data (low plasticity), or incur significant forgetting when allowed to fully adapt to a new SSL pretext-task (low stability). In this work, we propose to train an expert network that is relieved of the duty of keeping the previous knowledge and can focus on performing optimally on the new tasks (optimizing plasticity). In the second phase, we combine this new knowledge with the previous network in an adaptation-retrospection phase to avoid forgetting and initialize a new expert with the knowledge of the old network. We perform several experiments showing that our proposed approach outperforms other CURL exemplar-free methods in few- and many-task split settings. Furthermore, we show how to adapt our approach to semi-supervised continual learning (Semi-SCL) and show that we surpass the accuracy of other exemplar-free Semi-SCL methods and reach the results of some others that use exemplars.

    "abstract": "Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to extract and integrate the complementary information in two different modalities to generate high-quality fused images with salient targets and abundant texture details. However, current image fusion methods go to great lengths to excavate complementary features, which is generally achieved through two efforts. On the one hand, the feature extraction network is expected to have excellent performance in extracting complementary information. On the other hand, complex fusion strategies are often designed to aggregate the complementary information. In other words, enabling the network to perceive and extract complementary information is extremely challenging. Complicated fusion strategies, while effective, still run the risk of losing weak edge details. To this end, this paper rethinks the IVIF outside the box, proposing a complementary-redundant information transfer network (C-RITNet). It reasonably transfers complementary information into redundant one, which integrates both the shared and complementary features from two modalities. Hence, the proposed method is able to alleviate the challenges posed by the complementary information extraction and reduce the reliance on sophisticated fusion strategies. Specifically, to skillfully sidestep aggregating complementary information in IVIF, we first design the mutual information transfer (MIT) module to mutually represent features from two modalities, roughly transferring complementary information into redundant one. Then, a redundant information acquisition supervised by source image (RIASSI) module is devised to further ensure the complementary-redundant information transfer after MIT. Meanwhile, we also propose a structure information preservation (SIP) module to guarantee that the edge structure information of the source images can be transferred to the fusion results. ",

    "abstract": "Action anticipation involves forecasting future actions by connecting past events to future ones. However, this reasoning ignores the real-life hierarchy of events which is considered to be composed of three main parts: past, present, and future. We argue that considering these three main parts and their dependencies could improve performance. On the other hand, online action detection is the task of predicting actions in a streaming manner. In this case, one has access only to the past and present information. Therefore, in online action detection (OAD) the existing approaches miss semantics or future information which limits their performance. To sum up, for both of these tasks, the complete set of knowledge (past-present-future) is missing, which makes it challenging to infer action dependencies, therefore having low performances. To address this limitation, we propose to fuse both tasks into a single uniform architecture. By combining action anticipation and online action detection, our approach can cover the missing dependencies of future information in online action detection. This method referred to as JOADAA, presents a uniform model that jointly performs action anticipation and online action detection. We validate our proposed model on three challenging datasets: THUMOS'14, which is a sparsely annotated dataset with one action per time step, CHARADES, and Multi-THUMOS, two densely annotated datasets with more complex scenarios. JOADAA achieves SOTA results on these benchmarks for both tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Search methods based on Pretrained Language Models (PLM) have demonstrated great effectiveness gains compared to statistical and early neural ranking models. However, fine-tuning PLM-based rankers requires a great amount of annotated training data. Annotating data involves a large manual effort and thus is expensive, especially in domain specific tasks. In this paper we investigate fine-tuning PLM-based rankers under limited training data and budget. We investigate two scenarios: fine-tuning a ranker from scratch, and domain adaptation starting with a ranker already fine-tuned on general data, and continuing fine-tuning on a target dataset. We observe a great variability in effectiveness when fine-tuning on different randomly selected subsets of training data. This suggests that it is possible to achieve effectiveness gains by actively selecting a subset of the training data that has the most positive effect on the rankers. This way, it would be possible to fine-tune effective PLM rankers at a reduced annotation budget. To investigate this, we adapt existing Active Learning (AL) strategies to the task of fine-tuning PLM rankers and investigate their effectiveness, also considering annotation and computational costs. Our extensive analysis shows that AL strategies do not significantly outperform random selection of training subsets in terms of effectiveness. We further find that gains provided by AL strategies come at the expense of more assessments (thus higher annotation costs) and AL strategies underperform random selection when comparing effectiveness given a fixed annotation cost. Our results highlight that ``optimal'' subsets of training data that provide high effectiveness at low annotation cost do exist, but current mainstream AL strategies applied to PLM rankers are not capable of identifying them.

    "abstract": "Despite recent success, state-of-the-art learning-based models remain highly vulnerable to input changes such as adversarial examples. In order to obtain certifiable robustness against such perturbations, recent work considers Lipschitz-based regularizers or constraints while at the same time increasing prediction margin. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of significantly decreased accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Calibrated Lipschitz-Margin Loss (CLL) that addresses this issue and improves certified robustness by tackling two problems: Firstly, commonly used margin losses do not adjust the penalties to the shrinking output distribution; caused by minimizing the Lipschitz constant $K$. Secondly, and most importantly, we observe that minimization of $K$ can lead to overly smooth decision functions. This limits the model's complexity and thus reduces accuracy. Our CLL addresses these issues by explicitly calibrating the loss w.r.t. margin and Lipschitz constant, thereby establishing full control over slack and improving robustness certificates even with larger Lipschitz constants. On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, our models consistently outperform losses that leave the constant unattended. On CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, CLL improves upon state-of-the-art deterministic $L_2$ robust accuracies. In contrast to current trends, we unlock potential of much smaller models without $K=1$ constraints. ",

However, tailoring recommendations to users' specific interests can result in the divergence of information streams. Fragmented access to information poses challenges to the integrity of the public sphere, thereby influencing democracy and public discourse.

Accurate measurement of this metric requires the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify distinct news events, stories, or timelines. This paper presents an extensive investigation of various approaches for quantifying Fragmentation in news recommendations. These approaches are evaluated both intrinsically, by measuring performance on news story clustering, and extrinsically, by assessing the Fragmentation scores of different simulated news recommender scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that agglomerative hierarchical clustering coupled with SentenceBERT text representation is substantially better at detecting Fragmentation than earlier implementations. Additionally, the analysis of simulated scenarios yields valuable insights and recommendations for stakeholders concerning the measurement and interpretation of Fragmentation. ",

Learned iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (LISTA) and alternating direction method of multipliers compressive sensing network (ADMM-CSNet) are two widely used such approaches, based on ISTA and ADMM algorithms, respectively. In this work, we study optimization guarantees, i.e., achieving near-zero training loss with the increase in the number of learning epochs, for finite-layer unfolded networks such as LISTA and ADMM-CSNet with smooth soft-thresholding in an over-parameterized (OP) regime. We achieve this by leveraging a modified version of the Polyak-Lojasiewicz, denoted PL$^*$, condition. Satisfying the PL$^*$ condition within a specific region of the loss landscape ensures the existence of a global minimum and exponential convergence from initialization using gradient descent based methods. Hence, we provide conditions, in terms of the network width and the number of training samples, on these unfolded networks for the PL$^*$ condition to hold. We achieve this by deriving the Hessian spectral norm of these networks. Additionally, we show that the threshold on the number of training samples increases with the increase in the network width. Furthermore, we compare the threshold on training samples of unfolded networks with that of a standard fully-connected feed-forward network (FFNN) with smooth soft-thresholding non-linearity. We prove that unfolded networks have a higher threshold value than FFNN. Consequently, one can expect a better expected error for unfolded networks than FFNN. ",

However, existing 3D detectors heavily rely on annotated datasets, which are both time-consuming and prone to errors during the process of labeling 3D bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose a Scene Completion Pre-training (SCP) method to enhance the performance of 3D object detectors with less labeled data. SCP offers three key advantages: (1) Improved initialization of the point cloud model. By completing the scene point clouds, SCP effectively captures the spatial and semantic relationships among objects within urban environments. (2) Elimination of the need for additional datasets. SCP serves as a valuable auxiliary network that does not impose any additional efforts or data requirements on the 3D detectors. (3) Reduction of the amount of labeled data for detection. With the help of SCP, the existing state-of-the-art 3D detectors can achieve comparable performance while only relying on 20% labeled data. ",

    "abstract": "The accurate prediction of drought probability in specific regions is crucial for informed decision-making in agricultural practices. It is important to make predictions one year in advance, particularly for long-term decisions. However, forecasting this probability presents challenges due to the complex interplay of various factors within the region of interest and neighboring areas. In this study, we propose an end-to-end solution to address this issue based on various spatiotemporal neural networks. The models considered focus on predicting the drought intensity based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for subregions of interest, leveraging intrinsic factors and insights from climate models to enhance drought predictions. Comparative evaluations demonstrate the superior accuracy of Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and transformer models compared to baseline gradient boosting and logistic regression solutions. The two former models achieved impressive ROC AUC scores from 0.90 to 0.70 for forecast horizons from one to six months, outperforming baseline models. The transformer showed superiority for shorter horizons, while ConvLSTM did so for longer horizons. Thus, we recommend selecting the models accordingly for long-term drought forecasting. To ensure the broad applicability of the considered models, we conduct extensive validation across regions worldwide, considering different environmental conditions. We also run several ablation and sensitivity studies to challenge our findings and provide additional information on how to solve the problem. ",

Existing attacks are primarily launched over high-level DNN frameworks like PyTorch and flip bits in model weight files. Nevertheless, DNNs are frequently compiled into low-level executables by deep learning (DL) compilers to fully leverage low-level hardware primitives. The compiled code is usually high-speed and manifests dramatically distinct execution paradigms from high-level DNN frameworks. In this paper, we launch the first systematic study on the attack surface of BFA specifically for DNN executables compiled by DL compilers. We design an automated search tool to identify vulnerable bits in DNN executables and identify practical attack vectors that exploit the model structure in DNN executables with BFAs (whereas prior works make likely strong assumptions to attack model weights). DNN executables appear more \"opaque\" than models in high-level DNN frameworks. Nevertheless, we find that DNN executables contain extensive, severe (e.g., single-bit flip), and transferrable attack surfaces that are not present in high-level DNN models and can be exploited to deplete full model intelligence and control output labels. Our finding calls for incorporating security mechanisms in future DNN compilation toolchains. ",

Existing methods mainly focus on learning modality-shared representations by embedding different modalities into the same feature space. As a result, the learned feature emphasizes the common patterns across modalities while suppressing modality-specific and identity-aware information that is valuable for Re-ID. To address these issues, we propose a novel Modality Unifying Network (MUN) to explore a robust auxiliary modality for VI-ReID. First, the auxiliary modality is generated by combining the proposed cross-modality learner and intra-modality learner, which can dynamically model the modality-specific and modality-shared representations to alleviate both cross-modality and intra-modality variations. Second, by aligning identity centres across the three modalities, an identity alignment loss function is proposed to discover the discriminative feature representations. Third, a modality alignment loss is introduced to consistently reduce the distribution distance of visible and infrared images by modality prototype modeling. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. ",

It is possible for malicious parties having access to geolocation data to learn sensitive information about the user such as religion or political views. Location Privacy Preserving Mechanisms (LPPMs) have been proposed by previous works to ensure the privacy of the shared data while allowing the users to use LBSs. But there is no clear view of which mechanism to use according to the scenario in which the user makes use of a LBS. The scenario is the way the user is using a LBS (frequency of reports, number of reports). In this paper, we study the sensitivity of LPPMs on the scenario on which they are used. We propose a framework to systematically evaluate LPPMs by considering an exhaustive combination of LPPMs, attacks and metrics. Using our framework we compare a selection of LPPMs including an improved mechanism that we introduce. By evaluating over a variety of scenarios, we find that the efficacy (privacy, utility, and robustness) of the studied mechanisms is dependent on the scenario: for example the privacy of Planar Laplace geo-indistinguishability is greatly reduced in a continuous scenario. We show that the scenario is essential to consider when choosing an obfuscation mechanism for a given application. ",

As quantum computers become more widely accessible, potentially malicious users could try to execute their code on the machines to leak information from other users, to interfere with or manipulate the results of other users, or to reverse engineer the underlying quantum computer architecture and its intellectual property, for example. Among different security threats, previous work has demonstrated information leakage across the reset operations, and it then proposed a secure reset operation could be an enabling technology that allows the sharing of a quantum computer among different users, or among different quantum programs of the same user. This work first shows a set of new, extended reset operation attacks that could be more stealthy by hiding the intention of the attacker's circuit. This work shows various masking circuits and how attackers can retrieve information from the execution of a previous shot of a circuit, even if the masking circuit is used between the reset operation (of the victim, after the shot of the circuit is executed) and the measurement (of the attacker). Based on the uncovered new possible attacks, this work proposes a set of heuristic checks that could be applied at transpile time to check for the existence of malicious circuits that try to steal information via the attack on the reset operation. Unlike run-time protection or added secure reset gates, this work proposes a complimentary, compile-time security solution to the attacks on reset~operation. ",

In this paper, we compare self-training object detection under the deficiency of teacher training data where students are trained on unseen examples by the teacher, and multi-task learning with partially annotated data, i.e. single-task annotation per training example. Both scenarios have their own limitation but potentially helpful with limited annotated data. Experimental results show the improvement of performance when using a weak teacher with unseen data for training a multi-task student. Despite the limited setup we believe the experimental results show the potential of multi-task knowledge distillation and self-training, which could be beneficial for future study.

The creation of infrastructures for smart grids, the efficient utilization of the distributed network's components, and the appropriate administration of the distributed network would result in a valuable solution for the operators of the distributed network. As a result, a framework for peak-load management is given in this research. Within this framework, the real-time rating of the components and the voltage-dependent characteristics of the electric loads work together to assist the DN operator in effectively navigating peak periods. The combination of the conservation voltage reduction (CVR) and the dynamic thermal rating (DTR) of the components that make up the DN produces outcomes that are more helpful than any of these factors alone could provide. This is true even though each of these factors contributes to the efficient functioning of the DN. According to the findings, as compared to the individual implementation of CVR, the simultaneous utilization of DTR and CVR results in a cost-savings rise at peak events which is 58.75 percentage points more than the individual implementation. In addition, a discussion is offered concerning the current difficulties that are being experienced by the feeders that are providing the voltage-dependent constant-power loads during the utilization of the CVR, which are handled by the dynamic rating of the components that make up the DN.

In STINs, full frequency reuse between a satellite and a terrestrial base station (BS) is encouraged for enhancing spectral efficiency, which accounts for non-negligible amount of interference. To address the interference management problem in STINs, this paper proposes a novel distributed precoding method. Key features of our method are: i) a rate-splitting (RS) strategy is incorporated for efficient interference management, ii) precoders are designed in a distributed way without sharing channel state information between a satellite and a terrestrial BS. Specifically, to design precoders in a distributed fashion, we put forth a spectral efficiency decoupling technique. This technique disentangles the total spectral efficiency into two distinct terms, each dependent solely on the satellite's precoder and the terrestrial BS's precoder, respectively. Then, to resolve the non-smoothness raised by adopting the RS strategy, we approximate the spectral efficiency expression as a smooth function; thereafter we develop a generalized power iteration inspired optimization algorithm built based on the first-order optimality condition. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the spectral efficiency (around 20~29%) compared to existing distributed precoding schemes. ",

With drastic improvements in the quality and access to generative models, we answer the question: How do generated datasets influence the performance of QA models under natural distribution shifts? We perform experiments on 4 different datasets under varying amounts of distribution shift, and analyze how \"in-the-wild\" generation can help achieve domain generalization. We take a two-step generation approach, generating both contexts and QA pairs to augment existing datasets. Through our experiments, we demonstrate how augmenting reading comprehension datasets with generated data leads to better robustness towards natural distribution shifts. ",

    "abstract": "We propose DiRL, a Diversity-inducing Representation Learning technique for histopathology imaging. Self-supervised learning techniques, such as contrastive and non-contrastive approaches, have been shown to learn rich and effective representations of digitized tissue samples with limited pathologist supervision. Our analysis of vanilla SSL-pretrained models' attention distribution reveals an insightful observation: sparsity in attention, i.e, models tends to localize most of their attention to some prominent patterns in the image. Although attention sparsity can be beneficial in natural images due to these prominent patterns being the object of interest itself, this can be sub-optimal in digital pathology; this is because, unlike natural images, digital pathology scans are not object-centric, but rather a complex phenotype of various spatially intermixed biological components. Inadequate diversification of attention in these complex images could result in crucial information loss. To address this, we leverage cell segmentation to densely extract multiple histopathology-specific representations, and then propose a prior-guided dense pretext task for SSL, designed to match the multiple corresponding representations between the views. Through this, the model learns to attend to various components more closely and evenly, thus inducing adequate diversification in attention for capturing context rich representations. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis on multiple tasks across cancer types, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method and observe that the attention is more globally distributed. ",

    "title": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for an optimal counterdiabatic quantum  computation",
    "abstract": "We introduce a novel methodology that leverages the strength of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to address the counterdiabatic (CD) protocol in the optimization of quantum circuits comprised of systems with $N_{Q}$ qubits. The primary objective is to utilize physics-inspired deep learning techniques to accurately solve the time evolution of the different physical observables within the quantum system. To accomplish this objective, we embed the necessary physical information into an underlying neural network to effectively tackle the problem. In particular, we impose the hermiticity condition on all physical observables and make use of the principle of least action, guaranteeing the acquisition of the most appropriate counterdiabatic terms based on the underlying physics. The proposed approach offers a dependable alternative to address the CD driving problem, free from the constraints typically encountered in previous methodologies relying on classical numerical approximations. Our method provides a general framework to obtain optimal results from the physical observables relevant to the problem, including the external parameterization in time known as scheduling function, the gauge potential or operator involving the non-adiabatic terms, as well as the temporal evolution of the energy levels of the system, among others. The main applications of this methodology have been the $\\mathrm{H_{2}}$ and $\\mathrm{LiH}$ molecules, represented by a 2-qubit and 4-qubit systems employing the STO-3G basis. The presented results demonstrate the successful derivation of a desirable decomposition for the non-adiabatic terms, achieved through a linear combination utilizing Pauli operators. This attribute confers significant advantages to its practical implementation within quantum computing algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "The ongoing modernization of the power system, involving new equipment installations and upgrades, exposes the power system to the introduction of malware into its operation through supply chain attacks. Supply chain attacks present a significant threat to power systems, allowing cybercriminals to bypass network defenses and execute deliberate attacks at the physical layer. Given the exponential advancements in machine intelligence, cybercriminals will leverage this technology to create sophisticated and adaptable attacks that can be incorporated into supply chain attacks. We demonstrate the use of reinforcement learning for developing intelligent attacks incorporated into supply chain attacks against generation control devices. We simulate potential disturbances impacting frequency and voltage regulation. The presented method can provide valuable guidance for defending against supply chain attacks. ",

    "abstract": "A speech spoofing countermeasure (CM) that discriminates between unseen spoofed and bona fide data requires diverse training data. While many datasets use spoofed data generated by speech synthesis systems, it was recently found that data vocoded by neural vocoders were also effective as the spoofed training data. Since many neural vocoders are fast in building and generation, this study used multiple neural vocoders and created more than 9,000 hours of vocoded data on the basis of the VoxCeleb2 corpus. This study investigates how this large-scale vocoded data can improve spoofing countermeasures that use data-hungry self-supervised learning (SSL) models. Experiments demonstrated that the overall CM performance on multiple test sets improved when using features extracted by an SSL model continually trained on the vocoded data. Further improvement was observed when using a new SSL distilled from the two SSLs before and after the continual training. The CM with the distilled SSL outperformed the previous best model on challenging unseen test sets, including the ASVspoof 2019 logical access, WaveFake, and In-the-Wild. ",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) always suffered from the problem of long acquisition time. MRI reconstruction is one solution to reduce scan time by skipping certain phase-encoding lines and then restoring high-quality images from undersampled measurements. Recently, implicit neural representation (INR) has emerged as a new deep learning method that represents an object as a continuous function of spatial coordinates, and this function is normally parameterized by a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In this paper, we propose a novel MRI reconstruction method based on INR, which represents the fully-sampled images as the function of pixel coordinates and prior feature vectors of undersampled images for overcoming the generalization problem of INR. Specifically, we introduce a scale-embedded encoder to produce scale-independent pixel-specific features from MR images with different undersampled scales and then concatenate with coordinates vectors to recover fully-sampled MR images via an MLP, thus achieving arbitrary scale reconstruction. The performance of the proposed method was assessed by experimenting on publicly available MRI datasets and compared with other reconstruction methods. Our quantitative evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over alternative reconstruction methods. ",

However, successfully implementing such machine learning tools can be difficult due to the challenges in procuring sufficiently large, high-quality training datasets from experiments. In this work, we introduce Construction Zone, a Python package for rapidly generating complex nanoscale atomic structures, and develop an end-to-end workflow for creating large simulated databases for training neural networks. Construction Zone enables fast, systematic sampling of realistic nanomaterial structures, and can be used as a random structure generator for simulated databases, which is important for generating large, diverse synthetic datasets. Using HRTEM imaging as an example, we train a series of neural networks on various subsets of our simulated databases to segment nanoparticles and holistically study the data curation process to understand how various aspects of the curated simulated data -- including simulation fidelity, the distribution of atomic structures, and the distribution of imaging conditions -- affect model performance across several experimental benchmarks. Using our results, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance on experimental HRTEM images of nanoparticles from several experimental benchmarks and, further, we discuss robust strategies for consistently achieving high performance with machine learning in experimental settings using purely synthetic data.

    "abstract": "MRI is increasingly being used in the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa), with diffusion MRI (dMRI) playing an integral role. When combined with computational models, dMRI can estimate microstructural information such as cell size. Conventionally, such models are fit with a nonlinear least squares (NLLS) curve fitting approach, associated with a high computational cost. Supervised deep neural networks (DNNs) are an efficient alternative, however their performance is significantly affected by the underlying distribution of the synthetic training data. Self-supervised learning is an attractive alternative, where instead of using a separate training dataset, the network learns the features of the input data itself. This approach has only been applied to fitting of trivial dMRI models thus far. Here, we introduce a self-supervised DNN to estimate the parameters of the VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular and Restricted DIffusion for Cytometry in Tumours) model for prostate. We demonstrate, for the first time, fitting of a complex three-compartment biophysical model with machine learning without the requirement of explicit training labels. We compare the estimation performance to baseline NLLS and supervised DNN methods, observing improvement in estimation accuracy and reduction in bias with respect to ground truth values. Our approach also achieves a higher confidence level for discrimination between cancerous and benign prostate tissue in comparison to the other methods on a dataset of 20 PCa patients, indicating potential for accurate tumour characterisation.

We then perform a neural-architecture search to explore the model architecture and hyperparameter space of MPNNs to predict the band gaps of the materials identified as non-metals. The parameters in the search include the number of message-passing steps, latent size, and activation-function, among others. The top-performing models from the search are pooled into an ensemble that significantly outperforms existing models from the literature. Uncertainty quantification is evaluated with Monte-Carlo Dropout and ensembling, with the ensemble method proving superior. The domain of applicability of the ensemble model is analyzed with respect to the crystal systems, the inclusion of a Hubbard parameter in the density functional calculations, and the atomic species building up the materials.

The study here emphasizes two primary applications of hybrid classical-quantum Deep Learning models. The first application is to build a classification model for histopathological cancer detection using the quantum transfer learning strategy. The second application is to test the performance of this model for various adversarial attacks. Rather than using a single transfer learning model, the hybrid classical-quantum models are tested using multiple transfer learning models, especially ResNet18, VGG-16, Inception-v3, and AlexNet as feature extractors and integrate it with several quantum circuit-based variational quantum circuits (VQC) with high expressibility. As a result, we provide a comparative analysis of classical models and hybrid classical-quantum transfer learning models for histopathological cancer detection under several adversarial attacks. We compared the performance accuracy of the classical model with the hybrid classical-quantum model using pennylane default quantum simulator. We also observed that for histopathological cancer detection under several adversarial attacks, Hybrid Classical-Quantum (HCQ) models provided better accuracy than classical image classification models.
