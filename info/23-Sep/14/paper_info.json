    "title": "Narrowing the Gap between Supervised and Unsupervised Sentence  Representation Learning with Large Language Model",
    "abstract": "Sentence Representation Learning (SRL) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with Contrastive learning of Sentence Embeddings (CSE) as the mainstream technique due to its superior performance. An intriguing phenomenon in CSE is the significant performance gap between supervised and unsupervised methods, even when their sentence encoder and loss function are the same. Previous works attribute this performance gap to differences in two representation properties (alignment and uniformity). However, alignment and uniformity only measure the results, which means they cannot answer \"What happens during the training process that leads to the performance gap?\" and \"How can the performance gap be narrowed?\". In this paper, we conduct empirical experiments to answer these \"What\" and \"How\" questions. We first answer the \"What\" question by thoroughly comparing the behavior of supervised and unsupervised CSE during their respective training processes. From the comparison, We observe a significant difference in fitting difficulty. Thus, we introduce a metric, called Fitting Difficulty Increment (FDI), to measure the fitting difficulty gap between the evaluation dataset and the held-out training dataset, and use the metric to answer the \"What\" question. Then, based on the insights gained from the \"What\" question, we tackle the \"How\" question by increasing the fitting difficulty of the training dataset. We achieve this by leveraging the In-Context Learning (ICL) capability of the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate data that simulates complex patterns. By utilizing the hierarchical patterns in the LLM-generated data, we effectively narrow the gap between supervised and unsupervised CSE. ",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on multiple-access protocol design in a wireless network assisted by multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). By extending the existing approaches in single-user or single-RIS cases, we present two benchmark schemes for this multi-user multi-RIS scenario. Inspecting their shortcomings, a simple but efficient method coined opportunistic multi-user reflection (OMUR) is proposed. The key idea is to opportunistically select the best user as the anchor for optimizing the RISs, and non-orthogonally transmitting all users' signals simultaneously. A simplified version of OMUR exploiting random phase shifts is also proposed to avoid the complexity of RIS channel estimation. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel semantic representation, WISeR, that overcomes challenges for Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). Despite its strengths, AMR is not easily applied to languages or domains without predefined semantic frames, and its use of numbered arguments results in semantic role labels, which are not directly interpretable and are semantically overloaded for parsers. We examine the numbered arguments of predicates in AMR and convert them to thematic roles that do not require reference to semantic frames. We create a new corpus of 1K English dialogue sentences annotated in both WISeR and AMR. WISeR shows stronger inter-annotator agreement for beginner and experienced annotators, with beginners becoming proficient in WISeR annotation more quickly. Finally, we train a state-of-the-art parser on the AMR 3.0 corpus and a WISeR corpus converted from AMR 3.0. The parser is evaluated on these corpora and our dialogue corpus. The WISeR model exhibits higher accuracy than its AMR counterpart across the board, demonstrating that WISeR is easier for parsers to learn. ",

In this work, we provide a complete description of the algorithm as well as the performance optimizations that our implementation leverages to train deep networks at-scale in PyTorch. Our implementation enables fast multi-GPU distributed data-parallel training by distributing the memory and computation associated with blocks of each parameter via PyTorch's DTensor data structure and performing an AllGather primitive on the computed search directions at each iteration. This major performance enhancement enables us to achieve at most a 10% performance reduction in per-step wall-clock time compared against standard diagonal-scaling-based adaptive gradient methods. We validate our implementation by performing an ablation study on training ImageNet ResNet50, demonstrating Shampoo's superiority over standard training recipes with minimal hyperparameter tuning. ",

Through our investigation, we provide evidence that machine translation models display robustness displayed robustness against best performed known adversarial attacks, as the degree of perturbation in the output is directly proportional to the perturbation in the input. However, among underdogs, our attacks outperform alternatives, providing the best relative performance. Another strong candidate is an attack based on mixing of individual characters. ",

However, this approach often overlooks valuable knowledge that may be present in different yet potentially related auxiliary samples. When dealing with a limited amount of target data and a diverse range of source models, our paper introduces a novel approach, Distributionally Robust Optimization for Transfer Learning (TransDRO), that breaks free from strict similarity constraints. TransDRO is designed to optimize the most adversarial loss within an uncertainty set, defined as a collection of target populations generated as a convex combination of source distributions that guarantee excellent prediction performances for the target data. TransDRO effectively bridges the realms of transfer learning and distributional robustness prediction models. We establish the identifiability of TransDRO and its interpretation as a weighted average of source models closest to the baseline model. We also show that TransDRO achieves a faster convergence rate than the model fitted with the target data. Our comprehensive numerical studies and analysis of multi-institutional electronic health records data using TransDRO further substantiate the robustness and accuracy of TransDRO, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool in transfer learning applications.

In this paper, we propose a general framework that addresses the current gap between learning-based methods and regularization strategies.

While recent advancement in ADRD risk prediction have primarily relied on imaging analysis, yet not all patients undergo medical imaging before an ADRD diagnosis. Merging machine learning with claims data can reveal additional risk factors and uncover interconnections among diverse medical codes. Our goal is to utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with claims data for ADRD risk prediction. Addressing the lack of human-interpretable reasons behind these predictions, we introduce an innovative method to evaluate relationship importance and its influence on ADRD risk prediction, ensuring comprehensive interpretation. We employed Variationally Regularized Encoder-decoder Graph Neural Network (VGNN) for estimating ADRD likelihood. We created three scenarios to assess the model's efficiency, using Random Forest and Light Gradient Boost Machine as baselines. We further used our relation importance method to clarify the key relationships for ADRD risk prediction. VGNN surpassed other baseline models by 10% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic. The integration of the GNN model and relation importance interpretation could potentially play an essential role in providing valuable insight into factors that may contribute to or delay ADRD progression. Employing a GNN approach with claims data enhances ADRD risk prediction and provides insights into the impact of interconnected medical code relationships.

    "title": "Accelerating model evaluations in uncertainty propagation on tensor  grids using computational graph transformations",
    "abstract": "Methods such as non-intrusive polynomial chaos (NIPC), and stochastic collocation are frequently used for uncertainty propagation problems. Particularly for low-dimensional problems, these methods often use a tensor-product grid for sampling the space of uncertain inputs. A limitation of this approach is that it encounters a significant challenge: the number of sample points grows exponentially with the increase of uncertain inputs. Current strategies to mitigate computational costs abandon the tensor structure of sampling points, with the aim of reducing their overall count. Contrastingly, our investigation reveals that preserving the tensor structure of sample points can offer distinct advantages in specific scenarios. Notably, by manipulating the computational graph of the targeted model, it is feasible to avoid redundant evaluations at the operation level to significantly reduce the model evaluation cost on tensor-grid inputs. This paper presents a pioneering method: Accelerated Model Evaluations on Tensor grids using Computational graph transformations (AMTC). The core premise of AMTC lies in the strategic modification of the computational graph of the target model to algorithmically remove the repeated evaluations on the operation level. We implemented the AMTC method within the compiler of a new modeling language called the Computational System Design Language (CSDL). We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMTC by using it with the full-grid NIPC method to solve three low-dimensional UQ problems involving an analytical piston model, a multidisciplinary unmanned aerial vehicle design model, and a multi-point air taxi mission analysis model, respectively. For all of the test problems, AMTC reduces the model evaluation cost by between 50% and 90%, making the full-grid NIPC the most efficacious method to use among the UQ methods implemented. ",

    "abstract": "The demand for efficient processing of deep neural networks (DNNs) on embedded devices is a significant challenge limiting their deployment. Exploiting sparsity in the network's feature maps is one of the ways to reduce its inference latency. It is known that unstructured sparsity results in lower accuracy degradation with respect to structured sparsity but the former needs extensive inference engine changes to get latency benefits. To tackle this challenge, we propose a solution to induce semi-structured activation sparsity exploitable through minor runtime modifications. To attain high speedup levels at inference time, we design a sparse training procedure with awareness of the final position of the activations while computing the General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM). We extensively evaluate the proposed solution across various models for image classification and object detection tasks. Remarkably, our approach yields a speed improvement of $1.25 \\times$ with a minimal accuracy drop of $1.1\\%$ for the ResNet18 model on the ImageNet dataset. Furthermore, when combined with a state-of-the-art structured pruning method, the resulting models provide a good latency-accuracy trade-off, outperforming models that solely employ structured pruning techniques.

    "abstract": "Emulator embedded neural networks, which are a type of physics informed neural network, leverage multi-fidelity data sources for efficient design exploration of aerospace engineering systems. Multiple realizations of the neural network models are trained with different random initializations. The ensemble of model realizations is used to assess epistemic modeling uncertainty caused due to lack of training samples. This uncertainty estimation is crucial information for successful goal-oriented adaptive learning in an aerospace system design exploration. However, the costs of training the ensemble models often become prohibitive and pose a computational challenge, especially when the models are not trained in parallel during adaptive learning. In this work, a new type of emulator embedded neural network is presented using the rapid neural network paradigm. Unlike the conventional neural network training that optimizes the weights and biases of all the network layers by using gradient-based backpropagation, rapid neural network training adjusts only the last layer connection weights by applying a linear regression technique. It is found that the proposed emulator embedded neural network trains near-instantaneously, typically without loss of prediction accuracy. The proposed method is demonstrated on multiple analytical examples, as well as an aerospace flight parameter study of a generic hypersonic vehicle. ",

Although there have been many advances on different fronts ranging from SLAM to semantics, building an actionable hierarchical semantic representation of urban dynamic scenes from multiple agents is still a challenging problem. In this work, we present collaborative urban scene graphs (CURB-SG) that enable higher-order reasoning and efficient querying for many functions of automated driving. CURB-SG leverages panoptic LiDAR data from multiple agents to build large-scale maps using an effective graph-based collaborative SLAM approach that detects inter-agent loop closures. To semantically decompose the obtained 3D map, we build a lane graph from the paths of ego agents and their panoptic observations of other vehicles. Based on the connectivity of the lane graph, we segregate the environment into intersecting and non-intersecting road areas. Subsequently, we construct a multi-layered scene graph that includes lane information, the position of static landmarks and their assignment to certain map sections, other vehicles observed by the ego agents, and the pose graph from SLAM including 3D panoptic point clouds.

In this paper, we propose a novel bilevel optimization framework for GNNs inspired by the notion of Bregman distance. We demonstrate that the GNN layer proposed accordingly can effectively mitigate the over-smoothing issue by introducing a mechanism reminiscent of the \"skip connection\". We validate our theoretical results through comprehensive empirical studies in which Bregman-enhanced GNNs outperform their original counterparts in both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Furthermore, our experiments also show that Bregman GNNs can produce more robust learning accuracy even when the number of layers is high, suggesting the effectiveness of the proposed method in alleviating the over-smoothing issue.

Recently, Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) have proven useful to discriminate unexpected observations by comparing them against probabilistic predictions. However, the capability for the model to correctly distinguish between in- and out-of-training distribution observations hinges on the accuracy of these predictions, primarily affected by the class of functions the GPSSM kernel can represent. In this paper, we propose (i) a novel approach to embed existing domain knowledge in the kernel and (ii) an OoD online runtime monitor, based on receding-horizon predictions. Domain knowledge is assumed given as a dataset collected either in simulation or using a nominal model. Numerical results show that the informed kernel yields better regression quality with smaller datasets, as compared to standard kernel choices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the OoD monitor on a real quadruped navigating an indoor setting, which reliably classifies previously unseen terrains. ",

Compared to discrete representations, neural representations both scale well with increasing resolution, are continuous, and can be many-times differentiable. However, given a dataset of signals that we would like to represent, having to optimize a separate neural field for each signal is inefficient, and cannot capitalize on shared information or structures among signals. Existing generalization methods view this as a meta-learning problem and employ gradient-based meta-learning to learn an initialization which is then fine-tuned with test-time optimization, or learn hypernetworks to produce the weights of a neural field. We instead propose a new paradigm that views the large-scale training of neural representations as a part of a partially-observed neural process framework, and leverage neural process algorithms to solve this task.

    "abstract": "Deep neural network-based systems have significantly improved the performance of speaker diarization tasks. However, end-to-end neural diarization (EEND) systems often struggle to generalize to scenarios with an unseen number of speakers, while target speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD) systems tend to be overly complex. In this paper, we propose a simple attention-based encoder-decoder network for end-to-end neural diarization (AED-EEND). In our training process, we introduce a teacher-forcing strategy to address the speaker permutation problem, leading to faster model convergence. For evaluation, we propose an iterative decoding method that outputs diarization results for each speaker sequentially. Additionally, we propose an Enhancer module to enhance the frame-level speaker embeddings, enabling the model to handle scenarios with an unseen number of speakers. We also explore replacing the transformer encoder with a Conformer architecture, which better models local information. Furthermore, we discovered that commonly used simulation datasets for speaker diarization have a much higher overlap ratio compared to real data. We found that using simulated training data that is more consistent with real data can achieve an improvement in consistency. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methodologies. Our best system achieved a new state-of-the-art diarization error rate (DER) performance on all the CALLHOME (10.08%), DIHARD II (24.64%), and AMI (13.00%) evaluation benchmarks, when no oracle voice activity detection (VAD) is used. Beyond speaker diarization, our AED-EEND system also shows remarkable competitiveness as a speech type detection model. ",

    "abstract": "Industrial Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) provides deterministic mechanisms for real-time and reliable flow transmission. Increasing attention has been paid to efficient scheduling for time-sensitive flows with stringent requirements such as ultra-low latency and jitter. In TSN, the fine-grained traffic shaping protocol, cyclic queuing and forwarding (CQF), eliminates uncertain delay and frame loss by cyclic traffic forwarding and queuing. However, it inevitably causes high scheduling complexity. Moreover, complexity is quite sensitive to flow attributes and network scale. The problem stems in part from the lack of an attribute mining mechanism in existing frame-based scheduling. For time-critical industrial networks with large-scale complex flows, a so-called hyper-flow graph based scheduling scheme is proposed to improve the scheduling scalability in terms of schedulability, scheduling efficiency and latency & jitter. The hyper-flow graph is built by aggregating similar flow sets as hyper-flow nodes and designing a hierarchical scheduling framework. The flow attribute-sensitive scheduling information is embedded into the condensed maximal cliques, and reverse maps them precisely to congestion flow portions for re-scheduling. Its parallel scheduling reduces network scale induced complexity. Further, this scheme is designed in its entirety as a comprehensive scheduling algorithm GH^2. It improves the three criteria of scalability along a Pareto front. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate its superiority. Notably, GH^2 is verified its scheduling stability with a runtime of less than 100 ms for 1000 flows and near 1/430 of the SOTA FITS method for 2000 flows. ",

This technique projects one gradient vector onto the orthogonal plane of the other within conflicting client pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedGH consistently enhances multiple state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse benchmarks and non-IID scenarios.

Optical flow is low-level information directly obtained by vision-based tactile sensors, which can be transformed into other modalities like force, geometry and depth. Current vision-tactile sensors employ optical flow methods from OpenCV to estimate the deformation of markers in gels. However, these methods need to be more precise for accurately measuring the displacement of markers during large elastic deformation of the gel, as this can significantly impact the accuracy of downstream tasks. This study proposes a self-supervised optical flow method based on deep learning to achieve high accuracy in displacement measurement for vision-based tactile sensors. The proposed method employs a coarse-to-fine strategy to handle large deformations by constructing a multi-scale feature pyramid from the input image. To better deal with the elastic deformation caused by the gel, the Helmholtz velocity decomposition constraint combined with the elastic deformation constraint are adopted to address the distortion rate and area change rate, respectively. A local flow fusion module is designed to smooth the optical flow, taking into account the prior knowledge of the blurred effect of gel deformation. We trained the proposed self-supervised network using an open-source dataset and compared it with traditional and deep learning-based optical flow methods. The results show that the proposed method achieved the highest displacement measurement accuracy, thereby demonstrating its potential for enabling more precise measurement of downstream tasks using vision-based tactile sensors.

The causality between dimensions could be cursory, which hinders the comprehension of the internal relationship and the benefit of the causal graph to the neural networks (NNs). In this paper, we find that causality exists not only outside but also inside the time series because it reflects a succession of events in the real world. It inspires us to seek the relationship between internal subsequences. However, the challenges are the hardship of discovering causality from subsequences and utilizing the causal natural structures to improve NNs.

We evaluate the MCNS framework and impregnation NN with MCNS on time series classification tasks. Experimental results illustrate that our impregnation, by refining attention, shape selection classification, and pruning datasets, drives NN, even the data itself preferable accuracy and interpretability.

It fails to cover (inference-time) threats like embedding inversion and sensitive attribute inference. It is also costly in storage and computation when used to fine-tune large pre-trained language models (LMs). We propose DP-Forward, which directly perturbs embedding matrices in the forward pass of LMs. It satisfies stringent local DP requirements for training and inference data. To instantiate it using the smallest matrix-valued noise, we devise an analytic matrix Gaussian~mechanism (aMGM) by drawing possibly non-i.i.d. noise from a matrix Gaussian distribution. We then investigate perturbing outputs from different hidden (sub-)layers of LMs with aMGM noises. Its utility on three typical tasks almost hits the non-private baseline and outperforms DP-SGD by up to 7.7pp at a moderate privacy level. It saves 3$\\times$ time and memory costs compared to DP-SGD with the latest high-speed library. It also reduces the average success rates of embedding inversion and sensitive attribute inference by up to 88pp and 41pp, respectively, whereas DP-SGD fails. ",

    "abstract": "In the domain of traffic safety and road maintenance, precise detection of road damage is crucial for ensuring safe driving and prolonging road durability. However, current methods often fall short due to limited data. Prior attempts have used Generative Adversarial Networks to generate damage with diverse shapes and manually integrate it into appropriate positions. However, the problem has not been well explored and is faced with two challenges. First, they only enrich the location and shape of damage while neglect the diversity of severity levels, and the realism still needs further improvement. Second, they require a significant amount of manual effort. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach. In addition to using GAN to generate damage with various shapes, we further employ texture synthesis techniques to extract road textures. These two elements are then mixed with different weights, allowing us to control the severity of the synthesized damage, which are then embedded back into the original images via Poisson blending. Our method ensures both richness of damage severity and a better alignment with the background. To save labor costs, we leverage structural similarity for automated sample selection during embedding. Each augmented data of an original image contains versions with varying severity levels. We implement a straightforward screening strategy to mitigate distribution drift. Experiments are conducted on a public road damage dataset. The proposed method not only eliminates the need for manual labor but also achieves remarkable enhancements, improving the mAP by 4.1% and the F1-score by 4.5%. ",

    "abstract": "Traffic signs are important facilities to ensure traffic safety and smooth flow, but may be damaged due to many reasons, which poses a great safety hazard. Therefore, it is important to study a method to detect damaged traffic signs. Existing object detection techniques for damaged traffic signs are still absent. Since damaged traffic signs are closer in appearance to normal ones, it is difficult to capture the detailed local damage features of damaged traffic signs using traditional object detection methods. In this paper, we propose an improved object detection method based on YOLOv5s, namely MFL-YOLO (Mutual Feature Levels Loss enhanced YOLO). We designed a simple cross-level loss function so that each level of the model has its own role, which is beneficial for the model to be able to learn more diverse features and improve the fine granularity. The method can be applied as a plug-and-play module and it does not increase the structural complexity or the computational complexity while improving the accuracy. We also replaced the traditional convolution and CSP with the GSConv and VoVGSCSP in the neck of YOLOv5s to reduce the scale and computational complexity. Compared with YOLOv5s, our MFL-YOLO improves 4.3 and 5.1 in F1 scores and mAP, while reducing the FLOPs by 8.9%. The Grad-CAM heat map visualization shows that our model can better focus on the local details of the damaged traffic signs. In addition, we also conducted experiments on CCTSDB2021 and TT100K to further validate the generalization of our model. ",

Notably, source attribution of synthesized speech has value in forensics and intellectual property protection, but prior work in this area has certain limitations in scope. To address the gaps, we present our findings concerning the identification of the sources of synthesized speech in this paper. We investigate the existence of speech synthesis model fingerprints in the generated speech waveforms, with a focus on the acoustic model and the vocoder, and study the influence of each component on the fingerprint in the overall speech waveforms. Our research, conducted using the multi-speaker LibriTTS dataset, demonstrates two key insights: (1) vocoders and acoustic models impart distinct, model-specific fingerprints on the waveforms they generate, and (2) vocoder fingerprints are the more dominant of the two, and may mask the fingerprints from the acoustic model. These findings strongly suggest the existence of model-specific fingerprints for both the acoustic model and the vocoder, highlighting their potential utility in source identification applications.

The study finds that public sentiment and word vector representations related to transport and geopolitics have time-continuity effects on electricity demand. The experimental results show that the LSTM with textual features improves by more than 3% compared to the pure LSTM benchmark and by close to 10% over the official benchmark.

    "abstract": "Traffic prediction is a crucial topic because of its broad scope of applications in the transportation domain. Recently, various studies have achieved promising results. However, most studies assume the prediction locations have complete or at least partial historical records and cannot be extended to non-historical recorded locations. In real-life scenarios, the deployment of sensors could be limited due to budget limitations and installation availability, which makes most current models not applicable. Though few pieces of literature tried to impute traffic states at the missing locations, these methods need the data simultaneously observed at the locations with sensors, making them not applicable to prediction tasks. Another drawback is the lack of measurement of uncertainty in prediction, making prior works unsuitable for risk-sensitive tasks or involving decision-making. To fill the gap, inspired by the previous inductive graph neural network, this work proposed an uncertainty-aware framework with the ability to 1) extend prediction to missing locations with no historical records and significantly extend spatial coverage of prediction locations while reducing deployment of sensors and 2) generate probabilistic prediction with uncertainty quantification to help the management of risk and decision making in the down-stream tasks. Through extensive experiments on real-life datasets, the result shows our method achieved promising results on prediction tasks, and the uncertainty quantification gives consistent results which highly correlated with the locations with and without historical data. We also show that our model could help support sensor deployment tasks in the transportation field to achieve higher accuracy with a limited sensor deployment budget. ",

    "abstract": "The analysis of (social) networks and multi-agent systems is a central theme in Artificial Intelligence. Some line of research deals with finding groups of agents that could work together to achieve a certain goal. To this end, different notions of so-called clusters or communities have been introduced in the literature of graphs and networks. Among these, defensive alliance is a kind of quantitative group structure. However, all studies on the alliance so for have ignored one aspect that is central to the formation of alliances on a very intuitive level, assuming that the agents are preconditioned concerning their attitude towards other agents: they prefer to be in some group (alliance) together with the agents they like, so that they are happy to help each other towards their common aim, possibly then working against the agents outside of their group that they dislike. Signed networks were introduced in the psychology literature to model liking and disliking between agents, generalizing graphs in a natural way. Hence, we propose the novel notion of a defensive alliance in the context of signed networks. We then investigate several natural algorithmic questions related to this notion. These, and also combinatorial findings, connect our notion to that of correlation clustering, which is a well-established idea of finding groups of agents within a signed network. Also, we introduce a new structural parameter for signed graphs, signed neighborhood diversity snd, and exhibit a parameterized algorithm that finds a smallest defensive alliance in a signed graph.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) agents are vulnerable to adversarial disturbances, which can deteriorate task performance or compromise safety specifications. Existing methods either address safety requirements under the assumption of no adversary (e.g., safe RL) or only focus on robustness against performance adversaries (e.g., robust RL). Learning one policy that is both safe and robust remains a challenging open problem. The difficulty is how to tackle two intertwined aspects in the worst cases: feasibility and optimality. Optimality is only valid inside a feasible region, while identification of maximal feasible region must rely on learning the optimal policy. To address this issue, we propose a systematic framework to unify safe RL and robust RL, including problem formulation, iteration scheme, convergence analysis and practical algorithm design. This unification is built upon constrained two-player zero-sum Markov games. A dual policy iteration scheme is proposed, which simultaneously optimizes a task policy and a safety policy. The convergence of this iteration scheme is proved. Furthermore, we design a deep RL algorithm for practical implementation, called dually robust actor-critic (DRAC). The evaluations with safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that DRAC achieves high performance and persistent safety under all scenarios (no adversary, safety adversary, performance adversary), outperforming all baselines significantly.

However, correlations between process parameters, thermal profiles, and resulting microstructure in AFSD remain poorly understood. This hinders process optimization for properties. This work employs a cutting-edge framework combining supervised machine learning (SML) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict peak temperature distribution in AFSD from process parameters. Eight regression algorithms were implemented for SML modeling, while four PINNs leveraged governing equations for transport, wave propagation, heat transfer, and quantum mechanics. Across multiple statistical measures, ensemble techniques like gradient boosting proved superior for SML, with lowest MSE of 165.78. The integrated ML approach was also applied to classify deposition quality from process factors, with logistic regression delivering robust accuracy. By fusing data-driven learning and fundamental physics, this dual methodology provides comprehensive insights into tailoring microstructure through thermal management in AFSD. The work demonstrates the power of bridging statistical and physics-based modeling for elucidating AM process-property relationships. ",

    "abstract": "Seminal work of Eyal and Sirer (2014) establishes that a strategic Bitcoin miner may strictly profit by deviating from the intended Bitcoin protocol, using a strategy now termed *selfish mining*. More specifically, any miner with $>1/3$ of the total hashrate can earn bitcoin at a faster rate by selfish mining than by following the intended protocol (depending on network conditions, a lower fraction of hashrate may also suffice). One convincing critique of selfish mining in practice is that the presence of a selfish miner is *statistically detectable*: the pattern of orphaned blocks created by the presence of a selfish miner cannot be explained by natural network delays. Therefore, if an attacker chooses to selfish mine, users can detect this, and this may (significantly) negatively impact the value of BTC. So while the attacker may get slightly more bitcoin by selfish mining, these bitcoin may be worth significantly less USD. We develop a selfish mining variant that is provably *statistically undetectable*: the pattern of orphaned blocks is statistically identical to a world with only honest miners but higher network delay. Specifically, we consider a stylized model where honest miners with network delay produce orphaned blocks at each height independently with probability $\\beta'$. We propose a selfish mining strategy that instead produces orphaned blocks at each height independently with probability $\\beta > \\beta'$. We further show that our strategy is strictly profitable for attackers with $38.2\\% \\ll 50\\%$ of the total hashrate (and this holds for all natural orphan rates $\\beta'$). ",

Several researchers have studied the stability of spectral clustering under local differential privacy with the additional assumption that the underlying networks are generated from the stochastic block model (SBM). However, we argue that this assumption is too restrictive since social networks do not originate from the SBM. Thus, delve into an analysis for general graphs in this work. Our primary focus is the edge flipping method -- a common technique for protecting local differential privacy. On a positive side, our findings suggest that even when the edges of an $n$-vertex graph satisfying some reasonable well-clustering assumptions are flipped with a probability of $O(\\log n/n)$, the clustering outcomes are largely consistent. Empirical tests further corroborate these theoretical findings. Conversely, although clustering outcomes have been stable for dense and well-clustered graphs produced from the SBM, we show that in general, spectral clustering may yield highly erratic results on certain dense and well-clustered graphs when the flipping probability is $\\omega(\\log n/n)$. This indicates that the best privacy budget obtainable for general graphs is $\\Theta(\\log n)$. ",

    "abstract": "The self-media era provides us tremendous high quality videos. Unfortunately, frequent video copyright infringements are now seriously damaging the interests and enthusiasm of video creators. Identifying infringing videos is therefore a compelling task. Current state-of-the-art methods tend to simply feed high-dimensional mixed video features into deep neural networks and count on the networks to extract useful representations. Despite its simplicity, this paradigm heavily relies on the original entangled features and lacks constraints guaranteeing that useful task-relevant semantics are extracted from the features. In this paper, we seek to tackle the above challenges from two aspects: (1) We propose to disentangle an original high-dimensional feature into multiple sub-features, explicitly disentangling the feature into exclusive lower-dimensional components. We expect the sub-features to encode non-overlapping semantics of the original feature and remove redundant information. (2) On top of the disentangled sub-features, we further learn an auxiliary feature to enhance the sub-features. We theoretically analyzed the mutual information between the label and the disentangled features, arriving at a loss that maximizes the extraction of task-relevant information from the original feature. Extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmark datasets (i.e., SVD and VCSL) demonstrate that our method achieves 90.1% TOP-100 mAP on the large-scale SVD dataset and also sets the new state-of-the-art on the VCSL benchmark dataset.

The driving models used in these vehicles are based on neural networks, which can be difficult to validate. However, ensuring the safety of these models is crucial. Traditional field tests can be costly, time-consuming, and dangerous. To address these issues, scenario-based closed-loop simulations can simulate many hours of vehicle operation in a shorter amount of time and allow for specific investigation of important situations. Nonetheless, the detection of relevant traffic scenarios that also offer substantial testing benefits remains a significant challenge. To address this need, in this paper we build an imitation learning based trajectory prediction for traffic participants. We combine an image-based (CNN) approach to represent spatial environmental factors and a graph-based (GNN) approach to specifically represent relations between traffic participants. In our understanding, traffic scenes that are highly interactive due to the network's significant utilization of the social component are more pertinent for a validation process. Therefore, we propose to use the activity of such sub networks as a measure of interactivity of a traffic scene. We evaluate our model using a motion dataset and discuss the value of the relationship information with respect to different traffic situations. ",

To mitigate the aforementioned issues, the present research posits a GNNs based multi-behavior recommendation model MB-SVD that utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) graphs to enhance model performance. In particular, MB-SVD considers user preferences under different behaviors, improving recommendation effectiveness while better addressing the cold-start problem. Our model introduces an innovative methodology, which subsume multi-behavior contrastive learning paradigm to proficiently discern the intricate interconnections among heterogeneous manifestations of user behavior and generates SVD graphs to automate the distillation of crucial multi-behavior self-supervised information for robust graph augmentation.

    "title": "Lotaru: Locally Predicting Workflow Task Runtimes for Resource  Management on Heterogeneous Infrastructures",
    "abstract": "Many resource management techniques for task scheduling, energy and carbon efficiency, and cost optimization in workflows rely on a-priori task runtime knowledge. Building runtime prediction models on historical data is often not feasible in practice as workflows, their input data, and the cluster infrastructure change. Online methods, on the other hand, which estimate task runtimes on specific machines while the workflow is running, have to cope with a lack of measurements during start-up. Frequently, scientific workflows are executed on heterogeneous infrastructures consisting of machines with different CPU, I/O, and memory configurations, further complicating predicting runtimes due to different task runtimes on different machine types. This paper presents Lotaru, a method for locally predicting the runtimes of scientific workflow tasks before they are executed on heterogeneous compute clusters. Crucially, our approach does not rely on historical data and copes with a lack of training data during the start-up. To this end, we use microbenchmarks, reduce the input data to quickly profile the workflow locally, and predict a task's runtime with a Bayesian linear regression based on the gathered data points from the local workflow execution and the microbenchmarks. Due to its Bayesian approach, Lotaru provides uncertainty estimates that can be used for advanced scheduling methods on distributed cluster infrastructures. In our evaluation with five real-world scientific workflows, our method outperforms two state-of-the-art runtime prediction baselines and decreases the absolute prediction error by more than 12.5%. In a second set of experiments, the prediction performance of our method, using the predicted runtimes for state-of-the-art scheduling, carbon reduction, and cost prediction, enables results close to those achieved with perfect prior knowledge of runtimes.

    "abstract": "Emotion detection is a critical technology extensively employed in diverse fields. While the incorporation of commonsense knowledge has proven beneficial for existing emotion detection methods, dialogue-based emotion detection encounters numerous difficulties and challenges due to human agency and the variability of dialogue content.In dialogues, human emotions tend to accumulate in bursts. However, they are often implicitly expressed. This implies that many genuine emotions remain concealed within a plethora of unrelated words and dialogues.In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Causal Disentanglement Model based on hidden variable separation, which is founded on the separation of hidden variables. This model effectively decomposes the content of dialogues and investigates the temporal accumulation of emotions, thereby enabling more precise emotion recognition. First, we introduce a novel Causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to establish the correlation between hidden emotional information and other observed elements. Subsequently, our approach utilizes pre-extracted personal attributes and utterance topics as guiding factors for the distribution of hidden variables, aiming to separate irrelevant ones. Specifically, we propose a dynamic temporal disentanglement model to infer the propagation of utterances and hidden variables, enabling the accumulation of emotion-related information throughout the conversation. To guide this disentanglement process, we leverage the ChatGPT-4.0 and LSTM networks to extract utterance topics and personal attributes as observed information.Finally, we test our approach on two popular datasets in dialogue emotion detection and relevant experimental results verified the model's superiority.

The main limitations of the current HAR models are their complex structures and lengthy training time.

TransNet decomposes the complex 3D-CNNs into 2D- and 1D-CNNs, where the 2D- and 1D-CNN components extract spatial features and temporal patterns in videos, respectively. Benefiting from its concise architecture, TransNet is ideally compatible with any pretrained state-of-the-art 2D-CNN models in other fields, being transferred to serve the HAR task. In other words, it naturally leverages the power and success of transfer learning for HAR, bringing huge advantages in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experimental results and the comparison with the state-of-the-art models demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed TransNet in HAR in terms of flexibility, model complexity, training speed and classification accuracy.

Cardiac dominance classification is essential for SYNTAX score estimation, which is a tool used to determine the complexity of coronary artery disease and guide patient selection toward optimal revascularization strategy. Objectives. Cardiac dominance classification algorithm based on the analysis of right coronary artery (RCA) angiograms using neural network Method. We employed convolutional neural network ConvNext and Swin transformer for 2D image (frames) classification, along with a majority vote for cardio angiographic view classification. An auxiliary network was also used to detect irrelevant images which were then excluded from the data set. Our data set consisted of 828 angiographic studies, 192 of them being patients with left dominance. Results. 5-fold cross validation gave the following dominance classification metrics (p=95%): macro recall=93.1%, accuracy=93.5%, macro F1=89.2%. The most common case in which the model regularly failed was RCA occlusion, as it requires utilization of LCA information. Another cause for false prediction is a small diameter combined with poor quality cardio angiographic view. In such cases, cardiac dominance classification can be complex and may require discussion among specialists to reach an accurate conclusion. Conclusion. The use of machine learning approaches to classify cardiac dominance based on RCA alone has been shown to be successful with satisfactory accuracy. However, for higher accuracy, it is necessary to utilize LCA information in the case of an occluded RCA and detect cases where there is high uncertainty. ",

Existing black-box adversarial attacks on voice assistants either apply substitution models or leverage the intermediate model output to estimate the gradients for crafting adversarial audio samples. However, these attack approaches require a significant amount of queries with a lengthy training stage. PhantomSound leverages the decision-based attack to produce effective adversarial audios, and reduces the number of queries by optimizing the gradient estimation. In the experiments, we perform our attack against 4 different speech-to-text APIs under 3 real-world scenarios to demonstrate the real-time attack impact. The results show that PhantomSound is practical and robust in attacking 5 popular commercial voice controllable devices over the air, and is able to bypass 3 liveness detection mechanisms with >95% success rate. The benchmark result shows that PhantomSound can generate adversarial examples and launch the attack in a few minutes. We significantly enhance the query efficiency and reduce the cost of a successful untargeted and targeted adversarial attack by 93.1% and 65.5% compared with the state-of-the-art black-box attacks, using merely ~300 queries (~5 minutes) and ~1,500 queries (~25 minutes), respectively.

In this work, we propose a backdoor attack MASTERKEY, to compromise the SV models. Different from previous attacks, we focus on a real-world practical setting where the attacker possesses no knowledge of the intended victim. To design MASTERKEY, we investigate the limitation of existing poisoning attacks against unseen targets. Then, we optimize a universal backdoor that is capable of attacking arbitrary targets. Next, we embed the speaker's characteristics and semantics information into the backdoor, making it imperceptible. Finally, we estimate the channel distortion and integrate it into the backdoor. We validate our attack on 6 popular SV models. Specifically, we poison a total of 53 models and use our trigger to attack 16,430 enrolled speakers, composed of 310 target speakers enrolled in 53 poisoned models. Our attack achieves 100% attack success rate with a 15% poison rate. By decreasing the poison rate to 3%, the attack success rate remains around 50%. We validate our attack in 3 real-world scenarios and successfully demonstrate the attack through both over-the-air and over-the-telephony-line scenarios. ",

Recent advancements in GZSL have been expedited by incorporating contrastive-learning-based (instance-based) embedding in generative networks and leveraging the semantic relationship between data points. However, existing embedding architectures suffer from two limitations: (1) limited discriminability of synthetic features' embedding without considering fine-grained cluster structures; (2) inflexible optimization due to restricted scaling mechanisms on existing contrastive embedding networks, leading to overlapped representations in the embedding space. To enhance the quality of representations in the embedding space, as mentioned in (1), we propose a margin-based prototypical contrastive learning embedding network that reaps the benefits of prototype-data (cluster quality enhancement) and implicit data-data (fine-grained representations) interaction while providing substantial cluster supervision to the embedding network and the generator. To tackle (2), we propose an instance adaptive contrastive loss that leads to generalized representations for unseen labels with increased inter-class margin. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation, we show that our method can outperform the current state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets. Our approach also consistently achieves the best unseen performance in the GZSL setting. ",

We parameterize the RCI set as a configuration-constrained polytope whose facets have a fixed orientation and variable offset. This allows us to define the vertices of the polytopic set in terms of its offset. By exploiting this property, an RCI set and associated vertex control inputs are computed by solving a single linear programming (LP) problem, formulated based on a data-based invariance condition and system constraints. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach via two numerical examples. The proposed method can generate RCI sets that are of comparable size to those obtained by a model-based method in which exact knowledge of the system matrices is assumed. We show that RCI sets can be synthesized even with a relatively small number of data samples, if the gathered data satisfy certain excitation conditions. ",

Previous studies mainly modeled API recommendation as the recommendation task, which can recommend multiple candidate APIs for the given query, and developers may not yet be able to find what they need. Motivated by the neural machine translation research domain, we can model this problem as the generation task, which aims to directly generate the required API for the developer query. After our preliminary investigation, we find the performance of this intuitive approach is not promising. The reason is that there exists an error when generating the prefixes of the API. However, developers may know certain API prefix information during actual development in most cases. Therefore, we model this problem as the automatic completion task and propose a novel approach APICom based on prompt learning, which can generate API related to the query according to the prompts (i.e., API prefix information). Moreover, the effectiveness of APICom highly depends on the quality of the training dataset. In this study, we further design a novel gradient-based adversarial training method {\\atpart} for data augmentation, which can improve the normalized stability when generating adversarial examples. To evaluate the effectiveness of APICom, we consider a corpus of 33k developer queries and corresponding APIs. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, our experimental results show that APICom can outperform all baselines by at least 40.02\\%, 13.20\\%, and 16.31\\% in terms of the performance measures EM@1, MRR, and MAP.

To this end, we propose Frequency-aware Image Restoration (FAIR), a novel self-supervised image restoration task that restores images from their high-frequency components. It enables precise reconstruction of normal patterns while mitigating unfavorable generalization to anomalies. Using only a simple vanilla UNet, FAIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with higher efficiency on various defect detection datasets. Code: https://github.com/liutongkun/FAIR. ",

    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving vector mean estimation is a crucial primitive in federated analytics. Existing practices usually resort to Local Differentiated Privacy (LDP) mechanisms that inject random noise into users' vectors when communicating with users and the central server. Due to the privacy-utility trade-off, the privacy budget has been widely recognized as the bottleneck resource that requires well-provisioning. In this paper, we explore the possibility of privacy budget recycling and propose a novel Chained-DP framework enabling users to carry out data aggregation sequentially to recycle the privacy budget. We establish a sequential game to model the user interactions in our framework. We theoretically show the mathematical nature of the sequential game, solve its Nash Equilibrium, and design an incentive mechanism with provable economic properties. We further derive a differentially privacy-guaranteed protocol to alleviate potential privacy collusion attacks to avoid holistic exposure. Our numerical simulation validates the effectiveness of Chained-DP, showing that it can significantly save privacy budget and lower estimation error compared to the traditional LDP mechanism. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy called SupFusion, which provides an auxiliary feature level supervision for effective LiDAR-Camera fusion and significantly boosts detection performance. Our strategy involves a data enhancement method named Polar Sampling, which densifies sparse objects and trains an assistant model to generate high-quality features as the supervision. These features are then used to train the LiDAR-Camera fusion model, where the fusion feature is optimized to simulate the generated high-quality features. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective deep fusion module, which contiguously gains superior performance compared with previous fusion methods with SupFusion strategy. In such a manner, our proposal shares the following advantages. Firstly, SupFusion introduces auxiliary feature-level supervision which could boost LiDAR-Camera detection performance without introducing extra inference costs. Secondly, the proposed deep fusion could continuously improve the detector's abilities. Our proposed SupFusion and deep fusion module is plug-and-play, we make extensive experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. Specifically, we gain around 2% 3D mAP improvements on KITTI benchmark based on multiple LiDAR-Camera 3D detectors. ",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning is emerging as a privacy-preserving model training approach in distributed edge applications. As such, most edge deployments are heterogeneous in nature i.e., their sensing capabilities and environments vary across deployments. This edge heterogeneity violates the independence and identical distribution (IID) property of local data across clients and produces biased global models i.e. models that contribute to unfair decision-making and discrimination against a particular community or a group. Existing bias mitigation techniques only focus on bias generated from label heterogeneity in non-IID data without accounting for domain variations due to feature heterogeneity and do not address global group-fairness property. Our work proposes a group-fair FL framework that minimizes group-bias while preserving privacy and without resource utilization overhead. Our main idea is to leverage average conditional probabilities to compute a cross-domain group \\textit{importance weights} derived from heterogeneous training data to optimize the performance of the worst-performing group using a modified multiplicative weights update method. Additionally, we propose regularization techniques to minimize the difference between the worst and best-performing groups while making sure through our thresholding mechanism to strike a balance between bias reduction and group performance degradation. Our evaluation of human emotion recognition and image classification benchmarks assesses the fair decision-making of our framework in real-world heterogeneous settings. ",

These applications encompass object recognition, image retrieval, and video analysis. LCD consists in identifying whether a robot has returned to a previously visited location, referred to as a loop, and then estimating the related roto-translation with respect to the analyzed location. Despite the numerous advantages of radar sensors, such as their ability to operate under diverse weather conditions and provide a wider range of view compared to other commonly used sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDARs), integrating radar data remains an arduous task due to intrinsic noise and distortion. To address this challenge, this research introduces RadarLCD, a novel supervised deep learning pipeline specifically designed for Loop Closure Detection using the FMCW Radar (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) sensor. RadarLCD, a learning-based LCD methodology explicitly designed for radar systems, makes a significant contribution by leveraging the pre-trained HERO (Hybrid Estimation Radar Odometry) model. Being originally developed for radar odometry, HERO's features are used to select key points crucial for LCD tasks. The methodology undergoes evaluation across a variety of FMCW Radar dataset scenes, and it is compared to state-of-the-art systems such as Scan Context for Place Recognition and ICP for Loop Closure. The results demonstrate that RadarLCD surpasses the alternatives in multiple aspects of Loop Closure Detection. ",

A subset of viewpoint-agnostic monocular 3D detection methods also do not explicitly leverage scene homography or geometry during training, meaning that a model trained thusly can detect objects in images from arbitrary viewpoints. Such works predict the projections of the 3D bounding boxes on the image plane to estimate the location of the 3D boxes, but these projections are not rectangular so the calculation of IoU between these projected polygons is not straightforward. This work proposes an efficient, fully differentiable algorithm for the calculation of IoU between two convex polygons, which can be utilized to compute the IoU between two 3D bounding box footprints viewed from an arbitrary angle. We test the performance of the proposed polygon IoU loss (PIoU loss) on three state-of-the-art viewpoint-agnostic 3D detection models. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed PIoU loss converges faster than L1 loss and that in 3D detection models, a combination of PIoU loss and L1 loss gives better results than L1 loss alone (+1.64% AP70 for MonoCon on cars, +0.18% AP70 for RTM3D on cars, and +0.83%/+2.46% AP50/AP25 for MonoRCNN on cyclists).

While RGB-D systems are expected to be more robust to adversarial examples than RGB-only systems, they have also been proven to be highly vulnerable. Their robustness is similar even when the adversarial examples are generated by altering only the original images' colors. Different works highlighted the vulnerability of RGB-D systems; however, there is a lacking of technical explanations for this weakness. Hence, in our work, we bridge this gap by investigating the learned deep representation of RGB-D systems, discovering that color features make the function learned by the network more complex and, thus, more sensitive to small perturbations. To mitigate this problem, we propose a defense based on a detection mechanism that makes RGB-D systems more robust against adversarial examples. We empirically show that this defense improves the performances of RGB-D systems against adversarial examples even when they are computed ad-hoc to circumvent this detection mechanism, and that is also more effective than adversarial training.

    "abstract": "In the autoencoder based anomaly detection paradigm, implementing the autoencoder in edge devices capable of learning in real-time is exceedingly challenging due to limited hardware, energy, and computational resources. We show that these limitations can be addressed by designing an autoencoder with low-resolution non-volatile memory-based synapses and employing an effective quantized neural network learning algorithm. We propose a ferromagnetic racetrack with engineered notches hosting a magnetic domain wall (DW) as the autoencoder synapses, where limited state (5-state) synaptic weights are manipulated by spin orbit torque (SOT) current pulses. The performance of anomaly detection of the proposed autoencoder model is evaluated on the NSL-KDD dataset. Limited resolution and DW device stochasticity aware training of the autoencoder is performed, which yields comparable anomaly detection performance to the autoencoder having floating-point precision weights. While the limited number of quantized states and the inherent stochastic nature of DW synaptic weights in nanoscale devices are known to negatively impact the performance, our hardware-aware training algorithm is shown to leverage these imperfect device characteristics to generate an improvement in anomaly detection accuracy (90.98%) compared to accuracy obtained with floating-point trained weights. Furthermore, our DW-based approach demonstrates a remarkable reduction of at least three orders of magnitude in weight updates during training compared to the floating-point approach, implying substantial energy savings for our method. This work could stimulate the development of extremely energy efficient non-volatile multi-state synapse-based processors that can perform real-time training and inference on the edge with unsupervised data.

Both of these bounds are tight. The former result also follows from a very recent and independent work of Cheong et al.\\cite{cheong2023weakly} who showed that the maximum size of weakly and strongly fan-planar graphs coincide. By combining this result with the bound of Kaufmann and Ueckerdt\\cite{KU22} on the size of strongly fan-planar graphs and results of Brandenburg\\cite{Br20} by which the maximum size of adjacency-crossing graphs equals the maximum size of fan-crossing graphs which in turn equals the maximum size of weakly fan-planar graphs, one obtains the same bound on the size of adjacency-crossing graphs.

Compared with quantifying DCS manually, a more efficient and time-saving manner is provided by deep keypoint localization networks, which can be implemented in either the coordinate or the image domain. However, the vertebral visualization features often lead to abnormal topological structures during keypoint localization, including keypoint distortion with edges and weakly connected structures, which cannot be fully suppressed in either the coordinate or image domain alone. To overcome this limitation, a keypoint-edge and a reparameterization modules are utilized to restrict these abnormal structures in a cross-domain manner. The keypoint-edge constraint module restricts the keypoints on the edges of vertebrae, which ensures that the distribution pattern of keypoint coordinates is consistent with those for DCS quantification. And the reparameterization module constrains the weakly connected structures in image-domain heatmaps with coordinates combined. Moreover, the cross-domain network improves spatial generalization by utilizing heatmaps and incorporating coordinates for accurate localization, which avoids the trade-off between these two properties in an individual domain. Comprehensive results of distinct quantification tasks show the superiority and generability of the proposed Topology-inspired Cross-domain Network (TCN) compared with other competing localization methods.

We use this techniques to explore what neural networks learn about quantum optics experiments. Our story begins by training a deep neural networks on the properties of quantum systems. Once trained, we \"invert\" the neural network -- effectively asking how it imagines a quantum system with a specific property, and how it would continuously modify the quantum system to change a property. We find that the network can shift the initial distribution of properties of the quantum system, and we can conceptualize the learned strategies of the neural network. Interestingly, we find that, in the first layers, the neural network identifies simple properties, while in the deeper ones, it can identify complex quantum structures and even quantum entanglement.
