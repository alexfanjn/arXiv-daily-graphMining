    "title": "A Powerful Robust Cubic Hermite Collocation Method for the Numerical  Calculations and Simulations of the Equal Width Wave Equation",
    "abstract": "In this article, non-linear Equal Width-Wave (EW) equation will be numerically solved . For this aim, the non-linear term in the equation is firstly linearized by Rubin-Graves type approach. After that, to reduce the equation into a solvable discretized linear algebraic equation system which is the essential part of this study, the Crank-Nicolson type approximation and cubic Hermite collocation method are respectively applied to obtain the integration in the temporal and spatial domain directions. To be able to illustrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed method, six test model problems that is single solitary wave, the interaction of two solitary waves, the interaction of three solitary waves, the Maxwellian initial condition, undular bore and finally soliton collision will be taken into consideration and solved. Since only the single solitary wave has an analytical solution among these solitary waves, the error norms Linf and L2 are computed and compared to a few of the previous works available in the literature. Furthermore, the widely used three invariants I1, I2 and I3 of the proposed problems during the simulations are computed and presented. Beside those, the relative changes in those invariants are presented. Also, a comparison of the error norms Linf and L2 and these invariants obviously shows that the proposed scheme produces better and compatible results than most of the previous works using the same parameters. Finally, von Neumann analysis has shown that the present scheme is unconditionally stable. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a study on the prediction of outcomes in matches of the electronic game League of Legends (LoL) using machine learning techniques. With the aim of exploring the ability to predict real-time results, considering different variables and stages of the match, we highlight the use of unpublished data as a fundamental part of this process. With the increasing popularity of LoL and the emergence of tournaments, betting related to the game has also emerged, making the investigation in this area even more relevant. A variety of models were evaluated and the results were encouraging. A model based on LightGBM showed the best performance, achieving an average accuracy of 81.62\\% in intermediate stages of the match when the percentage of elapsed time was between 60\\% and 80\\%. On the other hand, the Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting models proved to be more effective in early stages of the game, with promising results. This study contributes to the field of machine learning applied to electronic games, providing valuable insights into real-time prediction in League of Legends. The results obtained may be relevant for both players seeking to improve their strategies and the betting industry related to the game. ",

Our findings reveal that MaskFeat achieves performance superior to pose-based and supervised video models, with a top-1 accuracy of 79.02% on gloss-based WLASL2000. Furthermore, we analyze these models' ability to produce representations of ASL signs using linear probing on diverse phonological features. This study underscores the value of architecture and pre-training task choices in ISLR. Specifically, our results on WLASL2000 highlight the power of masked reconstruction pre-training, and our linear probing results demonstrate the importance of hierarchical vision transformers for sign language representation.

However, the length of speech representation and text representation is inconsistent. Although the previous method up-samples the text representation to align with acoustic modality, it may not match the expected actual duration. In this paper, we proposed novel representations match strategy through down-sampling acoustic representation to align with text modality. By introducing a continuous integrate-and-fire (CIF) module generating acoustic representations consistent with token length, our ASR model can learn unified representations from both modalities better, allowing for domain adaptation using text-only data of the target domain. Experiment results of new domain data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

    "title": "Effective Multi-Graph Neural Networks for Illicit Account Detection on  Cryptocurrency Transaction Networks",
    "abstract": "We study illicit account detection on transaction networks of cryptocurrencies that are increasi_testngly important in online financial markets. The surge of illicit activities on cryptocurrencies has resulted in billions of losses from normal users. Existing solutions either rely on tedious feature engineering to get handcrafted features, or are inadequate to fully utilize the rich semantics of cryptocurrency transaction data, and consequently, yield sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we formulate the illicit account detection problem as a classification task over directed multigraphs with edge attributes, and present DIAM, a novel multi-graph neural network model to effectively detect illicit accounts on large transaction networks. First, DIAM includes an Edge2Seq module that automatically learns effective node representations preserving intrinsic transaction patterns of parallel edges, by considering both edge attributes and directed edge sequence dependencies. Then utilizing the multigraph topology, DIAM employs a new Multigraph Discrepancy (MGD) module with a well-designed message passing mechanism to capture the discrepant features between normal and illicit nodes, supported by an attention mechanism. Assembling all techniques, DIAM is trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments, comparing against 14 existing solutions on 4 large cryptocurrency datasets of Bitcoin and Ethereum, demonstrate that DIAM consistently achieves the best performance to accurately detect illicit accounts, while being efficient. For instance, on a Bitcoin dataset with 20 million nodes and 203 million edges, DIAM achieves F1 score 96.55%, significantly higher than the F1 score 83.92% of the best competitor. ",

    "abstract": "Matrix/array analysis of networks can provide significant insight into their behavior and aid in their operation and protection. Prior work has demonstrated the analytic, performance, and compression capabilities of GraphBLAS (graphblas.org) hypersparse matrices and D4M (d4m.mit.edu) associative arrays (a mathematical superset of matrices). Obtaining the benefits of these capabilities requires integrating them into operational systems, which comes with its own unique challenges. This paper describes two examples of real-time operational implementations. First, is an operational GraphBLAS implementation that constructs anonymized hypersparse matrices on a high-bandwidth network tap. Second, is an operational D4M implementation that analyzes daily cloud gateway logs. The architectures of these implementations are presented. Detailed measurements of the resources and the performance are collected and analyzed. The implementations are capable of meeting their operational requirements using modest computational resources (a couple of processing cores). GraphBLAS is well-suited for low-level analysis of high-bandwidth connections with relatively structured network data. D4M is well-suited for higher-level analysis of more unstructured data. This work demonstrates that these technologies can be implemented in operational settings. ",

It is therefore crucial to implement effective social risk management strategies at the point of care. Objective: To develop an EHR-based machine learning (ML) analytical pipeline to identify the unmet social needs associated with hospitalization risk in patients with T2D. Methods: We identified 10,192 T2D patients from the EHR data (from 2012 to 2022) from the University of Florida Health Integrated Data Repository, including contextual SDoH (e.g., neighborhood deprivation) and individual-level SDoH (e.g., housing stability). We developed an electronic health records (EHR)-based machine learning (ML) analytic pipeline, namely individualized polysocial risk score (iPsRS), to identify high social risk associated with hospitalizations in T2D patients, along with explainable AI (XAI) techniques and fairness assessment and optimization. Results: Our iPsRS achieved a C statistic of 0.72 in predicting 1-year hospitalization after fairness optimization across racial-ethnic groups. The iPsRS showed excellent utility for capturing individuals at high hospitalization risk; the actual 1-year hospitalization rate in the top 5% of iPsRS was ~13 times as high as the bottom decile. Conclusion: Our ML pipeline iPsRS can fairly and accurately screen for patients who have increased social risk leading to hospitalization in T2D patients. ",

It has been shown that traditional adversarial training, which seeks to minimize a classifier's susceptibility to malicious perturbations, increases the cost of generated recourse; with larger adversarial training radii correlating with higher recourse costs. From the perspective of algorithmic recourse, however, the appropriate adversarial training radius has always been unknown. Another recent line of work has motivated adversarial training with adaptive training radii to address the issue of instance-wise variable adversarial vulnerability, showing success in domains with unknown attack radii. This work studies the effects of adaptive adversarial training on algorithmic recourse costs. We establish that the improvements in model robustness induced by adaptive adversarial training show little effect on algorithmic recourse costs, providing a potential avenue for affordable robustness in domains where recoursability is critical.

This issue complicates the deployment of continual learners in realistic environments where agents are not explicitly informed when novel categories are encountered. A common family of techniques for detecting novelty relies on thresholds of similarity between observed data points and the data used for training. However, these methods often require manually specifying (ahead of time) the value of these thresholds, and are therefore incapable of adapting to the nature of the data. We propose a new method for automatically selecting these thresholds utilizing a linear search and leave-one-out cross-validation on the ID classes.

We aimed to develop a model leveraging information extracted from radiation pretreatment planning CT to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) in ASCC patients after CRT. Methods: Radiomics features were extracted from planning CT images of 96 ASCC patients. Following pre-feature selection, the optimal feature set was selected via step-forward feature selection with a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. The RFS prediction was generated from a radiomics-clinical combined model based on an optimal feature set with five repeats of five-fold cross validation. The risk stratification ability of the proposed model was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Shape- and texture-based radiomics features significantly predicted RFS. Compared to a clinical-only model, radiomics-clinical combined model achieves better performance in the testing cohort with higher C-index (0.80 vs 0.73) and AUC (0.84 vs 0.79 for 1-year RFS, 0.84 vs 0.78 for 2-year RFS, and 0.86 vs 0.83 for 3-year RFS), leading to distinctive high- and low-risk of recurrence groups (p<0.001). Conclusions: A treatment planning CT based radiomics and clinical combined model had improved prognostic performance in predicting RFS for ASCC patients treated with CRT as compared to a model using clinical features only.

The goal is to enable accurate mapping and long-range navigation with practical applications in domains such as autonomous construction, military engineering missions, and exploration of non-Earth planets. The proposed system - Terrain-Referenced Assured Engineer Localization System (TRAELS) - integrates pose estimates produced by two complementary terrain referenced navigation (TRN) methods with wheel odometry and inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Unlike simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems that require loop closures, the described approach maintains accuracy over long distances and one-way missions without the need to revisit previous positions. Evaluation of TRAELS is performed across a range of environments. In regions where a combination of distinctive geometric and ground surface features are present, the developed TRN methods are leveraged by TRAELS to consistently achieve an absolute trajectory error of less than 3.0 m. The approach is also shown to be capable of recovering from large accumulated drift when traversing feature-sparse areas, which is essential in ensuring robust performance of the system across a wide variety of challenging GNSS-denied environments. Overall, the effectiveness of the system in providing precise localization and mapping capabilities in challenging GNSS-denied environments is demonstrated and an analysis is performed leading to insights for improving TRN approaches for UGVs.

    "title": "Causal Structure Recovery of Linear Dynamical Systems: An FFT based  Approach",
    "abstract": "Learning causal effects from data is a fundamental and well-studied problem across science, especially when the cause-effect relationship is static in nature. However, causal effect is less explored when there are dynamical dependencies, i.e., when dependencies exist between entities across time. Identifying dynamic causal effects from time-series observations is computationally expensive when compared to the static scenario. We demonstrate that the computational complexity of recovering the causation structure for the vector auto-regressive (VAR) model is $O(Tn^3N^2)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes, $T$ is the number of samples, and $N$ is the largest time-lag in the dependency between entities. We report a method, with a reduced complexity of $O(Tn^3 \\log N)$, to recover the causation structure to obtain frequency-domain (FD) representations of time-series. Since FFT accumulates all the time dependencies on every frequency, causal inference can be performed efficiently by considering the state variables as random variables at any given frequency. We additionally show that, for systems with interactions that are LTI, do-calculus machinery can be realized in the FD resulting in versions of the classical single-door (with cycles), front and backdoor criteria. We demonstrate, for a large class of problems, graph reconstruction using multivariate Wiener projections results in a significant computational advantage with $O(n)$ complexity over reconstruction algorithms such as the PC algorithm which has $O(n^q)$ complexity, where $q$ is the maximum neighborhood size. This advantage accrues due to some remarkable properties of the phase response of the frequency-dependent Wiener coefficients which is not present in any time-domain approach. ",

To curtail such losses, it is possible to implement a system that takes input from a new employee regarding the challenges he/she is facing and match it to a previous occurrence where someone else held his/her chair. This system could be made possible with input through the ages from the array of individuals who managed that particular job and processing this data through a neural network that recognizes the pattern. The paper is based on data collected from traditional wooden dhow builders and some of the modern day unconventional shipyards. Since the requirements for successful implementation in such scenarios seems too steep at the moment, an alternate approach has been suggested by implementation through the design processes across multiple shipyards. The process entails the traditional value passed down through generations regarding a particular profession and analysis has been done regarding how this knowledge/experience can be captured and preserved for future generations to work upon. A series of tools including SharePoint, MATLAB, and some similar software working in tandem can be used for the design of the same. This research will provide valuable insight as to how information sharing can be applied through generations for effective application of production capabilities. ",

The network is trained to produce estimates of soil cohesion, angle of internal friction, soil-tool friction, soil failure angle, and residual depth of cut which are then passed through an earthmoving model based on the fundamental equation of earthmoving (FEE) to produce an estimated force. The network ingests a short history of kinematic observations along with past control commands and predicts interaction forces accurately with average error of less than 2kN, 13% of the measured force. To validate the approach, an earthmoving simulation of a bladed vehicle is developed using Vortex Studio, enabling comparison of the estimated parameters to pseudo-ground-truth values which is challenging in real-world experiments. The proposed approach is shown to enable accurate estimation of interaction forces and produces meaningful parameter estimates even when the model and the environmental physics deviate substantially.

    "abstract": "Pathology detection and delineation enables the automatic interpretation of medical scans such as chest X-rays while providing a high level of explainability to support radiologists in making informed decisions. However, annotating pathology bounding boxes is a time-consuming task such that large public datasets for this purpose are scarce. Current approaches thus use weakly supervised object detection to learn the (rough) localization of pathologies from image-level annotations, which is however limited in performance due to the lack of bounding box supervision. We therefore propose anatomy-driven pathology detection (ADPD), which uses easy-to-annotate bounding boxes of anatomical regions as proxies for pathologies. We study two training approaches: supervised training using anatomy-level pathology labels and multiple instance learning (MIL) with image-level pathology labels. Our results show that our anatomy-level training approach outperforms weakly supervised methods and fully supervised detection with limited training samples, and our MIL approach is competitive with both baseline approaches, therefore demonstrating the potential of our approach.

This study mainly focuses on creating and examining networks related to two major decentralized exchanges: Uniswap Version 2 and SushiSwap. We discovered that the distribution of links to nodes follow a power law making them scale-free networks. Additionally, during our analysis, we made an intresting discovery: the centrality of tokens in exchange graphs provide valuable insights into their value and significance in the world of cryptocurrencies. By observing changes in centrality over time, we uncovered noteworthy events in the cryptocurrency domain, that shows the potential of this networks for extracting information about the exchanges. ",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder affecting 50 million individuals worldwide and 1.2 million Americans. There exist millions of pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy, a condition in which seizures fail to come under control. The occurrence of seizures can result in physical injury, disorientation, unconsciousness, and additional symptoms that could impede children's ability to participate in everyday tasks. Predicting seizures can help parents and healthcare providers take precautions, prevent risky situations, and mentally prepare children to minimize anxiety and nervousness associated with the uncertainty of a seizure. This research proposes a novel and comprehensive framework to predict seizures in pediatric patients by evaluating machine learning algorithms on unimodal neuroimaging data consisting of electroencephalogram signals. The bandpass filtering and independent component analysis proved to be effective in reducing the noise and artifacts from the dataset. Various machine learning algorithms' performance is evaluated on important metrics such as accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, F1 score and MCC. The results show that the deep learning algorithms are more successful in predicting seizures than logistic Regression, and k nearest neighbors. The recurrent neural network (RNN) gave the highest precision and F1 Score, long short-term memory (LSTM) outperformed RNN in accuracy and convolutional neural network (CNN) resulted in the highest Specificity. This research has significant implications for healthcare providers in proactively managing seizure occurrence in pediatric patients, potentially transforming clinical practices, and improving pediatric care.

As the volumetric design process is complex, the underlying sequential design process encodes valuable information for designers. Many efforts have been made to automatically generate reasonable volumetric designs, but the quality of the generated design solutions varies, and evaluating a design solution requires either a prohibitively comprehensive set of metrics or expensive human expertise. While previous approaches focused on learning only the final design instead of sequential design tasks, we propose to encode the design knowledge from a collection of expert or high-performing design sequences and extract useful representations using transformer-based models. Later we propose to utilize the learned representations for crucial downstream applications such as design preference evaluation and procedural design generation. We develop the preference model by estimating the density of the learned representations whereas we train an autoregressive transformer model for sequential design generation. We demonstrate our ideas by leveraging a novel dataset of thousands of sequential volumetric designs. Our preference model can compare two arbitrarily given design sequences and is almost 90% accurate in evaluation against random design sequences. Our autoregressive model is also capable of autocompleting a volumetric design sequence from a partial design sequence. ",

Compact nonlinear classifiers trained on features outputted by a single pretrained model did not improve performance across all tasks; however, they did reduce inference time by 49% compared to serial execution of separate fine-tuned models. When training using 1% of the available labels, pretrained models consistently outperformed fully supervised models, with a maximum observed test AUC increase of 0.396 for the task of view classification.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made great strides in pushing the state-of-the-art in several challenging domains. Recent studies reveal that they are prone to making overconfident predictions. This greatly reduces the overall trust in model predictions, especially in safety-critical applications. Early work in improving model calibration employs post-processing techniques which rely on limited parameters and require a hold-out set. Some recent train-time calibration methods, which involve all model parameters, can outperform the postprocessing methods. To this end, we propose a new train-time calibration method, which features a simple, plug-and-play auxiliary loss known as multi-class alignment of predictive mean confidence and predictive certainty (MACC). It is based on the observation that a model miscalibration is directly related to its predictive certainty, so a higher gap between the mean confidence and certainty amounts to a poor calibration both for in-distribution and out-of-distribution predictions. Armed with this insight, our proposed loss explicitly encourages a confident (or underconfident) model to also provide a low (or high) spread in the presoftmax distribution. Extensive experiments on ten challenging datasets, covering in-domain, out-domain, non-visual recognition and medical image classification scenarios, show that our method achieves state-of-the-art calibration performance for both in-domain and out-domain predictions. Our code and models will be publicly released. ",

The second challenge is how to model malicious behavior in a sequential way such that maliciousness can be precisely captured. To address the two challenges, we propose and implement Cerebro to detect malicious packages in NPM and PyPI. We curate a feature set based on a high-level abstraction of malicious behavior to enable multi-lingual knowledge fusing. We organize extracted features into a behavior sequence to model sequential malicious behavior. We fine-tune the BERT model to understand the semantics of malicious behavior. Extensive evaluation has demonstrated the effectiveness of Cerebro over the state-of-the-art as well as the practically acceptable efficiency.

An important tool in proactively monitoring against HDD failure is timely estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). To this end, the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology employed within HDDs (S.M.A.R.T.) provide critical logs for long-term maintenance of the security and dependability of these essential data storage devices. Data-driven predictive models in the past have used these S.M.A.R.T. logs and CNN/RNN based architectures heavily. However, they have suffered significantly in providing a confidence interval around the predicted RUL values as well as in processing very long sequences of logs. In addition, some of these approaches, such as those based on LSTMs, are inherently slow to train and have tedious feature engineering overheads. To overcome these challenges, in this work we propose a novel transformer architecture - a Temporal-fusion Bi-encoder Self-attention Transformer (TFBEST) for predicting failures in hard-drives. It is an encoder-decoder based deep learning technique that enhances the context gained from understanding health statistics sequences and predicts a sequence of the number of days remaining before a disk potentially fails. In this paper, we also provide a novel confidence margin statistic that can help manufacturers replace a hard-drive within a time frame. Experiments on Seagate HDD data show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art RUL prediction methods during testing over the exhaustive 10-year data from Backblaze (2013-present). Although validated on HDD failure prediction, the TFBEST architecture is well-suited for other prognostics applications and may be adapted for allied regression problems. ",

However, locational post-contingency rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) requirements to accommodate significant inertia reduction has not been fully investigated in the literature. This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) based RoCoF-constrained unit commitment (CNN-RCUC) model to guarantee RoCoF stability following the worst generator outage event while ensuring operational efficiency. A generic CNN based predictor is first trained to track the highest locational RoCoF based on a high-fidelity simulation dataset. The RoCoF predictor is then formulated as MILP constraints into the unit commitment model. Case studies are carried out on the IEEE 24-bus system, and simulation results obtained with PSS/E indicate that the proposed method can ensure locational post-contingency RoCoF stability without conservativeness.

Herein, relevant and unique neural approximation methods for linear, nonlinear, and robust MPC are presented and compared. Comparisons are based on the theoretical guarantees that are preserved, the factor by which the original controller is sped up, and the size of problem that a framework is applicable to. Research contributions include: a taxonomy that organises existing knowledge, a summary of literary gaps, discussion on promising research directions, and simple guidelines for choosing an approximation framework.

Depending on the clipping strategy or additional properties of the processing function, the corresponding sensitivity set theoretically determines the necessary randomization to produce the required security parameters. Towards the optimal utility-privacy tradeoff, finding the minimal perturbation for properly-selected sensitivity sets stands as a central problem in DP research. In practice, l_2/l_1-norm clippings with Gaussian/Laplace noise mechanisms are among the most common setups. However, they also suffer from the curse of dimensionality. For more generic clipping strategies, the understanding of the optimal noise for a high-dimensional sensitivity set remains limited. In this paper, we revisit the geometry of high-dimensional sensitivity sets and present a series of results to characterize the non-asymptotically optimal Gaussian noise for R\\'enyi DP (RDP). Our results are both negative and positive: on one hand, we show the curse of dimensionality is tight for a broad class of sensitivity sets satisfying certain symmetry properties; but if, fortunately, the representation of the sensitivity set is asymmetric on some group of orthogonal bases, we show the optimal noise bounds need not be explicitly dependent on either dimension or rank. We also revisit sampling in the high-dimensional scenario, which is the key for both privacy amplification and computation efficiency in large-scale data processing. We propose a novel method, termed twice sampling, which implements both sample-wise and coordinate-wise sampling, to enable Gaussian noises to fit the sensitivity geometry more closely. With closed-form RDP analysis, we prove twice sampling produces asymptotic improvement of the privacy amplification given an additional infinity-norm restriction, especially for small sampling rate.

    "abstract": "Nowadays social media is the primary platform for people to obtain news and share information. Combating online fake news has become an urgent task to reduce the damage it causes to society. Existing methods typically improve their fake news detection performances by utilizing textual auxiliary information (such as relevant retweets and comments) or simple structural information (i.e., graph construction). However, these methods face two challenges. First, an increasing number of users tend to directly forward the source news without adding comments, resulting in a lack of textual auxiliary information. Second, simple graphs are unable to extract complex relations beyond pairwise association in a social context. Given that real-world social networks are intricate and involve high-order relations, we argue that exploring beyond pairwise relations between news and users is crucial for fake news detection. Therefore, we propose constructing an attributed hypergraph to represent non-textual and high-order relations for user participation in news spreading. We also introduce a hypergraph neural network-based method called Hy-DeFake to overcome the challenges. Our proposed method captures semantic information from news content, credibility information from involved users, and high-order correlations between news and users to learn distinctive embeddings for fake news detection. The superiority of Hy-DeFake is demonstrated through experiments conducted on four widely-used datasets, and it is compared against six baselines using four evaluation metrics. ",

However, such safety measures are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which contain maliciously designed token sequences to circumvent the model's safety guards and cause it to produce harmful content. In this work, we introduce erase-and-check, the first framework to defend against adversarial prompts with verifiable safety guarantees. We erase tokens individually and inspect the resulting subsequences using a safety filter. Our procedure labels the input prompt as harmful if any subsequences or the input prompt are detected as harmful by the filter. This guarantees that any adversarial modification of a harmful prompt up to a certain size is also labeled harmful. We defend against three attack modes: i) adversarial suffix, which appends an adversarial sequence at the end of the prompt; ii) adversarial insertion, where the adversarial sequence is inserted anywhere in the middle of the prompt; and iii) adversarial infusion, where adversarial tokens are inserted at arbitrary positions in the prompt, not necessarily as a contiguous block. Empirical results demonstrate that our technique obtains strong certified safety guarantees on harmful prompts while maintaining good performance on safe prompts. For example, against adversarial suffixes of length 20, it certifiably detects 93% of the harmful prompts and labels 94% of the safe prompts as safe using the open source language model Llama 2 as the safety filter.

    "abstract": "The $k$-means is a popular clustering objective, although it is inherently non-robust and sensitive to outliers. Its popular seeding or initialization called $k$-means++ uses $D^{2}$ sampling and comes with a provable $O(\\log k)$ approximation guarantee \\cite{AV2007}. However, in the presence of adversarial noise or outliers, $D^{2}$ sampling is more likely to pick centers from distant outliers instead of inlier clusters, and therefore its approximation guarantees \\textit{w.r.t.} $k$-means solution on inliers, does not hold. Assuming that the outliers constitute a constant fraction of the given data, we propose a simple variant in the $D^2$ sampling distribution, which makes it robust to the outliers. Our algorithm runs in $O(ndk)$ time, outputs $O(k)$ clusters, discards marginally more points than the optimal number of outliers, and comes with a provable $O(1)$ approximation guarantee. Our algorithm can also be modified to output exactly $k$ clusters instead of $O(k)$ clusters, while keeping its running time linear in $n$ and $d$. This is an improvement over previous results for robust $k$-means based on LP relaxation and rounding \\cite{Charikar}, \\cite{KrishnaswamyLS18} and \\textit{robust $k$-means++} \\cite{DeshpandeKP20}. Our empirical results show the advantage of our algorithm over $k$-means++~\\cite{AV2007}, uniform random seeding, greedy sampling for $k$ means~\\cite{tkmeanspp}, and robust $k$-means++~\\cite{DeshpandeKP20}, on standard real-world and synthetic data sets used in previous work. Our proposal is easily amenable to scalable, faster, parallel implementations of $k$-means++ \\cite{Bahmani,BachemL017} and is of independent interest for coreset constructions in the presence of outliers \\cite{feldman2007ptas,langberg2010universal,feldman2011unified}.

The current gold standard for diagnosing OSA, Polysomnography (PSG), involves an overnight hospital stay with multiple attached sensors, leading to potential inaccuracies due to the first-night effect. To address this, we present SlAction, a non-intrusive OSA detection system for daily sleep environments using infrared videos. Recognizing that sleep videos exhibit minimal motion, this work investigates the fundamental question: \"Are respiratory events adequately reflected in human motions during sleep?\" Analyzing the largest sleep video dataset of 5,098 hours, we establish correlations between OSA events and human motions during sleep. Our approach uses a low frame rate (2.5 FPS), a large size (60 seconds) and step (30 seconds) for sliding window analysis to capture slow and long-term motions related to OSA. Furthermore, we utilize a lightweight deep neural network for resource-constrained devices, ensuring all video streams are processed locally without compromising privacy. Evaluations show that SlAction achieves an average F1 score of 87.6% in detecting OSA across various environments. Implementing SlAction on NVIDIA Jetson Nano enables real-time inference (~3 seconds for a 60-second video clip), highlighting its potential for early detection and personalized treatment of OSA. ",

    "abstract": "Recent mainstream masked distillation methods function by reconstructing selectively masked areas of a student network from the feature map of its teacher counterpart. In these methods, the masked regions need to be properly selected, such that reconstructed features encode sufficient discrimination and representation capability like the teacher feature. However, previous masked distillation methods only focus on spatial masking, making the resulting masked areas biased towards spatial importance without encoding informative channel clues. In this study, we devise a Dual Masked Knowledge Distillation (DMKD) framework which can capture both spatially important and channel-wise informative clues for comprehensive masked feature reconstruction. More specifically, we employ dual attention mechanism for guiding the respective masking branches, leading to reconstructed feature encoding dual significance. Furthermore, fusing the reconstructed features is achieved by self-adjustable weighting strategy for effective feature distillation. Our experiments on object detection task demonstrate that the student networks achieve performance gains of 4.1% and 4.3% with the help of our method when RetinaNet and Cascade Mask R-CNN are respectively used as the teacher networks, while outperforming the other state-of-the-art distillation methods.

We observed that our data boosts HeBERT performance by 2% when combined with D_OLaH.

However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations can significantly impact the prediction results.

Additionally, increasing the attack success rate (ASR) typically involves generating more noise, making the attack more easily detectable. To address these limitations, we propose SWAP, a novel attacking method for TSC models. SWAP focuses on enhancing the confidence of the second-ranked logits while minimizing the manipulation of other logits. This is achieved by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the target logit distribution and the predictive logit distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that SWAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an ASR exceeding 50% and an 18% increase compared to existing methods. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNN) have achieved significant developments in a variety of graph analytical tasks. Nevertheless, GNN's superior performance will suffer from serious damage when the collected node features or structure relationships are partially missing owning to numerous unpredictable factors. Recently emerged graph completion learning (GCL) has received increasing attention, which aims to reconstruct the missing node features or structure relationships under the guidance of a specifically supervised task. Although these proposed GCL methods have made great success, they still exist the following problems: the reliance on labels, the bias of the reconstructed node features and structure relationships. Besides, the generalization ability of the existing GCL still faces a huge challenge when both collected node features and structure relationships are partially missing at the same time. To solve the above issues, we propose a more general GCL framework with the aid of self-supervised learning for improving the task performance of the existing GNN variants on graphs with features and structure missing, termed unsupervised GCL (UGCL). Specifically, to avoid the mismatch between missing node features and structure during the message-passing process of GNN, we separate the feature reconstruction and structure reconstruction and design its personalized model in turn. Then, a dual contrastive loss on the structure level and feature level is introduced to maximize the mutual information of node representations from feature reconstructing and structure reconstructing paths for providing more supervision signals. Finally, the reconstructed node features and structure can be applied to the downstream node classification task. Extensive experiments on eight datasets, three GNN variants and five missing rates demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

Despite their great success, critical computational challenges such as over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited expressive power continue to impact the performance of GNNs. In this study, inspired from the time-reversal principle commonly utilized in classical and quantum physics, we reverse the time direction of the graph heat equation. The resulted reversing process yields a class of high pass filtering functions that enhance the sharpness of graph node features. Leveraging this concept, we introduce the Multi-Scaled Heat Kernel based GNN (MHKG) by amalgamating diverse filtering functions' effects on node features. To explore more flexible filtering conditions, we further generalize MHKG into a model termed G-MHKG and thoroughly show the roles of each element in controlling over-smoothing, over-squashing and expressive power. Notably, we illustrate that all aforementioned issues can be characterized and analyzed via the properties of the filtering functions, and uncover a trade-off between over-smoothing and over-squashing: enhancing node feature sharpness will make model suffer more from over-squashing, and vice versa. Furthermore, we manipulate the time again to show how G-MHKG can handle both two issues under mild conditions. Our conclusive experiments highlight the effectiveness of proposed models. It surpasses several GNN baseline models in performance across graph datasets characterized by both homophily and heterophily. ",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential optimization strategy that is increasingly employed in a wide range of areas including materials design. In real world applications, acquiring high-fidelity (HF) data through physical experiments or HF simulations is the major cost component of BO. To alleviate this bottleneck, multi-fidelity (MF) methods are used to forgo the sole reliance on the expensive HF data and reduce the sampling costs by querying inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) sources whose data are correlated with HF samples. However, existing multi-fidelity BO (MFBO) methods operate under the following two assumptions that rarely hold in practical applications: (1) LF sources provide data that are well correlated with the HF data on a global scale, and (2) a single random process can model the noise in the fused data. These assumptions dramatically reduce the performance of MFBO when LF sources are only locally correlated with the HF source or when the noise variance varies across the data sources. In this paper, we dispense with these incorrect assumptions by proposing an MF emulation method that (1) learns a noise model for each data source, and (2) enables MFBO to leverage highly biased LF sources which are only locally correlated with the HF source. We illustrate the performance of our method through analytical examples and engineering problems on materials design. ",

However, existing decoding strategies are designed for Natural Language (NL) generation, overlooking the differences between NL and programming languages (PL). Due to this oversight, a better decoding strategy for code generation remains an open question. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study to explore a decoding strategy specialized in code generation. With an analysis of loss distributions of code tokens, we find that code tokens can be divided into two categories: challenging tokens that are difficult to predict and confident tokens that can be easily inferred. Among them, the challenging tokens mainly appear at the beginning of a code block. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a simple yet effective method: Adaptive Temperature (AdapT) sampling, which dynamically adjusts the temperature coefficient when decoding different tokens. We apply a larger temperature when sampling for challenging tokens, allowing LLMs to explore diverse choices. We employ a smaller temperature for confident tokens avoiding the influence of tail randomness noises. We apply AdapT sampling to LLMs with different sizes and conduct evaluations on two popular datasets. Results show that AdapT sampling significantly outperforms state-of-the-art decoding strategy. ",

It comes from the endoscope's light sources and decays with the inverse of the squared distance to the surface. To exploit these insights, we build on NeuS, a neural implicit surface reconstruction technique with an outstanding capability to learn appearance and a SDF surface model from multiple views, but currently limited to scenes with static illumination. To remove this limitation and exploit the relation between pixel brightness and depth, we modify the NeuS architecture to explicitly account for it and introduce a calibrated photometric model of the endoscope's camera and light source. Our method is the first one to produce watertight reconstructions of whole colon sections. We demonstrate excellent accuracy on phantom imagery. Remarkably, the watertight prior combined with illumination decline, allows to complete the reconstruction of unseen portions of the surface with acceptable accuracy, paving the way to automatic quality assessment of cancer screening explorations, measuring the global percentage of observed mucosa.

CVEs provide insights into vulnerabilities, but often lack details on potential threat actions (tactics, techniques, and procedures, or TTPs) within the ATT&CK framework. This gap hinders accurate CVE categorization and proactive countermeasure initiation. The paper introduces the TTPpredictor tool, which uses innovative techniques to analyze CVE descriptions and infer plausible TTP attacks resulting from CVE exploitation. TTPpredictor overcomes challenges posed by limited labeled data and semantic disparities between CVE and TTP descriptions. It initially extracts threat actions from unstructured cyber threat reports using Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) techniques. These actions, along with their contextual attributes, are correlated with MITRE's attack functionality classes. This automated correlation facilitates the creation of labeled data, essential for categorizing novel threat actions into threat functionality classes and TTPs. The paper presents an empirical assessment, demonstrating TTPpredictor's effectiveness with accuracy rates of approximately 98% and F1-scores ranging from 95% to 98% in precise CVE classification to ATT&CK techniques. TTPpredictor outperforms state-of-the-art language model tools like ChatGPT.

We train a variational autoencoder that generates an audio mel-spectrogram from two latent features representing the rhythmic and harmonic content. In the training phase, the variational autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the input mel-spectrogram given its pitch-shifted version. At each forward computation in the training phase, a vector rotation operation is applied to one of the latent features, assuming that the dimensions of the feature vectors are related to pitch intervals. Therefore, in the trained variational autoencoder, the rotated latent feature represents the pitch-related information of the mel-spectrogram, and the unrotated latent feature represents the pitch-invariant information, i.e., the rhythmic content. The proposed method was evaluated using a predictor-based disentanglement metric on the learned features. Furthermore, we demonstrate its application to the automatic generation of music remixes. ",

Currently, mainstream machine learning methods on TAGs involve a two-stage modeling approach: (1) unsupervised node feature extraction with pre-trained language models (PLMs); and (2) supervised learning using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, we observe that these representations, which have undergone large-scale pre-training, do not significantly improve performance with a limited amount of training samples. The main issue is that existing methods have not effectively integrated information from the graph and downstream tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called G-Prompt, which combines a graph adapter and task-specific prompts to extract node features. First, G-Prompt introduces a learnable GNN layer (\\emph{i.e.,} adaptor) at the end of PLMs, which is fine-tuned to better capture the masked tokens considering graph neighborhood information. After the adapter is trained, G-Prompt incorporates task-specific prompts to obtain \\emph{interpretable} node representations for the downstream task. Our experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on few-shot node classification.

While most logs are informative, log data also include artifacts that indicate failures or incidents. Accordingly, log data are often used to evaluate anomaly detection techniques that aim to automatically disclose unexpected or otherwise relevant system behavior patterns. Recently, detection approaches leveraging deep learning have increasingly focused on anomalies that manifest as changes of sequential patterns within otherwise normal event traces. Several publicly available data sets, such as HDFS, BGL, Thunderbird, OpenStack, and Hadoop, have since become standards for evaluating these anomaly detection techniques, however, the appropriateness of these data sets has not been closely investigated in the past. In this paper we therefore analyze six publicly available log data sets with focus on the manifestations of anomalies and simple techniques for their detection. Our findings suggest that most anomalies are not directly related to sequential manifestations and that advanced detection techniques are not required to achieve high detection rates on these data sets.

[JMLR 2023] introduced non-clashing teaching and showed it to be the most efficient machine teaching model satisfying the benchmark for collusion-avoidance set by Goldman and Mathias. A teaching map $T$ for a concept class $\\cal{C}$ assigns a (teaching) set $T(C)$ of examples to each concept $C \\in \\cal{C}$. A teaching map is non-clashing if no pair of concepts are consistent with the union of their teaching sets. The size of a non-clashing teaching map (NCTM) $T$ is the maximum size of a $T(C)$, $C \\in \\cal{C}$. The non-clashing teaching dimension NCTD$(\\cal{C})$ of $\\cal{C}$ is the minimum size of an NCTM for $\\cal{C}$. NCTM$^+$ and NCTD$^+(\\cal{C})$ are defined analogously, except the teacher may only use positive examples. We study NCTMs and NCTM$^+$s for the concept class $\\mathcal{B}(G)$ consisting of all balls of a graph $G$. We show that the associated decision problem {\\sc B-NCTD$^+$} for NCTD$^+$ is NP-complete in split, co-bipartite, and bipartite graphs. Surprisingly, we even prove that, unless the ETH fails, {\\sc B-NCTD$^+$} does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(vc)}}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$, nor a kernelization algorithm outputting a kernel with $2^{o(vc)}$ vertices, where vc is the vertex cover number of $G$. These are extremely rare results: it is only the second (fourth, resp.) problem in NP to admit a double-exponential lower bound parameterized by vc (treewidth, resp.), and only one of very few problems to admit an ETH-based conditional lower bound on the number of vertices in a kernel. We complement these lower bounds with matching upper bounds. For trees, interval graphs, cycles, and trees of cycles, we derive NCTM$^+$s or NCTMs for $\\mathcal{B}(G)$ of size proportional to its VC-dimension. For Gromov-hyperbolic graphs, we design an approximate NCTM$^+$ for $\\mathcal{B}(G)$ of size 2. ",

    "abstract": "Social media processing is a fundamental task in natural language processing with numerous applications. As Vietnamese social media and information science have grown rapidly, the necessity of information-based mining on Vietnamese social media has become crucial. However, state-of-the-art research faces several significant drawbacks, including imbalanced data and noisy data on social media platforms. Imbalanced and noisy are two essential issues that need to be addressed in Vietnamese social media texts. Graph Convolutional Networks can address the problems of imbalanced and noisy data in text classification on social media by taking advantage of the graph structure of the data. This study presents a novel approach based on contextualized language model (PhoBERT) and graph-based method (Graph Convolutional Networks). In particular, the proposed approach, ViCGCN, jointly trained the power of Contextualized embeddings with the ability of Graph Convolutional Networks, GCN, to capture more syntactic and semantic dependencies to address those drawbacks. Extensive experiments on various Vietnamese benchmark datasets were conducted to verify our approach. The observation shows that applying GCN to BERTology models as the final layer significantly improves performance. Moreover, the experiments demonstrate that ViCGCN outperforms 13 powerful baseline models, including BERTology models, fusion BERTology and GCN models, other baselines, and SOTA on three benchmark social media datasets. Our proposed ViCGCN approach demonstrates a significant improvement of up to 6.21%, 4.61%, and 2.63% over the best Contextualized Language Models, including multilingual and monolingual, on three benchmark datasets, UIT-VSMEC, UIT-ViCTSD, and UIT-VSFC, respectively. Additionally, our integrated model ViCGCN achieves the best performance compared to other BERTology integrated with GCN models. ",

Precise predictions are essential for achieving optimal energy consumption and distribution within the grid. This paper introduces a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model designed to forecast building energy consumption using historical energy data, occupancy patterns, and weather conditions. The LSTM model provides accurate short, medium, and long-term energy predictions for residential and commercial buildings compared to existing prediction models. We compare our LSTM model with established prediction methods, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forest. Encouragingly, the proposed LSTM model emerges as the superior performer across all metrics. It demonstrates exceptional prediction accuracy, boasting the highest R2 score of 0.97 and the most favorable mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.007. An additional advantage of our developed model is its capacity to achieve efficient energy consumption forecasts even when trained on a limited dataset. We address concerns about overfitting (variance) and underfitting (bias) through rigorous training and evaluation on real-world data. In summary, our research contributes to energy prediction by offering a robust LSTM model that outperforms alternative methods and operates with remarkable efficiency, generalizability, and reliability.

The timely identification and accurate localisation of such leakages is paramount for utilities to mitigate these unwanted effects. However, implementation of algorithms for leakage detection is limited in practice by requirements of either hydraulic models or large amounts of training data. Physics-informed machine learning can utilise hydraulic information thereby circumventing both limitations. In this work, we present a physics-informed machine learning algorithm that analyses pressure data and therefrom estimates unknown irregular water demands via a fully connected neural network, ultimately leveraging the Bernoulli equation and effectively linearising the leakage detection problem. Our algorithm is tested on data from the L-Town benchmark network, and results indicate a good capability for estimating most irregular demands, with R2 larger than 0.8. Identification results for leakages under the presence of irregular demands could be improved by a factor of 5.3 for abrupt leaks and a factor of 3.0 for incipient leaks when compared the results disregarding irregular demands.

To address these challenges, we propose M3D-NCA, a novel methodology that leverages Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) segmentation for 3D medical images using n-level patchification. Moreover, we exploit the variance in M3D-NCA to develop a novel quality metric which can automatically detect errors in the segmentation process of NCAs. M3D-NCA outperforms the two magnitudes larger UNet models in hippocampus and prostate segmentation by 2% Dice and can be run on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2GB RAM). This highlights the potential of M3D-NCA as an effective and efficient alternative for medical image segmentation in resource-constrained environments. ",

In this work, we propose the first precise hand-object reconstruction method in hyperbolic space, namely Dynamic Hyperbolic Attention Network (DHANet), which leverages intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space to learn representative features. Our method that projects mesh and image features into a unified hyperbolic space includes two modules, ie. dynamic hyperbolic graph convolution and image-attention hyperbolic graph convolution. With these two modules, our method learns mesh features with rich geometry-image multi-modal information and models better hand-object interaction. Our method provides a promising alternative for fine hand-object reconstruction in hyperbolic space.

In each step, they adequately tune the interaction of biomechanical muscle dynamics and neuronal signals to be robust against uncertainties in ground conditions. However, it is still not fully understood how the nervous system resolves the musculoskeletal redundancy to solve the multi-objective control problem considering stability, robustness, and energy efficiency. In computer simulations, energy minimization has been shown to be a successful optimization target, reproducing natural walking with trajectory optimization or reflex-based control methods. However, these methods focus on particular motions at a time and the resulting controllers are limited when compensating for perturbations. In robotics, reinforcement learning~(RL) methods recently achieved highly stable (and efficient) locomotion on quadruped systems, but the generation of human-like walking with bipedal biomechanical models has required extensive use of expert data sets. This strong reliance on demonstrations often results in brittle policies and limits the application to new behaviors, especially considering the potential variety of movements for high-dimensional musculoskeletal models in 3D. Achieving natural locomotion with RL without sacrificing its incredible robustness might pave the way for a novel approach to studying human walking in complex natural environments. ",

Social support in OHCs plays a crucial role in easing and rehabilitating patients. However, many time-sensitive questions from patients often remain unanswered due to the multitude of threads and the random nature of patient visits in OHCs. To address this issue, it is imperative to propose a recommender system that assists solution seekers in finding appropriate problem helpers. Nevertheless, developing a recommendation algorithm to enhance social support in OHCs remains an under-explored area. Traditional recommender systems cannot be directly adapted due to the following obstacles. First, unlike user-item links in traditional recommender systems, it is hard to model the social support behind helper-seeker links in OHCs since they are formed based on various heterogeneous reasons. Second, it is difficult to distinguish the impact of historical activities in characterizing patients. Third, it is significantly challenging to ensure that the recommended helpers possess sufficient expertise to assist the seekers. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we develop a Monotonically regularIzed diseNTangled Variational Autoencoders (MINT) model to strengthen social support in OHCs. ",

    "abstract": "A recent empirical observation of activation sparsity in MLP layers offers an opportunity to drastically reduce computation costs for free. Despite several works attributing it to training dynamics, the theoretical explanation of activation sparsity's emergence is restricted to shallow networks, small training steps well as modified training, even though the sparsity has been found in deep models trained by vanilla protocols for large steps. To fill the three gaps, we propose the notion of gradient sparsity as the source of activation sparsity and a theoretical explanation based on it that explains gradient sparsity and then activation sparsity as necessary steps to adversarial robustness w.r.t. hidden features and parameters, which is approximately the flatness of minima for well-learned models. The theory applies to standardly trained LayerNorm-ed pure MLPs, and further to Transformers or other architectures if noises are added to weights during training. To eliminate other sources of flatness when arguing sparsities' necessity, we discover the phenomenon of spectral concentration, i.e., the ratio between the largest and the smallest non-zero singular values of weight matrices is small. We utilize random matrix theory (RMT) as a powerful theoretical tool to analyze stochastic gradient noises and discuss the emergence of spectral concentration. With these insights, we propose two plug-and-play modules for both training from scratch and sparsity finetuning, as well as one radical modification that only applies to from-scratch training. Another under-testing module for both sparsity and flatness is also immediate from our theories. Validational experiments are conducted to verify our explanation. Experiments for productivity demonstrate modifications' improvement in sparsity, indicating further theoretical cost reduction in both training and inference. ",

Challenges occur in transferring, storing, and processing this rapidly growing amount of data on resource-constrained edge devices. Symbolic Representation (SR) algorithms are promising solutions to reduce the data size by converting actual raw data into symbols. Also, they allow data analytics (e.g., anomaly detection and trend prediction) directly on symbols, benefiting large classes of edge applications. However, existing SR algorithms are centralized in design and work offline with batch data, which is infeasible for real-time cases. We propose SymED - Symbolic Edge Data representation method, i.e., an online, adaptive, and distributed approach for symbolic representation of data on edge. SymED is based on the Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based Aggregation (ABBA), where we assume low-powered IoT devices do initial data compression (senders) and the more robust edge devices do the symbolic conversion (receivers). We evaluate SymED by measuring compression performance, reconstruction accuracy through Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance, and computational latency. The results show that SymED is able to (i) reduce the raw data with an average compression rate of 9.5%; (ii) keep a low reconstruction error of 13.25 in the DTW space; (iii) simultaneously provide real-time adaptability for online streaming IoT data at typical latencies of 42ms per symbol, reducing the overall network traffic.

    "title": "Cellular Wireless Networks in the Upper Mid-Band",
    "abstract": "The upper mid-band -- roughly from 7 to 24 GHz -- has attracted considerable recent interest for new cellular services. This frequency range has vastly more spectrum than the highly congested bands below 7 GHz while offering more favorable propagation and coverage than the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. Realizing the full potential of these bands, however, will require fundamental changes to the design of cellular systems. Most importantly, spectrum will likely need to be shared with incumbents including communication satellites, military RADAR, and radio astronomy. Also, due to the wide bandwidth, directional nature of transmission, and intermittent occupancy of incumbents, cellular systems will need to be agile to sense and intelligently use large spatial and bandwidth degrees of freedom. This paper attempts to provide an initial assessment of the feasibility and potential gains of wideband cellular systems operating in the upper mid-band. The study includes: (1) a system study to assess potential gains of multi-band systems in a representative dense urban environment; (2) propagation calculations to assess potential cross interference between satellites and terrestrial cellular services; and (3) design and evaluation of a compact multi-band antenna array structure. Leveraging these preliminary results, we identify potential future research directions to realize next-generation systems in these frequencies. ",

    "abstract": "The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are pivotal information for proactive cybersecurity measures, including service patching, security hardening, and more. However, CVEs typically offer low-level, product-oriented descriptions of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities, often lacking the essential attack semantic information required for comprehensive weakness characterization and threat impact estimation. This critical insight is essential for CVE prioritization and the identification of potential countermeasures, particularly when dealing with a large number of CVEs. Current industry practices involve manual evaluation of CVEs to assess their attack severities using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and mapping them to Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) for potential mitigation identification. Unfortunately, this manual analysis presents a major bottleneck in the vulnerability analysis process, leading to slowdowns in proactive cybersecurity efforts and the potential for inaccuracies due to human errors. In this research, we introduce our novel predictive model and tool (called CVEDrill) which revolutionizes CVE analysis and threat prioritization. CVEDrill accurately estimates the CVSS vector for precise threat mitigation and priority ranking and seamlessly automates the classification of CVEs into the appropriate CWE hierarchy classes. By harnessing CVEDrill, organizations can now implement cybersecurity countermeasure mitigation with unparalleled accuracy and timeliness, surpassing in this domain the capabilities of state-of-the-art tools like ChaptGPT.

However, most existing work in this domain treats all bugs the same, which is not the case in practice. It is important for a defect prediction method to estimate the severity of the identified bugs so that the higher-severity ones get immediate attention. In this study, we investigate source code metrics, source code representation using large language models (LLMs), and their combination in predicting bug severity labels of two prominent datasets. We leverage several source metrics at method-level granularity to train eight different machine-learning models. Our results suggest that Decision Tree and Random Forest models outperform other models regarding our several evaluation metrics. We then use the pre-trained CodeBERT LLM to study the source code representations' effectiveness in predicting bug severity. CodeBERT finetuning improves the bug severity prediction results significantly in the range of 29%-140% for several evaluation metrics, compared to the best classic prediction model on source code metric. Finally, we integrate source code metrics into CodeBERT as an additional input, using our two proposed architectures, which both enhance the CodeBERT model effectiveness. ",

Previous research on secure reasoning using multi-party computation (MPC) has proven to be impractical for LLM applications due to its time-consuming and communication-intensive nature. While lightweight anonymization techniques can protect private information in prompts through substitution or masking, they fail to recover sensitive data replaced in the LLM-generated results. In this paper, we expand the application scenarios of anonymization techniques by training a small local model to de-anonymize the LLM's returned results with minimal computational overhead. We introduce the HaS framework, where \"H(ide)\" and \"S(eek)\" represent its two core processes: hiding private entities for anonymization and seeking private entities for de-anonymization, respectively. To quantitatively assess HaS's privacy protection performance, we propose both black-box and white-box adversarial models. Furthermore, we conduct experiments to evaluate HaS's usability in translation and classification tasks. The experimental findings demonstrate that the HaS framework achieves an optimal balance between privacy protection and utility. ",

However, the fast adaptation in the industry, lack of awareness, and ability to exploit the models make them significant attack vectors. By embedding malware in neurons, the malware can be delivered covertly, with minor or no impact on the neural network's performance. The covert attack will use the Least Significant Bits (LSB) weight attack since LSB has a minimal effect on the model accuracy, and as a result, the user will not notice it. Since there are endless ways to hide the attacks, we focus on a zero-trust prevention strategy based on AI model attack disarm and reconstruction. We proposed three types of model steganography weight disarm defense mechanisms. The first two are based on random bit substitution noise, and the other on model weight quantization. We demonstrate a 100\\% prevention rate while the methods introduce a minimal decrease in model accuracy based on Qint8 and K-LRBP methods, which is an essential factor for improving AI security. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has been successfully applied to various fields of scientific computing in recent years. In this work, we propose a sparse radial basis function neural network method to solve elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with multiscale coefficients. Inspired by the deep mixed residual method, we rewrite the second-order problem into a first-order system and employ multiple radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) to approximate unknown functions in the system. To aviod the overfitting due to the simplicity of RBFNN, an additional regularization is introduced in the loss function. Thus the loss function contains two parts: the $L_2$ loss for the residual of the first-order system and boundary conditions, and the $\\ell_1$ regularization term for the weights of radial basis functions (RBFs). An algorithm for optimizing the specific loss function is introduced to accelerate the training process. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through a collection of multiscale problems with scale separation, discontinuity and multiple scales from one to three dimensions. Notably, the $\\ell_1$ regularization can achieve the goal of representing the solution by fewer RBFs. As a consequence, the total number of RBFs scales like $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-n\\tau})$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the smallest scale, $n$ is the dimensionality, and $\\tau$ is typically smaller than $1$. It is worth mentioning that the proposed method not only has the numerical convergence and thus provides a reliable numerical solution in three dimensions when a classical method is typically not affordable, but also outperforms most other available machine learning methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, are versatile and can solve different tasks due to their emergent ability and generalizability. However, LLMs sometimes lack domain-specific knowledge to perform tasks, which would also cause hallucination during inference. In some previous works, additional modules like graph neural networks (GNNs) are trained on retrieved knowledge from external knowledge bases, aiming to mitigate the problem of lacking domain-specific knowledge. However, incorporating additional modules: 1) would need retraining additional modules when encountering novel domains; 2) would become a bottleneck since LLMs' strong abilities are not fully utilized for retrieval. In this paper, we propose a paradigm, termed Knowledge Solver (KSL), to teach LLMs to search for essential knowledge from external knowledge bases by harnessing their own strong generalizability. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective prompt to transform retrieval into a multi-hop decision sequence, which empowers LLMs with searching knowledge ability in zero-shot manner. Additionally, KSL is able to provide complete retrieval paths and therefore increase explainability of LLMs' reasoning processes. We conduct experiments on three datasets: CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA, and MedQA-USMLE, and found that our approach improves LLM baseline performance by a relatively large margin. ",

This paper focuses on the critical physical layer aspects of transactions within the context of P2P energy trading, with a specific emphasis on addressing network constraints. Key challenges include maintaining margins for over/under voltage, voltage balance, and preventing congestion, all of which must be upheld during P2P energy exchanges. To address these challenges, we propose a novel analytical approach tailored to distribution networks. Furthermore, we introduce the Block Double Auction (BDA) mechanism as the P2P market mechanism for determining the acceptance or rejection of P2P transactions.

    "abstract": "In this work, a novel data-driven methodology for designing polar codes for channels with and without memory is proposed. The methodology is suitable for the case where the channel is given as a \"black-box\" and the designer has access to the channel for generating observations of its inputs and outputs, but does not have access to the explicit channel model. The proposed method leverages the structure of the successive cancellation (SC) decoder to devise a neural SC (NSC) decoder. The NSC decoder uses neural networks (NNs) to replace the core elements of the original SC decoder, the check-node, the bit-node and the soft decision. Along with the NSC, we devise additional NN that embeds the channel outputs into the input space of the SC decoder. The proposed method is supported by theoretical guarantees that include the consistency of the NSC. Also, the NSC has computational complexity that does not grow with the channel memory size. This sets its main advantage over successive cancellation trellis (SCT) decoder for finite state channels (FSCs) that has complexity of $O(|\\mathcal{S}|^3 N\\log N)$, where $|\\mathcal{S}|$ denotes the number of channel states. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms on memoryless channels and on channels with memory. The empirical results are compared with the optimal polar decoder, given by the SC and SCT decoders. We further show that our algorithms are applicable for the case where there SC and SCT decoders are not applicable. ",

However, despite the power and simplicity of representing signals with an MLP, these methods still face challenges when modeling large and complex temporal signals due to the limited capacity of MLPs.

We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the properties of ResFields and propose a matrix factorization technique to reduce the number of trainable parameters and enhance generalization capabilities. Importantly, our formulation seamlessly integrates with existing techniques and consistently improves results across various challenging tasks: 2D video approximation, dynamic shape modeling via temporal SDFs, and dynamic NeRF reconstruction. Lastly, we demonstrate the practical utility of ResFields by showcasing its effectiveness in capturing dynamic 3D scenes from sparse sensory inputs of a lightweight capture system. ",

To address this, we propose using link local differential privacy over decentralized nodes, enabling collaboration with an untrusted server to train GNNs without revealing the existence of any link. Our approach spends the privacy budget separately on links and degrees of the graph for the server to better denoise the graph topology using Bayesian estimation, alleviating the negative impact of LDP on the accuracy of the trained GNNs. We bound the mean absolute error of the inferred link probabilities against the ground truth graph topology. We then propose two variants of our LDP mechanism complementing each other in different privacy settings, one of which estimates fewer links under lower privacy budgets to avoid false positive link estimates when the uncertainty is high, while the other utilizes more information and performs better given relatively higher privacy budgets. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid variant that combines both strategies and is able to perform better across different privacy budgets. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy under varying privacy budgets. ",

    "abstract": "Generative AI is on the rise, enabling everyone to produce realistic content via publicly available interfaces. Especially for guided image generation, diffusion models are changing the creator economy by producing high quality low cost content. In parallel, artists are rising against unruly AI, since their artwork are leveraged, distributed, and dissimulated by large generative models. Our approach, My Art My Choice (MAMC), aims to empower content owners by protecting their copyrighted materials from being utilized by diffusion models in an adversarial fashion. MAMC learns to generate adversarially perturbed \"protected\" versions of images which can in turn \"break\" diffusion models. The perturbation amount is decided by the artist to balance distortion vs. protection of the content. MAMC is designed with a simple UNet-based generator, attacking black box diffusion models, combining several losses to create adversarial twins of the original artwork. We experiment on three datasets for various image-to-image tasks, with different user control values. Both protected image and diffusion output results are evaluated in visual, noise, structure, pixel, and generative spaces to validate our claims. We believe that MAMC is a crucial step for preserving ownership information for AI generated content in a flawless, based-on-need, and human-centric way. ",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in medical imaging is a challenging task in contexts where abnormalities are not annotated. This problem can be addressed through unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods, which identify features that do not match with a reference model of normal profiles. Artificial neural networks have been extensively used for UAD but they do not generally achieve an optimal trade-o$\\hookleftarrow$ between accuracy and computational demand. As an alternative, we investigate mixtures of probability distributions whose versatility has been widely recognized for a variety of data and tasks, while not requiring excessive design e$\\hookleftarrow$ort or tuning. Their expressivity makes them good candidates to account for complex multivariate reference models. Their much smaller number of parameters makes them more amenable to interpretation and e cient learning. However, standard estimation procedures, such as the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, do not scale well to large data volumes as they require high memory usage. To address this issue, we propose to incrementally compute inferential quantities. This online approach is illustrated on the challenging detection of subtle abnormalities in MR brain scans for the follow-up of newly diagnosed Parkinsonian patients. The identified structural abnormalities are consistent with the disease progression, as accounted by the Hoehn and Yahr scale. ",

Psycho-acoustically motivated frequency scales were used to inform the band definitions which are now defined with redundancy for more reliable feature extraction. A loss function motivated by the signal-to-noise ratio and the sparsity-promoting property of the 1-norm was proposed. We additionally exploit the information-sharing property of a common-encoder setup to reduce computational complexity during both training and inference, improve separation performance for hard-to-generalize classes of sounds, and allow flexibility during inference time with easily detachable decoders. Our best model sets the state of the art on the Divide and Remaster dataset with performance above the ideal ratio mask for the dialogue stem. ",

    "abstract": "The segmentation of kidney layer structures, including cortex, outer stripe, inner stripe, and inner medulla within human kidney whole slide images (WSI) plays an essential role in automated image analysis in renal pathology. However, the current manual segmentation process proves labor-intensive and infeasible for handling the extensive digital pathology images encountered at a large scale. In response, the realm of digital renal pathology has seen the emergence of deep learning-based methodologies. However, very few, if any, deep learning based approaches have been applied to kidney layer structure segmentation. Addressing this gap, this paper assesses the feasibility of performing deep learning based approaches on kidney layer structure segmetnation. This study employs the representative convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer segmentation approaches, including Swin-Unet, Medical-Transformer, TransUNet, U-Net, PSPNet, and DeepLabv3+. We quantitatively evaluated six prevalent deep learning models on renal cortex layer segmentation using mice kidney WSIs. The empirical results stemming from our approach exhibit compelling advancements, as evidenced by a decent Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) index. The results demonstrate that Transformer models generally outperform CNN-based models. By enabling a quantitative evaluation of renal cortical structures, deep learning approaches are promising to empower these medical professionals to make more informed kidney layer segmentation. ",

Manual analysis of emphysema subtypes and severity is laborious and subjective. To address this challenge, we present a deep learning-based approach for automating the Fleischner Society's visual score system for emphysema subtyping and severity analysis. We trained and evaluated our algorithm using 9650 subjects from the COPDGene study. Our algorithm achieved the predictive accuracy at 52\\%, outperforming a previously published method's accuracy of 45\\%. In addition, the agreement between the predicted scores of our method and the visual scores was good, where the previous method obtained only moderate agreement. Our approach employs a regression training strategy to generate categorical labels while simultaneously producing high-resolution localized activation maps for visualizing the network predictions. By leveraging these dense activation maps, our method possesses the capability to compute the percentage of emphysema involvement per lung in addition to categorical severity scores. Furthermore, the proposed method extends its predictive capabilities beyond centrilobular emphysema to include paraseptal emphysema subtypes. ",

Classical methods cannot handle it in this case because of the Curse of Dimensionality, where the computational cost of these methods increases exponentially fast in response to higher problem dimensions, far beyond the computing capacity of any modern supercomputers. Only in the past few years have machine learning researchers been able to mitigate this problem. The solution method chosen here is a model known as a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) which trains a deep neural network (DNN) to solve the minimal surface PDE. It can be scaled up into higher dimensions and trained relatively quickly even on a laptop with no GPU. Due to the inability to view the high-dimension output, our data is presented as snippets of a higher-dimension shape with enough fixed axes so that it is viewable with 3-D graphs. Not only will the functionality of this method be tested, but we will also explore potential limitations in the method's performance. ",

Then, we formulate the problem as a non-convex minimization subject to quality of service constraints. Since the problem is challenging to solve, we propose an Ensemble Deep Neural Network (EDNN) based approach which takes advantage of the dual formulation of the studied problem. Specifically, the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the ensemble are trained in an unsupervised manner using the Lagrangian function of the studied problem. Our experiments show that the proposed EDNN method outperforms traditional DNNs in reducing the expected AoI, achieving a remarkable reduction of $29.5\\%$. ",

We describe an MCMC-based algorithm to sample from this null model and statistically investigate the mixing behaviour. This is paired with a high-performance, Rust-based, publicly available implementation. The motivation comes from topological data analysis of connectomes in neuroscience. In particular, we answer the fundamental question: are the high Betti numbers observed in the investigated graphs evidence of an interesting topology, or are they merely a byproduct of the high numbers of simplices? Indeed, by applying our new tool on the connectome of C. Elegans and parts of the statistical reconstructions of the Blue Brain Project, we find that the Betti numbers observed are considerable statistical outliers with respect to this new null model. We thus, for the first time, statistically confirm that topological data analysis in microscale connectome research is extracting statistically meaningful information. ",

For sparse and not-too-dense Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs, we give linear and polynomial upper bounds on the number of maximal cliques. For the dense regime, we give super-polynomial and even exponential lower bounds. Although (geometric) inhomogeneous random graphs are sparse, we give super-polynomial lower bounds for these models. This comes form the fact that these graphs have a power-law degree distribution, which leads to a dense subgraph in which we find many maximal cliques. These lower bounds seem to contradict previous empirical evidence that (geometric) inhomogeneous random graphs have only few maximal cliques. We resolve this contradiction by providing experiments indicating that, even for large networks, the linear lower-order terms dominate, before the super-polynomial asymptotic behavior kicks in only for networks of extreme size.

Probabilistic meta-learning has received an abundance of attention from the research community in recent years, but a problem shared by many existing probabilistic meta-models is that they require a very large number of datasets in order to produce high-quality predictions with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. In many applications, however, such quantities of data are simply not available. In this dissertation we present a significantly more data-efficient approach to probabilistic meta-learning through per-datapoint amortisation of inference in Bayesian neural networks, introducing the Amortised Pseudo-Observation Variational Inference Bayesian Neural Network (APOVI-BNN). First, we show that the approximate posteriors obtained under our amortised scheme are of similar or better quality to those obtained through traditional variational inference, despite the fact that the amortised inference is performed in a single forward pass. We then discuss how the APOVI-BNN may be viewed as a new member of the neural process family, motivating the use of neural process training objectives for potentially better predictive performance on complex problems as a result. Finally, we assess the predictive performance of the APOVI-BNN against other probabilistic meta-models in both a one-dimensional regression problem and in a significantly more complex image completion setting. In both cases, when the amount of training data is limited, our model is the best in its class. ",

In this work, we propose a novel scheme that addresses this limitation by constructing a low-dimensional subspace of the neural network parameters-referred to as an active subspace-by identifying the parameter directions that have the most significant influence on the output of the neural network. We demonstrate that the significantly reduced active subspace enables effective and scalable Bayesian inference via either Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, otherwise computationally intractable, or variational inference.

A key component in simulating spectra is the pressure-temperature (PT) profile, which describes the thermal structure of the atmosphere. Current AR pipelines commonly use ad hoc fitting functions here that limit the retrieved PT profiles to simple approximations, but still use a relatively large number of parameters. In this work, we introduce a conceptually new, data-driven parameterization scheme for physically consistent PT profiles that does not require explicit assumptions about the functional form of the PT profiles and uses fewer parameters than existing methods. Our approach consists of a latent variable model (based on a neural network) that learns a distribution over functions (PT profiles). Each profile is represented by a low-dimensional vector that can be used to condition a decoder network that maps $P$ to $T$. When training and evaluating our method on two publicly available datasets of self-consistent PT profiles, we find that our method achieves, on average, better fit quality than existing baseline methods, despite using fewer parameters. In an AR based on existing literature, our model (using two parameters) produces a tighter, more accurate posterior for the PT profile than the five-parameter polynomial baseline, while also speeding up the retrieval by more than a factor of three. By providing parametric access to physically consistent PT profiles, and by reducing the number of parameters required to describe a PT profile (thereby reducing computational cost or freeing resources for additional parameters of interest), our method can help improve AR and thus our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres and their habitability.
