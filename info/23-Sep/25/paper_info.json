    "abstract": "This paper contextualises the common queries of \"why is crypto crashing?\" and \"why is crypto down?\", the research transcends beyond the frequent market fluctuations to unravel how cryptocurrencies fundamentally work and the step-by-step process on how to create a cryptocurrency. The study examines blockchain technologies and their pivotal role in the evolving Metaverse, shedding light on topics such as how to invest in cryptocurrency, the mechanics behind crypto mining, and strategies to effectively buy and trade cryptocurrencies. Through an interdisciplinary approach, the research transitions from the fundamental principles of fintech investment strategies to the overarching implications of blockchain within the Metaverse. Alongside exploring machine learning potentials in financial sectors and risk assessment methodologies, the study critically assesses whether developed or developing nations are poised to reap greater benefits from these technologies. Moreover, it probes into both enduring and dubious crypto projects, drawing a distinct line between genuine blockchain applications and Ponzi-like schemes. The conclusion resolutely affirms the continuing dominance of blockchain technologies, underlined by a profound exploration of their intrinsic value and a reflective commentary by the author on the potential risks confronting individual investors.

    "abstract": "In the 2023-2024 academic year, the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, exemplified by ChatGPT's 1.6 billion monthly visits, is set to impact academic integrity. With 77% of high school students previously reporting engagement in dishonest behaviour, the rise of AI-driven writing assistance, dubbed 'AI-giarism' by Chan (arXiv:2306.03358v2), will make plagiarism more accessible and less detectable. While these concerns are urgent, they also raise broader questions about the revolutionary nature of this technology, including autonomy, data privacy, copyright, and equity. This paper aims to explore generative AI from a social justice perspective, examining the training of these models, the inherent biases, and the potential injustices in detecting AI-generated writing.

    "abstract": "Attention-Aware Social Choice tackles the fundamental conflict faced by some agent communities between their desire to include all members in the decision making processes and the limited time and attention that are at the disposal of the community members. Here, we investigate a combination of two techniques for attention-aware social choice, namely Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sampling. Essentially, we propose a system in which each governance proposal to change the status quo is first sent to a trained NLP model that estimates the probability that the proposal would pass if all community members directly vote on it; then, based on such an estimation, a population sample of a certain size is being selected and the proposal is decided upon by taking the sample majority. We develop several concrete algorithms following the scheme described above and evaluate them using various data, including such from several Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). ",

    "abstract": "Today's AI systems for medical decision support often succeed on benchmark datasets in research papers but fail in real-world deployment. This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.

However, typical LP models are ill-suited for this task as they are incapable of performing inductive link prediction for new, unseen event entities and they require retraining as knowledge is added or changed in the underlying KG. We introduce a case-based reasoning model, EvCBR, to predict properties about new consequent events based on similar cause-effect events present in the KG. EvCBR uses statistical measures to identify similar events and performs path-based predictions, requiring no training step. To generalize our methods beyond the domain of event prediction, we frame our task as a 2-hop LP task, where the first hop is a causal relation connecting a cause event to a new effect event and the second hop is a property about the new event which we wish to predict. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated using a novel dataset of newsworthy events with causal relations curated from Wikidata, where EvCBR outperforms baselines including translational-distance-based, GNN-based, and rule-based LP models.

    "abstract": "A core part of maintenance planning is a monitoring system that provides a good prognosis on health and degradation, often expressed as remaining useful life (RUL). Most of the current data-driven approaches for RUL prediction focus on single-point prediction. These point prediction approaches do not include the probabilistic nature of the failure. The few probabilistic approaches to date either include the aleatoric uncertainty (which originates from the system), or the epistemic uncertainty (which originates from the model parameters), or both simultaneously as a total uncertainty. Here, we propose ensemble neural networks for probabilistic RUL predictions which considers both uncertainties and decouples these two uncertainties. These decoupled uncertainties are vital in knowing and interpreting the confidence of the predictions. This method is tested on NASA's turbofan jet engine CMAPSS data-set. Our results show how these uncertainties can be modeled and how to disentangle the contribution of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Additionally, our approach is evaluated on different metrics and compared against the current state-of-the-art methods. ",

This trend stimulates us to explore the potential of applying SemCom to vehicular networks, which normally consume a tremendous amount of resources to achieve stringent requirements on high reliability and low latency. Unfortunately, the unique background knowledge matching mechanism in SemCom makes it challenging to realize efficient vehicle-to-vehicle service provisioning for multiple users at the same time. To this end, this paper identifies and jointly addresses two fundamental problems of knowledge base construction (KBC) and vehicle service pairing (VSP) inherently existing in SemCom-enabled vehicular networks. Concretely, we first derive the knowledge matching based queuing latency specific for semantic data packets, and then formulate a latency-minimization problem subject to several KBC and VSP related reliability constraints. Afterward, a SemCom-empowered Service Supplying Solution (S$^{\\text{4}}$) is proposed along with the theoretical analysis of its optimality guarantee. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of S$^{\\text{4}}$ in terms of average queuing latency, semantic data packet throughput, and user knowledge preference satisfaction compared with two different benchmarks.

However, earlier works are demonstrating the presence of inherent \"order bias\" in It-LLMs, posing challenges to the appropriate evaluation. In this paper, we investigate It-LLMs' resilience abilities towards a series of probing tests using four MCQ benchmarks. Introducing adversarial examples, we show a significant performance gap, mainly when varying the order of the choices, which reveals a selection bias and brings into discussion reasoning abilities. Following a correlation between first positions and model choices due to positional bias, we hypothesized the presence of structural heuristics in the decision-making process of the It-LLMs, strengthened by including significant examples in few-shot scenarios. Finally, by using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique, we elicit the model to reason and mitigate the bias by obtaining more robust models. ",

    "abstract": "Energy consumption is a fundamental concern in mobile application development, bearing substantial significance for both developers and end-users. Moreover, it is a critical determinant in the consumer's decision-making process when considering a smartphone purchase. From the sustainability perspective, it becomes imperative to explore approaches aimed at mitigating the energy consumption of mobile devices, given the significant global consequences arising from the extensive utilisation of billions of smartphones, which imparts a profound environmental impact. Despite the existence of various energy-efficient programming practices within the Android platform, the dominant mobile ecosystem, there remains a need for documented machine learning-based energy prediction algorithms tailored explicitly for mobile app development. Hence, the main objective of this research is to propose a novel neural network-based framework, enhanced by a metaheuristic approach, to achieve robust energy prediction in the context of mobile app development. The metaheuristic approach here plays a crucial role in not only identifying suitable learning algorithms and their corresponding parameters but also determining the optimal number of layers and neurons within each layer. To the best of our knowledge, prior studies have yet to employ any metaheuristic algorithm to address all these hyperparameters simultaneously. Moreover, due to limitations in accessing certain aspects of a mobile phone, there might be missing data in the data set, and the proposed framework can handle this. In addition, we conducted an optimal algorithm selection strategy, employing 13 metaheuristic algorithms, to identify the best algorithm based on accuracy and resistance to missing values. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach yields significant outcomes for energy consumption prediction. ",

However, their focus was on the example-rich regime, where the users have so many examples that each user could themselves solve the problem. In this work we consider the example-scarce regime, where each user has only a few examples, and obtain the following results: 1. For approximate-DP, we give a generic transformation of any item-level DP algorithm to a user-level DP algorithm. Roughly speaking, the latter gives a (multiplicative) savings of $O_{\\varepsilon,\\delta}(\\sqrt{m})$ in terms of the number of users required for achieving the same utility, where $m$ is the number of examples per user. This algorithm, while recovering most known bounds for specific problems, also gives new bounds, e.g., for PAC learning. 2. For pure-DP, we present a simple technique for adapting the exponential mechanism [McSherry, Talwar FOCS 2007] to the user-level setting. This gives new bounds for a variety of tasks, such as private PAC learning, hypothesis selection, and distribution learning. For some of these problems, we show that our bounds are near-optimal. ",

This paper presents novel results on SDoF of ANECE by analyzing secret-key capacity (SKC) of each pair of nodes in a network of multiple collaborative nodes per channel coherence period. Each transmission session of ANECE has two phases: phase 1 is used for pilots, and phase 2 is used for random symbols. This results in two parts of SDoF of ANECE. Both lower and upper bounds on the SDoF of ANECE for any number of users are shown, and the conditions for the two bounds to meet are given. This leads to important discoveries, including: a) The phase-1 SDoF is the same for both multi-user ANECE and pair-wise ANECE while the former may require only a fraction of the number of time slots needed by the latter; b) For a three-user network, the phase-2 SDoF of all-user ANECE is generally larger than that of pair-wise ANECE; c) For a two-user network, a modified ANECE deploying square-shaped nonsingular pilot matrices yields a higher total SDoF than the original ANECE. The multi-user ANECE and the modified two-user ANECE shown in this paper appear to be the best full-duplex schemes known today in terms of SDoF subject to each node using a given number of antennas for both transmitting and receiving.

While its superiority over conventional methods has been demonstrated, the method can suffer from errors in speaker profiles, as those profiles are typically obtained by running a traditional clustering-based diarization method over the input signal. This paper proposes an extension to TS-VAD, called Profile-Error-Tolerant TS-VAD (PET-TSVAD), which is robust to such speaker profile errors. This is achieved by employing transformer-based TS-VAD that can handle a variable number of speakers and further introducing a set of additional pseudo-speaker profiles to handle speakers undetected during the first pass diarization. During training, we use speaker profiles estimated by multiple different clustering algorithms to reduce the mismatch between the training and testing conditions regarding speaker profiles. Experimental results show that PET-TSVAD consistently outperforms the existing TS-VAD method on both the VoxConverse and DIHARD-I datasets. ",

The paper proposes an optimal distributed Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) strategy with opportunistic RIS assistance, based on statistics theory of optimal sequential observation planned decision. Each source-destination pair makes decisions regarding the use of direct links and/or probing source-RIS-destination links. Channel access occurs in a distributed manner after successful channel contention. The optimality of the strategy is rigorously derived using multiple-level pure thresholds. A distributed algorithm, which achieves significantly lower online complexity at $O(1)$, is developed to implement the proposed strategy.

Usually, CEs for an input-output pair are defined as data points with minimum distance to the input that are classified with a different label than the output. To tackle the established problem that CEs are easily invalidated when model parameters are updated (e.g. retrained), studies have proposed ways to certify the robustness of CEs under model parameter changes bounded by a norm ball. However, existing methods targeting this form of robustness are not sound or complete, and they may generate implausible CEs, i.e., outliers wrt the training dataset. In fact, no existing method simultaneously optimises for proximity and plausibility while preserving robustness guarantees. In this work, we propose Provably RObust and PLAusible Counterfactual Explanations (PROPLACE), a method leveraging on robust optimisation techniques to address the aforementioned limitations in the literature. We formulate an iterative algorithm to compute provably robust CEs and prove its convergence, soundness and completeness. Through a comparative experiment involving six baselines, five of which target robustness, we show that PROPLACE achieves state-of-the-art performances against metrics on three evaluation aspects. ",

The manipulation of moving objects, due to their dynamic properties, requires learning a wide range of factors such as the object's position, movement speed, and grasping timing. We propose a data augmentation method for enabling a robot to grasp moving objects with different speeds and grasping timings at low cost. Specifically, the robot is taught to grasp an object moving at low speed using teleoperation, and multiple data with different speeds and grasping timings are generated by down-sampling and padding the robot sensor data in the time-series direction. By learning multiple sensor data in a time series, the robot can generate motions while adjusting the grasping timing for unlearned movement speeds and sudden speed changes. We have shown using a real robot that this data augmentation method facilitates learning the relationship between object position and velocity and enables the robot to perform robust grasping motions for unlearned positions and objects with dynamically changing positions and velocities.

In order to navigate human-inhabited public spaces, such a navigation task becomes more than only obstacle avoidance, but also requires considering surrounding humans and their intentions to somewhat change the navigation behavior in response to the underlying social norms, i.e., being socially compliant. Machine learning methods are shown to be effective in capturing those complex and subtle social interactions in a data-driven manner, without explicitly hand-crafting simplified models or cost functions. Considering multiple available sensor modalities and the efficiency of learning methods, this paper presents a comprehensive study on learning social robot navigation with multimodal perception using a large-scale real-world dataset. The study investigates social robot navigation decision making on both the global and local planning levels and contrasts unimodal and multimodal learning against a set of classical navigation approaches in different social scenarios, while also analyzing the training and generalizability performance from the learning perspective. We also conduct a human study on how learning with multimodal perception affects the perceived social compliance. The results show that multimodal learning has a clear advantage over unimodal learning in both dataset and human studies. We open-source our code for the community's future use to study multimodal perception for learning social robot navigation. ",

    "abstract": "Sparsifying the Transformer has garnered considerable interest, as training the Transformer is very computationally demanding. Prior efforts to sparsify the Transformer have either used a fixed pattern or data-driven approach to reduce the number of operations involving the computation of multi-head attention, which is the main bottleneck of the Transformer. However, existing methods suffer from inevitable problems, such as the potential loss of essential sequence features due to the uniform fixed pattern applied across all layers, and an increase in the model size resulting from the use of additional parameters to learn sparsity patterns in attention operations. In this paper, we propose a novel sparsification scheme for the Transformer that integrates convolution filters and the flood filling method to efficiently capture the layer-wise sparse pattern in attention operations. Our sparsification approach reduces the computational complexity and memory footprint of the Transformer during training. Efficient implementations of the layer-wise sparsified attention algorithm on GPUs are developed, demonstrating a new SPION that achieves up to 3.08X speedup over existing state-of-the-art sparse Transformer models, with better evaluation quality.

    "abstract": "As Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly used in solving various tasks in real-world applications, it is crucial to ensure that ML algorithms are robust to any potential worst-case noises, adversarial attacks, and highly unusual situations when they are designed. Studying ML robustness will significantly help in the design of ML algorithms. In this paper, we investigate ML robustness using adversarial training in centralized and decentralized environments, where ML training and testing are conducted in one or multiple computers. In the centralized environment, we achieve a test accuracy of 65.41% and 83.0% when classifying adversarial examples generated by Fast Gradient Sign Method and DeepFool, respectively. Comparing to existing studies, these results demonstrate an improvement of 18.41% for FGSM and 47% for DeepFool. In the decentralized environment, we study Federated learning (FL) robustness by using adversarial training with independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, respectively, where CIFAR-10 is used in this research. In the IID data case, our experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve such a robust accuracy that it is comparable to the one obtained in the centralized environment. Moreover, in the non-IID data case, the natural accuracy drops from 66.23% to 57.82%, and the robust accuracy decreases by 25% and 23.4% in C&W and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks, compared to the IID data case, respectively. We further propose an IID data-sharing approach, which allows for increasing the natural accuracy to 85.04% and the robust accuracy from 57% to 72% in C&W attacks and from 59% to 67% in PGD attacks.

Our findings demonstrate that users tend to overlook potential privacy risks in favor of the utility the technology provides. We also find that users do not mind sharing inaccurate or obfuscated location data as long as their frequently visited locations aren't identified, and their full driving routes can't be recreated.

    "abstract": "Surface electromyography (sEMG) and high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) biosignals have been extensively investigated for myoelectric control of prosthetic devices, neurorobotics, and more recently human-computer interfaces because of their capability for hand gesture recognition/prediction in a wearable and non-invasive manner. High intraday (same-day) performance has been reported. However, the interday performance (separating training and testing days) is substantially degraded due to the poor generalizability of conventional approaches over time, hindering the application of such techniques in real-life practices. There are limited recent studies on the feasibility of multi-day hand gesture recognition. The existing studies face a major challenge: the need for long sEMG epochs makes the corresponding neural interfaces impractical due to the induced delay in myoelectric control. This paper proposes a compact ViT-based network for multi-day dynamic hand gesture prediction. We tackle the main challenge as the proposed model only relies on very short HD-sEMG signal windows (i.e., 50 ms, accounting for only one-sixth of the convention for real-time myoelectric implementation), boosting agility and responsiveness. Our proposed model can predict 11 dynamic gestures for 20 subjects with an average accuracy of over 71% on the testing day, 3-25 days after training. Moreover, when calibrated on just a small portion of data from the testing day, the proposed model can achieve over 92% accuracy by retraining less than 10% of the parameters for computational efficiency.

Our research proceeds in three stages. First, we examine migration from a broad perspective, not just one-to-one migration. Second, we leverage behavioral analysis to pinpoint the distinct migration pattern of each platform.

    "abstract": "Performative prediction is a recently proposed framework where predictions guide decision-making and hence influence future data distributions. Such performative phenomena are ubiquitous in various areas, such as transportation, finance, public policy, and recommendation systems. To date, work on performative prediction has only focused on unconstrained scenarios, neglecting the fact that many real-world learning problems are subject to constraints. This paper bridges this gap by studying performative prediction under inequality constraints. Unlike most existing work that provides only performative stable points, we aim to find the optimal solutions. Anticipating performative gradients is a challenging task, due to the agnostic performative effect on data distributions. To address this issue, we first develop a robust primal-dual framework that requires only approximate gradients up to a certain accuracy, yet delivers the same order of performance as the stochastic primal-dual algorithm without performativity. Based on this framework, we then propose an adaptive primal-dual algorithm for location families. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed adaptive primal-dual algorithm attains $\\ca{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret and constraint violations, using only $\\sqrt{T} + 2T$ samples, where $T$ is the time horizon. To our best knowledge, this is the first study and analysis on the optimality of the performative prediction problem under inequality constraints. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our algorithm and theoretical results through numerical simulations. ",

Based on this observation, we propose a new approach to prevent degeneration problems by training two models. Specifically, we first train a model that is designed to amplify undesirable patterns. We then enhance the diversity of the second model by focusing on patterns that the first model fails to learn.

    "abstract": "How to accurately learn task-relevant state representations from high-dimensional observations with visual distractions is a realistic and challenging problem in visual reinforcement learning. Recently, unsupervised representation learning methods based on bisimulation metrics, contrast, prediction, and reconstruction have shown the ability for task-relevant information extraction. However, due to the lack of appropriate mechanisms for the extraction of task information in the prediction, contrast, and reconstruction-related approaches and the limitations of bisimulation-related methods in domains with sparse rewards, it is still difficult for these methods to be effectively extended to environments with distractions. To alleviate these problems, in the paper, the action sequences, which contain task-intensive signals, are incorporated into representation learning. Specifically, we propose a Sequential Action--induced invariant Representation (SAR) method, in which the encoder is optimized by an auxiliary learner to only preserve the components that follow the control signals of sequential actions, so the agent can be induced to learn the robust representation against distractions. We conduct extensive experiments on the DeepMind Control suite tasks with distractions while achieving the best performance over strong baselines. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at disregarding task-irrelevant information by deploying SAR to real-world CARLA-based autonomous driving with natural distractions. Finally, we provide the analysis results of generalization drawn from the generalization decay and t-SNE visualization. Code and demo videos are available at https://github.com/DMU-XMU/SAR.git. ",

    "abstract": "Surface defect inspection is a very challenging task in which surface defects usually show weak appearances or exist under complex backgrounds. Most high-accuracy defect detection methods require expensive computation and storage overhead, making them less practical in some resource-constrained defect detection applications. Although some lightweight methods have achieved real-time inference speed with fewer parameters, they show poor detection accuracy in complex defect scenarios. To this end, we develop a Global Context Aggregation Network (GCANet) for lightweight saliency detection of surface defects on the encoder-decoder structure. First, we introduce a novel transformer encoder on the top layer of the lightweight backbone, which captures global context information through a novel Depth-wise Self-Attention (DSA) module. The proposed DSA performs element-wise similarity in channel dimension while maintaining linear complexity. In addition, we introduce a novel Channel Reference Attention (CRA) module before each decoder block to strengthen the representation of multi-level features in the bottom-up path. The proposed CRA exploits the channel correlation between features at different layers to adaptively enhance feature representation. The experimental results on three public defect datasets demonstrate that the proposed network achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and running efficiency compared with other 17 state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, GCANet achieves competitive accuracy (91.79% $F_{\\beta}^{w}$, 93.55% $S_\\alpha$, and 97.35% $E_\\phi$) on SD-saliency-900 while running 272fps on a single gpu. ",

We find that this issue stems from broken gradient flow between input coordinates and indexed hash-keys, where the chain rule attempts to model discrete hash-keys, rather than the continuous coordinates. To tackle this concern, we introduce RHINO, in which a continuous analytical function is incorporated to facilitate regularization by connecting the input coordinate and the network additionally without modifying the architecture of current hash-based INRs. This connection ensures a seamless backpropagation of gradients from the network's output back to the input coordinates, thereby enhancing regularization. Our experimental results not only showcase the broadened regularization capability across different hash-based INRs like DINER and Instant NGP, but also across a variety of tasks such as image fitting, representation of signed distance functions, and optimization of 5D static / 6D dynamic neural radiance fields. Notably, RHINO outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both quality and speed, affirming its superiority. ",

Transformer-based model all-MiniLM-L6-v2 was employed to obtain the embeddings of the utterances from each speaker. The overall similarity of the conversation was then quantified by the average cosine similarity between the embeddings of adjacent utterances. Results showed that semantic similarity had a positive association with wives' affect during conflict (but not pleasant) conversations. Moreover, this association was not observed with husbands' affect regardless of conversation types. Two validation checks further provided support for the validity of the similarity measure and showed that the observed patterns were not mere artifacts of data.

In this paper, we construct a simple and novel transformer-based framework for multi-modal manipulation detection and grounding tasks. Our framework simultaneously explores modality-specific features while preserving the capability for multi-modal alignment. To achieve this, we introduce visual/language pre-trained encoders and dual-branch cross-attention (DCA) to extract and fuse modality-unique features. Furthermore, we design decoupled fine-grained classifiers (DFC) to enhance modality-specific feature mining and mitigate modality competition. Moreover, we propose an implicit manipulation query (IMQ) that adaptively aggregates global contextual cues within each modality using learnable queries, thereby improving the discovery of forged details. Extensive experiments on the $\\rm DGM^4$ dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model compared to state-of-the-art approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Gaussian Process (DGP) models offer a powerful nonparametric approach for Bayesian inference, but exact inference is typically intractable, motivating the use of various approximations. However, existing approaches, such as mean-field Gaussian assumptions, limit the expressiveness and efficacy of DGP models, while stochastic approximation can be computationally expensive. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Neural Operator Variational Inference (NOVI) for Deep Gaussian Processes. NOVI uses a neural generator to obtain a sampler and minimizes the Regularized Stein Discrepancy in L2 space between the generated distribution and true posterior. We solve the minimax problem using Monte Carlo estimation and subsampling stochastic optimization techniques. We demonstrate that the bias introduced by our method can be controlled by multiplying the Fisher divergence with a constant, which leads to robust error control and ensures the stability and precision of the algorithm. Our experiments on datasets ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands demonstrate the effectiveness and the faster convergence rate of the proposed method. We achieve a classification accuracy of 93.56 on the CIFAR10 dataset, outperforming SOTA Gaussian process methods. Furthermore, our method guarantees theoretically controlled prediction error for DGP models and demonstrates remarkable performance on various datasets. We are optimistic that NOVI has the potential to enhance the performance of deep Bayesian nonparametric models and could have significant implications for various practical applications ",

    "abstract": "Enriching the robot representation of the operational environment is a challenging task that aims at bridging the gap between low-level sensor readings and high-level semantic understanding. Having a rich representation often requires computationally demanding architectures and pure point cloud based detection systems that struggle when dealing with everyday objects that have to be handled by the robot. To overcome these issues, we propose a graph-based representation that addresses this gap by providing a semantic representation of robot environments from multiple sources. In fact, to acquire information from the environment, the framework combines classical computer vision tools with modern computer vision cloud services, ensuring computational feasibility on onboard hardware. By incorporating an ontology hierarchy with over 800 object classes, the framework achieves cross-domain adaptability, eliminating the need for environment-specific tools. The proposed approach allows us to handle also small objects and integrate them into the semantic representation of the environment. The approach is implemented in the Robot Operating System (ROS) using the RViz visualizer for environment representation. This work is a first step towards the development of a general-purpose framework, to facilitate intuitive interaction and navigation across different domains. ",

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework for temporal neighbor aggregation that uses the recurrent neural network with node-wise hidden states to integrate information from all historical neighbors for each node to acquire the complete neighbor information.

Despite their demonstrated effectiveness, these methods often neglect the underlying intents of users, which constitute a pivotal facet of comprehensive user interests. Consequently, a series of approaches have arisen to tackle this limitation by introducing independent intent representations. However, these approaches fail to capture the intricate relationships between intents of different users and the compatibility between user intents and item properties. To remedy the above issues, we propose a novel method, named uniformly co-clustered intent modeling. Specifically, we devise a uniformly contrastive intent modeling module to bring together the embeddings of users with similar intents and items with similar properties. This module aims to model the nuanced relations between intents of different users and properties of different items, especially those unreachable to each other on the user-item graph. To model the compatibility between user intents and item properties, we design the user-item co-clustering module, maximizing the mutual information of co-clusters of users and items. This approach is substantiated through theoretical validation, establishing its efficacy in modeling compatibility to enhance the mutual information between user and item representations. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. ",

In this work, we aim to alleviate the burden of including masking operation into the contrastive-learning framework for convolutional neural networks as an extra augmentation method. In addition to the additive but unwanted edges (between masked and unmasked regions) as well as other adverse effects caused by the masking operations for ConvNets, which have been discussed by prior works, we particularly identify the potential problem where for one view in a contrastive sample-pair the randomly-sampled masking regions could be overly concentrated on important/salient objects thus resulting in misleading contrastiveness to the other view. To this end, we propose to explicitly take the saliency constraint into consideration in which the masked regions are more evenly distributed among the foreground and background for realizing the masking-based augmentation. Moreover, we introduce hard negative samples by masking larger regions of salient patches in an input image. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets, contrastive learning mechanisms, and downstream tasks well verify the efficacy as well as the superior performance of our proposed method with respect to several state-of-the-art baselines.

Characterized by the promotion of messages via multi-platform coordination, in which multiple user accounts, within a short time, post content advancing a shared informational agenda on multiple platforms, they contribute to an already confusing and manipulated information ecosystem. To make things worse, reliable datasets that contain ground truth information about such operations are virtually nonexistent. This paper presents a multi-modal approach that identifies the social media messages potentially engaged in a coordinated information campaign across multiple platforms. Our approach incorporates textual content, temporal information and the underlying network of user and messages posted to identify groups of messages with unusual coordination patterns across multiple social media platforms. We apply our approach to content posted on four platforms related to the Syrian Civil Defence organization known as the White Helmets: Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube. Results show that our approach identifies social media posts that link to news YouTube channels with similar factuality score, which is often an indication of coordinated operations. ",

In this paper, we dynamically consider three typical classes of radio access network (RAN) slices, namely high-throughput slices, low-delay slices and wide-coverage slices, under the same underlying physical SAGIN. The throughput, the service delay and the coverage area of these three classes of RAN slices are jointly optimized in a non-scalar form by considering the distinct channel features and service advantages of the terrestrial, aerial and satellite components of SAGINs. A joint central and distributed multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (CDMADDPG) algorithm is proposed for solving the above problem to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions. The algorithm first determines the optimal virtual unmanned aerial vehicle (vUAV) positions and the inter-slice sub-channel and power sharing by relying on a centralized unit. Then it optimizes the intra-slice sub-channel and power allocation, and the virtual base station (vBS)/vUAV/virtual low earth orbit (vLEO) satellite deployment in support of three classes of slices by three separate distributed units. Simulation results verify that the proposed method approaches the Pareto-optimal exploitation of multiple RAN slices, and outperforms the benchmarkers. ",

Existing methods normally learn a neural field for the whole scene, while it is still under-explored how to reconstruct a certain object indicated by users on-the-fly. Considering the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown effectiveness in segmenting any 2D images, in this paper, we propose Neural Object Cloning (NOC), a novel high-quality 3D object reconstruction method, which leverages the benefits of both neural field and SAM from two aspects. Firstly, to separate the target object from the scene, we propose a novel strategy to lift the multi-view 2D segmentation masks of SAM into a unified 3D variation field. The 3D variation field is then projected into 2D space and generates the new prompts for SAM. This process is iterative until convergence to separate the target object from the scene. Then, apart from 2D masks, we further lift the 2D features of the SAM encoder into a 3D SAM field in order to improve the reconstruction quality of the target object. NOC lifts the 2D masks and features of SAM into the 3D neural field for high-quality target object reconstruction. We conduct detailed experiments on several benchmark datasets to demonstrate the advantages of our method. The code will be released. ",

Even though automated transpilation significantly boosts developer productivity, a key concern is whether the generated code is correct. Existing work initially used manually crafted test suites to test the translations of a small corpus of programs; these test suites were later automated. In contrast, we devise the first approach for automated, functional, property-based testing of code translation models. Our general, user-provided specifications about the transpiled code capture a range of properties, from purely syntactic to purely semantic ones. As shown by our experiments, this approach is very effective in detecting property violations in popular code translation models, and therefore, in evaluating model quality with respect to given properties. We also go a step further and explore the usage scenario where a user simply aims to obtain a correct translation of some code with respect to certain properties without necessarily being concerned about the overall quality of the model. To this purpose, we develop the first property-guided search procedure for code translation models, where a model is repeatedly queried with slightly different parameters to produce alternative and potentially more correct translations. Our results show that this search procedure helps to obtain significantly better code translations. ",

However, generalization - the ability to perform well in related but unseen scenarios - is an essential requirement that remains an unsolved challenge for game AI. Generalization is difficult for imitation learning agents because it requires the algorithm to take meaningful actions outside of the training distribution. In this paper we propose a solution to this challenge. Inspired by the success of data augmentation in supervised learning, we augment the training data so the distribution of states and actions in the dataset better represents the real state-action distribution. This study evaluates methods for combining and applying data augmentations to observations, to improve generalization of imitation learning agents. It also provides a performance benchmark of these augmentations across several 3D environments.

Since its growth in popularity in the recent years, pruning gave birth to countless papers and contributions, resulting first in critical inconsistencies in the way results are compared, and then to a collective effort to establish standardized benchmarks. However, said benchmarks are based on training practices that date from several years ago and do not align with current practices. In this work, we verify how results in the recent literature of pruning hold up against networks that underwent both state-of-the-art training methods and trivial model scaling. We find that the latter clearly and utterly outperform all the literature we compared to, proving that updating standard pruning benchmarks and re-evaluating classical methods in their light is an absolute necessity.

    "abstract": "The robotic handling of compliant and deformable food raw materials, characterized by high biological variation, complex geometrical 3D shapes, and mechanical structures and texture, is currently in huge demand in the ocean space, agricultural, and food industries. Many tasks in these industries are performed manually by human operators who, due to the laborious and tedious nature of their tasks, exhibit high variability in execution, with variable outcomes. The introduction of robotic automation for most complex processing tasks has been challenging due to current robot learning policies. A more consistent learning policy involving skilled operators is desired. In this paper, we address the problem of robot learning when presented with inconsistent demonstrations. To this end, we propose a robust learning policy based on Learning from Demonstration (LfD) for robotic grasping of food compliant objects. The approach uses a merging of RGB-D images and tactile data in order to estimate the necessary pose of the gripper, gripper finger configuration and forces exerted on the object in order to achieve effective robot handling. During LfD training, the gripper pose, finger configurations and tactile values for the fingers, as well as RGB-D images are saved. We present an LfD learning policy that automatically removes inconsistent demonstrations, and estimates the teacher's intended policy. The performance of our approach is validated and demonstrated for fragile and compliant food objects with complex 3D shapes. The proposed approach has a vast range of potential applications in the aforementioned industry sectors. ",

    "title": "Diffusion Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SRS) has become the technical foundation in many applications recently, which aims to recommend the next item based on the user's historical interactions. However, sequential recommendation often faces the problem of data sparsity, which widely exists in recommender systems. Besides, most users only interact with a few items, but existing SRS models often underperform these users. Such a problem, named the long-tail user problem, is still to be resolved. Data augmentation is a distinct way to alleviate these two problems, but they often need fabricated training strategies or are hindered by poor-quality generated interactions. To address these problems, we propose a Diffusion Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation (DiffuASR) for a higher quality generation. The augmented dataset by DiffuASR can be used to train the sequential recommendation models directly, free from complex training procedures. To make the best of the generation ability of the diffusion model, we first propose a diffusion-based pseudo sequence generation framework to fill the gap between image and sequence generation. Then, a sequential U-Net is designed to adapt the diffusion noise prediction model U-Net to the discrete sequence generation task. At last, we develop two guide strategies to assimilate the preference between generated and origin sequences. To validate the proposed DiffuASR, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets with three sequential recommendation models. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of DiffuASR. As far as we know, DiffuASR is one pioneer that introduce the diffusion model to the recommendation. ",

To enable the design of such controllers, this paper proposes an automated plant modeling framework that captures the relevant system dynamics, while being adaptable to any network configuration. Starting from the network topology and system parameters, the developed algorithm generates a state-space model of the system, relying on a graph-based technique to facilitate the combination of component models into a full network model. The accuracy of the approach is validated against experimental data collected from a laboratory-scale district heating network. The verification shows an average normalized root mean square error of 0.39 in the mass flow rates delivered to the buildings, and 0.15 in the network return temperature. Furthermore, the ability of the proposed modeling technique to rapidly generate models characterizing different network configurations is demonstrated through its application to topology optimization. The optimal design, obtained via a branch and bound algorithm, reduces network heat losses by 15% as compared to the conventional length-minimized topology. ",

    "abstract": "Emerging from the monolithic pairwise attention mechanism in conventional Transformer models, there is a growing interest in leveraging sparse interactions that align more closely with biological principles. Approaches including the Set Transformer and the Perceiver employ cross-attention consolidated with a latent space that forms an attention bottleneck with limited capacity. Building upon recent neuroscience studies of Global Workspace Theory and associative memory, we propose the Associative Transformer (AiT). AiT induces low-rank explicit memory that serves as both priors to guide bottleneck attention in the shared workspace and attractors within associative memory of a Hopfield network. Through joint end-to-end training, these priors naturally develop module specialization, each contributing a distinct inductive bias to form attention bottlenecks. A bottleneck can foster competition among inputs for writing information into the memory. We show that AiT is a sparse representation learner, learning distinct priors through the bottlenecks that are complexity-invariant to input quantities and dimensions. AiT demonstrates its superiority over methods such as the Set Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Coordination in various vision tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, increasingly more data are available as knowledge graphs (KGs). While this data model supports advanced reasoning and querying, they remain difficult to mine due to their size and complexity. Graph mining approaches can be used to extract patterns from KGs. However this presents two main issues. First, graph mining approaches tend to extract too many patterns for a human analyst to interpret (pattern explosion). Second, real-life KGs tend to differ from the graphs usually treated in graph mining: they are multigraphs, their vertex degrees tend to follow a power-law, and the way in which they model knowledge can produce spurious patterns. Recently, a graph mining approach named GraphMDL+ has been proposed to tackle the problem of pattern explosion, using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. However, GraphMDL+, like other graph mining approaches, is not suited for KGs without adaptations. In this paper we propose KG-MDL, a graph pattern mining approach based on the MDL principle that, given a KG, generates a human-sized and descriptive set of graph patterns, and so in a parameter-less and anytime way. We report on experiments on medium-sized KGs showing that our approach generates sets of patterns that are both small enough to be interpreted by humans and descriptive of the KG. We show that the extracted patterns highlight relevant characteristics of the data: both of the schema used to create the data, and of the concrete facts it contains. We also discuss the issues related to mining graph patterns on knowledge graphs, as opposed to other types of graph data. ",

Our method aims to alleviate the potential negative effects of using the same normalization statistics for both token types, which may not be optimally aligned with their individual roles. We empirically show that by utilizing a separate normalization layer, the [CLS] embeddings can better encode the global contextual information and are distributed more uniformly in its anisotropic space. When replacing the conventional normalization layer with the two separate layers, we observe an average 2.7% performance improvement over the image, natural language, and graph domains. ",

This becomes a critical concern when designing autonomous aerial vehicles, given the stringent constraints on power and weight. Especially in the case of blimps, known for their extended endurance, power-efficient control methods are essential. Spiking neural networks (SNN) can provide a solution, facilitating energy-efficient and asynchronous event-driven processing. In this paper, we have evolved SNNs for accurate altitude control of a non-neutrally buoyant indoor blimp, relying solely on onboard sensing and processing power. The blimp's altitude tracking performance significantly improved compared to prior research, showing reduced oscillations and a minimal steady-state error. The parameters of the SNNs were optimized via an evolutionary algorithm, using a Proportional-Derivative-Integral (PID) controller as the target signal. We developed two complementary SNN controllers while examining various hidden layer structures. The first controller responds swiftly to control errors, mitigating overshooting and oscillations, while the second minimizes steady-state errors due to non-neutral buoyancy-induced drift. Despite the blimp's drivetrain limitations, our SNN controllers ensured stable altitude control, employing only 160 spiking neurons. ",

    "abstract": "As software projects progress, quality of code assumes paramount importance as it affects reliability, maintainability and security of software. For this reason, static analysis tools are used in developer workflows to flag code quality issues. However, developers need to spend extra efforts to revise their code to improve code quality based on the tool findings. In this work, we investigate the use of (instruction-following) large language models (LLMs) to assist developers in revising code to resolve code quality issues. We present a tool, CORE (short for COde REvisions), architected using a pair of LLMs organized as a duo comprised of a proposer and a ranker. Providers of static analysis tools recommend ways to mitigate the tool warnings and developers follow them to revise their code. The \\emph{proposer LLM} of CORE takes the same set of recommendations and applies them to generate candidate code revisions. The candidates which pass the static quality checks are retained. However, the LLM may introduce subtle, unintended functionality changes which may go un-detected by the static analysis. The \\emph{ranker LLM} evaluates the changes made by the proposer using a rubric that closely follows the acceptance criteria that a developer would enforce. CORE uses the scores assigned by the ranker LLM to rank the candidate revisions before presenting them to the developer. CORE could revise 59.2% Python files (across 52 quality checks) so that they pass scrutiny by both a tool and a human reviewer. The ranker LLM is able to reduce false positives by 25.8% in these cases. CORE produced revisions that passed the static analysis tool in 76.8% Java files (across 10 quality checks) comparable to 78.3% of a specialized program repair tool, with significantly much less engineering efforts.

CAVs' driving decisions rely on remote untrusted data, making them susceptible to attacks carried out by malicious participants in the collaborative perception system.

To understand the impact of the vulnerability, we break the ground by proposing various real-time data fabrication attacks in which the attacker delivers crafted malicious data to victims in order to perturb their perception results, leading to hard brakes or increased collision risks. Our attacks demonstrate a high success rate of over 86\\% on high-fidelity simulated scenarios and are realizable in real-world experiments. To mitigate the vulnerability, we present a systematic anomaly detection approach that enables benign vehicles to jointly reveal malicious fabrication.

To bridge this capability gap, we propose a novel approach exploiting the rich mathematical theory of simplicial complexes (SCs) - a robust tool for modeling higher-order interactions. Current SC-based GNNs are burdened by high complexity and rigidity, and quantifying higher-order interaction strengths remains challenging. Innovatively, we present a higher-order Flower-Petals (FP) model, incorporating FP Laplacians into SCs. Further, we introduce a Higher-order Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN) grounded in FP Laplacians, capable of discerning intrinsic features across varying topological scales. By employing learnable graph filters, a parameter group within each FP Laplacian domain, we can identify diverse patterns where the filters' weights serve as a quantifiable measure of higher-order interaction strengths. The theoretical underpinnings of HiGCN's advanced expressiveness are rigorously demonstrated. Additionally, our empirical investigations reveal that the proposed model accomplishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on a range of graph tasks and provides a scalable and flexible solution to explore higher-order interactions in graphs.

This class is composed of piecewise LTV systems, i.e. LTV systems that are piecewise linear in time. Sufficient conditions of stability are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by using the Lyapunov stability criterion. The feasibility of LMIs guarantees the stability of a given piecewise LTV system. Furthermore, uncertain piecewise LTV systems with scalar parametric uncertainty are also considered. Sufficient conditions for robust stability of this case are also presented, which come out to be quasi-LMIs, which can be optimized using a bisection algorithm to find the bounds of uncertainty for which the system is stable.

    "abstract": "Hand-crafted image quality metrics, such as PSNR and SSIM, are commonly used to evaluate model privacy risk under reconstruction attacks. Under these metrics, reconstructed images that are determined to resemble the original one generally indicate more privacy leakage. Images determined as overall dissimilar, on the other hand, indicate higher robustness against attack. However, there is no guarantee that these metrics well reflect human opinions, which, as a judgement for model privacy leakage, are more trustworthy. In this paper, we comprehensively study the faithfulness of these hand-crafted metrics to human perception of privacy information from the reconstructed images. On 5 datasets ranging from natural images, faces, to fine-grained classes, we use 4 existing attack methods to reconstruct images from many different classification models and, for each reconstructed image, we ask multiple human annotators to assess whether this image is recognizable. Our studies reveal that the hand-crafted metrics only have a weak correlation with the human evaluation of privacy leakage and that even these metrics themselves often contradict each other. These observations suggest risks of current metrics in the community. To address this potential risk, we propose a learning-based measure called SemSim to evaluate the Semantic Similarity between the original and reconstructed images. SemSim is trained with a standard triplet loss, using an original image as an anchor, one of its recognizable reconstructed images as a positive sample, and an unrecognizable one as a negative. By training on human annotations, SemSim exhibits a greater reflection of privacy leakage on the semantic level. We show that SemSim has a significantly higher correlation with human judgment compared with existing metrics. Moreover, this strong correlation generalizes to unseen datasets, models and attack methods. ",

Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given uncertainty set. However, existing work often resorts to some coarse relaxation of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value using convex programming. The generality of our estimator enables various extensions such as sensitivity analysis with f-divergence, model selection with cross validation and information criterion, and robust policy learning with the sharp lower bound. Furthermore, our estimation method can be reformulated as an empirical risk minimization problem thanks to the strong duality, which enables us to provide strong theoretical guarantees of the proposed estimator using techniques of the M-estimation.

Despite Computed Tomography (CT) being the standard diagnostic tool for mTBI, it often yields normal results in mTBI patients despite symptomatic evidence. This fact underscores the complexity of accurate diagnosis. In this study, we introduce an interpretable 3D Multi-Modal Residual Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN) for mTBI diagnostic model enhanced with Occlusion Sensitivity Maps (OSM). Our MRCNN model exhibits promising performance in mTBI diagnosis, demonstrating an average accuracy of 82.4%, sensitivity of 82.6%, and specificity of 81.6%, as validated by a five-fold cross-validation process. Notably, in comparison to the CT-based Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) model, the MRCNN shows an improvement of 4.4% in specificity and 9.0% in accuracy. We show that the OSM offers superior data-driven insights into CT images compared to the Grad-CAM approach. These results highlight the efficacy of the proposed multi-modal model in enhancing the diagnostic precision of mTBI. ",

We propose a novel federated approach to derive valid causal inferences for a target population using multi-site data.

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) scans have demonstrated effectiveness in combating the rapid spread of the virus. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct research on computerized models for the detection of COVID-19 using CT imaging. A novel processing method has been developed, utilizing radiomic features, to assist in the CT-based diagnosis of COVID-19. Given the lower specificity of traditional features in distinguishing between different causes of pulmonary diseases, the objective of this study is to develop a CT-based radiomics framework for the differentiation of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. The model is designed to focus on outlining COVID-19 lesions, as traditional features often lack specificity in this aspect. The model categorizes images into three classes: COVID-19, non-COVID-19, or normal. It employs enhancement auto-segmentation principles using intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) and deep neural networks (ALS-IDCP-DNN) within a defined range of analysis thresholds. A publicly available dataset comprising COVID-19, normal, and non-COVID-19 classes was utilized to validate the proposed model's effectiveness. The best performing classification model, Residual Neural Network with 50 layers (Resnet-50), attained an average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.8%, 99%, 98%, and 98% respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of our model to accurately classify COVID-19 images, which could aid radiologists in diagnosing suspected COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our model's performance surpasses that of more than 10 current state-of-the-art studies conducted on the same dataset. ",

We consider two sampling models: (i) an identityless model, wherein only the community of each sampled individual is revealed, and (ii) an identity-based model, wherein the learner is able to discern whether or not each sampled individual has been sampled before, in addition to the community of that individual. The former model corresponds to the classical problem of identifying the mode of a discrete distribution, whereas the latter seeks to capture the utility of identity information in mode estimation. For each of these models, we establish information theoretic lower bounds on the expected number of samples needed to meet the prescribed confidence level, and propose sound algorithms with a sample complexity that is provably asymptotically optimal. Our analysis highlights that identity information can indeed be utilized to improve the efficiency of community mode estimation. ",

Via standard assumptions for the terminal cost and constraint, we establish distribtionally robust long-term and stage-wise performance guarantees for the closed-loop system. We further demonstrate that a common choice of the terminal cost, i.e., as the solution to the discrete-algebraic Riccati equation, renders the origin input-to-state stable for the closed-loop system. This choice of the terminal cost also ensures that the exact long-term performance of the closed-loop system is independent of the choice of ambiguity set the for DRMPC formulation. Thus, we establish conditions under which DRMPC does not provide a long-term performance benefit relative to stochastic MPC (SMPC). To solve the proposed DRMPC optimization problem, we propose a Newton-type algorithm that empirically achieves superlinear convergence by solving a quadratic program at each iteration and guarantees the feasibility of each iterate. We demonstrate the implications of the closed-loop guarantees and the scalability of the proposed algorithm via two examples. ",

Training SSRL models requires a large amount of pre-training data and this poses a challenge for low resource languages. A common approach is transferring knowledge from other languages. Instead, we propose to use audio augmentation to pre-train SSRL models in a low resource condition and evaluate phoneme recognition as downstream task. We performed a systematic comparison of augmentation techniques, namely: pitch variation, noise addition, accented target-language speech and other language speech. We found combined augmentations (noise/pitch) was the best augmentation strategy outperforming accent and language knowledge transfer. We compared the performance with various quantities and types of pre-training data. We examined the scaling factor of augmented data to achieve equivalent performance to models pre-trained with target domain speech. Our findings suggest that for resource constrained languages, in-domain synthetic augmentation can outperform knowledge transfer from accented or other language speech. ",

Third, the possibility of combining representations from Whisper and SSL models while deploying MOSA-Net+ is analyzed. The experimental results reveal that Whisper's embedding features correlate more strongly with subjective quality and intelligibility than other SSL's embedding features, contributing to more accurate prediction performance achieved by MOSA-Net+. Moreover, combining the embedding features from Whisper and SSL models only leads to marginal improvement. As compared to MOSA-Net and other SSL-based speech assessment models, MOSA-Net+ yields notable improvements in estimating subjective quality and intelligibility scores across all evaluation metrics.

Within this framework, the doubly robust (DR) estimator was derived and has shown its effectiveness in estimation, especially when the model assumption is violated. However, the current form of the DR estimator is restricted to binary treatments, while the treatment can be continuous in many real-world applications. The primary obstacle to continuous treatments resides in the delta function present in the original DR estimator, making it infeasible in causal effect estimation and introducing a heavy computational burden in nuisance function estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a kernel-based DR estimator that can well handle continuous treatments. Equipped with its smoothness, we show that its oracle form is a consistent approximation of the influence function. Further, we propose a new approach to efficiently solve the nuisance functions. We then provide a comprehensive convergence analysis in terms of the mean square error. We demonstrate the utility of our estimator on synthetic datasets and real-world applications. ",

Many different state-of-the-art deep neural networks yield similar neural predictions, but it remains unclear how to differentiate among models that perform equally well at predicting neural responses. To gain insight into this, we use a recent theoretical framework that relates the generalization error from regression to the spectral bias of the model activations and the alignment of the neural responses onto the learnable subspace of the model. We extend this theory to the case of regression between model activations and neural responses, and define geometrical properties describing the error embedding geometry. We test a large number of deep neural networks that predict visual cortical activity and show that there are multiple types of geometries that result in low neural prediction error as measured via regression. The work demonstrates that carefully decomposing representational metrics can provide interpretability of how models are capturing neural activity and points the way towards improved models of neural activity.

It is well motivated to consider similar problems about quantum graphs, which are an operator system generalisation of graphs. Defining well-formulated decision problems for quantum graphs faces several technical challenges, and consequently the connections between quantum graphs and complexity have been underexplored. In this work, we introduce and study the clique problem for quantum graphs. Our approach utilizes a well-known connection between quantum graphs and quantum channels. The inputs for our problems are presented as quantum channels induced by circuits, which implicitly determine a corresponding quantum graph. We also use this approach to reimagine the clique and independent set problems for classical graphs, by taking the inputs to be circuits of deterministic or noisy channels which implicitly determine confusability graphs. We show that, by varying the collection of channels in the language, these give rise to complete problems for the classes $\\textsf{NP}$, $\\textsf{MA}$, $\\textsf{QMA}$, and $\\textsf{QMA}(2)$. In this way, we exhibit a classical complexity problem whose natural quantisation is $\\textsf{QMA}(2)$, rather than $\\textsf{QMA}$, which is commonly assumed. To prove the results in the quantum case, we make use of methods inspired by self-testing. To illustrate the utility of our techniques, we include a new proof of the reduction of $\\textsf{QMA}(k)$ to $\\textsf{QMA}(2)$ via cliques for quantum graphs. We also study the complexity of a version of the independent set problem for quantum graphs, and provide preliminary evidence that it may be in general weaker in complexity, contrasting to the classical case where the clique and independent set problems are equivalent.

However, the key structures identified by the current explainable GNN models are typically chemically invalid. Furthermore, a threshold needs to be manually selected to pinpoint the key structures from the rest. To overcome the limitations of the current explainable GNN models, we propose our SLGNN, which stands for using Sparse Learning to Graph Neural Networks. Our SLGNN relies on using a chemical-substructure-based graph (where nodes are chemical substructures) to represent a drug molecule. Furthermore, SLGNN incorporates generalized fussed lasso with message-passing algorithms to identify connected subgraphs that are critical for the drug-protein binding prediction. Due to the use of the chemical-substructure-based graph, it is guaranteed that any subgraphs in a drug identified by our SLGNN are chemically valid structures. These structures can be further interpreted as the key chemical structures for the drug to bind to the target protein. We demonstrate the explanatory power of our SLGNN by first showing all the key structures identified by our SLGNN are chemically valid. In addition, we illustrate that the key structures identified by our SLGNN have more predictive power than the key structures identified by the competing methods. At last, we use known drug-protein binding data to show the key structures identified by our SLGNN contain most of the binding sites. ",

However, standard neural network-based federated learning models have been shown to be susceptible to data leakage from the gradients shared with the server. In this work, we introduce federated learning with variational quantum circuit model built using expressive encoding maps coupled with overparameterized ans\\\"atze. We show that expressive maps lead to inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks, while overparameterization ensures model trainability. Our privacy framework centers on the complexity of solving the system of high-degree multivariate Chebyshev polynomials generated by the gradients of quantum circuit. We present compelling arguments highlighting the inherent difficulty in solving these equations, both in exact and approximate scenarios. Additionally, we delve into machine learning-based attack strategies and establish a direct connection between overparameterization in the original federated learning model and underparameterization in the attack model. Furthermore, we provide numerical scaling arguments showcasing that underparameterization of the expressive map in the attack model leads to the loss landscape being swamped with exponentially many spurious local minima points, thus making it extremely hard to realize a successful attack. This provides a strong claim, for the first time, that the nature of quantum machine learning models inherently helps prevent data leakage in federated learning. ",
