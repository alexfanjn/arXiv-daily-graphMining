    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing have been grafted onto programming language modeling for advancing code intelligence. Although it can be represented in the text format, code is syntactically more rigorous in order to be properly compiled or interpreted to perform a desired set of behaviors given any inputs. In this case, existing works benefit from syntactic representations to learn from code less ambiguously in the forms of abstract syntax tree, control-flow graph, etc. However, programs with the same purpose can be implemented in various ways showing different syntactic representations while the ones with similar implementations can have distinct behaviors. Though trivially demonstrated during executions, such semantics about functionality are challenging to be learned directly from code, especially in an unsupervised manner. Hence, in this paper, we propose FuzzPretrain to explore the dynamic information of programs revealed by their test cases and embed it into the feature representations of code as complements. The test cases are obtained with the assistance of a customized fuzzer and are only required during pre-training. FuzzPretrain yielded more than 6%/9% mAP improvements on code search over its counterparts trained with only source code or AST, respectively. Our extensive experimental results show the benefits of learning discriminative code representations with program executions. ",

    "title": "TCGF: A unified tensorized consensus graph framework for multi-view  representation learning",
    "abstract": "Multi-view learning techniques have recently gained significant attention in the machine learning domain for their ability to leverage consistency and complementary information across multiple views. However, there remains a lack of sufficient research on generalized multi-view frameworks that unify existing works into a scalable and robust learning framework, as most current works focus on specific styles of multi-view models. Additionally, most multi-view learning works rely heavily on specific-scale scenarios and fail to effectively comprehend multiple scales holistically. These limitations hinder the effective fusion of essential information from multiple views, resulting in poor generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a universal multi-view representation learning framework named Tensorized Consensus Graph Framework (TCGF). Specifically, it first provides a unified framework for existing multi-view works to exploit the representations for individual view, which aims to be suitable for arbitrary assumptions and different-scales datasets. Then, stacks them into a tensor under alignment basics as a high-order representation, allowing for the smooth propagation of consistency and complementary information across all views. Moreover, TCGF proposes learning a consensus embedding shared by adaptively collaborating all views to uncover the essential structure of the multi-view data, which utilizes view-consensus grouping effect to regularize the view-consensus representation. To further facilitate related research, we provide a specific implementation of TCGF for large-scale datasets, which can be efficiently solved by applying the alternating optimization strategy. Experimental results conducted on seven different-scales datasets indicate the superiority of the proposed TCGF against existing state-of-the-art multi-view learning methods. ",

    "abstract": "Existing data-free model stealing methods use a generator to produce samples in order to train a student model to match the target model outputs. To this end, the two main challenges are estimating gradients of the target model without access to its parameters, and generating a diverse set of training samples that thoroughly explores the input space. We propose a Dual Student method where two students are symmetrically trained in order to provide the generator a criterion to generate samples that the two students disagree on. On one hand, disagreement on a sample implies at least one student has classified the sample incorrectly when compared to the target model. This incentive towards disagreement implicitly encourages the generator to explore more diverse regions of the input space. On the other hand, our method utilizes gradients of student models to indirectly estimate gradients of the target model. We show that this novel training objective for the generator network is equivalent to optimizing a lower bound on the generator's loss if we had access to the target model gradients. We show that our new optimization framework provides more accurate gradient estimation of the target model and better accuracies on benchmark classification datasets. Additionally, our approach balances improved query efficiency with training computation cost. Finally, we demonstrate that our method serves as a better proxy model for transfer-based adversarial attacks than existing data-free model stealing methods. ",

Specifically, we take advantage of graph representations of HD-map and apply vector transformations to reshape the maps, to easily enrich the limited number of scenes. Additionally, we employ a rule-based model to generate trajectories based on augmented scenes; thus enlarging the trajectories beyond the collected real ones. To foster the learning of general representations within this augmented dataset, we comprehensively explore the different pre-training strategies, including extending the concept of a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) for trajectory forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our data expansion and pre-training strategies, which outperform the baseline prediction model by large margins, e.g. 5.04\\%, 3.84\\% and 8.30\\% in terms of $MR_6$, $minADE_6$ and $minFDE_6$.

The algorithm is based on a surprising reduction to minimum-weight perfect matching. Along the way, we give tight worst-case bounds on the length of the optimal threading and on the maximum number of times this threading can visit a single edge.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention operations and the extensive layering in graph transformer architectures present challenges when applying them to graph based prediction tasks. Fine-tuning, a common approach, is resource-intensive and requires storing multiple copies of large models. We propose a novel approach called deep graph prompt tuning as an alternative to fine-tuning for leveraging large graph transformer models in downstream graph based prediction tasks. Our method introduces trainable feature nodes to the graph and pre-pends task-specific tokens to the graph transformer, enhancing the model's expressive power. By freezing the pre-trained parameters and only updating the added tokens, our approach reduces the number of free parameters and eliminates the need for multiple model copies, making it suitable for small datasets and scalable to large graphs. Through extensive experiments on various-sized datasets, we demonstrate that deep graph prompt tuning achieves comparable or even superior performance to fine-tuning, despite utilizing significantly fewer task-specific parameters. Our contributions include the introduction of prompt tuning for graph transformers, its application to both graph transformers and message passing graph neural networks, improved efficiency and resource utilization, and compelling experimental results.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require a large number of labeled graph samples to obtain good performance on the graph classification task. The performance of GNNs degrades significantly as the number of labeled graph samples decreases. To reduce the annotation cost, it is therefore important to develop graph augmentation methods that can generate new graph instances to increase the size and diversity of the limited set of available labeled graph samples. In this work, we propose a novel mixup-based graph augmentation method, Graph Dual Mixup (GDM), that leverages both functional and structural information of the graph instances to generate new labeled graph samples. GDM employs a graph structural auto-encoder to learn structural embeddings of the graph samples, and then applies mixup to the structural information of the graphs in the learned structural embedding space and generates new graph structures from the mixup structural embeddings. As for the functional information, GDM applies mixup directly to the input node features of the graph samples to generate functional node feature information for new mixup graph instances. Jointly, the generated input node features and graph structures yield new graph samples which can supplement the set of original labeled graphs. Furthermore, we propose two novel Balanced Graph Sampling methods to enhance the balanced difficulty and diversity for the generated graph samples. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art graph augmentation methods when the labeled graphs are scarce. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to possess strong representation abilities over graph data. However, GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and even minor perturbations to the graph structure can significantly degrade their performance. Existing methods either are ineffective against sophisticated attacks or require the optimization of dense adjacency matrices, which is time-consuming and prone to local minima. To remedy this problem, we propose an Efficient Low-Rank Graph Neural Network (ELR-GNN) defense method, which aims to learn low-rank and sparse graph structures for defending against adversarial attacks, ensuring effective defense with greater efficiency. Specifically, ELR-GNN consists of two modules: a Coarse Low-Rank Estimation Module and a Fine-Grained Estimation Module. The first module adopts the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to initialize the low-rank adjacency matrix estimation, which serves as a starting point for optimizing the low-rank matrix. In the second module, the initial estimate is refined by jointly learning a low-rank sparse graph structure with the GNN model. Sparsity is incorporated into the learned low-rank adjacency matrix by pruning weak connections, which can reduce redundant data while maintaining valuable information. As a result, instead of using the dense adjacency matrix directly, ELR-GNN can learn a low-rank and sparse estimate of it in a simple, efficient and easy to optimize manner. The experimental results demonstrate that ELR-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN defense methods in the literature, in addition to being very efficient and easy to train. ",

While state-of-the-art WF techniques have claimed high attack accuracies, e.g., by leveraging Deep Neural Networks (DNN), several recent works have questioned the practicality of such WF attacks in the real world due to the assumptions made in the design and evaluation of these attacks. In this work, we argue that such impracticality issues are mainly due to the attacker's inability in collecting training data in comprehensive network conditions, e.g., a WF classifier may be trained only on samples collected on specific high-bandwidth network links but deployed on connections with different network conditions. We show that augmenting network traces can enhance the performance of WF classifiers in unobserved network conditions. Specifically, we introduce NetAugment, an augmentation technique tailored to the specifications of Tor traces. We instantiate NetAugment through semi-supervised and self-supervised learning techniques. Our extensive open-world and close-world experiments demonstrate that under practical evaluation settings, our WF attacks provide superior performances compared to the state-of-the-art; this is due to their use of augmented network traces for training, which allows them to learn the features of target traffic in unobserved settings. For instance, with a 5-shot learning in a closed-world scenario, our self-supervised WF attack (named NetCLR) reaches up to 80% accuracy when the traces for evaluation are collected in a setting unobserved by the WF adversary. This is compared to an accuracy of 64.4% achieved by the state-of-the-art Triplet Fingerprinting [35]. We believe that the promising results of our work can encourage the use of network trace augmentation in other types of network traffic analysis. ",

Nevertheless, it remains a challenging problem and practical applications often rely on post-processing techniques for restricting the predicted words via lexicons or language models. Despite their enhanced performance, such systems are less usable in contexts where out-of-vocabulary words are anticipated, e.g. for detecting misspelled words in school assessments. To that end, we introduce the task of comparing a handwriting image to text. To solve the problem, we propose an unrestricted binary classifier, consisting of a HWR feature extractor and a multimodal classification head which convolves the feature extractor output with the vector representation of the input text. Our model's classification head is trained entirely on synthetic data created using a state-of-the-art generative adversarial network. We demonstrate that, while maintaining high recall, the classifier can be calibrated to achieve an average precision increase of 19.5% compared to addressing the task by directly using state-of-the-art HWR models. Such massive performance gains can lead to significant productivity increases in applications utilizing human-in-the-loop automation. ",

The robots must execute a Perception-Action-Communication (PAC) loop -- they perceive their local environment, communicate with other robots, and take actions in real time. A fundamental challenge in decentralized PAC systems is to decide what information to communicate with the neighboring robots and how to take actions while utilizing the information shared by the neighbors. Recently, this has been addressed using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for applications such as flocking and coverage control. Although conceptually, GNN policies are fully decentralized, the evaluation and deployment of such policies have primarily remained centralized or restrictively decentralized. Furthermore, existing frameworks assume sequential execution of perception and action inference, which is very restrictive in real-world applications. This paper proposes a framework for asynchronous PAC in robot swarms, where decentralized GNNs are used to compute navigation actions and generate messages for communication. In particular, we use aggregated GNNs, which enable the exchange of hidden layer information between robots for computational efficiency and decentralized inference of actions. Furthermore, the modules in the framework are asynchronous, allowing robots to perform sensing, extracting information, communication, action inference, and control execution at different frequencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNs executed in the proposed framework in navigating large robot swarms for collaborative coverage of large environments. ",

In this paper, we present an innovative approach to intruder detection within the CAN bus, leveraging Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) techniques as introduced by Zhang, Tong, Xu, and Maciejewski in 2019. By harnessing the capabilities of deep learning, we aim to enhance attack detection accuracy while minimizing the requirement for manual feature engineering. Our experimental findings substantiate that the proposed GCN-based method surpasses existing IDSs in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, our approach demonstrates efficacy in detecting mixed attacks, which are more challenging to identify than single attacks. Furthermore, it reduces the necessity for extensive feature engineering and is particularly well-suited for real-time detection systems. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the pioneering application of GCN to CAN data for intrusion detection.

Moreover, the burgeoning demand for such services with ever-fluctuating users has engendered a need for heightened service continuity consideration in B5G. To enable these services, the edge-cloud paradigm is a potential solution to harness cloud capacity and effectively manage users in real time as they move across the network. However, edge-cloud networks confront a multitude of limitations, including networking and computing resources that must be collectively managed to unlock their full potential. This paper addresses the joint problem of service placement and resource allocation in a network-cloud integrated environment while considering capacity constraints, dynamic users, and end-to-end delays. We present a non-linear programming model that formulates the optimization problem with the aiming objective of minimizing overall cost while enhancing latency. Next, to address the problem, we introduce a DDQL-based technique using RNNs to predict user behavior, empowered by a water-filling-based algorithm for service placement. The proposed framework adeptly accommodates the dynamic nature of users, the placement of services that mandate ultra-low latency in B5G, and service continuity when users migrate from one location to another. Simulation results show that our solution provides timely responses that optimize the network's potential, offering a scalable and efficient placement. ",

Recent empirical studies have confirmed associations between CI and the software quality (SQ). However, no existing study investigates causal relationships between CI and SQ. This paper investigates it by applying the causal Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) technique. We combine two other strategies to support this technique: a literature review and a Mining Software Repository (MSR) study. In the first stage, we review the literature to discover existing associations between CI and SQ, which help us create a \"literature-based causal DAG\" in the second stage. This DAG encapsulates the literature assumptions regarding CI and its influence on SQ. In the third stage, we analyze 12 activity months for 70 opensource projects by mining software repositories -- 35 CI and 35 no-CI projects. This MSR study is not a typical \"correlation is not causation\" study because it is used to verify the relationships uncovered in the causal DAG produced in the first stages. The fourth stage consists of testing the statistical implications from the \"literature-based causal DAG\" on our dataset. Finally, in the fifth stage, we build a DAG with observations from the literature and the dataset, the \"literature-data DAG\". In addition to the direct causal effect of CI on SQ, we find evidence of indirect effects of CI. For example, CI affects teams' communication, which positively impacts SQ.

    "title": "Towards Effective Semantic OOD Detection in Unseen Domains: A Domain  Generalization Perspective",
    "abstract": "Two prevalent types of distributional shifts in machine learning are the covariate shift (as observed across different domains) and the semantic shift (as seen across different classes). Traditional OOD detection techniques typically address only one of these shifts. However, real-world testing environments often present a combination of both covariate and semantic shifts. In this study, we introduce a novel problem, semantic OOD detection across domains, which simultaneously addresses both distributional shifts. To this end, we introduce two regularization strategies: domain generalization regularization, which ensures semantic invariance across domains to counteract the covariate shift, and OOD detection regularization, designed to enhance OOD detection capabilities against the semantic shift through energy bounding. Through rigorous testing on three standard domain generalization benchmarks, our proposed framework showcases its superiority over conventional domain generalization approaches in terms of OOD detection performance. Moreover, it holds its ground by maintaining comparable InD classification accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "We consider how human-centered causal theories and tools from the dynamical systems literature can be deployed to guide the representation of data when training neural networks for complex classification tasks. Specifically, we use simulated data to show that training a neural network with a data representation that makes explicit the invariant structural causal features of the data generating process of an epidemic system improves out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization performance on a classification task as compared to a more naive approach to data representation. We take these results to demonstrate that using human-generated causal knowledge to reduce the epistemic uncertainty of ML developers can lead to more well-specified ML pipelines. This, in turn, points to the utility of a dynamical systems approach to the broader effort aimed at improving the robustness and safety of machine learning systems via improved ML system development practices.

This research stresses the need for the inclusion of Indigenous Data Sovereignty and centers on the importance of Indigenous rights over their own data. Inclusion is necessary in order to integrate Indigenous knowledge into the design, development, and implementation of data-reliant technology. To support this hypothesis and address the problem, the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) are applied. We cover how the colonial practices of data mining do not align with Indigenous convictions. The included case studies highlight connections to Indigenous rights in relation to the protection of data and environmental ecosystems, thus establishing how data governance can serve both the people and the Earth. By applying the CARE Principles to the issues that arise from data mining and neocolonialism, our goal is to provide a framework that can be used in technological development. The theory is that this could reflect outwards to promote data sovereignty generally and create new relationships between people and data that are ethical as opposed to driven by speed and profit. ",

Recently, a common solution to semantic segmentation is the end-to-end convolution neural network, which is much more accurate than traditional methods.Recently, the decoders based on attention achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various datasets. But these networks always are compared with the mIoU of previous SOTA networks to prove their superiority and ignore their characteristics without considering the computation complexity and precision in various categories, which is essential for engineering applications. Besides, the methods to analyze the FLOPs and memory are not consistent between different networks, which makes the comparison hard to be utilized. What's more, various methods utilize attention in semantic segmentation, but the conclusion of these methods is lacking. This paper first conducts experiments to analyze their computation complexity and compare their performance. Then it summarizes suitable scenes for these networks and concludes key points that should be concerned when constructing an attention network.

    "abstract": "Clinically, automated polyp segmentation techniques have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical diagnosis, thereby reducing the risk of colorectal cancer in patients. Unfortunately, existing methods suffer from two significant weaknesses that can impact the accuracy of segmentation. Firstly, features extracted by encoders are not adequately filtered and utilized. Secondly, semantic conflicts and information redundancy caused by feature fusion are not attended to. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach for polyp segmentation, named MLFF-Net, which leverages multi-level feature fusion and attention mechanisms. Specifically, MLFF-Net comprises three modules: Multi-scale Attention Module (MAM), High-level Feature Enhancement Module (HFEM), and Global Attention Module (GAM). Among these, MAM is used to extract multi-scale information and polyp details from the shallow output of the encoder. In HFEM, the deep features of the encoders complement each other by aggregation. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism redistributes the weight of the aggregated features, weakening the conflicting redundant parts and highlighting the information useful to the task. GAM combines features from the encoder and decoder features, as well as computes global dependencies to prevent receptive field locality. Experimental results on five public datasets show that the proposed method not only can segment multiple types of polyps but also has advantages over current state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization ability.

While these capabilities are well suited for robotics tasks, SNNs have seen limited adaptation in this field thus far. This work introduces a SNN for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) that is both trainable within minutes and queryable in milliseconds, making it well suited for deployment on compute-constrained robotic systems. Our proposed system, VPRTempo, overcomes slow training and inference times using an abstracted SNN that trades biological realism for efficiency. VPRTempo employs a temporal code that determines the timing of a single spike based on a pixel's intensity, as opposed to prior SNNs relying on rate coding that determined the number of spikes; improving spike efficiency by over 100%. VPRTempo is trained using Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity and a supervised delta learning rule enforcing that each output spiking neuron responds to just a single place. We evaluate our system on the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmark localization datasets, which include up to 27k places. We found that VPRTempo's accuracy is comparable to prior SNNs and the popular NetVLAD place recognition algorithm, while being several orders of magnitude faster and suitable for real-time deployment -- with inference speeds over 50 Hz on CPU. VPRTempo could be integrated as a loop closure component for online SLAM on resource-constrained systems such as space and underwater robots. ",

However, identifying Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) points in a LiDAR point cloud is challenging as point clouds lack semantically rich features when compared with RGB images. We revisit this problem from the perspective of selective classification, which introduces a selective function into the standard closed-set classification setup. Our solution is built upon the basic idea of abstaining from choosing any known categories but learns a point-wise abstaining penalty with a marginbased loss. Synthesizing outliers to approximate unlimited OOD samples is also critical to this idea, so we propose a strong synthesis pipeline that generates outliers originated from various factors: unrealistic object categories, sampling patterns and sizes. We demonstrate that learning different abstaining penalties, apart from point-wise penalty, for different types of (synthesized) outliers can further improve the performance. We benchmark our method on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes and achieve state-of-the-art results. Risk-coverage analysis further reveals intrinsic properties of different methods.

Specifically, the adversarial examples based on optimization and gradient are implemented for white/black-box attacks. Correspondingly, the adversarial example is optimized via reverse gradient propagation, and the perturbation is added adaptively in the direction of gradient rising. The black-box attack is achieved by relying on the transferability of such adversarial examples to different localizers. Extensive evaluations verify that the proposed attack sharply reduces the localization accuracy while preserving high visual quality of the attacked images. ",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time when non-speech audio signals are proposed for predicting occupancy.

To accomplish this, we deployed our sensor-based platform in the waiting room of a large hospital with IRB approval over a period of several months to capture non-speech audio and thermal images for the training and evaluation of our models. The proposed non-speech-based approach outperformed the thermal camera-based model and all other baselines. In addition to demonstrating superior performance without utilizing speech audio, we conduct further analysis using differential privacy techniques to provide additional privacy guarantees. Overall, our work demonstrates the viability of employing non-speech audio data for accurate occupancy estimation, while also ensuring the exclusion of speech-related content and providing robust privacy protections through differential privacy guarantees.

    "abstract": "Distributed Volt-Var Control (VVC) is a widely used control mode of smart inverters. However, necessary VVC curve parameters are remotely communicated to the smart inverter, which opens doors for cyberattacks. If the VVC curves of an inverter are maliciously manipulated, the attacked inverter's reactive power injection will oscillate, causing undesirable voltage oscillations to manifest in the distribution system, which, in turn, threatens the system's stability. In contrast with previous works that proposed methods to mitigate the oscillations after they are already present in the system, this paper presents an intrusion detection method to detect malicious VVC curves once they are communicated to the inverter. The proposed method utilizes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that is trained on features extracted from only the local measurements of the inverter. After a smart inverter is equipped with the proposed method, any communicated VVC curve will be verified by the MLP once received. If the curve is found to be malicious, it will be rejected, thus preventing unwanted oscillations beforehand. Otherwise, legitimate curves will be permitted. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified using the 9-bus Canadian urban benchmark distribution system simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC environment. Our results show that the proposed solution can accurately detect malicious VVC curves. ",

To this end, we devise MQINet, which employs multi-dimension queries and interactions for stereo image deraining.

This module leverages dimension-wise queries that are independent of the input features and employs global context-aware attention (GCA) to capture essential features while avoiding the entanglement of redundant or irrelevant information. Meanwhile, we introduce an intra-view physics-aware attention (IPA) based on the inverse physical model of rainy images. IPA extracts shallow features that are sensitive to the physics of rain degradation, facilitating the reduction of rain-related artifacts during the early learning period. Furthermore, we integrate a cross-view multi-dimension interacting attention mechanism (CMIA) to foster comprehensive feature interaction between the two views across multiple dimensions.

Federated learning has been proposed as a solution to privacy challenges however report issues in generating the global prediction model due to data heterogeneity, variations in generation patterns, and the high number of parameters leading to even lower prediction accuracy. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing FedWOA a novel federated learning model that employs the Whale Optimization Algorithm to aggregate global prediction models from the weights of local LTSM neural network models trained on prosumer energy data. The proposed solution identifies the optimal vector of weights in the search spaces of the local models to construct the global shared model and then is subsequently transmitted to the local nodes to improve the prediction quality at the prosumer site while for handling non-IID data K-Means was used for clustering prosumers with similar scale of energy data. The evaluation results on prosumers energy data have shown that FedWOA can effectively enhance the accuracy of energy prediction models accuracy by 25% for MSE and 16% for MAE compared to FedAVG while demonstrating good convergence and reduced loss.

This newly added layer is trained utilizing pseudo-labels produced by CLIP, coupled with a self-training strategy. The LP-CLIP technique offers a promising approach to enhance the robustness of CLIP without the need for annotations. By leveraging a simple linear probing layer, we aim to improve the model's ability to withstand various uncertainties and challenges commonly encountered in real-world scenarios.

In our study, we first identify two crucial advantages of contrastive learning compared to meta learning, including (1) the comprehensive utilization of graph nodes and (2) the power of graph augmentations. To integrate the strength of both contrastive learning and meta learning on the few-shot node classification tasks, we introduce a new paradigm: Contrastive Few-Shot Node Classification (COLA). Specifically, COLA employs graph augmentations to identify semantically similar nodes, which enables the construction of meta-tasks without the need for label information. Therefore, COLA can utilize all nodes to construct meta-tasks, further reducing the risk of overfitting. Through extensive experiments, we validate the essentiality of each component in our design and demonstrate that COLA achieves new state-of-the-art on all tasks. ",

    "abstract": "We present a new method for automatically classifying medical images that uses weak causal signals in the scene to model how the presence of a feature in one part of the image affects the appearance of another feature in a different part of the image. Our method consists of two components: a convolutional neural network backbone and a causality-factors extractor module. The latter computes weights for the feature maps to enhance each feature map according to its causal influence in the image's scene. We can modify the functioning of the causality module by using two external signals, thus obtaining different variants of our method. We evaluate our method on a public dataset of prostate MRI images for prostate cancer diagnosis, using quantitative experiments, qualitative assessment, and ablation studies. Our results show that our method improves classification performance and produces more robust predictions, focusing on relevant parts of the image. That is especially important in medical imaging, where accurate and reliable classifications are essential for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. ",

There were several attempts to characterize the minimum width $w_{\\min}$ enabling the universal approximation property; however, only a few of them found the exact values. In this work, we show that the minimum width for the universal approximation of $L^p$ functions from $[0,1]^{d_x}$ to $\\mathbb R^{d_y}$ is exactly $\\max\\{d_x,d_y,2\\}$ if an activation function is ReLU-Like (e.g., ReLU, GELU, Softplus).

We next prove a lower bound on $w_{\\min}$ for uniform approximation using general activation functions including ReLU: $w_{\\min}\\ge d_y+1$ if $d_x<d_y\\le2d_x$.

The method groups historical observations into clusters according to the values of influential variables. It is applied either to the original or to the differentiated power-prosumption time series. The clusters are considered statistically representative pools of future realizations of power prosumption (or its derivative). They are used to determine empirical PDFs and, by extracting the quantiles, to deliver PIs for respective arbitrary confidence levels. The models are validated a posteriori by carrying out a performance analysis that uses experimentally observed power-prosumption for different building types, thus allowing the identification of the dominant model.

While current data augmentation techniques usually perform random transformations on all point cloud objects in an offline way and ignore the structure of the samples, resulting in over-or-under enhancement. In this work, we propose an alternative to make sample-adaptive transformations based on the structure of the sample to cope with potential corruption via an auto-augmentation framework, named as AdaptPoint. Specially, we leverage a imitator, consisting of a Deformation Controller and a Mask Controller, respectively in charge of predicting deformation parameters and producing a per-point mask, based on the intrinsic structural information of the input point cloud, and then conduct corruption simulations on top. Then a discriminator is utilized to prevent the generation of excessive corruption that deviates from the original data distribution. In addition, a perception-guidance feedback mechanism is incorporated to guide the generation of samples with appropriate difficulty level. Furthermore, to address the paucity of real-world corrupted point cloud, we also introduce a new dataset ScanObjectNN-C, that exhibits greater similarity to actual data in real-world environments, especially when contrasted with preceding CAD datasets. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple corruption benchmarks, including ModelNet-C, our ScanObjectNN-C, and ShapeNet-C. ",

    "abstract": "3D scene graphs offer a more efficient representation of the environment by hierarchically organizing diverse semantic entities and the topological relationships among them. Fiducial markers, on the other hand, offer a valuable mechanism for encoding comprehensive information pertaining to environments and the objects within them. In the context of Visual SLAM (VSLAM), especially when the reconstructed maps are enriched with practical semantic information, these markers have the potential to enhance the map by augmenting valuable semantic information and fostering meaningful connections among the semantic objects. In this regard, this paper exploits the potential of fiducial markers to incorporate a VSLAM framework with hierarchical representations that generates optimizable multi-layered vision-based situational graphs. The framework comprises a conventional VSLAM system with low-level feature tracking and mapping capabilities bolstered by the incorporation of a fiducial marker map. The fiducial markers aid in identifying walls and doors in the environment, subsequently establishing meaningful associations with high-level entities, including corridors and rooms. Experimental results are conducted on a real-world dataset collected using various legged robots and benchmarked against a Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR)-based framework (S-Graphs) as the ground truth. Consequently, our framework not only excels in crafting a richer, multi-layered hierarchical map of the environment but also shows enhancement in robot pose accuracy when contrasted with state-of-the-art methodologies.

A key challenge is to model user preferences accurately under the condition of data sparsity. To address this challenge, some methods have leveraged external user behavior data from multiple platforms to enrich user representation. However, all of these methods require a consistent user ID across platforms and ignore the information from similar users. In this study, we propose RUEL, a novel retrieval-based sequential recommender that can effectively incorporate external anonymous user behavior data from Edge browser logs to enhance recommendation. We first collect and preprocess a large volume of Edge browser logs over a one-year period and link them to target entities that correspond to candidate items in recommendation datasets. We then design a contrastive learning framework with a momentum encoder and a memory bank to retrieve the most relevant and diverse browsing sequences from the full browsing log based on the semantic similarity between user representations. After retrieval, we apply an item-level attentive selector to filter out noisy items and generate refined sequence embeddings for the final predictor. RUEL is the first method that connects user browsing data with typical recommendation datasets and can be generalized to various recommendation scenarios and datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on four real datasets for sequential recommendation tasks and demonstrate that RUEL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We also conduct ablation studies and qualitative analysis to validate the effectiveness of each component of RUEL and provide additional insights into our method. ",

The NeRF model generates a secret viewpoint image, which serves as a backdoor. Subsequently, we train a message extractor using overfitting to establish a one-to-one mapping between the secret message and the secret viewpoint image. The sender delivers the trained NeRF model and the message extractor to the receiver over the open channel, and the receiver utilizes the key shared by both parties to obtain the rendered image in the secret view from the NeRF model, and then obtains the secret message through the message extractor. The inherent complexity of the viewpoint information prevents attackers from stealing the secret message accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that the message extractor trained in this letter achieves high-capacity steganography with fast performance, achieving a 100\\% accuracy in message extraction.

    "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) have been successfully deployed in various fields. In NNs, a large number of multiplyaccumulate (MAC) operations need to be performed. Most existing digital hardware platforms rely on parallel MAC units to accelerate these MAC operations. However, under a given area constraint, the number of MAC units in such platforms is limited, so MAC units have to be reused to perform MAC operations in a neural network. Accordingly, the throughput in generating classification results is not high, which prevents the application of traditional hardware platforms in extreme-throughput scenarios. Besides, the power consumption of such platforms is also high, mainly due to data movement. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we propose to flatten and implement all the operations at neurons, e.g., MAC and ReLU, in a neural network with their corresponding logic circuits. To improve the throughput and reduce the power consumption of such logic designs, the weight values are embedded into the MAC units to simplify the logic, which can reduce the delay of the MAC units and the power consumption incurred by weight movement. The retiming technique is further used to improve the throughput of the logic circuits for neural networks. In addition, we propose a hardware-aware training method to reduce the area of logic designs of neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed logic designs can achieve high throughput and low power consumption for several high-throughput applications. ",

Currently, real-time semantic segmentation networks commonly employ either encoder-decoder architecture or two-pathway architecture. Generally speaking, encoder-decoder models tend to be quicker,whereas two-pathway models exhibit higher accuracy. To leverage both strengths, we present the Spatial-Assistant Encoder-Decoder Network (SANet) to fuse the two architectures. In the overall architecture, we uphold the encoder-decoder design while maintaining the feature maps in the middle section of the encoder and utilizing atrous convolution branches for same-resolution feature extraction. Toward the end of the encoder, we integrate the asymmetric pooling pyramid pooling module (APPPM) to optimize the semantic extraction of the feature maps. This module incorporates asymmetric pooling layers that extract features at multiple resolutions.

    "abstract": "Precise polyp segmentation is vital for the early diagnosis and prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) in clinical practice. However, due to scale variation and blurry polyp boundaries, it is still a challenging task to achieve satisfactory segmentation performance with different scales and shapes. In this study, we present a novel Edge-aware Feature Aggregation Network (EFA-Net) for polyp segmentation, which can fully make use of cross-level and multi-scale features to enhance the performance of polyp segmentation. Specifically, we first present an Edge-aware Guidance Module (EGM) to combine the low-level features with the high-level features to learn an edge-enhanced feature, which is incorporated into each decoder unit using a layer-by-layer strategy. Besides, a Scale-aware Convolution Module (SCM) is proposed to learn scale-aware features by using dilated convolutions with different ratios, in order to effectively deal with scale variation. Further, a Cross-level Fusion Module (CFM) is proposed to effectively integrate the cross-level features, which can exploit the local and global contextual information. Finally, the outputs of CFMs are adaptively weighted by using the learned edge-aware feature, which are then used to produce multiple side-out segmentation maps. Experimental results on five widely adopted colonoscopy datasets show that our EFA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art polyp segmentation methods in terms of generalization and effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "Annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds for perception tasks including 3D object detection and LiDAR semantic segmentation is notoriously time-and-energy-consuming. To alleviate the burden from labeling, it is promising to perform large-scale pre-training and fine-tune the pre-trained backbone on different downstream datasets as well as tasks. In this paper, we propose SPOT, namely Scalable Pre-training via Occupancy prediction for learning Transferable 3D representations, and demonstrate its effectiveness on various public datasets with different downstream tasks under the label-efficiency setting. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Occupancy prediction is shown to be promising for learning general representations, which is demonstrated by extensive experiments on plenty of datasets and tasks. (2) SPOT uses beam re-sampling technique for point cloud augmentation and applies class-balancing strategies to overcome the domain gap brought by various LiDAR sensors and annotation strategies in different datasets. (3) Scalable pre-training is observed, that is, the downstream performance across all the experiments gets better with more pre-training data. We believe that our findings can facilitate understanding of LiDAR point clouds and pave the way for future exploration in LiDAR pre-training. Codes and models will be released. ",

    "abstract": "The curve-based lane representation is a popular approach in many lane detection methods, as it allows for the representation of lanes as a whole object and maximizes the use of holistic information about the lanes. However, the curves produced by these methods may not fit well with irregular lines, which can lead to gaps in performance compared to indirect representations such as segmentation-based or point-based methods. We have observed that these lanes are not intended to be irregular, but they appear zigzagged in the perspective view due to being drawn on uneven pavement. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the lane detection task by decomposing it into two parts: curve modeling and ground height regression. Specifically, we use a parameterized curve to represent lanes in the BEV space to reflect the original distribution of lanes. For the second part, since ground heights are determined by natural factors such as road conditions and are less holistic, we regress the ground heights of key points separately from the curve modeling. Additionally, we have unified the 2D and 3D lane detection tasks by designing a new framework and a series of losses to guide the optimization of models with or without 3D lane labels. Our experiments on 2D lane detection benchmarks (TuSimple and CULane), as well as the recently proposed 3D lane detection datasets (ONCE-3Dlane and OpenLane), have shown significant improvements. We will make our well-documented source code publicly available. ",

To bridge this gap, we present a Parallel Stacked Aggregation Network that processes raw audio. Our approach employs a split-transform-aggregation technique, dividing utterances into convolved representations, applying transformations, and aggregating the results to identify logical (LA) and physical (PA) spoofing attacks. Evaluation of the ASVspoof-2019 and VSDC datasets shows the effectiveness of the proposed system. It outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, displaying reduced EER disparities and superior performance in detecting spoofing attacks.

    "abstract": "Various mobile applications that comprise dependent tasks are gaining widespread popularity and are increasingly complex. These applications often have low-latency requirements, resulting in a significant surge in demand for computing resources. With the emergence of mobile edge computing (MEC), it becomes the most significant issue to offload the application tasks onto small-scale devices deployed at the edge of the mobile network for obtaining a high-quality user experience. However, since the environment of MEC is dynamic, most existing works focusing on task graph offloading, which rely heavily on expert knowledge or accurate analytical models, fail to fully adapt to such environmental changes, resulting in the reduction of user experience. This paper investigates the task graph offloading in MEC, considering the time-varying computation capabilities of edge computing devices. To adapt to environmental changes, we model the task graph scheduling for computation offloading as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Then, we design a deep reinforcement learning algorithm (SATA-DRL) to learn the task scheduling strategy from the interaction with the environment, to improve user experience. Extensive simulations validate that SATA-DRL is superior to existing strategies in terms of reducing average makespan and deadline violation. ",

While uncertainty quantification has been recently proposed to detect adversarial inputs, under the assumption that such attacks exhibit a higher prediction uncertainty than pristine data, it has been shown that adaptive attacks specifically aimed at reducing also the uncertainty estimate can easily bypass this defense mechanism. In this work, we focus on a different adversarial scenario in which the attacker is still interested in manipulating the uncertainty estimate, but regardless of the correctness of the prediction; in particular, the goal is to undermine the use of machine-learning models when their outputs are consumed by a downstream module or by a human operator. Following such direction, we: \\textit{(i)} design a threat model for attacks targeting uncertainty quantification; \\textit{(ii)} devise different attack strategies on conceptually different UQ techniques spanning for both classification and semantic segmentation problems; \\textit{(iii)} conduct a first complete and extensive analysis to compare the differences between some of the most employed UQ approaches under attack.

    "abstract": "Object detection is an essential and fundamental task in computer vision and satellite image processing. Existing deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance thanks to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets. Yet, in real-world applications the availability of labels is limited. In this context, few-shot object detection (FSOD) has emerged as a promising direction, which aims at enabling the model to detect novel objects with only few of them annotated. However, many existing FSOD algorithms overlook a critical issue: when an input image contains multiple novel objects and only a subset of them are annotated, the unlabeled objects will be considered as background during training. This can cause confusions and severely impact the model's ability to recall novel objects. To address this issue, we propose a self-training-based FSOD (ST-FSOD) approach, which incorporates the self-training mechanism into the few-shot fine-tuning process. ST-FSOD aims to enable the discovery of novel objects that are not annotated, and take them into account during training. On the one hand, we devise a two-branch region proposal networks (RPN) to separate the proposal extraction of base and novel objects, On another hand, we incorporate the student-teacher mechanism into RPN and the region of interest (RoI) head to include those highly confident yet unlabeled targets as pseudo labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in various FSOD settings by a large margin.

In this study, we aim to learn the implicit relationship between motifs and their variations via representation learning, using the Siamese network architecture and a pretraining and fine-tuning pipeline. A regularization-based method, VICReg, is adopted for pretraining, while contrastive learning is used for fine-tuning. Experimental results on a retrieval-based task show that these two methods complement each other, yielding an improvement of 12.6% in the area under the precision-recall curve. Lastly, we visualize the acquired motif representations, offering an intuitive comprehension of the overall structure of a music piece.

Given structure parameters as input, NMN return continuously differentiable strain energy density functions, thus guaranteeing conservative forces by construction. Though trained on simulation data, NMN do not inherit the discontinuities resulting from topological changes in finite element meshes. They instead provide a smooth map from parameter to performance space that is fully differentiable and thus well-suited for gradient-based optimization. On this basis, we formulate inverse material design as a nonlinear programming problem that leverages neural networks for both objective functions and constraints. We use this approach to automatically design materials with desired strain-stress curves, prescribed directional stiffness and Poisson ratio profiles. We furthermore conduct ablation studies on network nonlinearities and show the advantages of our approach compared to native-scale optimization. ",

To tackle this problem, we propose a self-purified FL (SPFL) method that enables benign clients to exploit trusted historical features of locally purified model to supervise the training of aggregated model in each iteration. The purification is performed by an attention-guided self-knowledge distillation where the teacher and student models are optimized locally for task loss, distillation loss and attention-based loss simultaneously. SPFL imposes no restriction on the communication protocol and aggregator at the server. It can work in tandem with any existing secure aggregation algorithms and protocols for augmented security and privacy guarantee. We experimentally demonstrate that SPFL outperforms state-of-the-art FL defenses against various poisoning attacks. The attack success rate of SPFL trained model is at most 3$\\%$ above that of a clean model, even if the poisoning attack is launched in every iteration with all but one malicious clients in the system. Meantime, it improves the model quality on normal inputs compared to FedAvg, either under attack or in the absence of an attack. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely used in source code classification tasks, such as code classification according to their functionalities, code authorship attribution, and vulnerability detection. Unfortunately, the black-box nature of deep learning makes it hard to interpret and understand why a classifier (i.e., classification model) makes a particular prediction on a given example. This lack of interpretability (or explainability) might have hindered their adoption by practitioners because it is not clear when they should or should not trust a classifier's prediction. The lack of interpretability has motivated a number of studies in recent years. However, existing methods are neither robust nor able to cope with out-of-distribution examples. In this paper, we propose a novel method to produce \\underline{Rob}ust \\underline{in}terpreters for a given deep learning-based code classifier; the method is dubbed Robin. The key idea behind Robin is a novel hybrid structure combining an interpreter and two approximators, while leveraging the ideas of adversarial training and data augmentation. Experimental results show that on average the interpreter produced by Robin achieves a 6.11\\% higher fidelity (evaluated on the classifier), 67.22\\% higher fidelity (evaluated on the approximator), and 15.87x higher robustness than that of the three existing interpreters we evaluated. Moreover, the interpreter is 47.31\\% less affected by out-of-distribution examples than that of LEMNA. ",

Although machine learning (ML) is a promising approach to effectively predict network traffic, the centralization of massive data in a single data center raises issues regarding confidentiality, privacy and data transfer demands. To address these challenges, federated learning (FL) emerges as an appealing ML training framework which offers high accurate predictions through parallel distributed computations. However, the environmental impact of these methods is often overlooked, which calls into question their sustainability. In this paper, we address the trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption in FL by proposing a novel sustainability indicator that allows assessing the feasibility of ML models. Then, we comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) architectures in a federated scenario using real-world measurements from base station (BS) sites in the area of Barcelona, Spain. Our findings indicate that larger ML models achieve marginally improved performance but have a significant environmental impact in terms of carbon footprint, which make them impractical for real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Whole Slide Images (WSIs) present a challenging computer vision task due to their gigapixel size and presence of numerous artefacts. Yet they are a valuable resource for patient diagnosis and stratification, often representing the gold standard for diagnostic tasks. Real-world clinical datasets tend to come as sets of heterogeneous WSIs with labels present at the patient-level, with poor to no annotations. Weakly supervised attention-based multiple instance learning approaches have been developed in recent years to address these challenges, but can fail to resolve both long and short-range dependencies. Here we propose an end-to-end multi-stain self-attention graph (MUSTANG) multiple instance learning pipeline, which is designed to solve a weakly-supervised gigapixel multi-image classification task, where the label is assigned at the patient-level, but no slide-level labels or region annotations are available. The pipeline uses a self-attention based approach by restricting the operations to a highly sparse k-Nearest Neighbour Graph of embedded WSI patches based on the Euclidean distance. We show this approach achieves a state-of-the-art F1-score/AUC of 0.89/0.92, outperforming the widely used CLAM model. Our approach is highly modular and can easily be modified to suit different clinical datasets, as it only requires a patient-level label without annotations and accepts WSI sets of different sizes, as the graphs can be of varying sizes and structures.

While performing stylization directly on NeRF guarantees appearance consistency over arbitrary novel views, it is a challenging problem to guide the transfer of patterns from the style image onto different parts of the NeRF scene. In this work, we propose a stylization framework for NeRF based on local style transfer. In particular, we use a hash-grid encoding to learn the embedding of the appearance and geometry components, and show that the mapping defined by the hash table allows us to control the stylization to a certain extent. Stylization is then achieved by optimizing the appearance branch while keeping the geometry branch fixed. To support local style transfer, we propose a new loss function that utilizes a segmentation network and bipartite matching to establish region correspondences between the style image and the content images obtained from volume rendering. Our experiments show that our method yields plausible stylization results with novel view synthesis while having flexible controllability via manipulating and customizing the region correspondences.

Currently, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines struggle from scalability and noise issues to render a commercial quantum computer.

As the complexity of quantum algorithms and implementation increases, software control of quantum circuits may lead to a more intricate design. Consequently, the verification of quantum circuits becomes crucial in ensuring the correctness of the compilation, along with other processes, including quantum error correction and assertions, that can increase the fidelity of quantum circuits. In this paper, we propose a Decision Diagram-based quantum equivalence checking approach, QuBEC, that requires less latency compared to existing techniques, while accounting for circuits with quantum error correction redundancy. Our proposed methodology reduces verification time on certain benchmark circuits by up to $271.49 \\times$, while the number of Decision Diagram nodes required is reduced by up to $798.31 \\times$, compared to state-of-the-art strategies. The proposed QuBEC framework can contribute to the advancement of quantum computing by enabling faster and more efficient verification of quantum circuits, paving the way for the development of larger and more complex quantum algorithms.

The goal of learner is to mix these data sources in a target-distribution aware way and simultaneously minimize the empirical risk on the mixed source. The literature has made some tangible advancements in establishing theory of learning on mixture domain. However, there are still two unsolved problems. Firstly, how to estimate the optimal mixture of sources, given a target domain; Secondly, when there are numerous target domains, how to solve empirical risk minimization (ERM) for each target using possibly unique mixture of data sources in a computationally efficient manner. In this paper we address both problems efficiently and with guarantees. We cast the first problem, mixture weight estimation, as a convex-nonconcave compositional minimax problem, and propose an efficient stochastic algorithm with provable stationarity guarantees. Next, for the second problem, we identify that for certain regimes, solving ERM for each target domain individually can be avoided, and instead parameters for a target optimal model can be viewed as a non-linear function on a space of the mixture coefficients. Building upon this, we show that in the offline setting, a GD-trained overparameterized neural network can provably learn such function to predict the model of target domain instead of solving a designated ERM problem. Finally, we also consider an online setting and propose a label efficient online algorithm, which predicts parameters for new targets given an arbitrary sequence of mixing coefficients, while enjoying regret guarantees.

However, achieving high precision and DNN accuracy using such technologies is challenging, as high-precision data converters are costly and impractical. In this paper, we address this challenge by using the residue number system (RNS). RNS allows composing high-precision operations from multiple low-precision operations, thereby eliminating the information loss caused by the limited precision of the data converters. Our study demonstrates that analog accelerators utilizing the RNS-based approach can achieve ${\\geq}99\\%$ of FP32 accuracy for state-of-the-art DNN inference using data converters with only $6$-bit precision whereas a conventional analog core requires more than $8$-bit precision to achieve the same accuracy in the same DNNs. The reduced precision requirements imply that using RNS can reduce the energy consumption of analog accelerators by several orders of magnitude while maintaining the same throughput and precision. Our study extends this approach to DNN training, where we can efficiently train DNNs using $7$-bit integer arithmetic while achieving accuracy comparable to FP32 precision. Lastly, we present a fault-tolerant dataflow using redundant RNS error-correcting codes to protect the computation against noise and errors inherent within an analog accelerator. ",

However, graphs with topology and attributes usually have considerable cross-domain disparity and there are numerous real-world scenarios where merely a subset of nodes are labeled in the source graph. This imposes critical challenges on graph transfer learning due to serious domain shifts and label scarcity. To address these challenges, we propose a method named Semi-supervised Graph Domain Adaptation (SGDA). To deal with the domain shift, we add adaptive shift parameters to each of the source nodes, which are trained in an adversarial manner to align the cross-domain distributions of node embedding, thus the node classifier trained on labeled source nodes can be transferred to the target nodes. Moreover, to address the label scarcity, we propose pseudo-labeling on unlabeled nodes, which improves classification on the target graph via measuring the posterior influence of nodes based on their relative position to the class centroids. Finally, extensive experiments on a range of publicly accessible datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed SGDA in different experimental settings. ",

We show that arbitrary distribution shifts do not, in general, admit invariant and robust probabilistic predictions, in contrast to the setting of point prediction. We illustrate how to choose evaluation metrics and restrict the class of distribution shifts to allow for identifiability and invariance in the prototypical Gaussian heteroscedastic linear model. Motivated by these findings, we propose a method to yield invariant probabilistic predictions, called IPP, and study the consistency of the underlying parameters.

Compress sensing was invented for this purpose and has become the most popular method until deep learning (DL) based DMRI reconstruction methods emerged in the past decade.

We can do quantum error correction more effectively if our decoding algorithms take into account this prior information about the specific noise present. This motivates us to consider the complexity of surface code decoding where the input to the decoding problem is not only the syndrome-measurement results, but also a noise model in the form of probabilities of single-qubit Pauli errors for every qubit. In this setting, we show that Maximum Probability Error (MPE) decoding and Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding for the surface code are NP-hard and #P-hard, respectively. We reduce directly from SAT for MPE decoding, and from #SAT for ML decoding, by showing how to transform a boolean formula into a qubit-dependent Pauli noise model and set of syndromes that encode the satisfiability properties of the formula. We also give hardness of approximation results for MPE and ML decoding. These are worst-case hardness results that do not contradict the empirical fact that many efficient surface code decoders are correct in the average case (i.e., for most sets of syndromes and for most reasonable noise models).

    "abstract": "We investigate the dynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) with the goal of deriving an upper bound on their reaction rates. This task is challenging due to the nonlinear nature and discrete structure inherent in CRNs. To address this, we employ an information geometric approach, using the natural gradient, to develop a nonlinear system that yields an upper bound for CRN dynamics. We validate our approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating faster convergence in a specific class of CRNs. This class is characterized by the number of chemicals, the maximum value of stoichiometric coefficients of the chemical reactions, and the number of reactions. We also compare our method to a conventional approach, showing that the latter cannot provide an upper bound on reaction rates of CRNs. While our study focuses on CRNs, the ubiquity of hypergraphs in fields from natural sciences to engineering suggests that our method may find broader applications, including in information science.

    "abstract": "Simulation studies play a key role in the validation of causal inference methods. The simulation results are reliable only if the study is designed according to the promised operational conditions of the method-in-test. Still, many causal inference literature tend to design over-restricted or misspecified studies. In this paper, we elaborate on the problem of improper simulation design for causal methods and compile a list of desiderata for an effective simulation framework. We then introduce partially-randomized causal simulation (PARCS), a simulation framework that meets those desiderata. PARCS synthesizes data based on graphical causal models and a wide range of adjustable parameters. There is a legible mapping from usual causal assumptions to the parameters, thus, users can identify and specify the subset of related parameters and randomize the remaining ones to generate a range of complying data-generating processes for their causal method. The result is a more comprehensive and inclusive empirical investigation for causal claims. Using PARCS, we reproduce and extend the simulation studies of two well-known causal discovery and missing data analysis papers to emphasize the necessity of a proper simulation design. Our results show that those papers would have improved and extended the findings, had they used PARCS for simulation. The framework is implemented as a Python package, too. By discussing the comprehensiveness and transparency of PARCS, we encourage causal inference researchers to utilize it as a standard tool for future works. ",

    "abstract": "We investigate nonlinear prediction/regression in an online setting and introduce a hybrid model that effectively mitigates, via a joint mechanism through a state space formulation, the need for domain-specific feature engineering issues of conventional nonlinear prediction models and achieves an efficient mix of nonlinear and linear components. In particular, we use recursive structures to extract features from raw sequential sequences and a traditional linear time series model to deal with the intricacies of the sequential data, e.g., seasonality, trends. The state-of-the-art ensemble or hybrid models typically train the base models in a disjoint manner, which is not only time consuming but also sub-optimal due to the separation of modeling or independent training. In contrast, as the first time in the literature, we jointly optimize an enhanced recurrent neural network (LSTM) for automatic feature extraction from raw data and an ARMA-family time series model (SARIMAX) for effectively addressing peculiarities associated with time series data. We achieve this by introducing novel state space representations for the base models, which are then combined to provide a full state space representation of the hybrid or the ensemble. Hence, we are able to jointly optimize both models in a single pass via particle filtering, for which we also provide the update equations. The introduced architecture is generic so that one can use other recurrent architectures, e.g., GRUs, traditional time series-specific models, e.g., ETS or other optimization methods, e.g., EKF, UKF. Due to such novel combination and joint optimization, we demonstrate significant improvements in widely publicized real life competition datasets. We also openly share our code for further research and replicability of our results. ",

PINN exploits the acoustic wave equation to assist soundfield interpolation under a limited number of monitoring microphones, and demonstrates better interpolation performance than the spherical harmonic method in simulations.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional electron microscopy (3DEM) is an essential technique to investigate volumetric tissue ultra-structure. Due to technical limitations and high imaging costs, samples are often imaged anisotropically, where resolution in the axial direction ($z$) is lower than in the lateral directions $(x,y)$. This anisotropy 3DEM can hamper subsequent analysis and visualization tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel deep-learning (DL)-based self-supervised super-resolution approach that computationally reconstructs isotropic 3DEM from the anisotropic acquisition. The proposed DL-based framework is built upon the U-shape architecture incorporating vision-transformer (ViT) blocks, enabling high-capability learning of local and global multi-scale image dependencies. To train the tailored network, we employ a self-supervised approach. Specifically, we generate pairs of anisotropic and isotropic training datasets from the given anisotropic 3DEM data. By feeding the given anisotropic 3DEM dataset in the trained network through our proposed framework, the isotropic 3DEM is obtained. Importantly, this isotropic reconstruction approach relies solely on the given anisotropic 3DEM dataset and does not require pairs of co-registered anisotropic and isotropic 3DEM training datasets. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments using three 3DEM datasets acquired from brain. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed framework could successfully reconstruct isotropic 3DEM from the anisotropic acquisition. ",

Data compression is crucial for space missions to reduce data storage and video bandwidth requirements by eliminating redundancies in the data. In this paper, we present a novel neural Transformer-based video compression approach specifically designed for the SDO images. Our primary objective is to efficiently exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies inherent in solar images to obtain a high compression ratio. Our proposed architecture benefits from a novel Transformer block called Fused Local-aware Window (FLaWin), which incorporates window-based self-attention modules and an efficient fused local-aware feed-forward (FLaFF) network. This architectural design allows us to simultaneously capture short-range and long-range information while facilitating the extraction of rich and diverse contextual representations. Moreover, this design choice results in reduced computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the significant contribution of the FLaWin Transformer block to the compression performance, outperforming conventional hand-engineered video codecs such as H.264 and H.265 in terms of rate-distortion trade-off.

To make transmission efficient and feasible, image compression systems need to be exploited. Recently successful end-to-end optimized neural network-based image compression systems have shown great potential to be used in an ad-hoc manner. In this work we have proposed a transformer-based multi-spectral neural image compressor to efficiently capture redundancies both intra/inter-wavelength. To unleash the locality of window-based self attention mechanism, we propose an inter-window aggregated token multi head self attention. Additionally to make the neural compressor autoencoder shift invariant, a randomly shifted window attention mechanism is used which makes the transformer blocks insensitive to translations in their input domain. We demonstrate that the proposed approach not only outperforms the conventional compression algorithms but also it is able to better decorrelates images along the multiple wavelengths compared to single spectral compression.

Most existing learning-based image compression methods utilize convolutional-based transform, which lacks the ability to model long-range dependencies, primarily due to the limited receptive field of the convolution operation. To address this limitation, we propose a Transformer-based nonlinear transform. This transform has the remarkable ability to efficiently capture both local and global information from the input image, leading to a more decorrelated latent representation. In addition, we introduce a novel entropy model that incorporates two different hyperpriors to model cross-channel and spatial dependencies of the latent representation. To further improve the entropy model, we add a global context that leverages distant relationships to predict the current latent more accurately. This global context employs a causal attention mechanism to extract long-range information in a content-dependent manner.
