    "abstract": "           Silicon-based analog neural networks physically embody the ideal neural network model in an approximate way. We show that by retraining the neural network using a physics-informed hardware-aware model one can fully recover the inference accuracy of the ideal network model even in the presence of significant non-idealities. This is way more promising for scalability and integration density than the default option of improving the fidelity of the analog neural network at the cost of significant energy, area, and design overhead, through extensive calibration and conservative analog design. We first present a physics-informed hardware-aware model for a time-domain vector-matrix multiplier implemented with single-transistor floating-gate memory cells that explicitly accounts for two dominant non-idealities of the physical implementation - capacitive crosstalk and bit-line voltage drop - and integrates seamlessly with modern deep-learning workflows. The model discretizes each operation into adaptive time slots, processes activation patterns in parallel, and accumulates their contributions to predict effective multiplier outputs. Using measurements from a 16x16 silicon array, we calibrate the model, show that crosstalk is layout-dependent and often dominant, and introduce an improved weight-extraction procedure that doubles signal-to-error ratio versus an ideal vector-matrix multiplier model. Finally, we show that by training silicon-based analog neural networks using an hardware-aware model in the forward pass we can recover the accuracy of the ideal software networks across three architectures -- custom MLP on low-resolution MNIST, LeNet-5 on MNIST, and a VGG-style CNN on CIFAR-10 - establishing a complete design-to-deployment workflow for time-domain analog neuromorphic chips.

    "abstract": "           All-pairs shortest paths (APSP) remains a major bottleneck for large-scale graph analytics, as data movement with cubic complexity overwhelms the bandwidth of conventional memory hierarchies. In this work, we propose RAPID-Graph to address this challenge through a co-designed processing-in-memory (PIM) system that integrates algorithm, architecture, and device-level optimizations. At the algorithm level, we introduce a recursion-aware partitioner that enables an exact APSP computation by decomposing graphs into vertex tiles to reduce data dependency, such that both Floyd-Warshall and Min-Plus kernels execute fully in-place within digital PIM arrays. At the architecture and device levels, we design a 2.5D PIM stack integrating two phase-change memory compute dies, a logic die, and high-bandwidth scratchpad memory within a unified advanced package. An external non-volatile storage stack stores large APSP results persistently. The design achieves both tile-level and unit-level parallel processing to sustain high throughput. On the 2.45M-node OGBN-Products dataset, RAPID-Graph is 5.8x faster and 1,186x more energy efficient than state-of-the-art GPU clusters, while exceeding prior PIM accelerators by 8.3x in speed and 104x in efficiency. It further delivers up to 42.8x speedup and 392x energy savings over an NVIDIA H100 GPU.         ",

    "abstract": "           The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) is accelerating the integration of multimodal assistants into edge devices, where inference is executed under stringent latency and energy constraints, often exacerbated by intermittent connectivity. These challenges become particularly acute in the context of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), as high-dimensional visual inputs are transformed into extensive token sequences, thereby inflating the key-value (KV) cache and imposing substantial data movement overheads to the LLM backbone. To address these issues, we present CHIME, a chiplet-based heterogeneous near-memory acceleration for edge MLLMs inference. CHIME leverages the complementary strengths of integrated monolithic 3D (M3D) DRAM and RRAM chiplets: DRAM supplies low-latency bandwidth for attention, while RRAM offers dense, non-volatile storage for weights. This heterogeneous hardware is orchestrated by a co-designed mapping framework that executes fused kernels near data, minimizing cross-chiplet traffic to maximize effective bandwidth. On FastVLM (0.6B/1.7B) and MobileVLM (1.7B/3B), CHIME achieves up to 54x speedup and up to 246x better energy efficiency per inference as compared to the edge GPU NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX. It sustains 116.5-266.5 token/J compared to Jetson's 0.7-1.1 token/J. Furthermore, it delivers up to 69.2x higher throughput than the state-of-the-art PIM accelerator FACIL. Compared to the M3D DRAM-only design, CHIME's heterogeneous memory further improves energy efficiency by 7% and performance by 2.4x.         ",

    "abstract": "           Large language models (LLMs) are highly compute- and memory-intensive, posing significant demands on high-performance GPUs. At the same time, advances in GPU technology driven by shrinking transistor sizes and lower operating voltages have made these devices increasingly susceptible to soft errors. While prior work has examined GPU reliability, most studies have focused on general-purpose applications or conventional neural networks mostly used for vision tasks such as classification and detection. In contrast, systematic analysis of modern large-scale LLMs remains limited, despite their rapid adoption in diverse application scenarios. Given the unique characteristics of LLMs, their resilience to soft errors may differ substantially from earlier models. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first instruction-level fault injection study of LLM inference. Our approach reveals reliability characteristics from multiple perspectives, highlighting the effects of model architecture, parameter scale, and task complexity. These findings provide new insights into LLM reliability and inform the design of more effective fault tolerance mechanisms.         ",

We study whether expert detection can be treated as a learnable skill and improved through structured calibration. We introduce LREAD, a rubric derived from national Korean writing standards and adapted to target micro-level artifacts (e.g., punctuation optionality, spacing behavior, and register shifts). In a three-phase longitudinal blind protocol with Korean linguistics majors, Phase 1 measures intuition-only detection, Phase 2 enforces criterion-level scoring with explicit justifications, and Phase 3 evaluates domain-focused mastery on held-out elementary essays. Across phases, majority-vote accuracy increases from 60% to 100%, accompanied by stronger inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa: -0.09 --> 0.82). Compared to state-of-the-art LLM detectors, calibrated humans rely more on language-specific micro-diagnostics that are not well captured by coarse discourse priors. Our findings suggest that rubric-scaffolded expert judgment can serve as an interpretable complement to automated detectors for non-English settings, and we release the full rubric and a taxonomy of calibrated detection signatures.

    "abstract": "           Synthetic data has proven itself to be a valuable resource for tuning smaller, cost-effective language models to handle the complexities of multi-turn tool calling conversations. While many frameworks and systems for producing synthetic multi-turn tool calling data have been proposed, prior works have frequently assumed that any tool calling interactions will take place in an execution environment that maintains state. When such an environment is available, this is advantageous as it allows for the validity of an interaction to be determined by whether or not the state of the execution environment matches to some prespecified objective. Unfortunately, this does not hold in many real-world tool use settings, e.g., in enterprise settings where data security is of the utmost importance or in cases where tool specifications are synthesized from multiple sources. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a data generation method, DiGiT-TC, that is designed to produce tool calling conversations that have the characteristics of conversations generated through search in a stateful environment. The key to our technique lies in a novel generation pattern that allows our approach to implicitly represent certain tool calls in the user request. We validate our approach on standard tool calling benchmarks and demonstrate that, even in stateful problem settings, our approach results in strong performance gains.         ",

Experiments on PaperAudit-Bench reveal large variability in error detectability across models and detection depths, highlighting the difficulty of identifying such errors under long-context settings. Relative to representative automated reviewing baselines, incorporating explicit error detection into the review workflow produces systematically stricter and more discriminative evaluations, demonstrating its suitability for peer review.

    "abstract": "           Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), i.e., the tendency to generate plausible but non-factual content, pose a significant challenge for their reliable deployment in high-stakes environments. However, existing hallucination detection methods generally operate under unrealistic assumptions, i.e., either requiring expensive intensive sampling strategies for consistency checks or white-box LLM states, which are unavailable or inefficient in common API-based scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel efficient zero-shot metric called Lowest Span Confidence (LSC) for hallucination detection under minimal resource assumptions, only requiring a single forward with output probabilities. Concretely, LSC evaluates the joint likelihood of semantically coherent spans via a sliding window mechanism. By identifying regions of lowest marginal confidence across variable-length n-grams, LSC could well capture local uncertainty patterns strongly correlated with factual inconsistency. Importantly, LSC can mitigate the dilution effect of perplexity and the noise sensitivity of minimum token probability, offering a more robust estimate of factual uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and diverse benchmarks show that LSC consistently outperforms existing zero-shot baselines, delivering strong detection performance even under resource-constrained conditions.

By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations.

However, variations in individual experiences and different levels of device interactions lead to data and model initialization heterogeneities across devices. Such heterogeneities leave variations in local model parameters across devices that leads to slower convergence. This paper tackles the data and model heterogeneity by explicitly addressing the parameter level varying evidential credence across local models. A novel aggregation approach is introduced that captures these parameter variations in local models and performs robust aggregation of neighbourhood local updates. Specifically, consensus weights are generated via approximation of second-order information of local models on their local datasets. These weights are utilized to scale neighbourhood updates before aggregating them into global neighbourhood representation. In extensive experiments with computer vision tasks, the proposed approach shows strong generalizability of local models at reduced communication costs.         ",

Image-level mixed sample data augmentations, such as CutMix and MixUp, are frequently used for training transformers, yet these techniques perturb patient-specific attributes, such as medical comorbidity and clinical factors, since they only account for images and labels. To address this limitation, we propose a hierarchical sampling strategy, Oculomix, for mixed sample augmentations. Our method is based on two clinical priors. First (exam level), images acquired from the same patient at the same time point share the same attributes. Second (patient level), images acquired from the same patient at different time points have a soft temporal trend, as morbidity generally increases over time. Guided by these priors, our method constrains the mixing space to the patient and exam levels to better preserve patient-specific characteristics and leverages their hierarchical relationships. The proposed method is validated using ViT models on a five-year prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a large ethnically diverse population (Alzeye). We show that Oculomix consistently outperforms image-level CutMix and MixUp by up to 3% in AUROC, demonstrating the necessity and value of the proposed method in oculomics.         ",

    "abstract": "           Cross-session nonstationarity in neural activity recorded by implanted electrodes is a major challenge for invasive Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), as decoders trained on data from one session often fail to generalize to subsequent sessions. This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data.

We propose BayPrAnoMeta, a Bayesian generalization of Proto-MAML for few-shot industrial image anomaly detection. Unlike existing Proto-MAML approaches that rely on deterministic class prototypes and distance-based adaptation, BayPrAnoMeta replaces prototypes with task-specific probabilistic normality models and performs inner-loop adaptation via a Bayesian posterior predictive likelihood. We model normal support embeddings with a Normal-Inverse-Wishart (NIW) prior, producing a Student-$t$ predictive distribution that enables uncertainty-aware, heavy-tailed anomaly scoring and is essential for robustness in extreme few-shot settings. We further extend BayPrAnoMeta to a federated meta-learning framework with supervised contrastive regularization for heterogeneous industrial clients and prove convergence to stationary points of the resulting nonconvex objective. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate consistent and significant AUROC improvements over MAML, Proto-MAML, and PatchCore-based methods in few-shot anomaly detection settings.         ",

    "abstract": "           When deciding how to solve complex problems, it seems important not only to know whether an intervention is helpful but also to understand why. Therefore, the present study investigated whether explicit information about causal mechanisms enables people to distinguish between multiple interventions. It was hypothesised that mechanism information helps them appreciate indirect interventions that treat the root causes of a problem instead of just fixing its symptoms. This was investigated in an experimental hoof trimming scenario in which participants evaluated various interventions. To do so, they received causal diagrams with different types of causal information and levels of mechanistic detail. While detailed mechanism information and its embedding in the context of other influences made participants less sceptical towards indirect interventions, the effects were quite small. Moreover, it did not mitigate participants' robust preference for interventions that only fix a problem's symptoms. Taken together, the findings suggest that in order to help people choose sustainable interventions, it is not sufficient to make information about causal mechanisms available.         ",

The LSNN method is built on an equivalent least-squares formulation of the underlying problem on an admissible solution set that accommodates discontinuous solutions. It employs ReLU neural networks (in place of finite elements) as the approximating functions, uses a carefully designed physics-preserved numerical differentiation, and avoids penalization techniques such as artificial viscosity, entropy condition, and/or total variation. This approach captures shock features in the solution without oscillations or overshooting. Efficiently and reliably solving the resulting non-convex optimization problem posed by the LSNN method remains an open challenge.

Unlike classical formulations, we consider a covert adversary who has knowledge of the detector's false alarm constraint parameter $\\gamma$ and selects a stationary post-change distribution that depends on it, seeking to remain undetected for as long as possible. Building on the theoretical foundations of the CuSum procedure, we rigorously characterize the asymptotic behavior of the average detection delay (ADD) and the average time to false alarm (AT2FA) when the post-change distribution converges to the pre-change distribution as $\\gamma \\to \\infty$. Our analysis establishes exact asymptotic expressions for these quantities, extending and refining classical results that no longer hold in this regime. We identify the critical scaling laws governing covert behavior and derive explicit conditions under which an adversary can maintain covertness, defined by ADD = $\\Theta(\\gamma)$, whereas in the classical setting, ADD grows only as $\\mathcal{O}(\\log \\gamma)$. In particular, for Gaussian and Exponential models under adversarial perturbations of their respective parameters, we asymptotically characterize ADD as a function of the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions and $\\gamma$.

Based on this ansatz, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become a popular method for decomposing embeddings into a sparse combination of linear directions, which have been shown empirically to often correspond to human-interpretable semantics. However, recent attempts to apply SAEs to multimodal embedding spaces (such as the popular CLIP embeddings for image/text data) have found that SAEs often learn \"split dictionaries\", where most of the learned sparse features are essentially unimodal, active only for data of a single modality. In this work, we study how to effectively adapt SAEs for the setting of multimodal embeddings while ensuring multimodal alignment. We first argue that the existence of a split dictionary decomposition on an aligned embedding space implies the existence of a non-split dictionary with improved modality alignment. Then, we propose a new SAE-based approach to multimodal embedding decomposition using cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization. We apply our method to popular embeddings for image/text (CLIP) and audio/text (CLAP) data and show that, compared to standard SAEs, our approach learns a more multimodal dictionary while reducing the number of dead neurons and improving feature semanticity. We finally demonstrate how this improvement in alignment of concepts between modalities can enable improvements in the interpretability and control of cross-modal tasks.         ",

We introduce IBR-GCS, an Iterative Best Response (IBR) planning approach based on the Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) framework that models highway driving as a generalized noncooperative game. IBR-GCS integrates combinatorial maneuver reasoning, trajectory planning, and game-theoretic interaction within a unified framework. The key novelty is a vehicle-specific, strategy-dependent GCS construction. Specifically, at each best-response update, each vehicle builds its own graph conditioned on the current strategies of the other vehicles, with vertices representing lane-specific, time-varying, convex, collision-free regions and edges encoding dynamically feasible transitions. This yields a shortest-path problem in GCS for each best-response step, which admits an efficient convex relaxation that can be solved using convex optimization tools without exhaustive discrete tree search. We then apply an iterative best-response scheme in which vehicles update their trajectories sequentially and provide conditions under which the resulting inexact updates converge to an approximate generalized Nash equilibrium. Simulation results across multi-lane, multi-vehicle scenarios demonstrate that IBR-GCS produces safe trajectories and strategically consistent interactive behaviors.         ",

This can be enabled by making the target object different in one of the visual variables that determine the object's appearance; for example, by changing its color or size. Certain interpretations of the visual search literature have promoted the view that using visual variables such as hue-often labeled as preattentive-would make the target object automatically \"popout,\" implying that an object can be located almost instantly, regardless of the number of objects in the display. In this paper we present a study that serves as a bridge between the extensive visual search literature and visualization, establishing empirical base measurements for the localization task. By testing displays with up to hundreds of objects, we are able to show that none of the common visual variables is immune to the increase in the number of objects. We also provide the first empirically informed comparisons between visual variables for this task in the context of visualization, and show how different visual variables have varying robustness with respect to two additional dimensions: the location of the target and the overall visual arrangement (layout).

    "abstract": "           Interpretability in black-box dense retrievers remains a central challenge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Understanding how queries and documents semantically interact is critical for diagnosing retrieval behavior and improving model design. However, existing dense retrievers rely on static embeddings for both queries and documents, which obscures this bidirectional relationship. Post-hoc approaches such as re-rankers are computationally expensive, add inference latency, and still fail to reveal the underlying semantic alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Interpretable Modular Retrieval Neural Networks (IMRNNs), a lightweight framework that augments any dense retriever with dynamic, bidirectional modulation at inference time. IMRNNs employ two independent adapters: one conditions document embeddings on the current query, while the other refines the query embedding using corpus-level feedback from initially retrieved documents. This iterative modulation process enables the model to adapt representations dynamically and expose interpretable semantic dependencies between queries and documents. Empirically, IMRNNs not only enhance interpretability but also improve retrieval effectiveness. Across seven benchmark datasets, applying our method to standard dense retrievers yields average gains of +6.35% nDCG, +7.14% recall, and +7.04% MRR over state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating interpretability-driven modulation can both explain and enhance retrieval in RAG systems.         ",

Unlike prior work that evaluates reward hack detection in isolated classification scenarios, we contrast these evaluations with a more realistic, contrastive anomaly detection setup on TRACE. Our experiments reveal that models capture reward hacks more effectively in contrastive settings than in isolated classification settings, with GPT-5.2 with highest reasoning mode achieving the best detection rate at 63%, up from 45% in isolated settings on TRACE. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art models struggle significantly more with semantically contextualized reward hacks compared to syntactically contextualized ones. We further conduct qualitative analyses of model behaviors, as well as ablation studies showing that the ratio of benign to hacked trajectories and analysis cluster sizes substantially impact detection performance.

Using SonarQube, we perform a differential analysis between base and merged commits to identify code quality issues newly introduced by PR changes. We examine issue frequency, density, severity, and rule-level prevalence across five agents. Our results show that apparent differences in raw issue counts across agents largely disappear after normalizing by code churn, indicating that higher issue counts are primarily driven by larger PRs. Across all agents, code smells dominate, particularly at critical and major severities, while bugs are less frequent but often severe.

    "abstract": "           Strength-of-connection algorithms play a key role in algebraic multigrid (AMG). Specifically, they determine which matrix nonzeros are classified as weak and so ignored when coarsening matrix graphs and defining interpolation sparsity patterns. The general goal is to encourage coarsening only in directions where error can be smoothed and to avoid coarsening across sharp problem variations. Unfortunately, developing robust and inexpensive strength-of-connection schemes is challenging. The classification of matrix nonzeros involves four aspects: (a) choosing a strength-of-connection matrix, (b) scaling its values, (c) choosing a criterion to classify scaled values as strong or weak, and (d) dropping weak entries which includes adjusting matrix values to account for dropped terms. Typically, smoothed aggregation AMG uses the linear system being solved as a strength-of-connection matrix. It scales values symmetrically using square-roots of the matrix diagonal. It classifies based on whether scaled values are above or below a threshold. Finally, it adjusts matrix values by modifying the diagonal so that the sum of entries within each row of the dropped matrix matches that of the original. While these procedures can work well, we illustrate failure cases that motivate alternatives. The first alternative uses a distance Laplacian strength-of-connection matrix. The second centers on non-symmetric scaling. We then investigate alternative classification criteria based on identifying gaps in the values of the scaled entries. Finally, an alternative lumping procedure is proposed where row sums are preserved by modifying all retained matrix entries (as opposed to just diagonal entries). A series of numerical results illustrates trade-offs demonstrating in some cases notably more robust convergence on matrices coming from linear finite elements on stretched meshes.         ",

This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism. Experiments on nine datasets show SAMA achieves 30% relative AUC improvement over the best baseline, with up to 8 times improvement at low false positive rates. These findings reveal significant, previously unknown vulnerabilities in DLMs, necessitating the development of tailored privacy defenses.         ",

The required edge-connectivity $k$ is a chosen, constant parameter. Unlike standard dynamic graph problems, such as dynamic minimum-cut, which focus solely on reporting the value of the minimum cut, our approach actively modifies the graph $G$ to maintain the edge-connectivity invariant $\\lambda(G) \\ge k$. We address two fundamental maintenance tasks: redundancy elimination, which identifies and removes an existing edge rendered redundant for $k$-edge-connectivity by new edge insertion, and connectivity restoration, which computes and inserts a minimal set of augmenting edges to restore graph's $k$-edge-connectivity following an old edge deletion. To preclude trivial reversals, we strictly enforce that the eliminated edge is distinct from the inserted edge and that restoration excludes the already deleted edge. Our solution of the first problem integrates Nagamochi-Ibaraki sparse certificates [Nagamochi and Ibaraki 1992] with Link-Cut Trees [Sleator and Tarjan 1983] to remove redundant edges in $O(k \\log n)$ amortized time. For restoration, we propose a localized augmentation strategy that exploits the residual graph structure to bridge the minimum cut.

To evaluate long-horizon generation, we introduce three task-matched tests: (i) on-manifold stability via generated-only drift compared to the time-resolved distribution of real sliding windows, and (ii) conditional specificity via correct context versus prompt-swap controls using a neurophysiologically grounded metric set. We train on CamCAN and Omega and run all analyses on held-out MOUS, establishing cross-dataset generalization. Across metrics, generations remain relatively stable over long rollouts and are closer to the correct continuation than swapped controls. Code available at: this https URL.         ",

    "abstract": "           Tool-calling agents are increasingly deployed in real-world customer-facing workflows. Yet most studies on tool-calling agents focus on idealized settings with general, fixed, and well-specified tasks. In real-world applications, user requests are often (1) ambiguous, (2) changing over time, or (3) infeasible due to policy constraints, and training and evaluation data that cover these diverse, complex interaction patterns remain under-represented. To bridge the gap, we present Trajectory2Task, a verifiable data generation pipeline for studying tool use at scale under three realistic user scenarios: ambiguous intent, changing intent, and infeasible intents. The pipeline first conducts multi-turn exploration to produce valid tool-call trajectories. It then converts these trajectories into user-facing tasks with controlled intent adaptations. This process yields verifiable task that support closed-loop evaluation and training. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art LLMs on the generated complex user scenario tasks and observe frequent failures. Finally, using successful trajectories obtained from task rollouts, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs and find consistent improvements across all three conditions, along with better generalization to unseen tool-use domains, indicating stronger general tool-calling ability.

Among their most impactful applications is code generation, where ILMs--commonly referred to as Code Language Models CLMs--have demonstrated remarkable capability. This strength stems from their defining feature: the use of explicit task instructions during fine-tuning, which enables them to bridge natural language and code by translating human intent into executable code. While much of their progress has been driven by advances in scaling laws and training methodologies, one critical aspect remains underexplored--the impact of system prompts on the performance of both general-purpose ILMs and specialized CLMs when instantiated to assist users with code generation activities. In this study, we take a first step toward bridging this gap by systematically evaluating how system prompts of varying instructional detail, along with model scale, prompting strategy, and programming language, affect ILMs and CLMs in code generation tasks. Our evaluation framework, spanning 120 model configurations, reveals that (1) the influence of system prompts increases with model scale; (2) few-shot prompting reduces this effect compared to zero-shot; and (3) programming language matters, with Java showing greater sensitivity to system prompt variations than Python.

Specifically, SSL extracts the representation from massive unlabeled data, which will be transferred to a plenty of down streaming tasks with limited data. The significant improvement on diverse applications of representation learning has attracted increasing attention, resulting in a variety of dramatically different self-supervised learning objectives for representation extraction, with an assortment of learning procedures, but the lack of a clear and unified understanding. Such an absence hampers the ongoing development of representation learning, leaving a theoretical understanding missing, principles for efficient algorithm design unclear, and the use of representation learning methods in practice unjustified. The urgency for a unified framework is further motivated by the rapid growth in representation learning methods. In this paper, we are therefore compelled to develop a principled foundation of representation learning. We first theoretically investigate the sufficiency of the representation from a spectral representation view, which reveals the spectral essence of the existing successful SSL algorithms and paves the path to a unified framework for understanding and analysis. Such a framework work also inspires the development of more efficient and easy-to-use representation learning algorithms with principled way in real-world applications.         ",

However, sophisticated software supply chain security threats often stem from cascaded vulnerability and security weakness chains that span dependent components. Moreover, although the adoption of Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) has been accelerating, downstream vulnerability findings vary substantially across SBOM generators and analysis tools. We propose a novel approach to SBOM-driven security analysis methods and tools. We model vulnerability relationships over dependency structure rather than treating scanner outputs as independent records. We represent enriched SBOMs as heterogeneous graphs with nodes being the SBOM components and dependencies, the known software vulnerabilities, and the known software security weaknesses. We then train a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HGAT) to predict whether a component is associated with at least one known vulnerability. Since documented multi-vulnerability chains are scarce, we model cascade discovery as a link prediction problem over CVE pairs using a multi-layer perceptron neural network. This way, we produce ranked candidate links that can be composed into multi-step paths. The HGAT component classifier achieves an Accuracy of 91.03% and an F1-score of 74.02%.         ",

Using design fictions and comic-boarding, we story-boarded five design concepts for presenting PREs to users and evaluated them through an online survey with N = 44 Reddit users.

Applying our diagnostic to autoregressive fluid flow emulators, we show that orbit-wise gradient coherence provides the mechanism for learning to generalize over symmetry transformations and indicates when training selects a symmetry compatible basin.

Nonetheless, to extract connective structures, existing techniques aggregate discretized system matrices into graphs, and suffer from rank inflation and a suboptimal convergence rate. In this paper, we articulate NeuraLSP, a novel neural preconditioner combined with a novel loss metric that leverages the left singular subspace of the system matrix's near-nullspace vectors. By compressing spectral information into a fixed low-rank operator, our method exhibits both theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness to rank inflation, affording up to a 53% speedup. Besides the theoretical guarantees for our newly-formulated loss function, our comprehensive experimental results across diverse families of PDEs also substantiate the aforementioned theoretical advances.

This intractability persists even in the ostensibly simple setting with a quadratic loss function and linear distribution shifts. One of our key technical contributions is to extend this PPAD-hardness result to general convex domains, which is of broader interest in the complexity of variational inequalities.

In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.

    "abstract": "           Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has recently emerged as an effective technique for improving DNN robustness to input variations. However, its interplay with the compactness requirements of on-device DNN deployments remains less explored. Simply pruning a SAM-trained model can undermine robustness, since flatness in the continuous parameter space does not necessarily translate to robustness under the discrete structural changes induced by pruning. Conversely, applying SAM after pruning may be fundamentally constrained by architectural limitations imposed by an early, robustness-agnostic pruning pattern. To address this gap, we propose Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM), a framework that shifts sharpness-aware learning from parameter perturbations to mask perturbations. By explicitly perturbing pruning masks during training, C-SAM promotes a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure, enabling the discovery of pruning patterns that simultaneously optimize model compactness and robustness to input variations. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C across ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show that C-SAM consistently achieves higher certified robustness than strong baselines, with improvements of up to 42%, while maintaining task accuracy comparable to the corresponding unpruned models.

    "abstract": "           Latent-based watermarks, integrated into the generation process of latent diffusion models (LDMs), simplify detection and attribution of generated images. However, recent black-box forgery attacks, where an attacker needs at least one watermarked image and black-box access to the provider's model, can embed the provider's watermark into images not produced by the provider, posing outsized risk to provenance and trust. We propose SemBind, the first defense framework for latent-based watermarks that resists black-box forgery by binding latent signals to image semantics via a learned semantic masker. Trained with contrastive learning, the masker yields near-invariant codes for the same prompt and near-orthogonal codes across prompts; these codes are reshaped and permuted to modulate the target latent before any standard latent-based watermark. SemBind is generally compatible with existing latent-based watermarking schemes and keeps image quality essentially unchanged, while a simple mask-ratio parameter offers a tunable trade-off between anti-forgery strength and robustness. Across four mainstream latent-based watermark methods, our SemBind-enabled anti-forgery variants markedly reduce false acceptance under black-box forgery while providing a controllable robustness-security balance.

To enforce fairness, we maximize the minimum secrecy throughput across GUs by jointly designing trajectories and communication scheduling. The key difficulty lies in the continuous-time nature of UAV trajectories and the tight space-time coupling between the transmitter and the jammer, which jointly render the problem infinite-dimensional and nonconvex. To address these challenges, we characterize, for the first time, the structure of the optimal trajectories and rigorously prove that they follow a collaborative successive hover-and-fly (co-SHF) structure, where the two UAVs visit a limited number of synchronized co-hovering point pairs, and during each flight segment at least one UAV moves at maximum speed. Leveraging this structure, we reformulate the problem into a finite-dimensional form, without loss of optimality, over hovering and turning points, hovering durations, and scheduling. For tractability, we adopt a minimum-distance approximation of continuous anti-collision constraints and employ concave lower bounds on secrecy throughput within a successive convex approximation (SCA) method, which converges and, thanks to the co-SHF reduction in optimization variables and constraints, achieves low computational complexity. Numerical results show that, compared with time-discretization and no-jamming benchmarks, the proposed co-SHF design improves the min-secrecy and user fairness while requiring significantly less runtime.

To address these limitations, we propose neural cooperative reach-while-avoid certificates with Dynamic-Localized Vector Control Lyapunov and Barrier Functions, which capture cooperative dynamics through state-dependent neighborhood structures and provide decentralized certificates for global exponential stability and safety. Based on the certificates, we further develop a scalable training and verification framework that jointly synthesizes controllers and neural certificates via a constrained optimization objective, and leverages a sufficient condition to ensure formal guarantees considering modeling error. To improve scalability, we introduce a structural reuse mechanism to transfer controllers and certificates between substructure-isomorphic systems.

To address this gap, we benchmark existing inference methods with small draft models on 11 datasets across diverse input scenarios and observe scenario-specific performance fluctuations. Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing.

Traditional rule-based metrics like Time-to-Collision are too simplistic to capture complex interaction risks, and existing methods lack a systematic way to verify whether statistical anomalies truly reflect physical danger. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on a multi-agent Transformer that models normal driving and measures deviations through prediction residuals. A dual evaluation scheme has been proposed to assess both detection stability and physical alignment: Stability is measured using standard ranking metrics in which Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient captures rank agreement and Jaccard index captures the consistency of the top-K selected items; Physical alignment is assessed through correlations with established Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM). Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness: We show that the maximum residual aggregator achieves the highest physical alignment while maintaining stability. Furthermore, our framework identifies 388 unique anomalies missed by Time-to-Collision and statistical baselines, capturing subtle multi-agent risks like reactive braking under lateral drift. The detected anomalies are further clustered into four interpretable risk types, offering actionable insights for simulation and testing.         ",

    "abstract": "           Heterogeneous systems commonly adopt dynamic scheduling algorithms to improve resource utilization and enhance scheduling flexibility. However, such flexibility may introduce timing anomalies, wherein locally reduced execution times can lead to an increase in the overall system execution time. This phenomenon significantly complicates the analysis of Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT), rendering conventional analysis either overly pessimistic or unsafe, and often necessitating exhaustive state-space exploration to ensure correctness. To address this challenge, this paper presents the first timing-anomaly-free dynamic scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous systems, referred to as Deterministic Dynamic Execution. It achieves a safe and tight WCRT estimate through a single offline simulation execution. The core idea is to apply deterministic execution constraints, which partially restrict the resource allocation and execution order of tasks at runtime. Based on a formally defined execution progress model for heterogeneous system scheduling, we prove the correctness of the proposed execution constraints and their ability to eliminate timing anomalies. Furthermore, we propose two methods to generate execution constraints. The first method derives execution constraints directly from the execution traces produced by existing scheduling algorithms. The second method is a heuristic-based approach that constructs execution constraints, enabling further reduction of the WCRT. Experimental results on synthetically generated DAG task sets under various system configurations demonstrate that, compared to traditional dynamic scheduling algorithms, our approach not only eliminates timing anomalies but also effectively reduces both the WCRT and response time jitter.

Intuitively, the act of detection is the result of the reasoning process that explains the sarcasm. Current research predominantly focuses on addressing either MSD or MuSE as a single task. Even though some recent work has attempted to integrate these tasks, their inherent causal dependency is often overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose MuVaC, a variational causal inference framework that mimics human cognitive mechanisms for understanding sarcasm, enabling robust multimodal feature learning to jointly optimize MSD and MuSE. Specifically, we first model MSD and MuSE from the perspective of structural causal models, establishing variational causal pathways to define the objectives for joint optimization. Next, we design an alignment-then-fusion approach to integrate multimodal features, providing robust fusion representations for sarcasm detection and explanation generation. Finally, we enhance the reasoning trustworthiness by ensuring consistency between detection results and explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MuVaC in public datasets, offering a new perspective for understanding multimodal sarcasm.         ",

    "abstract": "           Stochastic transport processes on networked domains (modelled on metric graphs) arise in a variety of applications where diffusion and drift mechanisms interact with an underlying graph structure. The Fokker--Planck equation provides a natural framework for describing the evolution of probability densities associated with such dynamics. While Fokker--Planck equations on metric graphs have been studied from an analytical viewpoint, their optimal control remains largely unexplored, particularly in settings where the control acts through the drift term. In this paper, we investigate an optimal control problem governed by the Fokker--Planck equation on a star graph, with a bilinear control appearing in the drift. We establish the well-posedness of the state equation and prove the existence of at least one optimal control. The associated adjoint system is derived, and first-order necessary optimality conditions are formulated. A wavelet-based numerical scheme is proposed to approximate the optimal solution, and its performance is illustrated through representative numerical experiments. These results contribute to the analytical and computational understanding of controlled stochastic dynamics on network-like domains.         ",

However, existing deepfake detectors often generalize poorly to images produced by unseen generators. Notably, despite being trained under vastly different paradigms, such as diffusion or autoregressive modeling, many modern image generators share common final architectural components that serve as the last stage for converting intermediate representations into images. Motivated by this insight, we propose to \"contaminate\" real images using the generator's final component and train a detector to distinguish them from the original real images. We further introduce a taxonomy based on generators' final components and categorize 21 widely used generators accordingly, enabling a comprehensive investigation of our method's generalization capability. Using only 100 samples from each of three representative categories, our detector-fine-tuned on the DINOv3 backbone-achieves an average accuracy of 98.83% across 22 testing sets from unseen generators.

    "abstract": "           Basso continuo is a baroque improvisatory accompaniment style which involves improvising multiple parts above a given bass line in a musical score on a harpsichord or organ. Basso continuo is not merely a matter of history; moreover, it is a historically inspired living practice, and The Aligned Continuo Dataset (ACoRD) records the first sample of modern-day basso continuo playing in the symbolic domain. This dataset, containing 175 MIDI recordings of 5 basso continuo scores performed by 7 players, allows us to start observing and analyzing the variety that basso continuo improvisation brings. A recently proposed basso continuo performance-to-score alignment system provides a way of mapping improvised performance notes to score notes. In order to study aligned basso continuo performances, we need an appropriate feature representation. We propose griff, a representation inspired by historical basso continuo treatises. It enables us to encode both pitch content and structure of a basso continuo realization in a transposition-invariant way. Griffs are directly extracted from aligned basso continuo performances by grouping together performance notes aligned to the same score note in a onset-time ordered way, and they provide meaningful tokens that form a feature space in which we can analyze basso continuo performance styles. We statistically describe griffs extracted from the ACoRD dataset recordings, and show in two experiments how griffs can be used for statistical analysis of individuality of different players' basso continuo performance styles. We finally present an argument why it is desirable to preserve the structure of a basso continuo improvisation in order to conduct a refined analysis of personal performance styles of individual basso continuo practitioners, and why griffs can provide a meaningful historically informed feature space worthy of a more robust empirical validation.

Conventional vision-language models (VLMs) invariably process visual tokens in a rigid raster-scan order (top-left to bottom-right) with fixed positional encoding when fed into LLMs. However, this contradicts human visual perception, which follows flexible yet semantically coherent scanning patterns driven by inherent logical structures. Particularly for images with complex layouts, human vision exhibits causally-informed sequential processing. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, DeepEncoder V2 is designed to endow the encoder with causal reasoning capabilities, enabling it to intelligently reorder visual tokens prior to LLM-based content interpretation.

Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking. The system demonstrates robustness to the robot's own motion, maintaining effective tracking even during active operation.

Asynchronous decentralized ADMM-based methods have been explored for estimating the median, a statistical centrality measure that is notoriously more robust than the mean. However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node. We analyze a synchronous variant of AsylADMM to establish theoretical guarantees and empirically demonstrate fast convergence for the asynchronous algorithm. We then show that our algorithm enables quantile-based trimming, geometric median estimation, and depth-based trimming, with quantile-based trimming empirically outperforming existing rank-based methods.

Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables.

    "abstract": "           The rapid growth of AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled high-quality creative production across diverse domains, yet existing systems face critical inefficiencies in throughput, resource utilization, and scalability under concurrent workloads. This paper introduces OnePiece, a large-scale distributed inference system with RDMA optimized for multi-stage AIGC workflows. By decomposing pipelines into fine-grained microservices and leveraging one-sided RDMA communication, OnePiece significantly reduces inter-node latency and CPU overhead while improving GPU utilization. The system incorporates a novel double-ring buffer design to resolve deadlocks in RDMA-aware memory access without CPU involvement. Additionally, a dynamic Node Manager allocates resources elastically across workflow stages in response to real-time load. Experimental results demonstrate that OnePiece reduces GPU resource consumption by 16x in Wan2.1 image-to-video generation compared to monolithic inference pipelines, offering a scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient solution for production AIGC environments.

    "abstract": "           Face morphing attacks present a significant threat to face recognition systems used in electronic identity enrolment and border control, particularly in single-image morphing attack detection (S-MAD) scenarios where no trusted reference is available. In spite of the vast amount of research on this problem, morph detection systems struggle in cross-dataset scenarios. To address this problem, we introduce a region-aware frequency-based morph detection strategy that drastically improves over strong baseline methods in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings using a lightweight approach. Having observed the separability of bona fide and morph samples in the frequency domain of different facial parts, our approach 1) introduces the concept of residual frequency domain, where the frequency of the signal is decoupled from the natural spectral decay to easily discriminate between morph and bona fide data; 2) additionally, we reason in a global and local manner by combining the evidence from different facial regions in a Markov Random Field, which infers a globally consistent decision. The proposed method, trained exclusively on the synthetic morphing attack detection development dataset (SMDD), is evaluated in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings on FRLL-Morph and MAD22 sets. Our approach achieves an average equal error rate (EER) of 1.85\\% on FRLL-Morph and ranks second on MAD22 with an average EER of 6.12\\%, while also obtaining a good bona fide presentation classification error rate (BPCER) at a low attack presentation classification error rate (APCER) using only spectral features. These findings indicate that Fourier-domain residual modeling with structured regional fusion offers a competitive alternative to deep S-MAD architectures.         ",

We experimented with different pipeline settings, testing our proposed method on different datasets and on different families of models. All the pipeline stages are enriched with the relevant context (in an oracle-RAG setting) and a study on the impact of its summarization or its filtering is conducted.

Precise coil placement also directly influences stimulation efficacy. Traditional neuronavigation systems often rely on costly and still hard to use and error-prone tracking systems. To solve these limitations, we present a computer-vision-based neuronavigation system for real-time tracking of patient and TMS instrumentation. The system can feed the necessary data for a digital twin to track TMS stimulation targets. We integrate a self-coordinating optical tracking system with multiple consumer-grade cameras and visible tags with a dynamic 3D brain model in Unity. This model updates in real time to represent the current stimulation coil position and the estimated stimulation point to intuitively visualize neural targets for clinicians. We incorporate an augmented reality (AR) module to bridge the gap between the visualization of the digital twin and the real world and project the brain model in real-time onto the head of a patient. AR headsets or mobile AR devices allow clinicians to interactively view and adjust the placement of the stimulation transducer intuitively instead of guidance through abstract numbers and 6D cross hairs on an external screen. The proposed technique provides improved spatial precision as well as accuracy. A case study with ten participants with a medical background also demonstrates that the system has high usability.         ",

Reverse engineering continues to threaten software security, while traditional virtual machine protection (VMP) relies on rigid, rule-based transformations that are costly to design and vulnerable to automated analysis. In this work, we present the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our approach builds large-scale paired datasets of source code and normalized VM implementations, and introduces hierarchical dependency modeling at intra-, preceding-, and inter-instruction levels. We jointly optimize language modeling with functionality-aware and protection-aware contrastive objectives to capture both semantic equivalence and protection strength. To further assess resilience, we propose a protection effectiveness optimization task that quantifies and ranks different VM variants derived from the same source. Coupled with a two-stage continual pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline, our method enables models to generate, compare, and reason over protected code. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly improves robustness across diverse protection levels, opening a new research direction for learning-based software defense. In this work, we present ShieldedCode, the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our method achieves 26.95% Pass@1 on L0 VM code generation compared to 22.58% for GPT-4o., and improves binary similarity detection Recall@1 by 10% over state of art methods like jTrans.         ",

We present an empirical benchmarking study of three prominent ledger-based DID methods - Ethereum, Hedera, and XRP Ledger - using reference Software Development Kits (SDKs) under a unified experimental setup. We measure latency, transaction cost, and on-chain metadata exposure, normalizing latency by each platform's block or consensus interval and cost by its native value transfer fee. Privacy leakage is quantified using a Metadata-Leakage Score (MLS), an entropy-based measure expressed in bits per operation. Our results reveal distinct architectural trade-offs. Ethereum enables near-instant, off-chain DID creation, but incurs the highest latency and cost for on-chain lifecycle operations. XRPL delivers deterministic and stable latency with fixed, low fees, yet exhibits higher metadata leakage due to more verbose transaction payloads. Hedera achieves the lowest on-chain latency and low fees with minimal metadata leakage, while occasional variance arises from SDK-side processing and confirmation pipelines. Overall, the findings show that ledger architecture and SDK workflows play a major role in shaping DID latency, cost, and metadata exposure, complementing the effects of the underlying consensus mechanism. These results provide evidence-based insights to support informed selection and configuration of DID systems under performance and privacy constraints.         ",

We investigate the problem of maintaining spanners in the fully dynamic setting with an adaptive adversary. Despite a long line of research, this problem is still poorly understood: no algorithm achieving a sublogarithmic stretch, a sublinear in $n$ update time, and a strongly subquadratic in $n$ spanner size is currently known. One of our main results is a deterministic algorithm, that, for any $512 \\leq k \\leq (\\log n)^{1/49}$ and $1/k\\leq \\delta \\leq 1/400$, maintains a spanner $H$ of a fully dynamic graph with stretch $poly(k)\\cdot 2^{O(1/\\delta^6)}$ and size $|E(H)|\\leq O(n^{1+O(1/k)})$, with worst-case update time $n^{O(\\delta)}$ and recourse $n^{O(1/k)}$. Our algorithm relies on a new technical tool that we develop, called low-diameter router decomposition. We design a deterministic algorithm that maintains a decomposition of a fully dynamic graph into edge-disjoint clusters with bounded vertex overlap, where each cluster $C$ is a bounded-diameter router, meaning that any reasonable multicommodity demand over the vertices of $C$ can be routed along short paths and with low congestion. A similar graph decomposition notion was introduced by [Haeupler et al., STOC 2022] and strengthened by [Haeupler et al., FOCS 2024]. However, in contrast to these and other prior works, the decomposition that our algorithm maintains is proper, ensuring that the routing paths between the pairs of vertices of each cluster $C$ are contained inside $C$, rather than in the entire graph $G$. We show additional applications of our router decomposition, including dynamic algorithms for fault-tolerant spanners and low-congestion spanners.         ",

Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.         ",

Each edge is modeled as either a binary symmetric channel (BSC) or a binary erasure channel (BEC). We analyze two operational regimes. For binary symmetric and binary erasure channels, we provide a structural characterization of the induced learning dynamics. In a fast-communication regime, agents update using channel-averaged payoffs; the resulting learning dynamics coincide with a Gibbs sampler for a scaled coordination potential, where channel reliability enters only through a scalar attenuation coefficient. In a snapshot regime, agents update from a single noisy realization and ignore channel statistics; the induced Markov chain is generally nonreversible, but admits a high-temperature expansion whose drift matches that of the fast Gibbs sampler with the same attenuation. We further formalize a finite-$K$ communication budget, which interpolates between snapshot and fast behavior as the number of channel uses per update grows. This viewpoint yields a communication-theoretic interpretation in terms of retransmissions and repetition coding, and extends naturally to heterogeneous link reliabilities via effective edge weights. Numerical experiments illustrate the theory and quantify the tradeoff between communication resources and steady-state coordination quality.         ",

While Persona prompting (PP) is increasingly used as a way to steer model towards user-specific generation, its effect on model rationales remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-generated rationales vary when conditioned on different simulated demographic personas. Using datasets annotated with word-level rationales, we measure agreement with human annotations from different demographic groups, and assess the impact of PP on model bias and human alignment. Our evaluation across three LLMs results reveals three key findings: (1) PP improving classification on the most subjective task (hate speech) but degrading rationale quality. (2) Simulated personas fail to align with their real-world demographic counterparts, and high inter-persona agreement shows models are resistant to significant steering. (3) Models exhibit consistent demographic biases and a strong tendency to over-flag content as harmful, regardless of PP. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while PP can improve classification in socially-sensitive tasks, it often comes at the cost of rationale quality and fails to mitigate underlying biases, urging caution in its application.

We identify a structural pattern we call jurisdiction-siloed disclosure: information about data practices appearing in specific, actionable form only within regional compliance sections labeled \"California Residents\" or \"EU/UK Users,\" while general sections use vague or qualified language for the same practices. Our audit of 123 major companies identifies 282 potential instances across 77 companies (62.6% of this purposive sample). A conservative estimate restricted to practice categories validated against OPP-115 human annotations finds 138 instances across 54 companies (44%); post-2018 categories central to our findings await independent validation. If users skip jurisdiction-labeled sections as information foraging theory predicts, users outside regulated jurisdictions would receive less specific information about practices affecting them--a transparency failure operating through document architecture rather than omission. We propose universal substantive disclosure: practices affecting all users should appear in the main policy body, with regional sections containing only procedural rights information. This standard finds support in analogous disclosure regimes (securities, truth-in-lending, nutritional labeling) where material information must reach all affected parties. Regulators could operationalize this through the FTC's \"clear and conspicuous\" standard and GDPR transparency principles. This work is hypothesis-generating: we establish that the structural pattern exists and ground the transparency concern in behavioral theory, but direct measurement of jurisdiction-specific section skipping remains the critical validation priority.

In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes. Our empirical analysis reveals that degenerate explanations can be maliciously planted (allowing an attacker to hide the use of sensitive attributes) and can also emerge naturally, highlighting the need for reliable auditing. To address this, we introduce a novel faithfulness metric that reliably marks degenerate explanations as unfaithful, in both malicious and natural settings.

However, existing RSC techniques often fail to generalize beyond narrow operational conditions due to limited sensing modalities and datasets that lack environmental diversity. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites.

    "abstract": "           One of the biggest missing capabilities in current AI systems is the ability to learn continuously after deployment. Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.         ",

Specifically, we consider four polynomial kernels and a degree one arccosine kernel to measure similarities in speaker embeddings, using which sparse graphs are constructed in a principled manner to emphasize local similarities.

    "abstract": "           As Speech Language Models (SLMs) transition from personal devices to shared, multi-user environments such as smart homes, a new challenge emerges: the model is expected to distinguish between users to manage information flow appropriately. Without this capability, an SLM could reveal one user's confidential schedule to another, a privacy failure we term interactional privacy. Thus, the ability to generate speaker-aware responses becomes essential for SLM safe deployment. Current SLM benchmarks test dialogue ability but overlook speaker identity. Multi-speaker benchmarks check who said what without assessing whether SLMs adapt their responses. Privacy benchmarks focus on globally sensitive data (e.g., bank passwords) while neglecting contextual privacy-sensitive information (e.g., a user's private appointment). To address this gap, we introduce VoxPrivacy, the first benchmark designed to evaluate interactional privacy in SLMs. VoxPrivacy spans three tiers of increasing difficulty, from following direct secrecy commands to proactively protecting privacy. Our evaluation of nine SLMs on a 32-hour bilingual dataset reveals a widespread vulnerability: most open-source models perform close to random chance (around 50% accuracy) on conditional privacy decisions, while even strong closed-source systems fall short on proactive privacy inference. We further validate these findings on Real-VoxPrivacy, a human-recorded subset, confirming that failures observed on synthetic data persist in real speech. Finally, we demonstrate a viable path forward: by fine-tuning on a new 4,000-hour training set, we improve privacy-preserving abilities while maintaining robustness. To support future work, we release the VoxPrivacy benchmark, the large-scale training set, and the fine-tuned model to foster the development of safer and more context-aware SLMs.         ",

Architecturally, DNNs rely on the recursive application of parametrized functions, a mechanism that can be unstable and difficult to train, making stability a primary concern. Even when training succeeds, there are few rigorous results on how well such models generalize beyond the observed data, especially in the generative setting. In this work, we leverage the theory of stochastic Iterated Function Systems (IFS) and show that two important deep architectures can be viewed as, or canonically associated with, place-dependent IFS. This connection allows us to import results from random dynamical systems to (i) establish the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures under suitable contractivity assumptions, and (ii) derive a Wasserstein generalization bound for generative modeling. The bound naturally leads to a new training objective that directly controls the collage-type approximation error between the data distribution and its image under the learned transfer operator. We illustrate the theory on a controlled 2D example and empirically evaluate the proposed objective on standard image datasets (MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR-10).         ",

Such a (total-)dominating set endowed with a separation property is often referred to as a code of the graph. In this paper, we study the four separation properties location, closed-separation, open-separation and full-separation. We address the complexity of finding minimum separating sets in a graph and study the interplay of these separation properties with several codes (establishing a particularly close relation between separation and codes based on domination) as well as the interplay of separation and complementation (showing that location and full-separation are the same on a graph and its complement, whereas closed-separation in a graph corresponds to open-separation in its complement).

Although every graph admits a 1-11-representation, the repetition patterns that may or must appear in such representations have not been fully studied. In this paper, we study cube-free and square-free 1-11-representations of graphs. We first show that cubes cannot always be avoided in 1-11-representations of minimum length by providing a graph for which every minimum-length 1-11-representation necessarily contains a cube. We then focus on permutational 1-11-representations, where the representing word is a concatenation of permutations of the vertex set. In this setting, we prove that any cube appearing in a permutational 1-11-representation can be removed without changing the represented graph. As a consequence, every permutational 1-11-representation attaining the permutational 1-11-representation number is cube-free. We further show that this behaviour does not extend to squares by providing a graph for which every permutational 1-11-representation with the minimum number of permutations necessarily contains a square. Finally, we prove that the language of all 1-11-representations of a given graph is regular. Moreover, we show that the language of all permutational 1-11-representations of a graph is also regular.         ",

These structures can be naturally represented by graphs, and the task of inferring such graphs from data is known as graph learning or as causal discovery if the graphs are given a causal interpretation. Existing approaches typically rely on restrictive assumptions about the data-generating process, employ greedy oracle algorithms, or solve approximate formulations of the graph learning problem. As a result, they are either sensitive to violations of central assumptions or fail to guarantee globally optimal solutions. We address these limitations by introducing a nonparametric graph learning framework based on nonparametric conditional independence testing and integer programming. We reformulate the graph learning problem as an integer-programming problem and prove that solving the integer-programming problem provides a globally optimal solution to the original graph learning problem. Our method leverages efficient encodings of graphical separation criteria, enabling the exact recovery of larger graphs than was previously feasible. We provide an implementation in the openly available R package 'glip' which supports learning (acyclic) directed (mixed) graphs and chain graphs. From the resulting output one can compute representations of the corresponding Markov equivalence classes or weak equivalence classes. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach is faster than other existing exact graph learning procedures for a large fraction of instances and graphs of various sizes.

However, treating predictions as ground truth introduces bias while ignoring them wastes valuable information. Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) offers a principled framework that leverages predictions from large unlabeled datasets to improve statistical efficiency while maintaining valid inference through explicit bias correction using a smaller labeled subset. Despite its potential, the growing PPI variants and the subtle distinctions between them have made it challenging for practitioners to determine when and how to apply these methods responsibly. This paper demystifies PPI by synthesizing its theoretical foundations, methodological extensions, connections to existing statistics literature, and diagnostic tools into a unified practical workflow. Using the Mosaiks housing price data, we show that PPI variants produce tighter confidence intervals than complete-case analysis, but that double-dipping, i.e. reusing training data for inference, leads to anti-conservative confidence intervals and coverages. Under missing-not-at-random mechanisms, all methods, including classical inference using only labeled data, yield biased estimates. We provide a decision flowchart linking assumption violations to appropriate PPI variants, a summary table of selective methods, and practical diagnostic strategies for evaluating core assumptions. By framing PPI as a general recipe rather than a single estimator, this work bridges methodological innovation and applied practice, helping researchers responsibly integrate predictions into valid inference.

Heavy tails, multimodality, nonlinear dependencies, and sparse special-cause observations can distort baseline estimation, mask true anomalies, and prevent reliable identification of an in-control (IC) reference set. To address these challenges, we introduce VSCOUT, a distribution-free framework designed specifically for retrospective (Phase I) monitoring in high-dimensional settings. VSCOUT combines an Automatic Relevance Determination Variational Autoencoder (ARD-VAE) architecture with ensemble-based latent outlier filtering and changepoint detection. The ARD prior isolates the most informative latent dimensions, while the ensemble and changepoint filters identify pointwise and structural contamination within the determined latent space. A second-stage retraining step removes flagged observations and re-estimates the latent structure using only the retained inliers, mitigating masking and stabilizing the IC latent manifold. This two-stage refinement produces a clean and reliable IC baseline suitable for subsequent Phase II deployment. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that VSCOUT achieves superior sensitivity to special-cause structure while maintaining controlled false alarms, outperforming classical SPC procedures, robust estimators, and modern machine-learning baselines. Its scalability, distributional flexibility, and resilience to complex contamination patterns position VSCOUT as a practical and effective method for retrospective modeling and anomaly detection in AI-enabled environments.

    "abstract": "           The physics-informed neural operator (PINO) is a machine learning paradigm that has demonstrated promising results for learning solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). It leverages the Fourier Neural Operator to learn solution operators in function spaces and leverages physics losses during training to penalize deviations from known physics laws. Spectral differentiation provides an efficient way to compute derivatives for the physics losses, but it inherently assumes periodicity. When applied to non-periodic functions, this assumption can lead to significant errors, including Gibbs phenomena near domain boundaries which degrade the accuracy of both function representations and derivative computations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the FC-PINO (Fourier-Continuation-based Physics-Informed Neural Operator) architecture which extends the accuracy and efficiency of PINO and spectral differentiation to non-periodic and non-smooth PDEs. In FC-PINO, we propose integrating Fourier continuation into the PINO framework, and test two different continuation approaches: FC-Legendre and FC-Gram. By transforming non-periodic signals into periodic functions on extended domains in a well-conditioned manner, Fourier continuation enables fast and accurate derivative computations. This approach avoids the discretization sensitivity of finite differences and the memory overhead of automatic differentiation. We demonstrate that standard PINO fails (without padding) or struggles (even with padding) to solve non-periodic and non-smooth PDEs with high precision, across challenging benchmarks. In contrast, the proposed FC-PINO provides accurate, robust, and scalable solutions, substantially outperforming PINO alternatives, and demonstrating that Fourier continuation is critical for extending PINO to a wider range of PDE problems when high-precision solutions are needed.

We ask whether such gains impact membership privacy. Surprisingly, we find that SAM is more prone to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) than classical SGD across multiple datasets and attack methods, despite achieving lower test error. This suggests that the geometric mechanism of SAM that improves generalization simultaneously exacerbates membership leakage. We investigate this phenomenon through extensive analysis of memorization and influence scores. Our results reveal that SAM is more capable of capturing atypical subpatterns, leading to higher memorization scores of samples. Conversely, SGD depends more heavily on majority features, exhibiting worse generalization on atypical subgroups and lower memorization. Crucially, this characteristic of SAM can be linked to lower variance in the prediction confidence of unseen samples, thereby amplifying membership signals. Finally, we model SAM under a perfectly interpolating linear regime and theoretically show that sharpness regularization inherently reduces variance, guaranteeing a higher MIA advantage for confidence and likelihood ratio attacks.

    "abstract": "           Pre-trained code models lead the era of code intelligence, with multiple models designed with impressive performance. However, one important problem, data augmentation for code data that automatically helps developers prepare training data lacks study in this field. In this paper, we introduce a generic data augmentation framework, GenCode, to enhance the training of code understanding models. Simply speaking, GenCode follows a generation-and-selection paradigm to prepare useful training code data. Specifically, it employs code augmentation techniques to generate new code candidates first and then identifies important ones as the training data by influence scores. To evaluate the effectiveness of GenCode, we conduct experiments on four code understanding tasks (e.g., code clone detection) and three pre-trained code models (e.g., CodeT5) and two recent released code-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-Coder). Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) code augmentation method MixCode, GenCode produces pre-trained code models with 2.92% higher accuracy and 4.90% adversarial robustness on average. For code-specific LLMs, GenCode achieves an average improvement of 0.93% in accuracy and 0.98% in natural robustness.         ",

    "abstract": "           Uncertainties in transition dynamics pose a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), often resulting in performance degradation of trained policies when deployed on hardware. Many robust RL approaches follow two strategies: enforcing smoothness in actor or actor-critic modules with Lipschitz regularization, or learning robust Bellman operators. However, the first strategy does not investigate the impact of critic-only Lipschitz regularization on policy robustness, while the second lacks comprehensive validation in real-world scenarios. Building on this gap and prior work, we propose PPO-PGDLC, an algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that integrates Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) with a Lipschitz-regularized critic (LC). The PGD component calculates the adversarial state within an uncertainty set to approximate the robust Bellman operator, and the Lipschitz-regularized critic further improves the smoothness of learned policies. Experimental results on two classic control tasks and one real-world robotic locomotion task demonstrates that, compared to several baseline algorithms, PPO-PGDLC achieves better performance and predicts smoother actions under environmental perturbations.

While prior work attributes these failures to knowledge gaps in the model's parameters, we uncover a complementary phenomenon: LLMs frequently retain correct knowledge even when generating incorrect or \"unsure\" answers. By analyzing the token-level output distributions, we find that correct answers often appear among high-probability candidates, despite not being selected. Motivated by this, we propose Hits@k, a novel metric to evaluate latent knowledge retention independent of answer surface form. Our experiments reveal that LLMs possess significantly more factual knowledge than is reflected by standard QA accuracy. Building on these insights, we further examine the prevailing few-shot QA paradigm. We find that prompting strategies which allow \"unsure\" outputs can inadvertently suppress correct answers by discouraging low-confidence generation. We design a set of quantitative experiments to measure this suppression effect, offering practical guidance for future prompt and decoding design in knowledge-intensive tasks.         ",

SCoT augments any refusal training datasets to critically analyze the intent behind each request before generating answers. By employing proactive reasoning, SCoT enhances the generalization of LLMs across varied harmful queries and scenarios not covered in the safety alignment corpus. Additionally, it generates detailed refusals specifying the rules violated. Comparative evaluations show that SCoT significantly surpasses existing defenses, reducing vulnerability to out-of-distribution issues and adversarial manipulations while maintaining strong general capabilities.

Group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) addresses this problem by minimizing the worst-group loss, but it fails when group losses misrepresent performance differences between groups. This is common in domains like speech, where the widely used connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss not only scales with input length but also varies with linguistic and acoustic properties, leading to spurious differences between group losses. We present CTC-DRO, which addresses the shortcomings of the group DRO objective by smoothing the group weight update to prevent overemphasis on consistently high-loss groups, while using input length-matched batching to mitigate CTC's scaling issues. We evaluate CTC-DRO on the task of multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) across five language sets from the diverse ML-SUPERB 2.0 benchmark. CTC-DRO consistently outperforms group DRO and CTC-based baseline models, reducing the worst-language error by up to 47.1% and the average error by up to 32.9%. CTC-DRO can be applied to ASR with minimal computational costs, and, while motivated by multilingual ASR, offers the potential for reducing group disparities in other domains with similar challenges.

Among existing model-based state estimation methods for legged robots, the contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter defines the state on a Lie group to preserve invariance, thereby significantly accelerating convergence. It achieves more accurate state estimation by leveraging contact information as measurements for the update step. However, when the model exhibits strong nonlinearity, the estimation accuracy decreases. Such nonlinearities can cause initial errors to accumulate and lead to large drifts over time. To address this issue, we propose compensating for errors by augmenting the Kalman filter with an artificial neural network serving as a nonlinear function approximator. Furthermore, we design this neural network to respect the Lie group structure to ensure invariance, resulting in our proposed Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter (InNKF).

    "abstract": "           Transformers have revolutionized the field of machine learning. In particular, they can be used to solve complex algorithmic problems, including graph-based tasks. In such algorithmic tasks a key question is what is the minimal size of a transformer that can implement the task. Recent work has begun to explore this problem for graph-based tasks, showing that for sub-linear embedding dimension (i.e., model width) logarithmic depth suffices. However, an open question, which we address here, is what happens if width is allowed to grow linearly, while depth is kept fixed. Here we analyze this setting, and provide the surprising result that with linear width, constant depth suffices for solving a host of graph-based problems. This suggests that a moderate increase in width can allow much shallower models, which are advantageous in terms of inference and train time. For other problems, we show that quadratic width is required. Our results demonstrate the complex and intriguing landscape of transformer implementations of graph-based algorithms. We empirically investigate these trade-offs between the relative powers of depth and width and find tasks where wider models have the same accuracy as deep models, while having much faster train and inference time due to parallelizable hardware.

Recent state-of-the-art out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods leverage activation shaping to improve the separation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD inputs. These approaches resort to sample-specific scaling but apply a static percentile threshold across all samples regardless of their nature, resulting in suboptimal ID-OOD separability. In this work, we propose \\textbf{AdaSCALE}, an adaptive scaling procedure that dynamically adjusts the percentile threshold based on a sample's estimated OOD likelihood. This estimation leverages our key observation: OOD samples exhibit significantly more pronounced activation shifts at high-magnitude activations under minor perturbation compared to ID samples. AdaSCALE enables stronger scaling for likely ID samples and weaker scaling for likely OOD samples, yielding highly separable energy scores.

To address this, we introduce a novel framework that investigates the relationship between the semantic hierarchy depth perceived by a network and its real-data misclassification patterns. Central to our framework is the Similarity Depth (SD) metric, which quantifies the semantic hierarchy depth perceived by a network along with a method of evaluation of how closely the network's errors align with its internally perceived similarity structure. We also propose a graph-based visualization of model semantic relationships and misperceptions. A key advantage of our approach is that leveraging class templates -- representations derived from classifier layer weights -- is applicable to already trained networks without requiring additional data or experiments. Our approach reveals that deep vision networks encode specific semantic hierarchies and that high semantic depth improves the compliance between perceived class similarities and actual errors.

While these models enable impressive reasoning capabilities, they also introduce novel and underexplored privacy risks. In this paper, we identify a novel category of privacy leakage in MLRMs: Adversaries can infer sensitive geolocation information, such as a user's home address or neighborhood, from user-generated images, including selfies captured in private settings. To formalize and evaluate these risks, we propose a three-level visual privacy risk framework that categorizes image content based on contextual sensitivity and potential for location inference. We further introduce DoxBench, a curated dataset of 500 real-world images reflecting diverse privacy scenarios. Our evaluation across 11 advanced MLRMs and MLLMs demonstrates that these models consistently outperform non-expert humans in geolocation inference and can effectively leak location-related private information. This significantly lowers the barrier for adversaries to obtain users' sensitive geolocation information. We further analyze and identify two primary factors contributing to this vulnerability: (1) MLRMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities by leveraging visual clues in combination with their internal world knowledge; and (2) MLRMs frequently rely on privacy-related visual clues for inference without any built-in mechanisms to suppress or avoid such usage. To better understand and demonstrate real-world attack feasibility, we propose GeoMiner, a collaborative attack framework that decomposes the prediction process into two stages: clue extraction and reasoning to improve geolocation performance while introducing a novel attack perspective.

    "abstract": "           Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a new generation of energy-efficient neural networks suitable for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. As neuromorphic hardware has limited memory and computational resources, parameter pruning and quantization have recently been explored to improve the efficiency of SNNs. State-of-the-art SNN pruning/quantization methods employ multiple compression and training iterations, increasing the cost for pre-trained or very large SNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot post-training compression framework, Spiking Brain Compression (SBC), that extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon method to SNNs. SBC replaces the current-based objective found in the common layer-wise compression method with a spike-train-based objective whose Hessian is cheaply computable, allowing a single backward pass to compress parameters and analytically rescale the rest. Applying SBC to SNN pruning and quantization across event-based and static datasets (up to ImageNet), including SEW-ResNet152 and spike-driven Transformers, we achieve state-of-the-art one-shot post-training compression for SNNs, with single- to double-digit accuracy gains over ANN compression baselines ported to SNNs. We further report a synaptic-operation-based energy proxy and a calibration-size ablation, demonstrating robust performance under sub-one-sample-per-class calibration.         ",

    "abstract": "           Recent advances in diffusion-based video restoration (VR) demonstrate significant improvement in visual quality, yet yield a prohibitive computational cost during inference. While several distillation-based approaches have exhibited the potential of one-step image restoration, extending existing approaches to VR remains challenging and underexplored, particularly when dealing with high-resolution video in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2, which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically, an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses, including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that SeedVR2 can achieve comparable or even better performance compared with existing VR approaches in a single step.         ",

Instead of directly prompting or fine-tuning large multimodal models (LMMs) as black-box classifiers, we avoid immediate reasoning over complex visual inputs but decouple meme content recognition from meme harmfulness analysis through a high-fidelity meme-to-text pipeline, which collaborates lightweight LMMs and LLMs to convert multimodal memes into natural language descriptions that preserve critical visual information, thus enabling text-only LLMs to \"see\" memes by \"reading\". Grounded in textual inputs, we further guide unimodal LLMs' reasoning under zero-shot Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) prompting with targeted, interpretable, context-aware, and easily obtained human-crafted guidelines, thus providing accountable step-by-step rationales, while enabling flexible and efficient adaptation to diverse sociocultural criteria of harmfulness. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show that U-CoT+ achieves performance comparable to resource-intensive baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and potential as a scalable, explainable, and low-resource solution to support harmful meme detection.

    "abstract": "           Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix, which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened graphs.

    "abstract": "           Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired dynamical systems in which identical cells iteratively apply a learned local update rule to self-organize into complex patterns, exhibiting regeneration, robustness, and spontaneous dynamics. Despite their success in texture synthesis and morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution outputs. This limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information that impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this limitation by pairing an NCA that evolves on a coarse grid with a lightweight implicit decoder that maps cell states and local coordinates to appearance attributes, enabling the same model to render outputs at arbitrary resolution. Moreover, because both the decoder and NCA updates are local, inference remains highly parallelizable. To supervise high-resolution outputs efficiently, we introduce task-specific losses for morphogenesis (growth from a seed) and texture synthesis with minimal additional memory and computation overhead. Our experiments across 2D/3D grids and mesh domains demonstrate that our hybrid models produce high-resolution outputs in real-time, and preserve the characteristic self-organizing behavior of NCAs.

    "abstract": "           Modern RAN operate in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments, where hand-tuned, rule-based RRM algorithms often underperform. While RL can surpass such heuristics in constrained settings, the diversity of deployments and unpredictable radio conditions introduce major generalization challenges. Data-driven policies frequently overfit to training conditions, degrading performance in unseen scenarios. To address this, we propose a generalization-centered RL framework for RAN control that: (i) robustly reconstructs dynamically varying states from partial and noisy observations, while encoding static and semi-static information, such as radio nodes, cell attributes, and their topology, through graph representations; (ii) applies domain randomization to broaden the training distribution; and (iii) distributes data generation across multiple actors while centralizing training in a cloud-compatible architecture aligned with O-RAN principles. Although generalization increases computational and data-management complexity, our distributed design mitigates this by scaling data collection and training across diverse network conditions. Applied to downlink link adaptation in five 5G benchmarks, our policy improves average throughput and spectral efficiency by ~10% over an OLLA baseline (10% BLER target) in full-buffer MIMO/mMIMO and by >20% under high mobility. It matches specialized RL in full-buffer traffic and achieves up to 4- and 2-fold gains in eMBB and mixed-traffic benchmarks, respectively. In nine-cell deployments, GAT models offer 30% higher throughput over MLP baselines. These results, combined with our scalable architecture, offer a path toward AI-native 6G RAN using a single, generalizable RL agent.         ",

However, many existing methods involve trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. Some achieve high precision but with slow inference speed, while others adopt purely bird's-eye-view (BEV)-based 2D representations to accelerate processing, inevitably sacrificing vertical cues and compromising geometric integrity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a pure 2D framework that achieves efficient 3D occupancy prediction while preserving geometric integrity. Unlike conventional Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) methods that rely solely on depth scores to lift 2D features into 3D space, our approach additionally introduces a height-score projection to encode vertical geometric structure. We further employ direction-aware convolution to extract geometric features along both vertical and horizontal orientations, effectively balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method achieves an mIoU of 39.3\\% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.         ",

    "abstract": "           Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing. Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size, equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields. Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters) to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in advancing feature representation learning.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include: (1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and (4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

In this paper, we propose ABEX-RAT, a resource-efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust adversarial learning. Unlike computationally expensive large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning, our approach employs a two-stage abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline: it first utilizes a prompt-guided LLM to distill label-critical semantics into concise abstracts, which are then expanded into diverse synthetic samples to balance the data distribution. Subsequently, we train a lightweight classifier using a random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which stochastically injects perturbations to enhance generalization without significant computational overhead. Experimental results on the OSHA dataset demonstrate that ABEXRAT establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly outperforming both traditional baselines and fine-tuned large models. This confirms that targeted augmentation combined with robust training offers a superior, data-efficient alternative for specialized domain classification.

Among these, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix. Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts. Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.         ",

However, during training, the backpropagated gradients from original and augmented inputs may misalign, which can result in conflicting parameter updates. These conflicts could hinder convergence and push the model toward suboptimal solutions, thereby reducing the benefits of DA. To investigate and address this issue, we design a dual-path data-augmented (DPDA) training framework with gradient alignment for SDD. In our framework, each training utterance is processed through two input paths: one using the original speech and the other with its augmented version. This design allows us to compare and align their backpropagated gradient directions to reduce optimization conflicts. Our analysis shows that approximately 25% of training iterations exhibit gradient conflicts between the original inputs and their augmented counterparts when using RawBoost augmentation. By resolving these conflicts with gradient alignment, our method accelerates convergence by reducing the number of training epochs and achieves up to an 18.69% relative reduction in Equal Error Rate on the In-the-Wild dataset compared to the baseline.

In this work, we introduce a unified binary tree representation of EPs, termed the EP tree, which formalizes the hierarchical structure underlying SGRAND and Ordered Reliability Bits (ORB) GRAND algorithms, enabling structured organization of EPs and algorithmic-level parallel exploration. Building upon this unified framework, we propose a parallel design of SGRAND that preserves ML optimality while significantly reducing decoding complexity through pruning strategies and tree-based computation. Furthermore, we develop an enhanced ORBGRAND algorithm based on the same EP tree representation, improving decoding performance toward ML while retaining parallel efficiency. Numerical experiments show that the proposed parallel SGRAND achieves a $3.96\\times$ reduction in decoding latency compared with its serial counterpart, while the enhanced ORBGRAND achieves a $4.21\\times$ speedup, demonstrating the effectiveness of the unified tree-based framework and its strong potential for future algorithmic and hardware optimizations.

    "abstract": "           Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation in the context of fallacious argumentation.         ",

However, existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map. Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

    "abstract": "           Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions, advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics, degrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for effective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment. This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate alignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods. Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.         ",

    "abstract": "           Log-based anomaly detection is critical for ensuring the stability and reliability of web systems. One of the key problems in this task is the lack of sufficient labeled logs, which limits the rapid deployment in new systems. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from a mature web system and a small amount of labeled logs from a new system, using transfer learning to extract and generalize general knowledge across both domains. However, these methods focus solely on the transfer of general knowledge and neglect the disparity and potential mismatch between such knowledge and the proprietary knowledge of target system, thus constraining performance. To address this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of general and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without any labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router based on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs into 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs a small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct training and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between the source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative knowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small model (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to the target system. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that FusionLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art cross-system log-based anomaly detection methods.

A critical yet often overlooked barrier lies in the computational and memory limitations of RAN baseband hardware, particularly in legacy 4th Generation (4G) systems, which typically lack on-chip neural accelerators. As a result, only lightweight AI models (under 1 Mb and sub-100~\\mu s inference time) can be effectively deployed, limiting both their performance and applicability. However, achieving strong generalization across diverse network conditions often requires large-scale models with substantial resource demands. To address this trade-off, this paper investigates policy distillation in the context of a reinforcement learning-based link adaptation task. We explore two strategies: single-policy distillation, where a scenario-agnostic teacher model is compressed into one generalized student model; and multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student. Experimental evaluations in a high-fidelity, 5th Generation (5G)-compliant simulator demonstrate that both strategies produce compact student models that preserve the teachers' generalization capabilities while complying with the computational and memory limitations of existing RAN hardware.

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.         ",

We present a domain-specific framework for benchmarking that addresses the unique challenges of player risk detection in gambling and supports key stakeholders, including researchers, operators, vendors, and regulators.

The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability.

Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In-depth analysis shows hallucinations arise from systematic internal state variations in visual perception, cross-modal reasoning, and language decoding. Different internal signals provide complementary diagnostic cues, and hallucination patterns vary across VLM architectures, offering new insights into the underlying causes of multimodal hallucinations.

While effective, this approach offers limited interpretability and controllability, as embeddings also encode traits such as timbre and emotion. In this study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as a case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences. We propose the phoneme shift rate (PSR), a novel metric quantifying how strongly embeddings preserve or override rule-based transformations. Experiments show that combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents, while embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules, revealing entanglement between accent and speaker identity. Our findings highlight rules as a lever for accent control and a framework for evaluating disentanglement in speech generation.         ",

These methods enrich user representations by incorporating social network information into GCF, thereby integrating additional collaborative signals from social relations. However, existing GCF and graph-based SocialRec approaches face significant challenges: they incur high computational costs and suffer from limited scalability due to the large number of parameters required to assign explicit embeddings to all users and items. In this work, we propose PULSE (Parameter-efficient User representation Learning with Social Knowledge), a framework that addresses this limitation by constructing user representations from socially meaningful signals without creating an explicit learnable embedding for each user. PULSE reduces the parameter size by up to 50% compared to the most lightweight GCF baseline. Beyond parameter efficiency, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 13 GCF and graph-based social recommendation baselines across varying levels of interaction sparsity, from cold-start to highly active users, through a time- and memory-efficient modeling process.

We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

To address this vulnerability, we propose Feature-space Smoothing (FS), a general framework that provides certified robustness guarantees at the feature representation level of MLLMs. We theoretically prove that FS converts a given feature extractor into a smoothed variant that is guaranteed a certified lower bound on the cosine similarity between clean and adversarial features under $\\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. Moreover, we establish that the value of this Feature Cosine Similarity Bound (FCSB) is determined by the intrinsic Gaussian robustness score of the given encoder. Building on this insight, we introduce the Gaussian Smoothness Booster (GSB), a plug-and-play module that enhances the Gaussian robustness score of pretrained MLLMs, thereby strengthening the robustness guaranteed by FS, without requiring additional MLLM retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that applying the FS to various MLLMs yields strong certified feature-space robustness and consistently leads to robust task-oriented performance across diverse applications.

    "abstract": "           Adapting large pre-trained language models to downstream tasks often entails fine-tuning millions of parameters or deploying costly dense weight updates, which hinders their use in resource-constrained environments. Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduces trainable parameters by factorizing weight updates, yet the underlying dense weights still impose high storage and computation costs. Magnitude-based pruning can yield sparse models but typically degrades LoRA's performance when applied naively. In this paper, we introduce SALR (Sparsity-Aware Low-Rank Representation), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that unifies low-rank adaptation with sparse pruning under a rigorous mean-squared-error framework. We prove that statically pruning only the frozen base weights minimizes the pruning error bound, and we recover the discarded residual information via a truncated-SVD low-rank adapter, which provably reduces per-entry MSE by a factor of $(1 - r/\\min(d,k))$. To maximize hardware efficiency, we fuse multiple low-rank adapters into a single concatenated GEMM, and we adopt a bitmap-based encoding with a two-stage pipelined decoding + GEMM design to achieve true model compression and speedup. Empirically, SALR attains 50\\% sparsity on various LLMs while matching the performance of LoRA on GSM8K and MMLU, reduces model size by $2\\times$, and delivers up to a $1.7\\times$ inference speedup.

Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.         ",

Most frequency-domain neural codecs either disregard phase information or encode it as two separate real-valued channels, limiting spatial fidelity. This entails the need to introduce adversarial discriminators at the expense of convergence speed and training stability to compensate for the inadequate representation power of the audio signal. In this work we introduce an end-to-end complex-valued RVQ-VAE audio codec that preserves magnitude-phase coupling across the entire analysis-quantization-synthesis pipeline and removes adversarial discriminators and diffusion post-filters. Without GANs or diffusion we match or surpass much longer-trained baselines in-domain and reach SOTA out-of-domain performance.

    "abstract": "           Caribou across the Arctic has declined in recent decades, motivating scalable and accurate monitoring approaches to guide evidence-based conservation actions and policy decisions. Manual interpretation from this imagery is labor-intensive and error-prone, underscoring the need for automatic and reliable detection across varying scenes. Yet, such automatic detection is challenging due to severe background heterogeneity, dominant empty terrain (class imbalance), small or occluded targets, and wide variation in density and scale. To make the detection model (HerdNet) more robust to these challenges, a weakly supervised patch-level pretraining based on a detection network's architecture is proposed. The detection dataset includes five caribou herds distributed across Alaska. By learning from empty vs. non-empty labels in this dataset, the approach produces early weakly supervised knowledge for enhanced detection compared to HerdNet, which is initialized from generic weights. Accordingly, the patch-based pretrain network attained high accuracy on multi-herd imagery (2017) and on an independent year's (2019) test sets (F1: 93.7%/92.6%, respectively), enabling reliable mapping of regions containing animals to facilitate manual counting on large aerial imagery. Transferred to detection, initialization from weakly supervised pretraining yielded consistent gains over ImageNet weights on both positive patches (F1: 92.6%/93.5% vs. 89.3%/88.6%), and full-image counting (F1: 95.5%/93.3% vs. 91.5%/90.4%). Remaining limitations are false positives from animal-like background clutter and false negatives related to low animal density occlusions. Overall, pretraining on coarse labels prior to detection makes it possible to rely on weakly-supervised pretrained weights even when labeled data are limited, achieving results comparable to generic-weight initialization.

While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving.

From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC. Results indicate that although LLMs show promise in VC proving, significant challenges remain for program verification, highlighting a large gap and opportunity for future research.         ",

    "abstract": "           Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.         ",

    "abstract": "           Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing large language models' capabilities by generating intermediate reasoning steps for complex tasks. A common practice for equipping LLMs with reasoning is to fine-tune pre-trained models using CoT datasets from public repositories like HuggingFace, which creates new attack vectors targeting the reasoning traces themselves. While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our \"Thought-Transfer\" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset. Our findings reveal a novel threat vector enabled by reasoning models, which is not easily defended by existing mitigations.         ",

We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN (Ma et al., 2021). However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.

We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images.

More specifically, we show that, for activations which are not very regular (e.g., the Heaviside step function), the boundary volumes exhibit fractal behavior, with their Hausdorff dimension monotonically increasing with the depth. On the other hand, for activations which are more regular (e.g., ReLU, logistic and $\\tanh$), as the depth increases, the expected boundary volumes can either converge to zero, remain constant or diverge exponentially, depending on a single spectral parameter which can be easily computed. Our theoretical results are confirmed in some numerical experiments based on Monte Carlo simulations.         ",

Our proofs add some substantially novel ideas to those developed by Jenssen, Patel, and Regts, while building on them.

    "abstract": "           Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution (ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of 18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs, consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.         ",

This robustness appears in several ways. In the context of risk consistency -- when one takes the standard approach in machine learning of minimizing a surrogate (typically convex) loss in place of a desired task loss (such as the zero-one mis-classification error) -- procedures using label aggregation obtain stronger consistency guarantees than those even possible using raw labels. And while classical statistical scenarios of fitting perfectly-specified models suggest that incorporating all possible information -- modeling uncertainty in labels -- is statistically efficient, consistency fails for ``standard'' approaches as soon as a loss to be minimized is even slightly mis-specified. Yet procedures leveraging aggregated information still converge to optimal classifiers, highlighting how incorporating a fuller view of the data analysis pipeline, from collection to model-fitting to prediction time, can yield a more robust methodology by refining noisy signals.

    "abstract": "           Modern front-end design for speech deepfake detection relies on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models like XLSR. However, this approach is not parameter-efficient and may lead to suboptimal generalization to realistic, in-the-wild data types. To address these limitations, we introduce a new family of parameter-efficient front-ends that fuse prompt-tuning with classical signal processing transforms. These include FourierPT-XLSR, which uses the Fourier Transform, and two variants based on the Wavelet Transform: WSPT-XLSR and Partial-WSPT-XLSR. We further propose WaveSP-Net, a novel architecture combining a Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end and a bidirectional Mamba-based back-end. This design injects multi-resolution features into the prompt embeddings, which enhances the localization of subtle synthetic artifacts without altering the frozen XLSR parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that WaveSP-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art models on two new and challenging benchmarks, Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb, with low trainable parameters and notable performance gains.

However, their parameters remain fixed once trained, lacking flexibility during inference and limiting robustness under dynamic complex acoustic environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive paradigm for audio front-ends that replaces static parameterization with a closed-loop neural controller. Specifically, we simplify the learnable front-end LEAF architecture and integrate a neural controller for adaptive representation via dynamically tuning Per-Channel Energy Normalization. The neural controller leverages both the current and the buffered past subband energies to enable input-dependent adaptation during inference. Experimental results on multiple audio classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed adaptive front-end consistently outperforms prior fixed and learnable front-ends under both clean and complex acoustic conditions. These results highlight neural adaptability as a promising direction for the next generation of audio front-ends.         ",

This paper introduces Quasi-Adaptive Search with Asymptotic Reinitialization (QUASAR), an evolutionary algorithm to accelerate convergence in complex, non-differentiable problems afflicted by the curse of dimensionality. QUASAR expands upon the core principles of Differential Evolution (DE), introducing quasi-adaptive mechanisms to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation in its search. Inspired by the behavior of quantum particles, the algorithm utilizes three highly stochastic mechanisms that augment standard DE: 1) probabilistic mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying covariance reinitializations. Evaluated on the notoriously difficult CEC2017 benchmark suite of 29 test functions, QUASAR achieved the lowest overall rank sum (367) using the Friedman test, outperforming DE (735) and L-SHADE (452). Geometric mean comparisons show average final solution quality improvements of $3.85 \\times$ and $2.07 \\times$ compared to DE and L-SHADE, respectively ($p \\ll 0.001$), with average optimization speed averaging $1.40 \\times$ and $5.16 \\times$ faster.

    "abstract": "           Pediatric liver tumors are one of the most common solid tumors in pediatrics, with differentiation of benign or malignant status and pathological classification critical for clinical treatment. While pathological examination is the gold standard, the invasive biopsy has notable limitations: the highly vascular pediatric liver and fragile tumor tissue raise complication risks such as bleeding; additionally, young children with poor compliance require anesthesia for biopsy, increasing medical costs or psychological trauma. Although many efforts have been made to utilize AI in clinical settings, most researchers have overlooked its importance in pediatric liver tumors. To establish a non-invasive examination procedure, we developed a multi-stage deep learning (DL) framework for automated pediatric liver tumor diagnosis using multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT. Two retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled. We established a novel PKCP-MixUp data augmentation method to address data scarcity and class imbalance. We also trained a tumor detection model to extract ROIs, and then set a two-stage diagnosis pipeline with three backbones with ROI-masked images. Our tumor detection model has achieved high performance (mAP=0.871), and the first stage classification model between benign and malignant tumors reached an excellent performance (AUC=0.989). Final diagnosis models also exhibited robustness, including benign subtype classification (AUC=0.915) and malignant subtype classification (AUC=0.979). We also conducted multi-level comparative analyses, such as ablation studies on data and training pipelines, as well as Shapley-Value and CAM interpretability analyses. This framework fills the pediatric-specific DL diagnostic gap, provides actionable insights for CT phase selection and model design, and paves the way for precise, accessible pediatric liver tumor diagnosis.

The design leverages the strengths of both linear and non-linear model structures, allowing it to capture all relevant stylized price characteristics in power markets, including calendar and autoregressive effects, as well as influences from load, renewable energy, and related fuel and carbon markets. For empirical testing, we use hourly data from the largest European electricity market spanning 2018 to 2025 in a comprehensive forecasting study, comparing our model against state-of-the-art approaches, particularly high-dimensional linear and neural network models. In terms of RMSE, the proposed model achieves approximately 11% higher accuracy than the best-performing benchmark. We evaluate the contributions of the interpretable model components and conclude on the impact of combining linear and non-linear structures. We further evaluate the temporal robustness of the model by examining the stability of hyperparameters and the economic significance of key features.

    "abstract": "           Accurate and low-latency qubit state measurement is critical for trapped-ion quantum computing. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been integrated to enhance detection fidelity, their latency performance on specific hardware platforms remains underexplored. This work benchmarks the latency of DNN-based qubit detection on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The FPGA solution directly interfaces an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) with the subsequent data processing logic, eliminating buffering and interface overheads. As a baseline, the GPU-based system employs a high-speed PCIe image grabber for image input and I/O card for state output. We deploy Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models on hardware to evaluate measurement performance. Compared to conventional thresholding, DNNs reduce the mean measurement fidelity (MMF) error by factors of 1.8-2.5x (one-qubit case) and 4.2-7.6x (three-qubit case). FPGA-based MLP and ViT achieve nanosecond- and microsecond-scale inference latencies, while the complete single-shot measurement process achieves over 100x speedup compared to the GPU implementation. Additionally, clock-cycle-level signal analysis reveals inefficiencies in EMCCD data transmission via Cameralink, suggesting that optimizing this interface could further leverage the advantages of ultra-low-latency DNN inference, guiding the development of next-generation qubit detection systems.

This study examined sentiment and moral elements underlying 219,358 marriage-related posts from Weibo and Xiaohongshu using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral elements (autonomy, community, divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo leaned toward positive sentiment, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral elements were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking autonomy and community were predominantly negative, whereas divinity-framed posts tended toward positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations contribute to negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China, offering insights for culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline.
