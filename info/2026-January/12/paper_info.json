    "abstract": "           Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances language models by retrieving external knowledge to support informed and grounded responses. However, traditional RAG methods rely on fragment-level retrieval, limiting their ability to address query-focused summarization queries. GraphRAG introduces a graph-based paradigm for global knowledge reasoning, yet suffers from inefficiencies in information extraction, costly resource consumption, and poor adaptability to incremental updates. To overcome these limitations, we propose TagRAG, a tag-guided hierarchical knowledge graph RAG framework designed for efficient global reasoning and scalable graph maintenance. TagRAG introduces two key components: (1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction, which extracts object tags and their relationships from documents and organizes them into hierarchical domain tag chains for structured knowledge representation, and (2) Tag-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which retrieves domain-centric tag chains to localize and synthesize relevant knowledge during inference. This design significantly adapts to smaller language models, improves retrieval granularity, and supports efficient knowledge increment. Extensive experiments on UltraDomain datasets spanning Agriculture, Computer Science, Law, and cross-domain settings demonstrate that TagRAG achieves an average win rate of 95.41\\% against baselines while maintaining about 14.6x construction and 1.9x retrieval efficiency compared with GraphRAG.

    "abstract": "           LLM-based conversational systems have become a popular gateway for information access, yet most existing chatbots struggle to handle news-related trending queries effectively. To improve user experience, an effective trending query detection method is urgently needed to enable differentiated processing of such target traffic. However, current research on trending detection tailored to the dialogue system scenario remains largely unexplored, and methods designed for traditional search engines often underperform in conversational contexts due to radically distinct query distributions and expression patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-stage framework for trending detection, which achieves systematic optimization from both offline generation and online identification perspectives. Specifically, our framework first exploits selected hot events to generate index queries, establishing a key bridge between static events and dynamic user queries. It then employs a retrieval matching mechanism for real-time online detection of trending queries, where we introduce a cascaded recall and ranking architecture to balance detection efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, to better adapt to the practical application scenario, our framework adopts a single-recall module as a cold-start strategy to collect online data for fine-tuning the reranker. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in both offline evaluations and online A/B tests, and user satisfaction is relatively improved by 27\\% in terms of positive-negative feedback ratio.

    "abstract": "           Predicting enzyme-substrate interactions has long been a fundamental problem in biochemistry and metabolic engineering. While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

This paper introduces MJAD-MLLMs, a holistic framework that systematically analyzes the proposed Multi-turn Jailbreaking Attacks and multi-LLM-based defense techniques for MLLMs. In this paper, we make three original contributions. First, we introduce a novel multi-turn jailbreaking attack to exploit the vulnerabilities of the MLLMs under multi-turn prompting. Second, we propose a novel fragment-optimized and multi-LLM defense mechanism, called FragGuard, to effectively mitigate jailbreaking attacks in the MLLMs. Third, we evaluate the efficacy of the proposed attacks and defenses through extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and closed-source MLLMs and benchmark datasets, and compare their performance with the existing techniques.

Through fine-grained error analysis, we show that many failures occur despite correct intent understanding and tool selection. We identify parameter value language mismatch as a dominant failure mode, where models generate semantically appropriate parameter values in the user's language, violating language-invariant execution conventions.

    "abstract": "           We present MOSAIC-GS, a novel, fully explicit, and computationally efficient approach for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos using Gaussian Splatting. Monocular reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of sufficient multiview constraints, making accurate recovery of object geometry and temporal coherence particularly challenging. To address this, we leverage multiple geometric cues, such as depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, and point tracking. Combined with rigidity-based motion constraints, these cues allow us to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics during an initialization stage. Recovering scene dynamics prior to the photometric optimization reduces reliance on motion inference from visual appearance alone, which is often ambiguous in monocular settings. To enable compact representations, fast training, and real-time rendering while supporting non-rigid deformations, the scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components. Each Gaussian in the dynamic part of the scene is assigned a trajectory represented as time-dependent Poly-Fourier curve for parameter-efficient motion encoding. We demonstrate that MOSAIC-GS achieves substantially faster optimization and rendering compared to existing methods, while maintaining reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art approaches across standard monocular dynamic scene benchmarks.

    "abstract": "           Modern commercial ground vehicles are increasingly equipped with multiple operational modalities (e.g., human driving, advanced driver assistance, remote tele-operation, full autonomy). These often rely on heterogeneous sensing infrastructures and distinct routing algorithms, which can yield misaligned perceptions of the traffic environment and route preferences. While such technologies accelerate the transition toward increasingly intelligent transportation networks, their current deployment fails to avoid challenges associated with selfish routing behavior, in which drivers or automated agents prioritize individually optimal routes instead of network-wide congestion mitigation. Existing traffic flow management strategies can address leader-follower dynamics in traffic routing problems but are not designed to account for vehicles capable of dynamically switching between multiple operational modes. This paper models the interaction between a vehicle control arbitration system and a multi-modal vehicle as a repeated single-leader, multiple follower Stackelberg game with asymmetric information. To address the intractability of computing an exact solution in this setting, we propose a Trust-Aware Control Trading Strategy (TACTS) utilizing a regret matching-based algorithm to adaptively update the arbitration system's mixed strategy over sequential, dynamic routing decisions. Theoretical results provide bounds on the realized total network travel time under TACTS algorithm relative to the system-optimal total network travel time. Experimental results of simulations between the system and a vehicle in several real-world traffic networks under various different congestion levels demonstrate that TACTS consistently reduces network-wide congestion and generally outperforms alternative routing and control-allocation strategies, particularly under high congestion and heavy induced vehicle flows.

However, non-injective functions can be restricted to sub-domains on which they are locally injective and surjective and thus invertible if the dimensionality between input and output spaces are the same.

Twin neural network regression is naturally capable of incorporating these properties to invert non-injective functions. Twin neural network regression is trained to predict adjustments to well known input variables $\\mathbf{x}^{\\text{anchor}}$ to obtain an estimate for an unknown $\\mathbf{x}^{\\text{new}}$ under a change of the target variable from $\\mathbf{y}^{\\text{anchor}}$ to $\\mathbf{y}^{\\text{new}}$.

While quaternion neural networks improve parameter efficiency by coupling multiple channels through Hamilton products, they typically retain unstructured dense weights; conversely, structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in the real domain. This paper introduces EdgeLDR, a practical framework for quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combines quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure and enables FFT-based evaluation through the complex adjoint representation. We present reference implementations of EdgeLDR layers and compare FFT-based computation against a naive spatial-domain realization of quaternion circulant products. FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over the naive implementation and keeps latency stable as block size increases, making larger compression factors computationally viable. We further integrate EdgeLDR layers into compact CNN and Transformer backbones and evaluate accuracy-compression trade-offs on 32x32 RGB classification (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN) and hyperspectral image classification (Houston 2013, Pavia University), reporting parameter counts and CPU/GPU latency.

By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.

At each time step, our transformer-based model injects the given adjacency as an adaptable attention bias, allowing the model to focus on relevant neighbors as the graph evolves. We further deploy a masked node-time pretraining objective that primes the encoder to reconstruct missing features, and train with scheduled sampling and a horizon-weighted loss to mitigate compounding error over long horizons.

Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail. In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines.

Since their training data are largely derived from human-authored corpora, LLMs may inherit a range of human biases. Behavioral biases can lead to instability and uncertainty in decision-making, particularly when processing financial information. However, existing research on LLM bias has mainly focused on direct questioning or simplified, general-purpose settings, with limited consideration of the complex real-world financial environments and high-risk, context-sensitive, multilingual financial misinformation detection tasks (\\mfmd). In this work, we propose \\mfmdscen, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating behavioral biases of LLMs in \\mfmd across diverse economic scenarios. In collaboration with financial experts, we construct three types of complex financial scenarios: (i) role- and personality-based, (ii) role- and region-based, and (iii) role-based scenarios incorporating ethnicity and religious beliefs. We further develop a multilingual financial misinformation dataset covering English, Chinese, Greek, and Bengali. By integrating these scenarios with misinformation claims, \\mfmdscen enables a systematic evaluation of 22 mainstream LLMs. Our findings reveal that pronounced behavioral biases persist across both commercial and open-source models.

    "title": "Meaning over Motion: A Semantic-First Approach to 360\u00b0 Viewport Prediction",
    "abstract": "           Ultra-high-resolution 360-degree video streaming is severely constrained by the massive bandwidth required to deliver immersive experiences. Current viewport prediction techniques predominately rely on kinematics or low-level visual saliency, treating users as passive physical objects governed by inertia. This theoretical limitation leads to the \"Saccade Trap\" -- a critical failure mode where predictors fail to anticipate rapid, meaning-driven shifts in attention, causing rebuffering stalls exactly when user engagement is highest. To resolve this, we propose Semantically-Adaptive Conformal Tiling with Associative Lookahead, a novel framework that integrates cognitive intent into network control. Unlike \"one-size-fits-all\" approaches, our method utilizes an architectural inversion strategy: heavy semantic reasoning is offloaded to the server to generate lightweight association graphs, which guide a low-latency client-side controller. We construct a personalized Multi-Modal Prediction Set that dynamically tightens safety margins during stable fixation to maximize efficiency, while simultaneously pre-fetching non-adjacent tiles containing semantically linked objects (Associative Lookahead). This mechanism effectively converts the \"calm\" of fixation into a preparation phase for the next interaction. Trace-driven evaluation on the 360-AV-HM dataset demonstrates that this approach successfully mitigates the Saccade Trap, reducing stall duration by $\\ge$ 20% and lowering effective bandwidth consumption by $\\ge$ 18% compared to state-of-the-art trajectory-based baselines.

    "abstract": "           Accurately assessing the potential for fault slip is essential in many subsurface operations. Conventional model-based history matching methods, which entail the generation of posterior geomodels calibrated to observed data, can be challenging to apply in coupled flow-geomechanics problems with faults. In this work, we implement a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based data-space inversion (DSI) framework to predict pressure, stress and strain fields, and fault slip tendency, in CO${_2}$ storage projects. The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables. The VAE parameterization is used with DSI for posterior predictions, with monitoring wells providing observed pressure and strain data. Posterior results for synthetic true models demonstrate that the DSI-VAE framework gives accurate predictions for pressure, strain, and stress fields and for fault slip tendency. The framework is also shown to reduce uncertainty in key geomechanical and fault parameters.         ",

    "abstract": "           Infrared small target detection (ISTD) remains a long-standing challenge due to weak signal contrast, limited spatial extent, and cluttered backgrounds. Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.         ",

    "abstract": "           Recently, differentiable causal discovery has emerged as a promising approach to improve the accuracy and efficiency of existing methods. However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ALVGL not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly improves optimization efficiency, making it a reliable and effective solution for differentiable causal discovery.

In this work, we explore inference-time search algorithms that guide the LLM to discover better solutions through iterative refinement based on execution feedback. Our approach, called MaxCode unifies existing search methods under a max-reward reinforcement learning framework, making the observation and action-value functions modular for modification. To enhance the observation space, we integrate a natural language critique model that converts raw execution feedback into diagnostic insights about errors and performance bottlenecks, and the best-discounted reward seen so far. Together, these provide richer input to the code proposal function. To improve exploration during search, we train a generative reward-to-go model using action values from rollouts to rerank potential solutions. Testing on the KernelBench (CUDA) and PIE (C++) optimization benchmarks shows that MaxCode improves optimized code performance compared to baselines, achieving 20.3% and 10.1% relative improvements in absolute speedup value and relative speedup ranking, respectively.

However, accurate imaging of roots in subterranean environments remains a persistent challenge due to adverse conditions such as occlusion, varying soil moisture, and inherently low contrast, which limit the effectiveness of conventional vision-based approaches. In this work, we propose a novel underground imaging system that captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework designed to enhance root visibility and detail. To train and evaluate our approach, we construct a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic underground imaging scenarios, incorporating key environmental factors that affect image quality. Our proposed MISR algorithm leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity and visual clarity. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines, achieving a 2.3 percent reduction in BRISQUE, indicating improved image quality with the same CLIP-IQA score, thereby enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis of root systems. This, in turn, facilitates accurate estimation of critical root traits, including root hair count and root hair density. The proposed framework presents a promising direction for robust automatic underground plant root imaging and trait quantification for agricultural and ecological research.         ",

While code language models have shown significant advancements, the current models and benchmarks are confined to high-readability code, which contains sufficient semantic cues such as function and variable names. In the real world, however, code is often poorly structured or obfuscated, significantly degrading model performance. In this paper, we first empirically evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art language models on poor-readability code for the task of code summarization, focusing on (1) their effectiveness, (2) the impact of prompt engineering, and (3) the robustness of different variants. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models-including GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 experience a substantial performance drop when faced with poorly readable code, and that prompt engineering and reasoning-enhanced models offer limited improvements. Motivated by these findings, we propose RoFTCodeSum, a novel fine-tuning method that enhances the robustness of code summarization against poorly readable code. RoFTCodeSum marries the concepts of curriculum learning and meta-learning: based on the original dataset for fine-tuning, it creates curricular training sets, e.g., obfuscating function names and identifiers from the code, respectively, that have progressive difficulty in code comprehension. In each training step, the approach meta-updates the gradients using these progressively challenging datasets, thereby optimizing both accuracy and readability robustness simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that RoFTCodeSum exhibits increased robustness against semantic perturbation while enhancing performance on the original code.         ",

    "abstract": "           Large language model agents equipped with persistent memory are vulnerable to memory poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious instructions through query only interactions that corrupt the agents long term memory and influence future responses. Recent work demonstrated that the MINJA (Memory Injection Attack) achieves over 95 % injection success rate and 70 % attack success rate under idealized conditions. However, the robustness of these attacks in realistic deployments and effective defensive mechanisms remain understudied. This work addresses these gaps through systematic empirical evaluation of memory poisoning attacks and defenses in Electronic Health Record (EHR) agents. We investigate attack robustness by varying three critical dimensions: initial memory state, number of indication prompts, and retrieval parameters. Our experiments on GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct models using MIMIC-III clinical data reveal that realistic conditions with pre-existing legitimate memories dramatically reduce attack effectiveness. We then propose and evaluate two novel defense mechanisms: (1) Input/Output Moderation using composite trust scoring across multiple orthogonal signals, and (2) Memory Sanitization with trust-aware retrieval employing temporal decay and pattern-based filtering. Our defense evaluation reveals that effective memory sanitization requires careful trust threshold calibration to prevent both overly conservative rejection (blocking all entries) and insufficient filtering (missing subtle attacks), establishing important baselines for future adaptive defense mechanisms.

We have witnessed significant progress in widely use of visual-language foundational models in recent approaches. However, current methods often struggle with complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, ultimately limiting their flexibility and generality. To address these issues, this paper rethinks the fundamental mechanism behind visual-language models for AD and presents an embarrassingly simple, general, and effective framework for Universal vision Anomaly Detection (UniADet). Specifically, we first find language encoder is used to derive decision weights for anomaly classification and segmentation, and then demonstrate that it is unnecessary for universal AD. Second, we propose an embarrassingly simple method to completely decouple classification and segmentation, and decouple cross-level features, i.e., learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features. UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains.

However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.

Current detection methods often struggle to generalize to unseen generative models, and the rapid evolution of generative techniques continuously exacerbates this challenge. Without adaptability, detection models risk becoming ineffective in real-world applications. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel three-stage domain continual learning framework designed for continuous adaptation to evolving generative models. In the first stage, we employ a strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to develop a transferable offline detection model with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, the second stage integrates unseen data streams into a continual learning process. To efficiently learn from limited samples of novel generated models and mitigate overfitting, we design a data augmentation chain with progressively increasing complexity. Furthermore, we leverage the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method to approximate the Hessian and alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the third stage utilizes a linear interpolation strategy based on Linear Mode Connectivity, effectively capturing commonalities across diverse generative models and further enhancing overall performance. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 27 generative models, including GANs, deepfakes, and diffusion models, chronologically structured up to August 2024 to simulate real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our initial offline detectors surpass the leading baseline by +5.51% in terms of mean average precision.

The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed method across various choices of energies and initial conditions.         ",

    "abstract": "           Recent advances in software vulnerability detection have been driven by Language Model (LM)-based approaches. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit lexical and syntax perturbations, allowing critical flaws to evade detection. Existing black-box attacks on LM-based vulnerability detectors primarily rely on isolated perturbation strategies, limiting their ability to efficiently explore the adversarial code space for optimal perturbations. To bridge this gap, we propose HogVul, a black-box adversarial code generation framework that integrates both lexical and syntax perturbations under a unified dual-channel optimization strategy driven by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). By systematically coordinating two-level perturbations, HogVul effectively expands the search space for adversarial examples, enhancing the attack efficacy. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HogVul achieves an average attack success rate improvement of 26.05\\% over state-of-the-art baseline methods. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid optimization strategies in exposing model vulnerabilities.         ",

    "title": "A Causal Information-Flow Framework for Unbiased Learning-to-Rank",
    "abstract": "           In web search and recommendation systems, user clicks are widely used to train ranking models. However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.

This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning. Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for multimodal reasoning.

As a result, it does not prioritize classes within the same package or project, treating all global names equally. In this paper, we present a new heuristic that addresses this limitation. Our approach searches variable names in a structured manner: it begins with the package of the requesting class, then expands to other packages within the same repository, and finally considers the global namespace. We describe the logic behind this heuristic and evaluate it against the default semantic heuristic and one that directly queries the global namespace. Preliminary results indicate that the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) improves, confirming that package-awareness completions deliver more accurate and relevant suggestions than the previous flat global approach.

While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs.

Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce \"overgeneralization\", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal. In contrast, attention mechanisms prioritize global context over local detail and yield the highest detection performance with an area-under-the-curve of 0.875. The attention-based Variational Autoencoder achieves an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 in the 0 to 40-kilometer near-source range, demonstrating high suitability for immediate early warning applications.

Recently, most SPD studies have targeted Open-Source Software (OSS), yet a large portion of real-world software is closed-source, where patches are distributed as binaries without accessible source code. The limited binary SPD approaches often lift binaries to abstraction levels, i.e., assembly code or pseudo-code. However, assembly code is register-based instructions conveying limited semantics, while pseudo-code lacks parser-compatible grammar to extract structure, both hindering accurate vulnerability-fix representation learning.

ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network. Moreover, ADRL performs prototype-specific feature selection by enabling independent interactions between label embeddings and view representations, accompanied by the generation of pseudo-labels for each category. The structural characteristics of the pseudo-label space are then exploited to guide a discriminative trade-off during view fusion.

In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits. Additionally, we explore its applicability to protein-RNA and peptide-protein interactions. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multimodal information with contrastive objectives to enhance interaction-prediction accuracy and to provide more interpretable and reliability-aware models for virtual screening.

    "abstract": "           Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) generate high-quality images by operating in a compressed latent space, typically obtained through image tokenizers such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In pursuit of a generation-friendly VAE, recent studies have explored leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as representation alignment targets for VAEs, mirroring the approach commonly adopted for LDMs. Although this yields certain performance gains, using the same alignment target for both VAEs and LDMs overlooks their fundamentally different representational requirements. We advocate that while LDMs benefit from latents retaining high-level semantic concepts, VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement, enabling encoding of attribute-level information in a structured way. To address this, we propose the Semantic disentangled VAE (Send-VAE), explicitly optimized for disentangled representation learning through aligning its latent space with the semantic hierarchy of pre-trained VFMs. Our approach employs a non-linear mapper network to transform VAE latents, aligning them with VFMs to bridge the gap between attribute-level disentanglement and high-level semantics, facilitating effective guidance for VAE learning. We evaluate semantic disentanglement via linear probing on attribute prediction tasks, showing strong correlation with improved generation performance. Finally, using Send-VAE, we train flow-based transformers SiTs; experiments show Send-VAE significantly speeds up training and achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.21 and 1.75 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256x256.

    "abstract": "           Accurate surround-view depth estimation provides a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors and is essential for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving. While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Poisson non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used method to find interpretable \"parts-based\" decompositions of count data. While many variants of Poisson NMF exist, existing methods assume that the \"parts\" in the decomposition combine additively. This assumption may be natural in some settings, but not in others. Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix). We illustrate these new methods on a variety of real datasets. Our examples show how the choice of link function in Poisson NMF can substantively impact the results, and how in some settings the use of a shifted-log link function may improve interpretability compared with the standard, additive link.

However, most existing approaches rely primarily on spectral magnitude, implicitly under exploring the role of phase information. In this work, we propose Phase4DFD, a phase aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase magnitude interactions via a learnable attention mechanism. Our approach augments standard RGB input with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude and local binary pattern (LBP) representations to expose subtle synthesis artifacts that remain indistinguishable under spatial analysis alone. Crucially, we introduce an input level phase aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities commonly introduced by synthetic generation to guide the model toward frequency patterns that are most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction. The attended multi domain representation is processed by an efficient BNext M backbone, with optional channel spatial attention applied for semantic feature refinement. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE and DFFD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model Phase4DFD outperforms state of the art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that explicit phase modeling provides complementary and non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only frequency representations.         ",

    "abstract": "           Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models are critically undermined by citation hallucinations, a deceptive failure where a model confidently cites a source that fails to support its claim. Existing work often attributes hallucination to a simple over-reliance on the model's parametric knowledge. We challenge this view and introduce FACTUM (Framework for Attesting Citation Trustworthiness via Underlying Mechanisms), a framework of four mechanistic scores measuring the distinct contributions of a model's attention and FFN pathways, and the alignment between them. Our analysis reveals two consistent signatures of correct citation: a significantly stronger contribution from the model's parametric knowledge and greater use of the attention sink for information synthesis. Crucially, we find the signature of a correct citation is not static but evolves with model scale. For example, the signature of a correct citation for the Llama-3.2-3B model is marked by higher pathway alignment, whereas for the Llama-3.1-8B model, it is characterized by lower alignment, where pathways contribute more distinct, orthogonal information. By capturing this complex, evolving signature, FACTUM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 37.5% in AUC. Our findings reframe citation hallucination as a complex, scale-dependent interplay between internal mechanisms, paving the way for more nuanced and reliable RAG systems.         ",

To build cybersecurity superintelligence --Cybersecurity AI exceeding best human capability-such strategic intuition must be embedded into agentic reasoning processes. We present Generative Cut-the-Rope (G-CTR), a game-theoretic guidance layer that extracts attack graphs from agent's context, computes Nash equilibria with effort-aware scoring, and feeds a concise digest back into the LLM loop \\emph{guiding} the agent's actions. Across five real-world exercises, G-CTR matches 70--90% of expert graph structure while running 60--245x faster and over 140x cheaper than manual analysis. In a 44-run cyber-range, adding the digest lifts success from 20.0% to 42.9%, cuts cost-per-success by 2.7x, and reduces behavioral variance by 5.2x. In Attack-and-Defense exercises, a shared digest produces the Purple agent, winning roughly 2:1 over the LLM-only baseline and 3.7:1 over independently guided teams. This closed-loop guidance is what produces the breakthrough: it reduces ambiguity, collapses the LLM's search space, suppresses hallucinations, and keeps the model anchored to the most relevant parts of the problem, yielding large gains in success rate, consistency, and reliability.

A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region. When approximate analytic solutions can be obtained in each patch, they are then matched at the interfaces to construct a global solution. However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in representative problems from chemical kinetics and cosmology, where it accurately reproduces global solutions and outperforms conventional matching procedures.

    "abstract": "           Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a promising paradigm for agents, with long-term planning and decision-making emerging as core general-purpose capabilities for adapting to diverse scenarios and tasks. Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

Most work in this area uses an algorithm design strategy that combines a bandit learning algorithm with the virtual queue technique to track the throughput constraint violation. These algorithms seek to minimize the virtual queue length in their algorithm design. However, in networks where channel conditions change abruptly, the resulting constraints may become infeasible, leading to unbounded growth in virtual queue lengths. In this paper, we make the key observation that the dynamics of the head-of-line age, i.e. the age of the oldest packet in the virtual queue, make it more robust when used in algorithm design compared to the virtual queue length. We therefore design a learning-based scheduling policy that uses the head-of-line age in place of the virtual queue length. We show that our policy matches state-of-the-art performance under i.i.d. network conditions. Crucially, we also show that the system remains stable even under abrupt changes in channel conditions and can rapidly recover from periods of constraint infeasibility.         ",

VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger.

For each community, representative stations based on the best silhouette are selected and three autoencoder architectures (BiLSTM, LSTM, and MLP) are trained using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with expanding window cross-validation and tested on stations from the same cluster and the best representative stations of other clusters. The models are trained on normal temperature patterns of the data and anomalies are detected through reconstruction error analysis.

In this work, we extend the DUMB -- Dataset soUrces, Model architecture and Balance - and DUMBer methodology to deepfake detection. We evaluate detectors robustness against adversarial attacks under transferability constraints and cross-dataset configuration to extract real-world insights. Our study spans five state-of-the-art detectors (RECCE, SRM, XCeption, UCF, SPSL), three attacks (PGD, FGSM, FPBA), and two datasets (FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF-V2). We analyze both attacker and defender perspectives mapping results to mismatch scenarios. Experiments show that adversarial training strategies reinforce robustness in the in-distribution cases but can also degrade it under cross-dataset configuration depending on the strategy adopted. These findings highlight the need for case-aware defense strategies in real-world applications exposed to adversarial attacks.         ",

    "abstract": "           University dropout remains a persistent challenge in higher education systems, yet causal evidence on the mechanisms triggering early disengagement is limited. This study estimates the causal effect of first-time academic failure on subsequent university attrition. Exploiting a sharp institutional grading threshold on a 0-10 scale, we implement a regression discontinuity design (RDD) comparing students who narrowly fail to those who narrowly pass their first attempt. Using longitudinal administrative data spanning multiple cohorts and degree programmes, we estimate local average treatment effects (LATE) for students at the margin of success and examine dropout outcomes within 12 and 24 months following the initial evaluation. Contrary to conventional assumptions, the results indicate that marginal first-time failure is associated with a lower probability of subsequent dropout relative to marginal passing at both horizons. A comprehensive battery of robustness checks - including donut RDD specifications, placebo cutoffs, and formal density tests - supports the validity of the identification strategy. These findings suggest that early academic failure may function as a salient signal that prompts behavioural adjustment or reorientation, while marginal passing may sustain a state of \"fragile persistence\". The study provides causal evidence on the non-linear effects of early academic performance and highlights the importance of carefully designed institutional responses at critical evaluation thresholds.

    "abstract": "           Representing networks as a graph and training a link prediction model using benign connections is an effective method of anomaly-based intrusion detection. Existing works using this technique have shown great success using temporal graph neural networks and skip-gram-based approaches on random walks. However, random walk-based approaches are unable to incorporate rich edge data, while the GNN-based approaches require large amounts of memory to train. In this work, we propose extending the original insight from random walk-based skip-grams--that random walks through a graph are analogous to sentences in a corpus--to the more modern transformer-based foundation models. Using language models that take advantage of GPU optimizations, we can quickly train a graph foundation model to predict missing tokens in random walks through a network of computers. The graph foundation model is then finetuned for link prediction and used as a network anomaly detector. This new approach allows us to combine the efficiency of random walk-based methods and the rich semantic representation of deep learning methods. This system, which we call CyberGFM, achieved state-of-the-art results on three widely used network anomaly detection datasets, delivering a up to 2$\\times$ improvement in average precision. We found that CyberGFM outperforms all prior works in unsupervised link prediction for network anomaly detection, using the same number of parameters, and with equal or better efficiency than the previous best approaches.

Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance.

However, existing approaches primarily rely on binary outcome rewards, which fail to capture the comprehensiveness and factuality of agents' reasoning process, and often lead to undesirable behaviors such as shortcut exploitation and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Citation-aware Rubric Rewards (CaRR)}, a fine-grained reward framework for deep search agents that emphasizes reasoning comprehensiveness, factual grounding, and evidence connectivity. CaRR decomposes complex questions into verifiable single-hop rubrics and requires agents to satisfy these rubrics by explicitly identifying hidden entities, supporting them with correct citations, and constructing complete evidence chains that link to the predicted answer. We further introduce \\textbf{Citation-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)}, which combines CaRR and outcome rewards for training robust deep search agents. Experiments show that C-GRPO consistently outperforms standard outcome-based RL baselines across multiple deep search benchmarks. Our analysis also validates that C-GRPO effectively discourages shortcut exploitation, promotes comprehensive, evidence-grounded reasoning, and exhibits strong generalization to open-ended deep research tasks.

We draw conclusions from training and comparing the performance of the models on multiple, comparable highly complex datasets simulated from SPLICE (Avanzi, Taylor and Wang, 2023).

While machine learning has shown promise in this domain, many reported results suffer from methodological flaws, most notably patient level data leakage, inflating performance estimates and limiting clinical translation. To address these modeling pitfalls, we propose a unified evaluation framework grounded in nested cross validation and incorporating three complementary safeguards: (i) patient level stratification to eliminate subject overlap and ensure unbiased generalization, (ii) multi layered windowing to harmonize heterogeneous EEG recordings while preserving temporal dynamics, and (iii) inner loop channel selection to enable principled feature reduction without information leakage. Applied across three independent datasets with a heterogeneous number of channels, a convolutional neural network trained under this framework achieved 80.6% accuracy and demonstrated state of the art performance under held out population block testing, comparable to other methods in the literature. This performance underscores the necessity of nested cross validation as a safeguard against bias and as a principled means of selecting the most relevant information for patient level decisions, providing a reproducible foundation that can extend to other biomedical signal analysis domains.

Parametric models with fixed nominal parameters often omit critical physical effects due to simplifications in geometry, material behavior, damping, or boundary conditions, resulting in model form errors (MFEs) that impair predictive accuracy. This work introduces a comprehensive framework for MFE estimation and correction in high-dimensional finite element (FE) based structural dynamical systems. The Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) represents discrepancies non-parametrically in the reduced modal domain, allowing a flexible data-driven characterization of unmodeled dynamics. A linear Bayesian filtering approach jointly estimates system states and discrepancies, incorporating epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. To ensure computational tractability, the FE system is projected onto a reduced modal basis, and a mesh-invariant neural network maps modal states to discrepancy estimates, permitting model rectification across different FE discretizations without retraining. Validation is undertaken across five MFE scenarios-including incorrect beam theory, damping misspecification, misspecified boundary condition, unmodeled material nonlinearity, and local damage demonstrating the surrogate model's substantial reduction of displacement and rotation prediction errors under unseen excitations. The proposed methodology offers a potential means to uphold digital twin accuracy amid inherent modeling uncertainties.         ",

Asset eligibility is formalized as a state-dependent constraint on portfolio construction, allowing factor exposure to adjust endogenously in response to observable market conditions such as liquidity, volatility, and cross-sectional breadth. Rather than estimating expected returns or covariances, the framework relies on cross-sectional rankings and hard structural bounds to control concentration, turnover, and fragility. The resulting approach is fully algorithmic, transparent, and directly implementable.

This growth becomes a bottleneck for many antenna and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) systems as arrays and user densities scale. Practical CSI feedback and beam management rely on codebooks, where beams are selected via indices rather than explicitly transmitting radiation patterns. Hardware-aware operation requires an explicit representation of the measured antenna/RIS response, yet high-fidelity measured patterns are high-dimensional and costly to handle. We present SPARK (Sparse Parametric Antenna Representation using Kernels), a training-free compression model that decomposes patterns into a smooth global base and sparse localized lobes. For 3D patterns, SPARK uses low-order spherical harmonics for global directivity and anisotropic Gaussian kernels for localized features. For RIS 1D azimuth cuts, it uses a Fourier-series base with 1D Gaussians. On patterns from the AERPAW testbed and a public RIS dataset, SPARK achieves up to 2.8$\\times$ and 10.4$\\times$ reductions in reconstruction MSE over baselines, respectively. Simulation shows that amortizing a compact pattern description and reporting sparse path descriptors can produce 12.65% mean uplink goodput gain under a fixed uplink budget.

    "abstract": "           Combinatorial materials libraries are an efficient route to generate large families of candidate compositions, but their impact is often limited by the speed and depth of characterization and by the difficulty of extracting actionable structure-property relations from complex characterization data. Here we develop an autonomous scanning probe microscopy (SPM) framework that integrates automated atomic force and magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) to rapidly explore magnetic and structural properties across combinatorial spread libraries. To enable automated exploration of systems without a clear optimization target, we introduce a combination of a static physics-informed bag-of-features (BoF) representation of measured surface morphology and magnetic structure with multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to discover the relative significance and robustness of features. The resulting closed-loop workflow selectively samples the compositional gradient and reconstructs feature landscapes consistent with dense grid \"ground truth\" measurements. The resulting Pareto structure reveals where multiple nanoscale objectives are simultaneously optimized, where trade-offs between roughness, coherence, and magnetic contrast are unavoidable, and how families of compositions cluster into distinct functional regimes, thereby turning multi-feature imaging data into interpretable maps of competing structure-property trends. While demonstrated for Au-Co-Ni and AFM/MFM, the approach is general and can be extended to other combinatorial systems, imaging modalities, and feature sets, illustrating how feature-based MOBO and autonomous SPM can transform microscopy images from static data products into active feedback for real-time, multi-objective materials discovery.

After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL obtains cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks.

Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly infinite width are linear functionals on the space of measures on the parameter space. From this functional-analytic perspective, graph signals are seen as spatial discretizations of functions on the manifold, which leads to a natural notion of training data consistent across graph resolutions. To enable convergence results, the continuum parameter space is chosen as a weakly compact product of unit balls, with Sobolev regularity imposed on the output weight and bias, but not on the convolutional parameter. The corresponding discrete parameter spaces inherit the corresponding spectral decay, and are additionally restricted by a frequency cutoff adapted to the informative spectral window of the graph Laplacians. Under these assumptions, we prove $\\Gamma$-convergence of regularized empirical risk minimization functionals and corresponding convergence of their global minimizers, in the sense of weak convergence of the parameter measures and uniform convergence of the functions over compact sets.

    "title": "MIPO: Mutual Integration of Patient Journey and Medical Ontology for Healthcare Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "           Representation learning on electronic health records (EHRs) plays a vital role in downstream medical prediction tasks. Although natural language processing techniques, such as recurrent neural networks, and self-attention, have been adapted for learning medical representations from hierarchical, time-stamped EHR data, they often struggle when either general or task-specific data are limited. Recent efforts have attempted to mitigate this challenge by incorporating medical ontologies (i.e., knowledge graphs) into self-supervised tasks like diagnosis prediction. However, two main issues remain: (1) small and uniform ontologies that lack diversity for robust learning, and (2) insufficient attention to the critical contexts or dependencies underlying patient journeys, which could further enhance ontology-based learning. To address these gaps, we propose MIPO (Mutual Integration of Patient Journey and Medical Ontology), a robust end-to-end framework that employs a Transformer-based architecture for representation learning. MIPO emphasizes task-specific representation learning through a sequential diagnosis prediction task, while also incorporating an ontology-based disease-typing task. A graph-embedding module is introduced to integrate information from patient visit records, thus alleviating data insufficiency. This setup creates a mutually reinforcing loop, where both patient-journey embedding and ontology embedding benefit from each other. We validate MIPO on two real-world benchmark datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline methods under both sufficient and limited data conditions. Furthermore, the resulting diagnosis embeddings offer improved interpretability, underscoring the promise of MIPO for real-world healthcare applications.         ",

However, the parameter-sharing strategy greatly increases the computational burden for each added parameter, which hampers its application to deep neural network models. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a non-parameter-sharing approach for group equivariant neural networks. The proposed methods adaptively aggregate a diverse range of filters by a weighted sum of stochastically augmented decomposed filters. We give theoretical proof about how the group equivariance can be achieved by our methods. Our method applies to both continuous and discrete groups, where the augmentation is implemented using Monte Carlo sampling and bootstrap resampling, respectively. Our methods also serve as an efficient extension of standard CNN. The experiments show that our method outperforms parameter-sharing group equivariant networks and enhances the performance of standard CNNs in image classification and denoising tasks, by using suitable filter bases to build efficient lightweight networks.

    "abstract": "           NASA's forthcoming Lunar Gateway space station, which will be uncrewed most of the time, will need to operate with an unprecedented level of autonomy. One key challenge is enabling the Canadarm3, the Gateway's external robotic system, to detect hazards in its environment using its onboard inspection cameras. This task is complicated by the extreme and variable lighting conditions in space. In this paper, we introduce the visual anomaly detection and localization task for the space domain and establish a benchmark based on a synthetic dataset called ALLO (Anomaly Localization in Lunar Orbit). We show that state-of-the-art visual anomaly detection methods often fail in the space domain, motivating the need for new approaches. To address this, we propose MRAD (Model Reference Anomaly Detection), a statistical algorithm that leverages the known pose of the Canadarm3 and a CAD model of the Gateway to generate reference images of the expected scene appearance. Anomalies are then identified as deviations from this model-generated reference. On the ALLO dataset, MRAD surpasses state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms, achieving an AP score of 62.9% at the pixel level and an AUROC score of 75.0% at the image level. Given the low tolerance for risk in space operations and the lack of domain-specific data, we emphasize the need for novel, robust, and accurate anomaly detection methods to handle the challenging visual conditions found in lunar orbit and beyond.

To obtain robust supervised detectors from synthetic datasets, we also adopt a data mixture strategy to improve performance robustness and generalization. Our results on three datasets show that our generated hallucination text is more closely aligned with non-hallucinated text versus baselines, to train hallucination detectors with better generalization. Our hallucination detectors trained on synthetic datasets outperform in-context-learning (ICL)-based detectors by a large margin of 32%. Our extensive experiments confirm the benefits of our approach with cross-task and cross-generator generalization. Our data-mixture-based training further improves the generalization and robustness of hallucination detection.         ",

    "abstract": "           Video-based multimodal large language models (V-MLLMs) have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in video-text multimodal tasks. However, the transferability of adversarial videos to unseen models - a common and practical real-world scenario - remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer an investigation into the transferability of adversarial video samples across V-MLLMs. We find that existing adversarial attack methods face significant limitations when applied in black-box settings for V-MLLMs, which we attribute to the following shortcomings: (1) lacking generalization in perturbing video features, (2) focusing only on sparse key-frames, and (3) failing to integrate multimodal information. To address these limitations and deepen the understanding of V-MLLM vulnerabilities in black-box scenarios, we introduce the Image-to-Video MLLM (I2V-MLLM) attack. In I2V-MLLM, we utilize an image-based multimodal large language model (I-MLLM) as a surrogate model to craft adversarial video samples. Multimodal interactions and spatiotemporal information are integrated to disrupt video representations within the latent space, improving adversarial transferability. Additionally, a perturbation propagation technique is introduced to handle different unknown frame sampling strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate adversarial examples that exhibit strong transferability across different V-MLLMs on multiple video-text multimodal tasks. Compared to white-box attacks on these models, our black-box attacks (using BLIP-2 as a surrogate model) achieve competitive performance, with average attack success rate (AASR) of 57.98% on MSVD-QA and 58.26% on MSRVTT-QA for Zero-Shot VideoQA tasks, respectively.

From a model's perspective, this presents an interesting challenge. If models could autonomously retrieve knowledge useful for transfer or decision-making to solve problems, they would transition from passively acquiring to actively accessing and learning from knowledge. However, filling models with knowledge is relatively straightforward -- it simply requires more training and accessible knowledge bases. The more complex task is teaching models about which knowledge can be analogized and transferred. Therefore, we design a knowledge augmentation method, LEKA, for knowledge transfer that actively searches for suitable knowledge sources that can enrich the target domain's knowledge. This LEKA method extracts key information from the target domain's textual information, retrieves pertinent data from external data libraries, and harmonizes retrieved data with the target domain data in feature space and marginal probability measures. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across various domains and demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods in reducing computational costs, automating data alignment, and optimizing transfer learning outcomes.

In human-computer communication, underspecified messages often represent a major challenge: for instance, translating natural language instructions into code is difficult when user instructions contain inherent ambiguities. In the present paper, we aim to scale up the pragmatic \"Rational Speech Act\" framework to naturalistic language-to-code problems, and propose a way of dealing with multiple meaning-equivalent instruction alternatives, an issue that does not arise in previous toy-scale problems. We evaluate our method, CodeRSA, with two recent LLMs (Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct) on two widely used code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP). Our experimental results show that CodeRSA consistently outperforms common baselines, surpasses the state-of-the-art approach in most cases, and demonstrates robust overall performance. Qualitative analyses demonstrate that it exhibits the desired behavior for the right reasons. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating pragmatic reasoning into a naturalistic complex communication task, language-to-code generation, offering a promising direction for enhancing code generation quality in LLMs and emphasizing the importance of pragmatic reasoning in complex communication settings.

Malicious users can exploit LLMs to produce paraphrased versions of proprietary code that closely resemble the original. While the potential for LLM-assisted code paraphrasing continues to grow, research on detecting it remains limited, underscoring an urgent need for detection system. We respond to this need by proposing two tasks. The first task is to detect whether code generated by an LLM is a paraphrased version of original human-written code. The second task is to identify which LLM is used to paraphrase the original code. For these tasks, we construct a dataset LPcode consisting of pairs of human-written code and LLM-paraphrased code using various LLMs. We statistically confirm significant differences in the coding styles of human-written and LLM-paraphrased code, particularly in terms of naming consistency, code structure, and readability. Based on these findings, we develop LPcodedec, a detection method that identifies paraphrase relationships between human-written and LLM-generated code, and discover which LLM is used for the paraphrasing. LPcodedec outperforms the best baselines in two tasks, improving F1 scores by 2.64% and 15.17% while achieving speedups of 1,343x and 213x, respectively.

A novel concept of virtual incremental capacity (VIC) and virtual differential voltage (VDV) is proposed. Then, two related convolutional neural networks (CNNs), called U-Net and Conv-Net, are proposed to construct VIC/VDV curves and estimate the state of health (SOH) from dynamic charging profiles across any state-of-charge (SOC) range that satisfies some constraints. Finally, two CNNs called Mobile U-Net and Mobile-Net are proposed as replacements for the U-Net and Conv-Net, respectively, to reduce the computational footprint and memory requirements, while keeping similar performance. Using an extensive experimental dataset of battery modules, the proposed CNNs are demonstrated to provide accurate VIC/VDV curves and enable ICA/DVA-based battery degradation monitoring under various fast-charging protocols and different SOC ranges.

However, recent studies have revealed that private information can still be leaked through shared gradient information and attacked by Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA). While many GIA methods have been proposed, a detailed analysis, evaluation, and summary of these methods are still lacking. Although various survey papers summarize existing privacy attacks in FL, few studies have conducted extensive experiments to unveil the effectiveness of GIA and their associated limiting factors in this context. To fill this gap, we first undertake a systematic review of GIA and categorize existing methods into three types, i.e., \\textit{optimization-based} GIA (OP-GIA), \\textit{generation-based} GIA (GEN-GIA), and \\textit{analytics-based} GIA (ANA-GIA). Then, we comprehensively analyze and evaluate the three types of GIA in FL, providing insights into the factors that influence their performance, practicality, and potential threats. Our findings indicate that OP-GIA is the most practical attack setting despite its unsatisfactory performance, while GEN-GIA has many dependencies and ANA-GIA is easily detectable, making them both impractical. Finally, we offer a three-stage defense pipeline to users when designing FL frameworks and protocols for better privacy protection and share some future research directions from the perspectives of attackers and defenders that we believe should be pursued. We hope that our study can help researchers design more robust FL frameworks to defend against these attacks.         ",

These priorities can also change dynamically: for example, an emergency alert requires high reliability, while routine monitoring prioritizes energy efficiency to prolong network lifetime. Existing works, including many deep reinforcement learning approaches, are typically centralized and assume static objectives, making them slow to adapt when preferences shift. We propose a dynamic and fully distributed multi-objective Q-learning routing algorithm that learns multiple per-preference Q-tables in parallel and introduces a novel greedy interpolation policy to act near-optimally for unseen preferences without retraining or central coordination. A theoretical analysis further shows that the optimal value function is Lipschitz-continuous in the preference parameter, ensuring that the proposed greedy interpolation policy yields provably near-optimal behavior. Simulations show that our approach adapts in real time to shifting priorities and achieves up to 80-90\\% lower energy consumption and more than 2-5x higher cumulative rewards and packet delivery compared to six baseline protocols, under dynamic and distributed settings. Sensitivity analysis across varying preference window lengths confirms that the proposed DPQ framework consistently achieves higher composite reward than all baseline methods, demonstrating robustness to changes in operating conditions.

    "abstract": "           Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) with missing modalities has attracted increasing attention recently. While current Transformer-based methods leverage dense text information to maintain model robustness, their quadratic complexity hinders efficient long-range modeling and multimodal fusion. To this end, we propose a novel and efficient Text-enhanced Fusion Mamba (TF-Mamba) framework for robust MSA with missing modalities. Specifically, a Text-aware Modality Enhancement (TME) module aligns and enriches non-text modalities, while reconstructing the missing text semantics. Moreover, we develop Text-based Context Mamba (TC-Mamba) to capture intra-modal contextual dependencies under text collaboration. Finally, Text-guided Query Mamba (TQ-Mamba) queries text-guided multimodal information and learns joint representations for sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments on three MSA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method under missing modality scenarios. Our code is available at this https URL.         ",

There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers.

    "abstract": "           We present the first truly subcubic, combinatorial algorithm for detecting an induced $4$-cycle in a graph. The running time is $O(n^{2.84})$ on $n$-node graphs, thus separating the task of detecting induced $4$-cycles from detecting triangles, which requires $n^{3-o(1)}$ time combinatorially under the popular BMM hypothesis. Significant work has gone into characterizing the exact time complexity of induced $H$-detection, relative to the complexity of detecting cliques of various sizes. Prior work identified the question of whether induced $4$-cycle detection is triangle-hard as the only remaining case towards completing the lowest level of the classification, dubbing it a \"curious\" case [Dalirrooyfard, Vassilevska W., FOCS 2022]. Our result can be seen as a negative resolution of this question. Our algorithm deviates from previous techniques in the large body of subgraph detection algorithms and employs the trendy topic of graph decomposition that has hitherto been restricted to more global problems (as in the use of expander decompositions for flow problems) or to shaving subpolynomial factors (as in the application of graph regularity lemmas). While our algorithm is slower than the (non-combinatorial) state-of-the-art $\\tilde{O}(n^{\\omega})$-time algorithm based on polynomial identity testing [Vassilevska W., Wang, Williams, Yu, SODA 2014], combinatorial advancements often come with other benefits.

Yet, LLMs could introduce critical vulnerabilities in these systems. Here, we examine the vulnerability and robustness of off-the-shelf consensus-generating LLMs to prompt-injection attacks, in which texts are injected to amplify particular viewpoints, erase certain opinions, or divert consensus toward unrelated or irrelevant topics. We construct attack-free and adversarial variants of prompts containing public policy questions and opinion texts, classify opinion and consensus valences with a fine-tuned BERT model, and estimate Attack Success Rates (ASR) from $3\\times3$ confusion matrices conditional on matching human majorities. Across topics, default LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, GPT-4.1 Nano, and Apertus 8B exhibit widespread vulnerability, with especially high ASR for economically and socially conservative parties and for rational, instruction-like rhetorical strategies. A robustness pipeline combining GPT-OSS-SafeGuard injection detection, structured opinion representations, and GSPO-based reinforcement learning reduces ASR to near zero across parties and policy clusters when restricting attention to non-ambiguous consensus outcomes. These findings advance our understanding of both the vulnerabilities and the potential defenses of consensus-generating LLMs in digital democracy applications.         ",

Specifically, we consider the task of constructing a rate 1/2 binary linear code such that both it and its dual are asymptotically good (in fact, have rate-distance tradeoff approaching the GV bound), and are encodable in linear time. While we believe such codes should find applications more broadly, as motivation we describe how such codes can be used the secure computation task of encrypted matrix-vector product. Our main contribution is a construction of such a fast good code with fast good dual. Our construction is inspired by the repeat multiple accumulate (RMA) code. To create the rate 1/2 code, after repeating each message coordinate, we perform accumulation steps -- where first a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the prefix-sum mod 2 is applied -- which are alternated with discrete derivative steps -- where again a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the previous two coordinates are summed mod 2. Importantly, these two operations are inverse of each other. In particular, the dual of the code is very similar, with the accumulation and discrete derivative steps reversed. Our analysis is inspired by a prior analysis of RMA: we bound the expected number of codewords of weight below the GV bound. We face new challenges in controlling the behaviour of the discrete derivative operation (which can significantly drop the weight of a vector), which we overcome by careful case analysis.         ",

    "abstract": "           Voice Authentication Systems (VAS) use unique vocal characteristics for verification. They are increasingly integrated into high-security sectors such as banking and healthcare. Despite their improvements using deep learning, they face severe vulnerabilities from sophisticated threats like deepfakes and adversarial attacks. The emergence of realistic voice cloning complicates detection, as systems struggle to distinguish authentic from synthetic audio. While anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs) exist to mitigate these risks, many rely on static detection models that can be bypassed by novel adversarial methods, leaving a critical security gap. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we propose the Spectral Masking and Interpolation Attack (SMIA), a novel method that strategically manipulates inaudible frequency regions of AI-generated audio. By altering the voice in imperceptible zones to the human ear, SMIA creates adversarial samples that sound authentic while deceiving CMs. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our attack against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple tasks, under simulated real-world conditions. SMIA achieved a strong attack success rate (ASR) of at least 82% against combined VAS/CM systems, at least 97.5% against standalone speaker verification systems, and 100% against countermeasures. These findings conclusively demonstrate that current security postures are insufficient against adaptive adversarial attacks. This work highlights the urgent need for a paradigm shift toward next-generation defenses that employ dynamic, context-aware frameworks capable of evolving with the threat landscape.         ",

    "abstract": "           Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD on time series data for specific robotic tasks, however the transferability of an AD approach between different robot control strategies and task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency. We examine three industrial tasks, each presenting several anomalies. Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and multi-modal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are compared, and we evaluate the generalization across different tasks and control methods (diffusion policy-, position-, and impedance-controlled). This allows us to validate the integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC above 0.96 in failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned parts. In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected, while more subtle failures remained undetected.         ",

We introduce ContractEval, a benchmark for evaluating contract-satisfying assertions in code generation, i.e., whether code rejects contract-violating inputs by triggering intended assertions. Built on HumanEval+ and MBPP+, ContractEval augments each task with contract-violation tests derived from reference assertions. We synthesize these via a neuro-symbolic pipeline: an LLM converts assertion clauses into constraints, and an SMT solver enumerates satisfiable violation combinations to generate inputs that violate selected clauses while satisfying the rest. Across five code LLMs, standard prompting yields 0% contract satisfaction, while adding a few contract-violation examples boosts contract satisfaction to 49--53% while maintaining pass@1 by 92% of the original.

For modality coordination, GraphVista introduces a planning agent that decomposes and routes tasks to the most suitable modality-using the text modality for direct access to explicit graph properties and the visual modality for local graph structure reasoning grounded in explicit topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large graphs, up to 200$\\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods, achieving up to 4.4$\\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

Unlike the commonly applied additive (parallel) augmentation structure, the proposed formulation eliminates overlap in representation of the system dynamics, thereby preserving the uniqueness of the estimated physical parameters, ultimately leading to enhanced model interpretability. By theoretical analysis, we show that, under mild conditions, the method is statistically consistent and guarantees recovery of the true physical parameters. With further analysis regarding the asymptotic covariance matrix of the identified parameters, we also prove that the proposed structure provides a clear separation between the physics-based and learning components of the augmentation structure.

Current inter-satellite link (ISL) layouts have rarely been optimized to minimize network diameter while simultaneously satisfying physical and operational constraints, including maximum link distance, line-of-sight, per-satellite hardware limits, and long-term link viability over orbital periods. In this study, the selection and assignment of inter-plane ISLs is formulated as a diameter-minimization problem on a Starlink-inspired Walker-Delta constellation in which each satellite is equipped with two fixed intra-plane links and may activate up to two inter-plane links. Beginning with a feasible baseline, the topology is iteratively refined by a local-search procedure that replaces or reinforces links to shrink the diameter. The resulting ISL configuration meets all geometric and hardware limits, preserves link stability across multiple orbital periods, and yields a sparse, diameter-aware graph with potential for centralized routing capabilities. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves low worst-case latency without compromising ISL stability, and the trade-off between hop count and long-term link stability is empirically measured for guidance of future LEO network deployments.

    "title": "A Lightweight Approach to Detection of AI-Generated Texts Using Stylometric Features",
    "abstract": "           A growing number of AI-generated texts raise serious concerns. Most existing approaches to AI-generated text detection rely on fine-tuning large transformer models or building ensembles, which are computationally expensive and often provide limited generalization across domains. Existing lightweight alternatives achieved significantly lower accuracy on large datasets. We introduce NEULIF, a lightweight approach that achieves best performance in the lightweight detector class, that does not require extensive computational power and provides high detection accuracy. In our approach, a text is first decomposed into stylometric and readability features which are then used for classification by a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Random Forest (RF). Evaluated and tested on the Kaggle AI vs. Human corpus, our models achieve 97% accuracy (~ 0.95 F1) for CNN and 95% accuracy (~ 0.94 F1) for the Random Forest, demonstrating high precision and recall, with ROC-AUC scores of 99.5% and 95%, respectively. The CNN (~ 25 MB) and Random Forest (~ 10.6 MB) models are orders of magnitude smaller than transformer-based ensembles and can be run efficiently on standard CPU devices, without sacrificing accuracy. This study also highlights the potential of such models for broader applications across languages, domains, and streaming contexts, showing that simplicity, when guided by structural insights, can rival complexity in AI-generated content detection.

    "abstract": "           Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) aims to complete missing factual elements along the timeline. Depending on the temporal position of the query, the task is categorized into interpolation and extrapolation. Existing interpolation methods typically embed temporal information into individual facts to complete missing historical knowledge, while extrapolation techniques often leverage sequence models over graph snapshots to identify recurring patterns for future event prediction. These methods face two critical challenges: limited contextual modeling in interpolation and cognitive generalization bias in extrapolation. To address these, we propose a unified method for TKGR, dubbed DynaGen. For interpolation, DynaGen dynamically constructs entity-centric subgraphs and processes them with a synergistic dual-branch GNN encoder to capture evolving structural context. For extrapolation, it applies a conditional diffusion process, which forces the model to learn underlying evolutionary principles rather than just superficial patterns, enhancing its ability to predict unseen future events. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show DynaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance. On average, compared to the second-best models, DynaGen improves the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) score by 2.61 points for interpolation and 1.45 points for extrapolation.         ",

    "abstract": "           Many large language models (LLMs) are trained on a massive body of knowledge present on the Internet. Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database (\"knowledge base\" or \"knowledge graph\"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface. DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software, on an \"as is\" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Users need to be cognizant of the potential risks and benefits of using DV and its outputs, and users are responsible for ensuring any use is safe and effective.

    "abstract": "           Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) recommends interventions during business processes to optimize key performance indicators (KPIs). In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI. The novel semi-synthetic setup, based on a real-life event log, is provided as a reusable benchmark for future work on sequential PresPM.         ",

Although existing methods have extensively explored feature interaction between different modalities, they commonly rely on simple fusion strategies for feature aggregation. This introduces two critical flaws: it is prone to cross-modal noise and disrupts the hierarchical structure of the feature pyramid, thereby impairing the fine-grained detection of small objects. To address this challenge, we propose the Pyramidal Adaptive Cross-Gating Network (PACGNet), an architecture designed to perform deep fusion within the backbone. To this end, we design two core components: the Symmetrical Cross-Gating (SCG) module and the Pyramidal Feature-aware Multimodal Gating (PFMG) module. The SCG module employs a bidirectional, symmetrical \"horizontal\" gating mechanism to selectively absorb complementary information, suppress noise, and preserve the semantic integrity of each modality. The PFMG module reconstructs the feature hierarchy via a progressive hierarchical gating mechanism. This leverages the detailed features from a preceding, higher-resolution level to guide the fusion at the current, lower-resolution level, effectively preserving fine-grained details as features propagate. Through evaluations conducted on the DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets, our PACGNet sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark, with mAP50 scores reaching 82.2% and 82.1% respectively.         ",

Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile. We propose a three-headed quantile network that estimates these weights via finite differences using auxiliary quantile levels at \\(1-\\alpha \\pm \\delta\\), subsequently fine-tuning the central quantile by optimizing the weighted loss. We provide a theoretical analysis with exact non-asymptotic guarantees characterizing the resulting excess risk. Extensive experiments on diverse high-dimensional real-world datasets demonstrate remarkable improvements in conditional coverage performance.         ",

    "abstract": "           We address the Diverse Traveling Salesman Problem (D-TSP), a bi-criteria optimization challenge that seeks a set of $k$ distinct TSP tours. The objective requires every selected tour to have a length at most $c|T^*|$ (where $|T^*|$ is the optimal tour length) while minimizing the average Jaccard similarity across all tour pairs. This formulation is crucial for applications requiring both high solution quality and fault tolerance, such as logistics planning, robotics pathfinding or strategic patrolling. Current methods are limited: traditional heuristics, such as the Niching Memetic Algorithm (NMA) or bi-criteria optimization, incur high computational complexity $O(n^3)$, while modern neural approaches (e.g., RF-MA3S) achieve limited diversity quality and rely on complex, external mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid framework that decomposes D-TSP into two efficient steps. First, we utilize a simple Graph Pointer Network (GPN), augmented with an approximated sequence entropy loss, to efficiently sample a large, diverse pool of high-quality tours. This simple modification effectively controls the quality-diversity trade-off without complex external mechanisms. Second, we apply a greedy algorithm that yields a 2-approximation for the dispersion problem to select the final $k$ maximally diverse tours from the generated pool. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On the Berlin instance, our model achieves an average Jaccard index of $0.015$, significantly outperforming NMA ($0.081$) and RF-MA3S. By leveraging GPU acceleration, our GPN structure achieves a near-linear empirical runtime growth of $O(n)$. While maintaining solution diversity comparable to complex bi-criteria algorithms, our approach is over 360 times faster on large-scale instances (783 cities), delivering high-quality TSP solutions with unprecedented efficiency and simplicity.

Defining complexity and actually measuring it is an ongoing debate and no standard framework has been established that is both theoretically sound and computationally practical to use. Currently, one of the fields which attempts to formally define complexity is in the realm of Algorithmic Information Theory. The field has shown advances by studying the outputs of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional Turing machines to determine the complexity values of binary strings and 2-dimensional binary matrices respectively. Using these complexity values, an algorithm called the Block Decomposition Method developed by Zenil, et al. in 2018, has been created to approximate the complexity of adjacency matrices of graphs which has found relative success in grouping graphs based on their complexity values. We use this method along with another method called edge perturbation to exhaustively determine if an edge can be identified to connect two sub-graphs within a graph using the entire symmetric group of its vertices permutation and via unique permutations we call automorphic subsets, which is a special subset of the symmetric group. We also analyze if edges will be grouped closer to their respective sub-graphs in terms of the average algorithmic information contribution. This analysis has been done in order to ascertain if Algorithmic Information Theory can be a viable theory in understanding substructures within graphs and ultimately as a foundation to create frameworks of measuring and analyzing complexity.

However, existing approaches for ACD, such as deep reinforcement learning (RL), often face difficult exploration in complex networks with large decision/state spaces and thus require an expensive amount of samples. Inspired by the need to learn sample-efficient defense policies, we frame ACD in CAGE Challenge 4 (CAGE-4 / CC4) as a context-based partially observable Markov decision problem and propose a planning-centric defense policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It explicitly models the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in ACD and uses statistical sampling to guide exploration and decision making. We make novel use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to embed observations from the network as attributed graphs, to enable permutation-invariant reasoning over hosts and their relationships. To make our solution practical in complex search spaces, we guide MCTS with learned graph embeddings and priors over graph-edit actions, combining model-free generalization and policy distillation with look-ahead planning. We evaluate the resulting agent on CC4 scenarios involving diverse network structures and adversary behaviors, and show that our search-guided, graph-embedding-based planning improves defense reward and robustness relative to state-of-the-art RL baselines.

Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline.

Accurate mastoidectomy shape prediction from preoperative imaging improves pre-surgical planning, reduces risks, and enhances surgical outcomes. Despite its importance, there are limited deep-learning-based studies regarding this topic due to the challenges of acquiring ground-truth labels. We address this gap by investigating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning models to predict the mastoidectomy region without human annotations.

    "title": "Advanced Multimodal Learning for Seizure Detection and Prediction: Concept, Challenges, and Future Directions",
    "abstract": "           Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, affects over 50 million people worldwide, and poses significant risks, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Conventional unimodal approaches, primarily reliant on electroencephalography (EEG), face several key challenges, including low SNR, nonstationarity, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, portability, and real-time applicability in clinical settings. To address these issues, a comprehensive survey highlights the concept of advanced multimodal learning for epileptic seizure detection and prediction (AMLSDP). The survey presents the evolution of epileptic seizure detection (ESD) and prediction (ESP) technologies across different eras. The survey also explores the core challenges of multimodal and non-EEG-based ESD and ESP. To overcome the key challenges of the multimodal system, the survey introduces the advanced processing strategies for efficient AMLSDP. Furthermore, this survey highlights future directions for researchers and practitioners. We believe this work will advance neurotechnology toward wearable and imaging-based solutions for epilepsy monitoring, serving as a valuable resource for future innovations in this domain.         ",

    "abstract": "           Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have achieved initial success in various tasks by integrating quantum computing and neural networks. However, growing concerns about their reliability and robustness highlight the need for systematic testing. Unfortunately, current testing methods for QNNs remain underdeveloped, with limited practical utility and insufficient empirical evaluation. As an initial effort, we design a set of superposition-targeted coverage criteria to evaluate QNN state exploration embedded in test suites. To characterize the effectiveness, scalability, and robustness of the criteria, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study using benchmark datasets and QNN architectures. We first evaluate their sensitivity to input diversity under multiple data settings, and analyze their correlation with the number of injected faults. We then assess their scalability to increasing circuit scales. The robustness is further studied under practical quantum constraints including insufficient measurement and quantum noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of quantifying test adequacy and the potential applicability to larger-scale circuits and realistic quantum execution, while also revealing some limitations. Finally, we provide insights and recommendations for future QNN testing.         ",

    "title": "Graded String Diagrams for Imprecise Probability and Causal Intervention",
    "abstract": "           We introduce string diagrams for graded symmetric monoidal categories. Our approach includes a definition of graded monoidal theory and the corresponding freely generated syntactic category. Also, we show how an axiomatic presentation for the graded theory may be modularly obtained from one for the grading theory and one for the base category. The Para construction on monoidal actegories is a motivating example for our framework. As a case study, we show how to axiomatise a variant of the graded category ImP, recently introduced by Liell-Cock and Staton to model imprecise probability. This culminates in a representation, as string diagrams with grading wires, of programs with primitives for nondeterministic and probabilistic choices and conditioning.         ",

    "title": "Mapping bipartite networks into multidimensional hyperbolic spaces",
    "abstract": "           Bipartite networks appear in many real-world contexts, linking entities across two distinct sets. They are often analyzed via one-mode projections, but such projections can introduce artificial correlations and inflated clustering, obscuring the true underlying structure. In this paper, we propose a geometric model for bipartite networks that leverages the high levels of bipartite four-cycles as a measure of clustering to place both node types in the same similarity space, where link probabilities decrease with distance. Additionally, we introduce B-Mercator, an algorithm that infers node positions from the bipartite structure. We evaluate its performance on diverse datasets, illustrating how the resulting embeddings improve downstream tasks such as node classification and distance-based link prediction in machine learning. These hyperbolic embeddings also enable the generation of synthetic networks with node features closely resembling real-world ones, thereby safeguarding sensitive information while allowing secure data sharing. In addition, we show how preserving bipartite structure avoids the pitfalls of projection-based techniques, yielding more accurate descriptions and better performance. Our method provides a robust framework for uncovering hidden geometry in complex bipartite systems.         ",
