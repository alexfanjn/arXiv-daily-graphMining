    "abstract": "Detecting faults in steel plates is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of the structures and industrial equipment. Early detection of faults can prevent further damage and costly repairs. This chapter aims at diagnosing and predicting the likelihood of steel plates developing faults using experimental text data. Various machine learning methods such as GWO-based and FDO-based MLP and CMLP are tested to classify steel plates as either faulty or non-faulty. The experiments produced promising results for all models, with similar accuracy and performance. However, the FDO-based MLP and CMLP models consistently achieved the best results, with 100% accuracy in all tested datasets. The other models' outcomes varied from one experiment to another. The findings indicate that models that employed the FDO as a learning algorithm had the potential to achieve higher accuracy with a little longer runtime compared to other algorithms. In conclusion, early detection of faults in steel plates is critical for maintaining safety and reliability, and machine learning techniques can help predict and diagnose these faults accurately. ",

    "abstract": "This research addresses the pressing challenge of enhancing processing times and detection capabilities in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)/drone imagery for global wildfire detection, despite limited datasets. Proposing a Segmented Neural Network (SegNet) selection approach, we focus on reducing feature maps to boost both time resolution and accuracy significantly advancing processing speeds and accuracy in real-time wildfire detection. This paper contributes to increased processing speeds enabling real-time detection capabilities for wildfire, increased detection accuracy of wildfire, and improved detection capabilities of early wildfire, through proposing a new direction for image classification of amorphous objects like fire, water, smoke, etc. Employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, emphasizing on the reduction of irrelevant features vital for deep learning processes, especially in live feed data for fire detection. Amidst the complexity of live feed data in fire detection, our study emphasizes on image feed, highlighting the urgency to enhance real-time processing. Our proposed algorithm combats feature overload through segmentation, addressing challenges arising from diverse features like objects, colors, and textures. Notably, a delicate balance of feature map size and dataset adequacy is pivotal. Several research papers use smaller image sizes, compromising feature richness which necessitating a new approach. We illuminate the critical role of pixel density in retaining essential details, especially for early wildfire detection. By carefully selecting number of filters during training, we underscore the significance of higher pixel density for proper feature selection. The proposed SegNet approach is rigorously evaluated using real-world dataset obtained by a drone flight and compared to state-of-the-art literature. ",

    "abstract": "Health monitoring of remote critical infrastructure is a complex and expensive activity due to the limited infrastructure accessibility. Inspection drones are ubiquitous assets that enhance the reliability of critical infrastructures through improved accessibility. However, due to the harsh operation environment, it is crucial to monitor their health to ensure successful inspection operations. The battery is a key component that determines the overall reliability of the inspection drones and, with an appropriate health management approach, contributes to reliable and robust inspections. In this context, this paper presents a novel hybrid probabilistic approach for battery end-of-discharge (EOD) voltage prediction of Li-Po batteries. The hybridization is achieved in an error-correction configuration, which combines physics-based discharge and probabilistic error-correction models to quantify the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The performance of the hybrid probabilistic methodology was empirically evaluated on a dataset comprising EOD voltage under varying load conditions. The dataset was obtained from real inspection drones operated on different flights, focused on offshore wind turbine inspections. The proposed approach has been tested with different probabilistic methods and demonstrates 14.8% improved performance in probabilistic accuracy compared to the best probabilistic method. In addition, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties provide robust estimations to enhance the diagnosis of battery health-states. ",

In this work, we propose a novel model called BrainODE to achieve continuous modeling of dynamic brain signals using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). By learning latent initial values and neural ODE functions from irregular time series, BrainODE effectively reconstructs brain signals at any time point, mitigating the aforementioned three data challenges of brain signals altogether. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BrainODE and its capability of addressing the three data challenges. ",

Monostatic detection at the base station (BS) is considered. At the BS, we receive two signals: the communication-mode uplink signal to be decoded and the radar-mode signal to be detected. After self-interference cancellation (SIC), inspired by NOMA, successive interference cancellation (SuIC) is a natural strategy at the BS to retrieve both signals. However, the ordering of SuIC, usually based on some measure of channel strength, is not clear as the radar-mode target is unknown. The detection signal suffers a double path-loss making it vulnerable, but the uplink signal to be decoded originates at a user which has much lower power than the BS making it weak as well. Further, the intercell interference from a large network reduces the channel disparity between the two signals. We investigate the impact of both SuIC orders at the BS, i.e., decoding $1^{st}$ or detecting $1^{st}$ and highlight the importance of careful order selection. We find the existence of a threshold target distance before which detecting $1^{st}$ is superior and decoding $2^{nd}$ does not suffer much. After this distance, both decoding $1^{st}$ and detecting $2^{nd}$ is superior. Similarly, a threshold UE power exists after which the optimum SuIC order changes. We consider imperfections in SIC; this helps highlight the vulnerability of the decoding and detection in the setup. ",

Given a set of a constant number of input strings, the problem asks to decide if there exists some subset $\\mathcal X$ of $K$ longest common subsequences whose diversity is no less than a specified threshold $\\Delta$, where we consider two types of diversities of a set $\\mathcal X$ of strings of equal length: the Sum diversity and the Min diversity defined as the sum and the minimum of the pairwise Hamming distance between any two strings in $\\mathcal X$, respectively. We analyze the computational complexity of the respective problems with Sum- and Min-diversity measures, called the Max-Sum and Max-Min Diverse LCSs, respectively, considering both approximation algorithms and parameterized complexity. Our results are summarized as follows. When $K$ is bounded, both problems are polynomial time solvable. In contrast, when $K$ is unbounded, both problems become NP-hard, while Max-Sum Diverse LCSs problem admits a PTAS. Furthermore, we analyze the parameterized complexity of both problems with combinations of parameters $K$ and $r$, where $r$ is the length of the candidate strings to be selected. Importantly, all positive results above are proven in a more general setting, where an input is an edge-labeled directed acyclic graph (DAG) that succinctly represents a set of strings of the same length. Negative results are proven in the setting where an input is explicitly given as a set of strings. The latter results are equipped with an encoding such a set as the longest common subsequences of a specific input string set. ",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Radiologists are tasked with visually scrutinizing large amounts of data produced by 3D volumetric imaging modalities. Small signals can go unnoticed during the 3d search because they are hard to detect in the visual periphery. Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision have led to effective computer-aided detection (CADe) support systems with the potential to mitigate perceptual errors. Approach: Sixteen non-expert observers searched through digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) phantoms and single cross-sectional slices of the DBT phantoms. The 3D/2D searches occurred with and without a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based CADe support system. The model provided observers with bounding boxes superimposed on the image stimuli while they looked for a small microcalcification signal and a large mass signal. Eye gaze positions were recorded and correlated with changes in the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: The CNN-CADe improved the 3D search for the small microcalcification signal (delta AUC = 0.098, p = 0.0002) and the 2D search for the large mass signal (delta AUC = 0.076, p = 0.002). The CNN-CADe benefit in 3D for the small signal was markedly greater than in 2D (delta delta AUC = 0.066, p = 0.035). Analysis of individual differences suggests that those who explored the least with eye movements benefited the most from the CNN-CADe (r = -0.528, p = 0.036). However, for the large signal, the 2D benefit was not significantly greater than the 3D benefit (delta delta AUC = 0.033, p = 0.133). Conclusion: The CNN-CADe brings unique performance benefits to the 3D (vs. 2D) search of small signals by reducing errors caused by the under-exploration of the volumetric data. ",

    "abstract": "A wide range of graph embedding objectives decompose into two components: one that attracts the embeddings of nodes that are perceived as similar, and another that repels embeddings of nodes that are perceived as dissimilar. Because real-world graphs are sparse and the number of dissimilar pairs grows quadratically with the number of nodes, Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) has emerged as a popular and efficient repulsion approach. SGNS repels each node from a sample of dissimilar nodes, as opposed to all dissimilar nodes. In this work, we show that node-wise repulsion is, in aggregate, an approximate re-centering of the node embedding dimensions. Such dimension operations are much more scalable than node operations. The dimension approach, in addition to being more efficient, yields a simpler geometric interpretation of the repulsion. Our result extends findings from the self-supervised learning literature to the skip-gram model, establishing a connection between skip-gram node contrast and dimension regularization. We show that in the limit of large graphs, under mild regularity conditions, the original node repulsion objective converges to optimization with dimension regularization. We use this observation to propose an algorithm augmentation framework that speeds up any existing algorithm, supervised or unsupervised, using SGNS. The framework prioritizes node attraction and replaces SGNS with dimension regularization. We instantiate this generic framework for LINE and node2vec and show that the augmented algorithms preserve downstream performance while dramatically increasing efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "Table detection within document images is a crucial task in document processing, involving the identification and localization of tables. Recent strides in deep learning have substantially improved the accuracy of this task, but it still heavily relies on large labeled datasets for effective training. Several semi-supervised approaches have emerged to overcome this challenge, often employing CNN-based detectors with anchor proposals and post-processing techniques like non-maximal suppression (NMS). However, recent advancements in the field have shifted the focus towards transformer-based techniques, eliminating the need for NMS and emphasizing object queries and attention mechanisms. Previous research has focused on two key areas to improve transformer-based detectors: refining the quality of object queries and optimizing attention mechanisms. However, increasing object queries can introduce redundancy, while adjustments to the attention mechanism can increase complexity. To address these challenges, we introduce a semi-supervised approach employing SAM-DETR, a novel approach for precise alignment between object queries and target features. Our approach demonstrates remarkable reductions in false positives and substantial enhancements in table detection performance, particularly in complex documents characterized by diverse table structures. This work provides more efficient and accurate table detection in semi-supervised settings. ",

Predicting cognitive workload from fNIRS data has taken on a diffuse set of methods. To be applicable in real-world settings, models are needed, which can perform well across different sessions as well as different subjects. However, most existing works assume that training and testing data come from the same subjects and/or cannot generalize well across never-before-seen subjects. Additional challenges imposed by fNIRS data include the high variations in inter-subject fNIRS data and also in intra-subject data collected across different blocks of sessions. To address these issues, we propose an effective method, referred to as the class-aware-block-aware domain adaptation (CABA-DA) which explicitly minimize intra-session variance by viewing different blocks from the same subject same session as different domains. We minimize the intra-class domain discrepancy and maximize the inter-class domain discrepancy accordingly. In addition, we propose an MLPMixer-based model for cognitive load classification. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed model has better performance compared with three different baseline models on three public-available datasets of cognitive workload. Two of them are collected from n-back tasks and one of them is from finger tapping. From our experiments, we also show the proposed contrastive learning method can also improve baseline models we compared with. ",

    "title": "Constrained Decoding for Secure Code Generation",
    "abstract": "Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have been increasingly used by developers to boost productivity, but they often generate vulnerable code. Thus, there is an urgent need to ensure that code generated by Code LLMs is correct and secure. Previous research has primarily focused on generating secure code, overlooking the fact that secure code also needs to be correct. This oversight can lead to a false sense of security. Currently, the community lacks a method to measure actual progress in this area, and we need solutions that address both security and correctness of code generation. This paper introduces a new benchmark, CodeGuard+, along with two new metrics, secure-pass@k and secure@$k_{\\text{pass}}$, to measure Code LLMs' ability to generate both secure and correct code. Using our new evaluation methods, we show that the state-of-the-art defense technique, prefix tuning, may not be as strong as previously believed, since it generates secure code but sacrifices functional correctness. We also demonstrate that different decoding methods significantly affect the security of Code LLMs. Furthermore, we explore a new defense direction: constrained decoding for secure code generation. We propose new constrained decoding techniques to generate code that satisfies security and correctness constraints simultaneously. Our results reveal that constrained decoding is more effective than prefix tuning to improve the security of Code LLMs, without requiring a specialized training dataset. Moreover, constrained decoding can be used together with prefix tuning to further improve the security of Code LLMs. ",

Existing methods are mostly trained on synthetic datasets, which perform poorly in real scenes. In this work, to facilitate the development of real-world HDR video reconstruction, we present Real-HDRV, a large-scale real-world benchmark dataset for HDR video reconstruction, featuring various scenes, diverse motion patterns, and high-quality labels. Specifically, our dataset contains 500 LDRs-HDRs video pairs, comprising about 28,000 LDR frames and 4,000 HDR labels, covering daytime, nighttime, indoor, and outdoor scenes. To our best knowledge, our dataset is the largest real-world HDR video reconstruction dataset. Correspondingly, we propose an end-to-end network for HDR video reconstruction, where a novel two-stage strategy is designed to perform alignment sequentially. Specifically, the first stage performs global alignment with the adaptively estimated global offsets, reducing the difficulty of subsequent alignment. The second stage implicitly performs local alignment in a coarse-to-fine manner at the feature level using the adaptive separable convolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) models trained on our dataset can achieve better performance on real scenes than those trained on synthetic datasets; (2) our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

However, LLMs sometimes generate code that appears plausible but fails to meet the expected requirements or executes incorrectly. This phenomenon of hallucinations in the coding field has not been explored. To advance the community's understanding and research on code hallucinations in LLMs, we propose a definition method for these hallucinations based on execution verification and introduce the concept of code hallucinations for the first time. We categorize code hallucinations into four main types: mapping, naming, resource, and logic hallucinations, each further divided into different subcategories to better understand and address the unique challenges faced by LLMs during code generation. To systematically evaluate code hallucinations, we propose a dynamic detection algorithm for code hallucinations and construct the CodeHalu benchmark, which includes 8,883 samples from 699 tasks, to actively detect hallucination phenomena in LLMs during programming. We tested 16 popular LLMs on this benchmark to evaluate the frequency and nature of their hallucinations during code generation. The findings reveal significant variations in the accuracy and reliability of LLMs in generating code, highlighting the urgent need to improve models and training methods to ensure the functional correctness and safety of automatically generated code. This study not only classifies and quantifies code hallucinations but also provides insights for future improvements in LLM-based code generation research.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been an effective technique for aligning AI systems with human values, with remarkable successes in fine-tuning large-language models recently. Most existing RLHF paradigms make the underlying assumption that human preferences are relatively homogeneous, and can be encoded by a single reward model. In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues due to the inherent heterogeneity in human preferences, as well as their potential strategic behavior in providing feedback. Specifically, we propose two frameworks to address heterogeneous human feedback in principled ways: personalization-based one and aggregation-based one. For the former, we propose two approaches based on representation learning and clustering, respectively, for learning multiple reward models that trades off the bias (due to preference heterogeneity) and variance (due to the use of fewer data for learning each model by personalization). We then establish sample complexity guarantees for both approaches. For the latter, we aim to adhere to the single-model framework, as already deployed in the current RLHF paradigm, by carefully aggregating diverse and truthful preferences from humans. We propose two approaches based on reward and preference aggregation, respectively: the former utilizes both utilitarianism and Leximin approaches to aggregate individual reward models, with sample complexity guarantees; the latter directly aggregates the human feedback in the form of probabilistic opinions. Under the probabilistic-opinion-feedback model, we also develop an approach to handle strategic human labelers who may bias and manipulate the aggregated preferences with untruthful feedback. Based on the ideas in mechanism design, our approach ensures truthful preference reporting, with the induced aggregation rule maximizing social welfare functions. ",

This paper introduces ASAM, a novel methodology that amplifies SAM's performance through adversarial tuning. We harness the potential of natural adversarial examples, inspired by their successful implementation in natural language processing. By utilizing a stable diffusion model, we augment a subset (1%) of the SA-1B dataset, generating adversarial instances that are more representative of natural variations rather than conventional imperceptible perturbations. Our approach maintains the photorealism of adversarial examples and ensures alignment with original mask annotations, thereby preserving the integrity of the segmentation task. The fine-tuned ASAM demonstrates significant improvements across a diverse range of segmentation tasks without necessitating additional data or architectural modifications. The results of our extensive evaluations confirm that ASAM establishes new benchmarks in segmentation tasks, thereby contributing to the advancement of foundational models in computer vision.

While generative AI enables interactive and role-playing storytelling, little is known about how users engage with and perceive the use of AI in social life simulation for non-cognitive skills learning. To this end, we introduced SimuLife++, an interactive platform enabled by a large language model (LLM). The system allows users to act as protagonists, creating stories with one or multiple AI-based characters in diverse social scenarios. In particular, we expanded the Human-AI interaction to a Human-AI-AI collaboration by including a sage agent, who acts as a bystander to provide users with more insightful perspectives on their choices and conversations. Through a within-subject user study, we found that the inclusion of the sage agent significantly enhanced narrative immersion, according to the narrative transportation scale, leading to more messages, particularly in group chats. Participants' interactions with the sage agent were also associated with significantly higher scores in their perceived motivation, self-perceptions, and resilience and coping, indicating positive impacts on non-cognitive skills reflection. Participants' interview results further explained the sage agent's aid in decision-making, solving ethical dilemmas, and problem-solving; on the other hand, they suggested improvements in user control and balanced responses from multiple characters. We provide design implications on the application of generative AI in narrative solutions for non-cognitive skill development in broader social contexts. ",

We focus on the task of conversation entailment, where multi-turn natural language dialogues are the premise, and the transformer model is fine-tuned to predict whether a given hypothesis about the given dialogue is true or false. The adversary would attack the hypothesis to fool the model to make the wrong predictions. We apply synonym-swapping as the attack method.

Although existing methods can learn good embeddings for each factual element in quadruples by integrating temporal information, they often fail to infer the evolution of temporal facts. This is mainly because of (1) insufficiently exploring the internal structure and semantic relationships within individual quadruples and (2) inadequately learning a unified representation of the contextual and temporal correlations among different quadruples. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Transformer-based reasoning model (dubbed ECEformer) for TKG to learn the Evolutionary Chain of Events (ECE). Specifically, we unfold the neighborhood subgraph of an entity node in chronological order, forming an evolutionary chain of events as the input for our model. Subsequently, we utilize a Transformer encoder to learn the embeddings of intra-quadruples for ECE. We then craft a mixed-context reasoning module based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to learn the unified representations of inter-quadruples for ECE while accomplishing temporal knowledge reasoning. In addition, to enhance the timeliness of the events, we devise an additional time prediction task to complete effective temporal information within the learned unified representation.

We focus on their potential for improved generalization, particularly when training data is limited. Despite the notable success of large vision-language models utilizing transformer architectures in various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, the deepfake detection community has still shown some reluctance to adopt pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), especially large ones, as feature extractors. One concern is their perceived excessive capacity, which often demands extensive data, and the resulting suboptimal generalization when training or fine-tuning data is small or less diverse. This contrasts poorly with ConvNets, which have already established themselves as robust feature extractors. Additionally, training and optimizing transformers from scratch requires significant computational resources, making this accessible primarily to large companies and hindering broader investigation within the academic community. Recent advancements in using self-supervised learning (SSL) in transformers, such as DINO and its derivatives, have showcased significant adaptability across diverse vision tasks and possess explicit semantic segmentation capabilities. By leveraging DINO for deepfake detection with modest training data and implementing partial fine-tuning, we observe comparable adaptability to the task and the natural explainability of the detection result via the attention mechanism. Moreover, partial fine-tuning of transformers for deepfake detection offers a more resource-efficient alternative, requiring significantly fewer computational resources. ",

In this paper, we propose an innovative TKGE method (PTBox) via polynomial decomposition-based temporal representation and box embedding-based entity representation to tackle the above-mentioned problems. Specifically, we decompose time information by polynomials and then enhance the model's capability to represent arbitrary timestamps flexibly by incorporating the learnable temporal basis tensor. In addition, we model every entity as a hyperrectangle box and define each relation as a transformation on the head and tail entity boxes. The entity boxes can capture complex geometric structures and learn robust representations, improving the model's inductive capability for rich inference patterns. Theoretically, our PTBox can encode arbitrary time information or even unseen timestamps while capturing rich inference patterns and higher-arity relations of the knowledge base.

Specifically, our scheme achieves at most 46.9% higher normalized spectral efficiency than the baselines when the user is moving at 5 m/s, demonstrating the potential of liquid neural networks to enhance mmWave mobile communication performance.

    "title": "Certified Adversarial Robustness of Machine Learning-based Malware  Detectors via (De)Randomized Smoothing",
    "abstract": "Deep learning-based malware detection systems are vulnerable to adversarial EXEmples - carefully-crafted malicious programs that evade detection with minimal perturbation. As such, the community is dedicating effort to develop mechanisms to defend against adversarial EXEmples. However, current randomized smoothing-based defenses are still vulnerable to attacks that inject blocks of adversarial content. In this paper, we introduce a certifiable defense against patch attacks that guarantees, for a given executable and an adversarial patch size, no adversarial EXEmple exist. Our method is inspired by (de)randomized smoothing which provides deterministic robustness certificates. During training, a base classifier is trained using subsets of continguous bytes. At inference time, our defense splits the executable into non-overlapping chunks, classifies each chunk independently, and computes the final prediction through majority voting to minimize the influence of injected content. Furthermore, we introduce a preprocessing step that fixes the size of the sections and headers to a multiple of the chunk size. As a consequence, the injected content is confined to an integer number of chunks without tampering the other chunks containing the real bytes of the input examples, allowing us to extend our certified robustness guarantees to content insertion attacks. We perform an extensive ablation study, by comparing our defense with randomized smoothing-based defenses against a plethora of content manipulation attacks and neural network architectures. Results show that our method exhibits unmatched robustness against strong content-insertion attacks, outperforming randomized smoothing-based defenses in the literature. ",

Nowadays, large unlabeled datasets can be collected for many research tasks, including text recognition, but it is costly to annotate them. Therefore, methods utilizing unlabeled data are researched. We study self-supervised pre-training methods based on masked label prediction using three different approaches -- Feature Quantization, VQ-VAE, and Post-Quantized AE. We also investigate joint-embedding approaches with VICReg and NT-Xent objectives, for which we propose an image shifting technique to prevent model collapse where it relies solely on positional encoding while completely ignoring the input image. We perform our experiments on historical handwritten (Bentham) and historical printed datasets mainly to investigate the benefits of the self-supervised pre-training techniques with different amounts of annotated target domain data. We use transfer learning as strong baselines. The evaluation shows that the self-supervised pre-training on data from the target domain is very effective, but it struggles to outperform transfer learning from closely related domains. This paper is one of the first researches exploring self-supervised pre-training in document text recognition, and we believe that it will become a cornerstone for future research in this area.

    "abstract": "With the development of the open source community, the code is often copied, spread, and evolved in multiple software systems, which brings uncertainty and risk to the software system (e.g., bug propagation and copyright infringement). Therefore, it is important to conduct code clone detection to discover similar code pairs. Many approaches have been proposed to detect code clones where token-based tools can scale to big code. However, due to the lack of program details, they cannot handle more complicated code clones, i.e., semantic code clones. In this paper, we introduce CC2Vec, a novel code encoding method designed to swiftly identify simple code clones while also enhancing the capability for semantic code clone detection. To retain the program details between tokens, CC2Vec divides them into different categories (i.e., typed tokens) according to the syntactic types and then applies two self-attention mechanism layers to encode them. To resist changes in the code structure of semantic code clones, CC2Vec performs contrastive learning to reduce the differences introduced by different code implementations. We evaluate CC2Vec on two widely used datasets (i.e., BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam) and the results report that our method can effectively detect simple code clones. In addition, CC2Vec not only attains comparable performance to widely used semantic code clone detection systems such as ASTNN, SCDetector, and FCCA by simply fine-tuning, but also significantly surpasses these methods in both detection efficiency.

Depending on the variant forbidden subgraphs denote certain subsets of $t$-regular complete partite subgraphs of $G$. A graph is complete partite if there exists a partition of its vertex set such that every pair of vertices from different sets is connected by an edge and vertices from the same set form an independent set. A clique $K_t$ and a bipartite clique $K_{t,t}$ are examples of complete partite graphs. These problems are natural generalizations of the triangle-free and square-free $2$-matching problems in subcubic graphs. In the weighted setting we assume that the weights of edges of $G$ are vertex-induced on every forbidden subgraph. We present simple and fast combinatorial algorithms for these problems. The presented algorithms are the first ones for the weighted versions, and for the unweighted ones, are faster than those known previously. Our approach relies on the use of gadgets with so-called half-edges. A half-edge of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing exactly one of its endpoints. ",

    "abstract": "Prediction of road users' behaviors in the context of autonomous driving has gained considerable attention by the scientific community in the last years. Most works focus on predicting behaviors based on kinematic information alone, a simplification of the reality since road users are humans, and as such they are highly influenced by their surrounding context. In addition, a large plethora of research works rely on powerful Deep Learning techniques, which exhibit high performance metrics in prediction tasks but may lack the ability to fully understand and exploit the contextual semantic information contained in the road scene, not to mention their inability to provide explainable predictions that can be understood by humans. In this work, we propose an explainable road users' behavior prediction system that integrates the reasoning abilities of Knowledge Graphs (KG) and the expressiveness capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) by using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. For that purpose, Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) and Bayesian inference are combined to allow the deployment of a fully inductive reasoning system that enables the issuing of predictions that rely on legacy information contained in the graph as well as on current evidence gathered in real time by onboard sensors. Two use cases have been implemented following the proposed approach: 1) Prediction of pedestrians' crossing actions; 2) Prediction of lane change maneuvers. In both cases, the performance attained surpasses the current state of the art in terms of anticipation and F1-score, showing a promising avenue for future research in this field. ",

    "abstract": "As deep generative models advance, we anticipate deepfakes achieving \"perfection\"-generating no discernible artifacts or noise. However, current deepfake detectors, intentionally or inadvertently, rely on such artifacts for detection, as they are exclusive to deepfakes and absent in genuine examples. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Rebalanced Deepfake Detection Protocol (RDDP) to stress-test detectors under balanced scenarios where genuine and forged examples bear similar artifacts. We offer two RDDP variants: RDDP-WHITEHAT uses white-hat deepfake algorithms to create 'self-deepfakes,' genuine portrait videos with the resemblance of the underlying identity, yet carry similar artifacts to deepfake videos; RDDP-SURROGATE employs surrogate functions (e.g., Gaussian noise) to process both genuine and forged examples, introducing equivalent noise, thereby sidestepping the need of deepfake algorithms. Towards detecting perfect deepfake videos that aligns with genuine ones, we present ID-Miner, a detector that identifies the puppeteer behind the disguise by focusing on motion over artifacts or appearances. As an identity-based detector, it authenticates videos by comparing them with reference footage. Equipped with the artifact-agnostic loss at frame-level and the identity-anchored loss at video-level, ID-Miner effectively singles out identity signals amidst distracting variations. Extensive experiments comparing ID-Miner with 12 baseline detectors under both conventional and RDDP evaluations with two deepfake datasets, along with additional qualitative studies, affirm the superiority of our method and the necessity for detectors designed to counter perfect deepfakes.

This inexplicable nature can be frustrating to teachers and students when trying to interpret, or learn from an automatically-generated grade. To create a powerful yet intelligible ASAG model, we experiment with a type of model called a Neural Additive Model that combines the performance of a NN with the explainability of an additive model. We use a Knowledge Integration (KI) framework from the learning sciences to guide feature engineering to create inputs that reflect whether a student includes certain ideas in their response. We hypothesize that indicating the inclusion (or exclusion) of predefined ideas as features will be sufficient for the NAM to have good predictive power and interpretability, as this may guide a human scorer using a KI rubric. We compare the performance of the NAM with another explainable model, logistic regression, using the same features, and to a non-explainable neural model, DeBERTa, that does not require feature engineering.

    "abstract": "The success of machine learning (ML) has been intimately linked with the availability of large amounts of data, typically collected from heterogeneous sources and processed on vast networks of computing devices (also called {\\em workers}). Beyond accuracy, the use of ML in critical domains such as healthcare and autonomous driving calls for robustness against {\\em data poisoning}and some {\\em faulty workers}. The problem of {\\em Byzantine ML} formalizes these robustness issues by considering a distributed ML environment in which workers (storing a portion of the global dataset) can deviate arbitrarily from the prescribed algorithm. Although the problem has attracted a lot of attention from a theoretical point of view, its practical importance for addressing realistic faults (where the behavior of any worker is locally constrained) remains unclear. It has been argued that the seemingly weaker threat model where only workers' local datasets get poisoned is more reasonable. We prove that, while tolerating a wider range of faulty behaviors, Byzantine ML yields solutions that are, in a precise sense, optimal even under the weaker data poisoning threat model. Then, we study a generic data poisoning model wherein some workers have {\\em fully-poisonous local data}, i.e., their datasets are entirely corruptible, and the remainders have {\\em partially-poisonous local data}, i.e., only a fraction of their local datasets is corruptible. We prove that Byzantine-robust schemes yield optimal solutions against both these forms of data poisoning, and that the former is more harmful when workers have {\\em heterogeneous} local data. ",

Previous research has demonstrated that they are vulnerable to the denial-of-service attack (DoS attack). For instance, the JNI global reference (JGR), which is widely used by system services, can be exhausted to cause the system reboot (hence the name JGRE attack). Even though the Android team tries to fix the problem by enforcing security checks, we find that it is still possible to construct a JGR exhaustion DoS attack in the latest Android system. In this paper, we propose a new JGR exhaustion DoS attack, which is effective in different Android versions, including the latest one (i.e., Android 10). Specifically, we developed JGREAnalyzer, a tool that can systematically detect JGR vulnerable services APIs via a call graph analysis and a forwarding reachability analysis. We applied this tool to different Android versions and found multiple vulnerabilities. In particular, among 148 system services in Android 10, 12 of them have 21 vulnerabilities. Among them, 9 can be successfully exploited without any permissions. We further analyze the root cause of the vulnerabilities and propose a new defense to mitigate the JGRE attack by restricting resource consumption via global reference counting. ",

Compared to NL2SQL, NL2BI introduces more challenges. In this paper, we propose ChatBI, a comprehensive and efficient technology for solving the NL2BI task. First, we analyze the interaction mode, an important module where NL2SQL and NL2BI differ in use, and design a smaller and cheaper model to match this interaction mode. In BI scenarios, tables contain a huge number of columns, making it impossible for existing NL2SQL methods that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for schema linking to proceed due to token limitations. The higher proportion of ambiguous columns in BI scenarios also makes schema linking difficult. ChatBI combines existing view technology in the database community to first decompose the schema linking problem into a Single View Selection problem and then uses a smaller and cheaper machine learning model to select the single view with a significantly reduced number of columns. The columns of this single view are then passed as the required columns for schema linking into the LLM. Finally, ChatBI proposes a phased process flow different from existing process flows, which allows ChatBI to generate SQL containing complex semantics and comparison relations more accurately. We have deployed ChatBI on Baidu's data platform and integrated it into multiple product lines for large-scale production task evaluation. The obtained results highlight its superiority in practicality, versatility, and efficiency. At the same time, compared with the current mainstream NL2SQL technology under our real BI scenario data tables and queries, it also achieved the best results. ",

We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.

    "abstract": "Regional traffic forecasting is a critical challenge in urban mobility, with applications to various fields such as the Internet of Everything. In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in the context of numerous traffic forecasting challenges. This work aims at expanding upon the conventional spatio-temporal graph neural network architectures in a manner that may facilitate the inclusion of information regarding the examined regions, as well as the populations that traverse them, in order to establish a more efficient prediction model. The end-product of this scientific endeavour is a novel spatio-temporal graph neural network architecture that is referred to as WEST (WEighted STacked) GCN-LSTM. Furthermore, the inclusion of the aforementioned information is conducted via the use of two novel dedicated algorithms that are referred to as the Shared Borders Policy and the Adjustable Hops Policy. Through information fusion and distillation, the proposed solution manages to significantly outperform its competitors in the frame of an experimental evaluation that consists of 19 forecasting models, across several datasets. Finally, an additional ablation study determined that each of the components of the proposed solution contributes towards enhancing its overall performance. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a popular tool for modelling functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. Many recent studies have reported significant improvements in disorder classification performance via more sophisticated GNN designs and highlighted salient features that could be potential biomarkers of the disorder. In this review, we provide an overview of how GNN and model explainability techniques have been applied on fMRI datasets for disorder prediction tasks, with a particular emphasis on the robustness of biomarkers produced for neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. We found that while most studies have performant models, salient features highlighted in these studies vary greatly across studies on the same disorder and little has been done to evaluate their robustness. To address these issues, we suggest establishing new standards that are based on objective evaluation metrics to determine the robustness of these potential biomarkers. We further highlight gaps in the existing literature and put together a prediction-attribution-evaluation framework that could set the foundations for future research on improving the robustness of potential biomarkers discovered via GNNs.

URR is a novel solution to the problem of JavaScript bundles, where websites pre-compile multiple code units into a single file, making it impossible for content filters and ad-blockers to differentiate between desired and unwanted resources. Where traditional content filtering tools rely on URLs, URR analyzes the code at the AST level, and replaces harmful AST sub-trees with privacy-and-functionality maintaining alternatives. We present an open-sourced implementation of URR as a Firefox extension, and evaluate it against JavaScript bundles generated by the most popular bundling system (Webpack) deployed on the Tranco 10k. We measure the performance, measured by precision (1.00), recall (0.95), and speed (0.43s per-script) when detecting and rewriting three representative privacy harming libraries often included in JavaScript bundles, and find URR to be an effective approach to a large-and-growing blind spot unaddressed by current privacy tools.

Nowadays, self-supervised representation learning models are increasingly utilized in content extraction.

To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for expressive voice conversion called \"SAVC\" based on soft speech units from HuBert-soft. Taking soft speech units as input, we design an attribute encoder to extract content and prosody features respectively. Specifically, we first introduce statistic perturbation imposed by adversarial style augmentation to eliminate speaker information. Then the prosody is implicitly modeled on soft speech units with knowledge distillation. Experiment results show that the intelligibility and naturalness of converted speech outperform previous work.

When the data corruption is not distributed uniformly over subpopulations, our algorithms provide more meaningful robustness guarantees than standard guarantees that are oblivious to how the data corruption and the affected subpopulations are related.

Recent advances in language models have expanded the horizons of artificial intelligence across various domains, sparking inquiries into their potential for causal reasoning. In this work, we introduce Causal evaluation of Language Models (CaLM), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the causal reasoning capabilities of language models. First, we propose the CaLM framework, which establishes a foundational taxonomy consisting of four modules: causal target (i.e., what to evaluate), adaptation (i.e., how to obtain the results), metric (i.e., how to measure the results), and error (i.e., how to analyze the bad results). This taxonomy defines a broad evaluation design space while systematically selecting criteria and priorities. Second, we compose the CaLM dataset, comprising 126,334 data samples, to provide curated sets of causal targets, adaptations, metrics, and errors, offering extensive coverage for diverse research pursuits. Third, we conduct an extensive evaluation of 28 leading language models on a core set of 92 causal targets, 9 adaptations, 7 metrics, and 12 error types. Fourth, we perform detailed analyses of the evaluation results across various dimensions (e.g., adaptation, scale). Fifth, we present 50 high-level empirical findings across 9 dimensions (e.g., model), providing valuable guidance for future language model development. Finally, we develop a multifaceted platform, including a website, leaderboards, datasets, and toolkits, to support scalable and adaptable assessments. We envision CaLM as an ever-evolving benchmark for the community, systematically updated with new causal targets, adaptations, models, metrics, and error types to reflect ongoing research advancements.

A key challenge within NeRF is the editing of reconstructed scenes, such as object removal, which requires maintaining consistency across multiple views and ensuring high-quality synthesised perspectives. Previous studies have incorporated depth priors, typically from LiDAR or sparse depth measurements provided by COLMAP, to improve the performance of object removal in NeRF. However, these methods are either costly or time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates monocular depth estimates with NeRF-based object removal models to significantly reduce time consumption and enhance the robustness and quality of scene generation and object removal. We conducted a thorough evaluation of COLMAP's dense depth reconstruction on the KITTI dataset to verify its accuracy in depth map generation. Our findings suggest that COLMAP can serve as an effective alternative to a ground truth depth map where such information is missing or costly to obtain. Additionally, we integrated various monocular depth estimation methods into the removal NeRF model, i.e., SpinNeRF, to assess their capacity to improve object removal performance. Our experimental results highlight the potential of monocular depth estimation to substantially improve NeRF applications. ",

One popular approach for OOD detection is outlier exposure, where models are trained using a mixture of in-distribution (ID) samples and ``seen\" OOD samples. For the OOD samples, the model is trained to minimize the KL divergence between the output probability and the uniform distribution while correctly classifying the in-distribution (ID) data. In this paper, we propose a label-mixup approach to generate synthetic OOD data using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). Additionally, we explore recent advancements in metric learning to train our models. In the experiments, we found that metric learning-based loss functions perform better than the softmax. Furthermore, the baseline models (including softmax, and metric learning) show a significant improvement when trained with the generated OOD data. Our approach outperforms strong baselines in conventional OOD detection metrics. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting, as a novel 3D representation, has garnered attention for its fast rendering speed and high rendering quality. However, this comes with high memory consumption, e.g., a well-trained Gaussian field may utilize three million Gaussian primitives and over 700 MB of memory. We credit this high memory footprint to the lack of consideration for the relationship between primitives. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient Gaussian field named SUNDAE with spectral pruning and neural compensation. On one hand, we construct a graph on the set of Gaussian primitives to model their relationship and design a spectral down-sampling module to prune out primitives while preserving desired signals. On the other hand, to compensate for the quality loss of pruning Gaussians, we exploit a lightweight neural network head to mix splatted features, which effectively compensates for quality losses while capturing the relationship between primitives in its weights. We demonstrate the performance of SUNDAE with extensive results. For example, SUNDAE can achieve 26.80 PSNR at 145 FPS using 104 MB memory while the vanilla Gaussian splatting algorithm achieves 25.60 PSNR at 160 FPS using 523 MB memory, on the Mip-NeRF360 dataset.

    "abstract": "Fault-tolerant quantum computation relies on the assumption of time-invariant, sufficiently low physical error rates. However, current superconducting quantum computers suffer from frequent disruptive noise events, including cosmic ray impacts and shifting two-level system defects. Several methods have been proposed to mitigate these issues in software, but they add large overheads in terms of physical qubit count, as it is difficult to preserve logical information through burst error events. We focus on mitigating multi-qubit burst errors in magic state factories, which are expected to comprise up to 95% of the space cost of future quantum programs. Our key insight is that magic state factories do not need to preserve logical information over time; once we detect an increase in local physical error rates, we can simply turn off parts of the factory that are affected, re-map the factory to the new chip geometry, and continue operating. This is much more efficient than previous more general methods, and is resilient even under many simultaneous impact events. Using precise physical noise models, we show an efficient ray detection method and evaluate our strategy in different noise regimes. Compared to existing baselines, we find reductions in ray-induced overheads by several orders of magnitude, reducing total qubitcycle cost by geomean 6.5x to 13.9x depending on the noise model. This work reduces the burden on hardware by providing low-overhead software mitigation of these errors. ",

    "title": "Optimized Distribution of Entanglement Graph States in Quantum Networks",
    "abstract": "Building large-scale quantum computers, essential to demonstrating quantum advantage, is a key challenge. Quantum Networks (QNs) can help address this challenge by enabling the construction of large, robust, and more capable quantum computing platforms by connecting smaller quantum computers. Moreover, unlike classical systems, QNs can enable fully secured long-distance communication. Thus, quantum networks lie at the heart of the success of future quantum information technologies. In quantum networks, multipartite entangled states distributed over the network help implement and support many quantum network applications for communications, sensing, and computing. Our work focuses on developing optimal techniques to generate and distribute multipartite entanglement states efficiently. Prior works on generating general multipartite entanglement states have focused on the objective of minimizing the number of maximally entangled pairs (EPs) while ignoring the heterogeneity of the network nodes and links as well as the stochastic nature of underlying processes. In this work, we develop a hypergraph based linear programming framework that delivers optimal (under certain assumptions) generation schemes for general multipartite entanglement represented by graph states, under the network resources, decoherence, and fidelity constraints, while considering the stochasticity of the underlying processes. We illustrate our technique by developing generation schemes for the special cases of path and tree graph states, and discuss optimized generation schemes for more general classes of graph states. Using extensive simulations over a quantum network simulator (NetSquid), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed techniques and show that they outperform prior known schemes by up to orders of magnitude.

    "title": "Hybrid Quantum-Classical Scheduling for Accelerating Neural Network  Training with Newton's Gradient Descent",
    "abstract": "Optimization techniques in deep learning are predominantly led by first-order gradient methodologies, such as SGD. However, neural network training can greatly benefit from the rapid convergence characteristics of second-order optimization. Newton's GD stands out in this category, by rescaling the gradient using the inverse Hessian. Nevertheless, one of its major bottlenecks is matrix inversion, which is notably time-consuming in $O(N^3)$ time with weak scalability. Matrix inversion can be translated into solving a series of linear equations. Given that quantum linear solver algorithms (QLSAs), leveraging the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement, can operate within a $\\text{polylog}(N)$ time frame, they present a promising approach with exponential acceleration. Specifically, one of the most recent QLSAs demonstrates a complexity scaling of $O(d\\cdot\\kappa \\log(N\\cdot\\kappa/\\epsilon))$, depending on: {size~$N$, condition number~$\\kappa$, error tolerance~$\\epsilon$, quantum oracle sparsity~$d$} of the matrix. However, this also implies that their potential exponential advantage may be hindered by certain properties (i.e. $\\kappa$ and $d$). We propose Q-Newton, a hybrid quantum-classical scheduler for accelerating neural network training with Newton's GD. Q-Newton utilizes a streamlined scheduling module that coordinates between quantum and classical linear solvers, by estimating & reducing $\\kappa$ and constructing $d$ for the quantum solver. Our evaluation showcases the potential for Q-Newton to significantly reduce the total training time compared to commonly used optimizers like SGD. We hypothesize a future scenario where the gate time of quantum machines is reduced, possibly realized by attoseconds physics. Our evaluation establishes an ambitious and promising target for the evolution of quantum computing. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has made important contributions to the development of medical image segmentation. Convolutional neural networks, as a crucial branch, have attracted strong attention from researchers. Through the tireless efforts of numerous researchers, convolutional neural networks have yielded numerous outstanding algorithms for processing medical images. The ideas and architectures of these algorithms have also provided important inspiration for the development of later technologies.Through extensive experimentation, we have found that currently mainstream deep learning algorithms are not always able to achieve ideal results when processing complex datasets and different types of datasets. These networks still have room for improvement in lesion localization and feature extraction. Therefore, we have created the Dense Multiscale Attention and Depth-Supervised Network (DmADs-Net).We use ResNet for feature extraction at different depths and create a Multi-scale Convolutional Feature Attention Block to improve the network's attention to weak feature information. The Local Feature Attention Block is created to enable enhanced local feature attention for high-level semantic information. In addition, in the feature fusion phase, a Feature Refinement and Fusion Block is created to enhance the fusion of different semantic information.We validated the performance of the network using five datasets of varying sizes and types. Results from comparative experiments show that DmADs-Net outperformed mainstream networks. Ablation experiments further demonstrated the effectiveness of the created modules and the rationality of the network architecture. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce Multivariate Multiscale Graph-based Dispersion Entropy (mvDEG), a novel, computationally efficient method for analyzing multivariate time series data in graph and complex network frameworks, and demonstrate its application in real-world data. mvDEG effectively combines temporal dynamics with topological relationships, offering enhanced analysis compared to traditional nonlinear entropy methods. Its efficacy is established through testing on synthetic signals, such as uncorrelated and correlated noise, showcasing its adeptness in discerning various levels of dependency and complexity. The robustness of mvDEG is further validated with real-world datasets, effectively differentiating various two-phase flow regimes and capturing distinct dynamics in weather data analysis. An important advancement of mvDEG is its computational efficiency. Our optimized algorithm displays a computational time that grows linearly with the number of vertices or nodes, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in classical methods. This efficiency is achieved through refined matrix power calculations that exploit matrix and Kronecker product properties, making our method faster than the state of the art. The significant acceleration in computational time positions mvDEG as a transformative tool for extensive and real-time applications, setting a new benchmark in the analysis of time series recorded at distributed locations and opening avenues for innovative applications.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection in the face of network perturbations, specifically edge deletions. Graph embedding techniques, which represent nodes as low-dimensional vectors, are widely used for various graph machine learning tasks due to their ability to capture structural properties of networks effectively. However, the impact of perturbations on the performance of these methods remains relatively understudied. The research considers state-of-the-art graph embedding methods from two families: matrix factorization (e.g., LE, LLE, HOPE, M-NMF) and random walk-based (e.g., DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec). Through experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks, the study reveals varying degrees of robustness within each family of graph embedding methods. The robustness is found to be influenced by factors such as network size, initial community partition strength, and the type of perturbation. Notably, node2vec and LLE consistently demonstrate higher robustness for community detection across different scenarios, including networks with degree and community size heterogeneity. These findings highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate graph embedding method based on the specific characteristics of the network and the task at hand, particularly in scenarios where robustness to perturbations is crucial.
