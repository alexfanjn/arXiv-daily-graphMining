    "abstract": "Understanding how images influence the world, interpreting which effects their semantics have on various quantities and exploring the reasons behind changes in image-based predictions are highly difficult yet extremely interesting problems. By adopting a holistic modeling approach utilizing Neural Additive Models in combination with Diffusion Autoencoders, we can effectively identify the latent hidden semantics of image effects and achieve full intelligibility of additional tabular effects. Our approach offers a high degree of flexibility, empowering us to comprehensively explore the impact of various image characteristics. We demonstrate that the proposed method can precisely identify complex image effects in an ablation study. To further showcase the practical applicability of our proposed model, we conduct a case study in which we investigate how the distinctive features and attributes captured within host images exert influence on the pricing of Airbnb rentals.

    "abstract": "Perspective distortion (PD) causes unprecedented changes in shape, size, orientation, angles, and other spatial relationships of visual concepts in images. Precisely estimating camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is a challenging task that prevents synthesizing perspective distortion. Non-availability of dedicated training data poses a critical barrier to developing robust computer vision methods. Additionally, distortion correction methods make other computer vision tasks a multi-step approach and lack performance. In this work, we propose mitigating perspective distortion (MPD) by employing a fine-grained parameter control on a specific family of M\\\"obius transform to model real-world distortion without estimating camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and without the need for actual distorted data. Also, we present a dedicated perspectively distorted benchmark dataset, ImageNet-PD, to benchmark the robustness of deep learning models against this new dataset. The proposed method outperforms on existing benchmarks, ImageNet-E and ImageNet-X. Additionally, it significantly improves performance on ImageNet-PD while consistently performing on standard data distribution. Further, our method shows improved performance on three PD-affected real-world applications: crowd counting, fisheye image recognition, and person re-identification. We will release source code, dataset, and models for foster further research. ",

    "abstract": "The expanding applications, utilized by more users, enhance hardware performance and further develop cloud systems for big data processing. This leads to numerous unexplored deep learning applications, especially in advanced computer vision for object recognition. Deep learning in image processing encompasses varied tasks from recognizing elements with diverse shapes and sizes to complex element classification, coping with varying backgrounds and lighting conditions, and text recognition. Its advantages lie in robust setup and high performance for recognizing complex elements. This work aims to develop a deep learning-based detection system for automated recognition of assembly components differing in geometry, size, contour, or color. Implementing the YOLOv4 algorithm, the system detects components based on their characteristics. Testing with 13 components involves capturing them in different orientations, numbers, individual parts, or assembled groups using a Raspberry Pi microcontroller and camera. Evaluation focuses on correct object recognition, confidence values, different compositions, distances between objects, and environmental factors affecting system quality. Results show positive object recognition across all scenarios, irrespective of orientation or number of objects. Even densely packed objects are correctly recognized with high confidence (97-100%). Lighting conditions don't significantly impact results, and all objects are properly labeled. The developed system is suitable for real-time two-dimensional component detection, with potential for extension to three-dimensional analysis using multiple cameras with varied positioning and views.

Our approach centers around a learning-based controller using Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) on physical plants.

This design replicates control signals from a cloud-based controller directly on the plant, reducing the need for constant plant-cloud communication. The plant updates weights only when errors surpass predefined thresholds, ensuring efficiency and robustness in various conditions. Applied to linear workbench systems and satellite rendezvous scenarios, including obstacle avoidance, our architecture dramatically lowers normalized tracking error by 96% with increased network size. The event-driven nature of SNNs minimizes energy consumption, utilizing only about 111 nJ (0.3% of conventional computing requirements). The results demonstrate the system's adjustment to changing work environments and its efficient use of computational and energy resources, with a moderate increase in energy consumption of 27.2% and 37% for static and dynamic obstacles, respectively, compared to non-obstacle scenarios.

Automatically detecting logical fallacies has important applications in tracking misinformation and validating claims. In this paper, we design a process to reliably detect logical fallacies by translating natural language to First-order Logic (FOL) step-by-step using Large Language Models (LLMs). We then utilize Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers to reason about the validity of the formula and classify inputs as either a fallacy or valid statement. Our model also provides a novel means of utilizing LLMs to interpret the output of the SMT solver, offering insights into the counter-examples that illustrate why a given sentence is considered a logical fallacy. Our approach is robust, interpretable and does not require training data or fine-tuning. We evaluate our model on a mixed dataset of fallacies and valid sentences. The results demonstrate improved performance compared to end-to-end LLMs, with our classifier achieving an F1-score of 71\\% on the Logic dataset. The approach is able to generalize effectively, achieving an F1-score of 73% on the challenge set, LogicClimate, outperforming state-of-the-art models by 21% despite its much smaller size. ",

In contrast, machine intelligence is only adaptive and goal directed at a high level. Learned policies are passively interpreted using abstractions (e.g. arithmetic) embodied in static interpreters (e.g. x86). Biological intelligence excels at causal learning. Machine intelligence does not. Previous work showed causal learning follows from weak policy optimisation, which is hindered by presupposed abstractions in silico. Here we formalise MCAs as nested \"agentic abstraction layers\", to understand how they might learn causes. We show that weak policy optimisation at low levels enables weak policy optimisation at high. This facilitates what we call \"multiscale causal learning\" and high level goal directed behaviour. We argue that by engineering human abstractions in silico we disconnect high level goal directed behaviour from the low level goal directed behaviour that gave rise to it. This inhibits causal learning, and we speculate this is one reason why human recall would be accompanied by feeling, and in silico recall not. ",

Traditional causal discovery methods often suffer from issues related to missing data To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach called CausalDisco that formulates causal discovery as a knowledge graph completion problem. More specifically, the task of discovering causal relations is mapped to the task of knowledge graph link prediction. CausalDisco supports two types of discovery: causal explanation and causal prediction. The causal relations have weights representing the strength of the causal association between entities in the knowledge graph. An evaluation of this approach uses a benchmark dataset of simulated videos for causal reasoning, CLEVRER-Humans, and compares the performance of multiple knowledge graph embedding algorithms. In addition, two distinct dataset splitting approaches are utilized within the evaluation: (1) random-based split, which is the method typically used to evaluate link prediction algorithms, and (2) Markov-based split, a novel data split technique for evaluating link prediction that utilizes the Markovian property of the causal relation. Results show that using weighted causal relations improves causal discovery over the baseline without weighted relations. ",

In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing a novel privacy accounting method for the sparsified Gaussian mechanism that incorporates the randomness inherent in sparsification into the DP noise. Unlike previous approaches, our accounting algorithm directly operates in $L_2$ geometry, yielding MSEs that fast converge to those of the uncompressed Gaussian mechanism. Additionally, we extend the sparsification scheme to the matrix factorization framework under streaming DP and provide a precise accountant tailored for DP-FTRL type optimizers. Empirically, our method demonstrates at least a 100x improvement of compression for DP-SGD across various FL tasks. ",

However, most of the existing methods have limitations in identifying nonlinear lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs), and it remains a huge challenge to predict new LDAs. Therefore, the accurate identification of LDAs is very important for the warning and treatment of diseases. In this work, multiple sources of biomedical data are fully utilized to construct characteristics of lncRNAs and diseases, and linear and nonlinear characteristics are effectively integrated. Furthermore, a novel deep learning model based on graph attention automatic encoder is proposed, called HGATELDA. To begin with, the linear characteristics of lncRNAs and diseases are created by the miRNA-lncRNA interaction matrix and miRNA-disease interaction matrix. Following this, the nonlinear features of diseases and lncRNAs are extracted using a graph attention auto-encoder, which largely retains the critical information and effectively aggregates the neighborhood information of nodes. In the end, LDAs can be predicted by fusing the linear and nonlinear characteristics of diseases and lncRNA. The HGATELDA model achieves an impressive AUC value of 0.9692 when evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation indicating its superior performance in comparison to several recent prediction models. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of HGATELDA in identifying novel LDAs is further demonstrated by case studies. the HGATELDA model appears to be a viable computational model for predicting LDAs. ",

Existing methods rely on multiple prompts to the large language model to explore better solutions, which is expensive.

CodeGRAG extracts and summarizes the control flow and data flow of code blocks to fill the gap between programming languages and natural language. The extracted external structural knowledge models the inherent flows of code blocks, which can facilitate LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. CodeGRAG significantly improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation, e.g., C++ for Python. ",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has received remarkable performance in various critical disciplines, such as chemistry analysis and bioinformatics. Existing UGAD paradigms often adopt data augmentation techniques to construct multiple views, and then employ different strategies to obtain representations from different views for jointly conducting UGAD. However, most previous works only considered the relationship between nodes/graphs from a limited receptive field, resulting in some key structure patterns and feature information being neglected. In addition, most existing methods consider different views separately in a parallel manner, which is not able to explore the inter-relationship across different views directly. Thus, a method with a larger receptive field that can explore the inter-relationship across different views directly is in need. In this paper, we propose a novel Simplified Transformer with Cross-View Attention for Unsupervised Graph-level Anomaly Detection, namely, CVTGAD. To increase the receptive field, we construct a simplified transformer-based module, exploiting the relationship between nodes/graphs from both intra-graph and inter-graph perspectives. Furthermore, we design a cross-view attention mechanism to directly exploit the view co-occurrence between different views, bridging the inter-view gap at node level and graph level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply transformer and cross attention to UGAD, which realizes graph neural network and transformer working collaboratively. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets of 3 fields demonstrate the superiority of CVTGAD on the UGAD task. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/jindongli-Ai/CVTGAD}. ",

    "abstract": "Large language models have boosted Large Models as a Service (LMaaS) into a thriving business sector. But even model owners offering only API access while keeping model parameters and internal workings private, their Intellectual Property (IP) are still at risk of theft through model extraction attacks. To safeguard the IP of these models and mitigate unfair competition in the language model market, watermarking technology serves as an efficient post-hoc solution for identifying IP infringements. However, existing IP protection watermarking methods either explicitly alter the original output of the language model or implant watermark signals in the model logits. These methods forcefully distort the original distribution of the language model and impact the sampling process, leading to a decline in the quality of the generated text. The existing method also fails to achieve end-to-end adaptive watermark embedding and lack robustness verification in complex scenarios where watermark detection is subject to interference. To overcome these challenges, we propose PromptShield, a plug-and-play IP protection watermarking method to resist model extraction attacks without training additional modules. Leveraging the self-reminding properties inherent in large language models, we encapsulate the user's query with a watermark self-generated instruction, nudging the LLMs to automatically generate watermark words in its output without compromising generation quality. Our method does not require access to the model's internal logits and minimizes alterations to the model's distribution using prompt-guided cues. Comprehensive experimental results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness of our watermark. Moreover, Our watermark detection method remains robust and high detection sensitivity even when subjected to interference. ",

In this study, we address the following question: since the human brain is a task-based neuron user, can the artificial network design go from the task-based architecture design to the task-based neuron design? Since methodologically there are no one-size-fits-all neurons, given the same structure, task-based neurons can enhance the feature representation ability relative to the existing universal neurons due to the intrinsic inductive bias for the task. Specifically, we propose a two-step framework for prototyping task-based neurons. First, symbolic regression is used to identify optimal formulas that fit input data by utilizing base functions such as logarithmic, trigonometric, and exponential functions. We introduce vectorized symbolic regression that stacks all variables in a vector and regularizes each input variable to perform the same computation, which can expedite the regression speed, facilitate parallel computation, and avoid overfitting. Second, we parameterize the acquired elementary formula to make parameters learnable, which serves as the aggregation function of the neuron. The activation functions such as ReLU and the sigmoidal functions remain the same because they have proven to be good. Empirically, experimental results on synthetic data, classic benchmarks, and real-world applications show that the proposed task-based neuron design is not only feasible but also delivers competitive performance over other state-of-the-art models.

Traditionally, the TM does not consider data characteristics such as sparsity, commonly seen in NLP applications and other bag-of-word-based representations. Consequently, a TM must initialize, store, and process a significant number of zero values, resulting in excessive memory usage and computational time. Previous attempts at creating a sparse TM have predominantly been unsuccessful, primarily due to their inability to identify which literals are sufficient for TM training. By introducing Active Literals (AL), the STM can focus exclusively on literals that actively contribute to the current data representation, significantly decreasing memory footprint and computational time while demonstrating competitive classification performance.

    "title": "Robustness of Decentralised Learning to Nodes and Data Disruption",
    "abstract": "In the vibrant landscape of AI research, decentralised learning is gaining momentum. Decentralised learning allows individual nodes to keep data locally where they are generated and to share knowledge extracted from local data among themselves through an interactive process of collaborative refinement. This paradigm supports scenarios where data cannot leave local nodes due to privacy or sovereignty reasons or real-time constraints imposing proximity of models to locations where inference has to be carried out. The distributed nature of decentralised learning implies significant new research challenges with respect to centralised learning. Among them, in this paper, we focus on robustness issues. Specifically, we study the effect of nodes' disruption on the collective learning process. Assuming a given percentage of \"central\" nodes disappear from the network, we focus on different cases, characterised by (i) different distributions of data across nodes and (ii) different times when disruption occurs with respect to the start of the collaborative learning task. Through these configurations, we are able to show the non-trivial interplay between the properties of the network connecting nodes, the persistence of knowledge acquired collectively before disruption or lack thereof, and the effect of data availability pre- and post-disruption. Our results show that decentralised learning processes are remarkably robust to network disruption. As long as even minimum amounts of data remain available somewhere in the network, the learning process is able to recover from disruptions and achieve significant classification accuracy. This clearly varies depending on the remaining connectivity after disruption, but we show that even nodes that remain completely isolated can retain significant knowledge acquired before the disruption.

    "title": "Combining Crown Structures for Vulnerability Measures",
    "abstract": "Over the past decades, various metrics have emerged in graph theory to grasp the complex nature of network vulnerability. In this paper, we study two specific measures: (weighted) vertex integrity (wVI) and (weighted) component order connectivity (wCOC). These measures not only evaluate the number of vertices required to decompose a graph into fragments, but also take into account the size of the largest remaining component. The main focus of our paper is on kernelization algorithms tailored to both measures. We capitalize on the structural attributes inherent in different crown decompositions, strategically combining them to introduce novel kernelization algorithms that advance the current state of the field. In particular, we extend the scope of the balanced crown decomposition provided by Casel et al.~[7] and expand the applicability of crown decomposition techniques. In summary, we improve the vertex kernel of VI from $p^3$ to $p^2$, and of wVI from $p^3$ to $3(p^2 + p^{1.5} p_{\\ell})$, where $p_{\\ell} < p$ represents the weight of the heaviest component after removing a solution. For wCOC we improve the vertex kernel from $\\mathcal{O}(k^2W + kW^2)$ to $3\\mu(k + \\sqrt{\\mu}W)$, where $\\mu = \\max(k,W)$. We also give a combinatorial algorithm that provides a $2kW$ vertex kernel in FPT-runtime when parameterized by $r$, where $r \\leq k$ is the size of a maximum $(W+1)$-packing. We further show that the algorithm computing the $2kW$ vertex kernel for COC can be transformed into a polynomial algorithm for two special cases, namely when $W=1$, which corresponds to the well-known vertex cover problem, and for claw-free graphs. In particular, we show a new way to obtain a $2k$ vertex kernel (or to obtain a 2-approximation) for the vertex cover problem by only using crown structures. ",

To understand the reasons, we conducted a discussion-based study, anchored in the authors' extensive industrial experience and keen observations, to uncover the gap between research and practice in this field. We empirically identified three main barriers preventing the industry from adopting academic models, namely, complicated requirements of scalability and prioritization, limited customization flexibility, and unclear financial implications.

The construction of knowledge graphs is a multifaceted process involving various techniques, where researchers aim to extract the knowledge from existing resources for the construction since building from scratch entails significant labor and time costs. However, due to the pervasive issue of heterogeneity, the description diversity across different knowledge graphs can lead to mismatches between concepts, thereby impacting the efficacy of knowledge extraction. This Ph.D. study focuses on automatic knowledge graph extension, i.e., properly extending the reference knowledge graph by extracting and integrating concepts from one or more candidate knowledge graphs. We propose a novel knowledge graph extension framework based on entity type recognition. The framework aims to achieve high-quality knowledge extraction by aligning the schemas and entities across different knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of the extension. This paper elucidates three major contributions: (i) we propose an entity type recognition method exploiting machine learning and property-based similarities to enhance knowledge extraction; (ii) we introduce a set of assessment metrics to validate the quality of the extended knowledge graphs; (iii) we develop a platform for knowledge graph acquisition, management, and extension to benefit knowledge engineers practically. Our evaluation comprehensively demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed extension framework and its functionalities through quantitative experiments and case studies. ",

However, the processes and internal mechanisms along which they determine relevance are still largely unknown. Existing approaches for analyzing neural ranker behavior with respect to IR properties rely either on assessing overall model behavior or employing probing methods that may offer an incomplete understanding of causal mechanisms. To provide a more granular understanding of internal model decision-making processes, we propose the use of causal interventions to reverse engineer neural rankers, and demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability methods can be used to isolate components satisfying term-frequency axioms within a ranking model. We identify a group of attention heads that detect duplicate tokens in earlier layers of the model, then communicate with downstream heads to compute overall document relevance. More generally, we propose that this style of mechanistic analysis opens up avenues for reverse engineering the processes neural retrieval models use to compute relevance. This work aims to initiate granular interpretability efforts that will not only benefit retrieval model development and training, but ultimately ensure safer deployment of these models. ",

Sparse-view CT, offering reduced ionizing radiation, faces challenges due to its under-sampled nature, leading to ill-posed reconstruction problems. Recent advancements in Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have shown promise in addressing sparse-view CT reconstruction. Recognizing that CT often involves scanning similar subjects, we propose a novel approach to improve reconstruction quality through joint reconstruction of multiple objects using INRs. This approach can potentially leverage both the strengths of INRs and the statistical regularities across multiple objects. While current INR joint reconstruction techniques primarily focus on accelerating convergence via meta-initialization, they are not specifically tailored to enhance reconstruction quality. To address this gap, we introduce a novel INR-based Bayesian framework integrating latent variables to capture the inter-object relationships. These variables serve as a dynamic reference throughout the optimization, thereby enhancing individual reconstruction fidelity. Our extensive experiments, which assess various key factors such as reconstruction quality, resistance to overfitting, and generalizability, demonstrate significant improvements over baselines in common numerical metrics. This underscores a notable advancement in CT reconstruction methods. ",

The incremental Volt/Var controller is implemented with the objective of minimizing reactive power usage while maintaining voltages within safe limits sufficiently often. To this end, the parameters of the incremental Volt/Var controller are obtained by solving a chance-constrained optimization problem, where constraints are designed to ensure that voltage violations do not occur more often than a pre-specified probability. This approach leads to cost savings in a controlled, predictable way, while still avoiding significant over- or under-voltage issues. The proposed chance-constrained problem is solved using a successive convex approximation method. Once the gains are broadcast to the inverters, no additional communication is required since the controller is implemented locally at the inverters. The proposed method is successfully tested on a low-voltage 42-nodes network. ",

As one of the important application domains of foundation models, earth observation has attracted attention and various approaches have been developed. When considering earth observation as a single image capture, earth observation imagery can be processed as an image with three or more channels, and when it comes with multiple image captures of different timestamps at one location, the temporal observation can be considered as a set of continuous image resembling video frames or medical SCAN slices. This paper presents Spatio-Temporal SwinMAE (ST-SwinMAE), an architecture which particularly focuses on representation learning for spatio-temporal image processing. Specifically, it uses a hierarchical Masked Auto-encoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks. With the architecture, we present a pretrained model named Degas 100M as a geospatial foundation model. Also, we propose an approach for transfer learning with Degas 100M, which both pretrained encoder and decoder of MAE are utilized with skip connections added between them to achieve multi-scale information communication, forms an architecture named Spatio-Temporal SwinUNet (ST-SwinUNet). Our approach shows significant improvements of performance over existing state-of-the-art of foundation models.

The diagnostic accuracy is often affected by image resolution, which can be insufficient in practice. For medical CT images, the through-plane resolution is often worse than the in-plane resolution and there can be overlap between slices, causing difficulties in diagnoses. Self-supervised methods for through-plane resolution enhancement, which train on in-plane images and infer on through-plane images, have shown promise for both CT and MRI imaging. However, existing self-supervised methods either neglect overlap or can only handle specific cases with fixed combinations of resolution and overlap. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised method called SR4ZCT. It employs the same off-axis training approach while being capable of handling arbitrary combinations of resolution and overlap. Our method explicitly models the relationship between resolutions and voxel spacings of different planes to accurately simulate training images that match the original through-plane images. We highlight the significance of accurate modeling in self-supervised off-axis training and demonstrate the effectiveness of SR4ZCT using a real-world dataset. ",

Therefore, instead of designing controllers directly for the unknown true system, an available approach is to design controllers for all systems compatible with the dataset. To overcome the limitations of using a single dataset and benefit from collecting more data, multiple datasets are employed in this paper. Furthermore, a new iterative method is developed to address the challenges of using multiple datasets. Based on this method, this paper develops an offline and online robust data-driven iterative control method, respectively. Compared to the existing robust data-driven controller method, both proposed control methods iteratively utilize multiple datasets in the controller design process. This allows for the incorporation of numerous datasets, potentially reducing the conservativeness of the designed controller. Particularly, the online controller is iteratively designed by continuously incorporating online collected data into the historical data to construct new datasets.

The gradient calculations in EP have been shown to approximate the gradients computed by Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when an infinitesimally small nudge factor is used. This property makes EP a powerful candidate for training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which are commonly trained by BPTT. However, in the spiking domain, previous studies on EP have been limited to architectures involving few linear layers. In this work, for the first time we provide a formulation for training convolutional spiking convergent RNNs using EP, bridging the gap between spiking and non-spiking convergent RNNs. We demonstrate that for spiking convergent RNNs, there is a mismatch in the maximum pooling and its inverse operation, leading to inaccurate gradient estimation in EP. Substituting this with average pooling resolves this issue and enables accurate gradient estimation for spiking convergent RNNs. We also highlight the memory efficiency of EP compared to BPTT. In the regime of SNNs trained by EP, our experimental results indicate state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, with test errors of 0.97% and 8.89%, respectively. These results are comparable to those of convergent RNNs and SNNs trained by BPTT. These findings underscore EP as an optimal choice for on-chip training and a biologically-plausible method for computing error gradients. ",

In contrast, despite their unparalleled performance across numerous visual tasks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) remain far less robust than humans, showing, for example, a surprising susceptibility to adversarial attacks involving image perturbations that are (almost) imperceptible to humans. Human object recognition likely owes its robustness, in part, to the increasingly resilient representations that emerge along the hierarchy of the ventral visual cortex. Here we show that DNNs, when guided by neural representations from a hierarchical sequence of regions in the human ventral visual stream, display increasing robustness to adversarial attacks. These neural-guided models also exhibit a gradual shift towards more human-like decision-making patterns and develop hierarchically smoother decision surfaces. Importantly, the resulting representational spaces differ in important ways from those produced by conventional smoothing methods, suggesting that such neural-guidance may provide previously unexplored robustness solutions. Our findings support the gradual emergence of human robustness along the ventral visual hierarchy and suggest that the key to DNN robustness may lie in increasing emulation of the human brain. ",

In this paper, we propose ActiveNeuS, which evaluates candidate views considering both uncertainties. ActiveNeuS provides a way to accumulate image rendering uncertainty while avoiding the bias that the estimated densities can introduce. ActiveNeuS computes the neural implicit surface uncertainty, providing the color uncertainty along with the surface information. It efficiently handles the bias by using the surface information and a grid, enabling the fast selection of diverse viewpoints.

Numerical results show that the MLP decoder has the best error-correction performance under a similar model parameter number. ",

    "abstract": "Safety helmets play a crucial role in protecting workers from head injuries in construction sites, where potential hazards are prevalent. However, currently, there is no approach that can simultaneously achieve both model accuracy and performance in complex environments. In this study, we utilized a Yolo-based model for safety helmet detection, achieved a 2% improvement in mAP (mean Average Precision) performance while reducing parameters and Flops count by over 25%. YOLO(You Only Look Once) is a widely used, high-performance, lightweight model architecture that is well suited for complex environments. We presents a novel approach by incorporating a lightweight feature extraction network backbone based on GhostNetv2, integrating attention modules such as Spatial Channel-wise Attention Net(SCNet) and Coordination Attention Net(CANet), and adopting the Gradient Norm Aware optimizer (GAM) for improved generalization ability. In safety-critical environments, the accurate detection and speed of safety helmets plays a pivotal role in preventing occupational hazards and ensuring compliance with safety protocols. This work addresses the pressing need for robust and efficient helmet detection methods, offering a comprehensive framework that not only enhances accuracy but also improves the adaptability of detection models to real-world conditions. Our experimental results underscore the synergistic effects of GhostNetv2, attention modules, and the GAM optimizer, presenting a compelling solution for safety helmet detection that achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, generalization, and efficiency.

    "abstract": "In recent years, autonomous driving has garnered escalating attention for its potential to relieve drivers' burdens and improve driving safety. Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction, which predicts the spatial occupancy status and semantics of 3D voxel grids around the autonomous vehicle from image inputs, is an emerging perception task suitable for cost-effective perception system of autonomous driving. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the greater advantages of 3D occupancy prediction over object-centric perception tasks, there is still a lack of a dedicated review focusing on this rapidly developing field. In this paper, we first introduce the background of vision-based 3D occupancy prediction and discuss the challenges in this task. Secondly, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the progress in vision-based 3D occupancy prediction from three aspects: feature enhancement, deployment friendliness and label efficiency, and provide an in-depth analysis of the potentials and challenges of each category of methods. Finally, we present a summary of prevailing research trends and propose some inspiring future outlooks.

Despite recent advances, existing methods still face challenges such as limited ability to generalize, and inadequate representation of learning from unlabeled data, especially for tasks specific to molecular structures. To address these limitations, we introduce DIG-Mol, a novel self-supervised graph neural network framework for molecular property prediction. This architecture leverages the power of contrast learning with dual interaction mechanisms and unique molecular graph enhancement strategies. DIG-Mol integrates a momentum distillation network with two interconnected networks to efficiently improve molecular characterization. The framework's ability to extract key information about molecular structure and higher-order semantics is supported by minimizing loss of contrast. We have established DIG-Mol's state-of-the-art performance through extensive experimental evaluation in a variety of molecular property prediction tasks. In addition to demonstrating superior transferability in a small number of learning scenarios, our visualizations highlight DIG-Mol's enhanced interpretability and representation capabilities. These findings confirm the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming challenges faced by traditional methods and mark a significant advance in molecular property prediction. ",

    "abstract": "As the complexity and destructiveness of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) increase, there is a growing tendency to identify a series of actions undertaken to achieve the attacker's target, called attack investigation. Currently, analysts construct the provenance graph to perform causality analysis on Point-Of-Interest (POI) event for capturing critical events (related to the attack). However, due to the vast size of the provenance graph and the rarity of critical events, existing attack investigation methods suffer from problems of high false positives, high overhead, and high latency. To this end, we propose SPARSE, an efficient and real-time system for constructing critical component graphs (i.e., consisting of critical events) from streaming logs. Our key observation is 1) Critical events exist in a suspicious semantic graph (SSG) composed of interaction flows between suspicious entities, and 2) Information flows that accomplish attacker's goal exist in the form of paths. Therefore, SPARSE uses a two-stage framework to implement attack investigation (i.e., constructing the SSG and performing path-level contextual analysis). First, SPARSE operates in a state-based mode where events are consumed as streams, allowing easy access to the SSG related to the POI event through semantic transfer rule and storage strategy. Then, SPARSE identifies all suspicious flow paths (SFPs) related to the POI event from the SSG, quantifies the influence of each path to filter irrelevant events. Our evaluation on a real large-scale attack dataset shows that SPARSE can generate a critical component graph (~ 113 edges) in 1.6 seconds, which is 2014 X smaller than the backtracking graph (~ 227,589 edges). SPARSE is 25 X more effective than other state-of-the-art techniques in filtering irrelevant edges. ",

Assessing the risk of systems under stealth attacks remains an open challenge, especially in nonlinear systems. To comprehensively quantify these risks, we propose a framework that considers both the reachability of a system and the risk distribution of a scenario. We propose an algorithm to approximate the reachability of a nonlinear system under stealth attacks with a union of standard sets. Meanwhile, we present a method to construct a risk field to formally describe the risk distribution in a given scenario. The intersection relationships of system reachability and risk regions in the risk field indicate that attackers can cause corresponding risks without being detected. Based on this, we introduce a metric to dynamically quantify the risk. Compared to traditional methods, our framework predicts the risk value in an explainable way and provides early warnings for safety control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a case study of an automated warehouse. ",

In this letter we show that conformal prediction algorithms are related to the uncertainty of the deep learning model and that this relation can be used to detect if the deep learning model is out-of-calibration. Popular classification models like Resnet50, Densenet161, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2 are applied on remote sensing datasets such as the EuroSAT to demonstrate how under noisy scenarios the model outputs become untrustworthy.

However, physical equipment in space is subject to various natural hazards, such as radiation, which may inhibit the correct operation of computing devices. Despite plenty of evidence showing the damage that naturally-induced faults can cause to ML-related hardware, we observe that the effects of radiation on ML models for space applications are not well-studied. This is a problem: without understanding how ML models are affected by these natural phenomena, it is uncertain \"where to start from\" to develop radiation-tolerant ML software. As ML researchers, we attempt to tackle this dilemma. By partnering up with space-industry practitioners specialized in ML, we perform a reflective analysis of the state of the art. We provide factual evidence that prior work did not thoroughly examine the impact of natural hazards on ML models meant for spacecraft. Then, through a \"negative result\", we show that some existing open-source technologies can hardly be used by researchers to study the effects of radiation for some applications of ML in satellites. As a constructive step forward, we perform simple experiments showcasing how to leverage current frameworks to assess the robustness of practical ML models for cloud detection against radiation-induced faults. Our evaluation reveals that not all faults are as devastating as claimed by some prior work. By publicly releasing our resources, we provide a foothold -- usable by researchers without access to spacecraft -- for spearheading development of space-tolerant ML models. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial EXEmples are carefully-perturbed programs tailored to evade machine learning Windows malware detectors, with an on-going effort in developing robust models able to address detection effectiveness. However, even if robust models can prevent the majority of EXEmples, to maintain predictive power over time, models are fine-tuned to newer threats, leading either to partial updates or time-consuming retraining from scratch. Thus, even if the robustness against attacks is higher, the new models might suffer a regression in performance by misclassifying threats that were previously correctly detected. For these reasons, we study the trade-off between accuracy and regression when updating Windows malware detectors, by proposing EXE-scanner, a plugin that can be chained to existing detectors to promptly stop EXEmples without causing regression. We empirically show that previously-proposed hardening techniques suffer a regression of accuracy when updating non-robust models. On the contrary, we show that EXE-scanner exhibits comparable performance to robust models without regression of accuracy, and we show how to properly chain it after the base classifier to obtain the best performance without the need of costly retraining. To foster reproducibility, we openly release source code, along with the dataset of adversarial EXEmples based on state-of-the-art perturbation algorithms. ",

We here advocate the need for a general DL architecture flexible enough to solve different traffic analysis tasks. We test this idea by proposing a DL architecture based on generic data adaptation modules, followed by an integration module that summarises the extracted information into a compact and rich intermediate representation (i.e. embeddings). The result is a flexible Multi-modal Autoencoder (MAE) pipeline that can solve different use cases. We demonstrate the architecture with traffic classification (TC) tasks since they allow us to quantitatively compare results with state-of-the-art solutions. However, we argue that the MAE architecture is generic and can be used to learn representations useful in multiple scenarios. On TC, the MAE performs on par or better than alternatives while avoiding cumbersome feature engineering, thus streamlining the adoption of DL solutions for traffic analysis. ",

    "abstract": "Developing a general information processing model in uncertain environments is fundamental for the advancement of explainable artificial intelligence. Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is a well-known and effective reasoning method for representing epistemic uncertainty, which is closely related to subjective probability theory and possibility theory. Although they can be transformed to each other under some particular belief structures, there remains a lack of a clear and interpretable transformation process, as well as a unified approach for information processing. In this paper, we aim to address these issues from the perspectives of isopignistic belief functions and the hyper-cautious transferable belief model. Firstly, we propose an isopignistic transformation based on the belief evolution network. This transformation allows for the adjustment of the information granule while retaining the potential decision outcome. The isopignistic transformation is integrated with a hyper-cautious transferable belief model to establish a new canonical decomposition. This decomposition offers a reverse path between the possibility distribution and its isopignistic mass functions. The result of the canonical decomposition, called isopignistic function, is an identical information content distribution to reflect the propensity and relative commitment degree of the BPA. Furthermore, this paper introduces a method to reconstruct the basic belief assignment by adjusting the isopignistic function. It explores the advantages of this approach in modeling and handling uncertainty within the hyper-cautious transferable belief model. More general, this paper establishes a theoretical basis for building general models of artificial intelligence based on probability theory, Dempster-Shafer theory, and possibility theory. ",

It is a widely popular notion of privacy since it captures the natural privacy semantics for many applications (such as, for location data) and results in better utility than standard DP. However, prior work in metric DP has primarily focused on the \\textit{item-level} setting where every user only reports a single data item. A more realistic setting is that of user-level DP where each user contributes multiple items and privacy is then desired at the granularity of the user's \\textit{entire} contribution. In this paper, we initiate the study of metric DP at the user-level. Specifically, we use the earth-mover's distance ($d_\\textsf{EM}$) as our metric to obtain a notion of privacy as it captures both the magnitude and spatial aspects of changes in a user's data. We make three main technical contributions. First, we design two novel mechanisms under $d_\\textsf{EM}$-DP to answer linear queries and item-wise queries. Specifically, our analysis for the latter involves a generalization of the privacy amplification by shuffling result which may be of independent interest. Second, we provide a black-box reduction from the general unbounded to bounded $d_\\textsf{EM}$-DP (size of the dataset is fixed and public) with a novel sampling based mechanism. Third, we show that our proposed mechanisms can provably provide improved utility over user-level DP, for certain types of linear queries and frequency estimation. ",

The increase in popularity of this paradigm of interaction has given birth to new applications and has attracted casual consumers to experience VR. Providing a self-embodied representation (avatar) of users' full bodies inside shared virtual spaces can improve the VR experience and make it more engaging to both new and experienced users . This is especially important in fully immersive systems, where the equipment completely occludes the real world making self awareness problematic. Indeed, the feeling of presence of the user is highly influenced by their virtual representations, even though small flaws could lead to uncanny valley side-effects. Following previous research, we would like to assess whether using a third-person perspective could also benefit the VR experience, via an improved spatial awareness of the user's virtual surroundings. In this paper we investigate realism and perspective of self-embodied representation in VR setups in natural tasks, such as walking and avoiding obstacles. We compare both First and Third-Person perspectives with three different levels of realism in avatar representation. These range from a stylized abstract avatar, to a \"realistic\" mesh-based humanoid representation and a point-cloud rendering. The latter uses data captured via depth-sensors and mapped into a virtual self inside the Virtual Environment. We present a throughout evaluation and comparison of these different representations, describing a series of guidelines for self-embodied VR applications. The effects of the uncanny valley are also discussed in the context of navigation and reflex-based tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Load balancing has been a fundamental building block of cloud and, more recently, edge computing environments. At the same time, in edge computing environments, prior research has highlighted that applications operate on similar (correlated) data. Based on this observation, prior research has advocated for the direction of \"computation reuse\", where the results of previously executed computational tasks are stored at the edge and are reused (if possible) to satisfy incoming tasks with similar input data, instead of executing incoming tasks from scratch. Both load balancing and computation reuse are critical to the deployment of scalable edge computing environments, yet they are contradictory in nature. In this paper, we propose the Deduplicator, a middlebox that aims to facilitate both load balancing and computation reuse at the edge. The Deduplicator features mechanisms to identify and deduplicate similar tasks offloaded by user devices, collect information about the usage of edge servers' resources, manage the addition of new edge servers and the failures of existing edge servers, and ultimately balance the load imposed on edge servers. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the Deduplicator achieves up to 20% higher percentages of computation reuse compared to several other load balancing approaches, while also effectively balancing the distribution of tasks among edge servers at line rate.

To this end, we first propose a novel semi-supervised SNMF model by seeking low-rank representation for the tensor synthesized by the pairwise constraint matrix and a similarity matrix obtained by the product of the embedding matrix and its transpose, which could strengthen those two matrices simultaneously from a global perspective. We then propose an enhanced SNMF model, making the embedding matrix tailored to the above tensor low-rank representation. We finally refine the similarity matrix by the strengthened pairwise constraints.

    "abstract": "The radio spectrum is a limited resource. Demand for wireless communication services is increasing exponentially, stressing the availability of radio spectrum to accommodate new services. TV White Space (TVWS) technologies allow a dynamic usage of the spectrum. These technologies provide wireless connectivity, in the channels of the Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) television broadcasting bands. In this paper, we investigate and compare the coverage range, network capacity, and network energy efficiency for TVWS technologies and LTE. We consider Ghent, Belgium and Boyeros, Havana, Cuba to evaluate a realistic outdoor suburban and rural area, respectively. The comparison shows that TVWS networks have an energy efficiency 9-12 times higher than LTE networks. ",

For a realistic suburban scenario in Ghent city, Belgium, we determine the optimality among the KPIs. Compared to a traditional Cognitive Radio network design, our optimization algorithm for the cloud-based architecture reduced the network power consumption by 27.5%, the average global exposure by 34.3%, and spectrum usage by 34.5% at the same time. Even for the worst optimization case, our solution performs better than the traditional architecture by 4.8% in terms of network power consumption, 7.3% in terms of spectrum usage and 4.3% in terms of global exposure.

    "abstract": "Bipartite graph hashing (BGH) is extensively used for Top-K search in Hamming space at low storage and inference costs. Recent research adopts graph convolutional hashing for BGH and has achieved the state-of-the-art performance. However, the contributions of its various influencing factors to hashing performance have not been explored in-depth, including the same/different sign count between two binary embeddings during Hamming space search (sign property), the contribution of sub-embeddings at each layer (model property), the contribution of different node types in the bipartite graph (node property), and the combination of augmentation methods. In this work, we build a lightweight graph convolutional hashing model named LightGCH by mainly removing the augmentation methods of the state-of-the-art model BGCH. By analyzing the contributions of each layer and node type to performance, as well as analyzing the Hamming similarity statistics at each layer, we find that the actual neighbors in the bipartite graph tend to have low Hamming similarity at the shallow layer, and all nodes tend to have high Hamming similarity at the deep layers in LightGCH. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel sign-guided framework SGBGH to make improvement, which uses sign-guided negative sampling to improve the Hamming similarity of neighbors, and uses sign-aware contrastive learning to help nodes learn more uniform representations. Experimental results show that SGBGH outperforms BGCH and LightGCH significantly in embedding quality. ",

Automatic placement of these devices is challenging because of the complex interaction of the signal and environment due to reflection, refraction and scattering. In this work, we iteratively improve the placement of these devices by interleaving device placement and sensing actions, correcting errors in the model of the signal propagation. To this end, we propose a novel factor-graph based belief model which combines the measurements taken by the robot and an analytical light propagation model. This model allows accurately modelling the uncertainty of the light propagation with respect to the obstacles, which greatly improves the informative path planning routine. Additionally, we propose a method for determining when to re-plan the emitter placements to balance a trade-off between information about a specific configuration and frequent updating of the configuration. This method incorporates the uncertainty from belief model to adaptively determine when re-configuration is needed. We find that our system has a 9.8% median error reduction compared to a baseline system in simulations in the most difficult environment. We also run on-robot tests and determine that our system performs favorably compared to the baseline. ",

    "abstract": "This systematic review focuses on anomaly detection for connected and autonomous vehicles. The initial database search identified 2160 articles, of which 203 were included in this review after rigorous screening and assessment. This study revealed that the most commonly used Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms employed in anomaly detection are neural networks like LSTM, CNN, and autoencoders, alongside one-class SVM. Most anomaly-based models were trained using real-world operational vehicle data, although anomalies, such as attacks and faults, were often injected artificially into the datasets. These models were evaluated mostly using five key evaluation metrics: recall, accuracy, precision, F1-score, and false positive rate. The most frequently used selection of evaluation metrics used for anomaly detection models were accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This systematic review presents several recommendations. First, there is a need to incorporate multiple evaluation metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment of the anomaly detection models. Second, only a small proportion of the studies have made their models open source, indicating a need to share models publicly to facilitate collaboration within the research community, and to validate and compare findings effectively. Third, there is a need for benchmarking datasets with predefined anomalies or cyberattacks to test and improve the effectiveness of the proposed anomaly-based detection models. Furthermore, there is a need for future research to investigate the deployment of anomaly detection to a vehicle to assess its performance on the road. There is a notable lack of research done on intrusion detection systems using different protocols to CAN, such as Ethernet and FlexRay. ",

However, EO data offers the unique opportunity to pair data from different modalities and sensors automatically based on geographic location and time, at virtually no human labor cost. We seize this opportunity to create a diverse multi-modal pretraining dataset at global scale. Using this new corpus of 1.2 million locations, we propose a Multi-Pretext Masked Autoencoder (MP-MAE) approach to learn general-purpose representations for optical satellite images. Our approach builds on the ConvNeXt V2 architecture, a fully convolutional masked autoencoder (MAE). Drawing upon a suite of multi-modal pretext tasks, we demonstrate that our MP-MAE approach outperforms both MAEs pretrained on ImageNet and MAEs pretrained on domain-specific satellite images. This is shown on several downstream tasks including image classification and semantic segmentation. We find that multi-modal pretraining notably improves the linear probing performance, e.g. 4pp on BigEarthNet and 16pp on So2Sat, compared to pretraining on optical satellite images only. We show that this also leads to better label and parameter efficiency which are crucial aspects in global scale applications. ",

However, categorically labelled datasets are time-consuming to generate and constrain classification to a pre-defined, fixed set of classes. For neuroradiological applications in particular, this represents a barrier to clinical adoption. To address these challenges, we present a self-supervised text-vision framework that learns to detect clinically relevant abnormalities in brain MRI scans by directly leveraging the rich information contained in accompanying free-text neuroradiology reports. Our training approach consisted of two-steps. First, a dedicated neuroradiological language model - NeuroBERT - was trained to generate fixed-dimensional vector representations of neuroradiology reports (N = 50,523) via domain-specific self-supervised learning tasks. Next, convolutional neural networks (one per MRI sequence) learnt to map individual brain scans to their corresponding text vector representations by optimising a mean square error loss. Once trained, our text-vision framework can be used to detect abnormalities in unreported brain MRI examinations by scoring scans against suitable query sentences (e.g., 'there is an acute stroke', 'there is hydrocephalus' etc.), enabling a range of classification-based applications including automated triage. Potentially, our framework could also serve as a clinical decision support tool, not only by suggesting findings to radiologists and detecting errors in provisional reports, but also by retrieving and displaying examples of pathologies from historical examinations that could be relevant to the current case based on textual descriptors.

However, traditional ore sorting meth- ods often suffer from inefficiency and lack of accuracy, especially in complex mineral environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a method called OreYOLO, which incorporates an attentional mechanism and a multi-scale feature fusion strategy, based on ore data from gold and sul- fide ores. By introducing the progressive feature pyramid structure into YOLOv5 and embedding the attention mechanism in the feature extraction module, the detection performance and accuracy of the model are greatly improved. In order to adapt to the diverse ore sorting scenarios and the deployment requirements of edge devices, the network structure is designed to be lightweight, which achieves a low number of parameters (3.458M) and computational complexity (6.3GFLOPs) while maintaining high accuracy (99.3% and 99.2%, respectively). In the experimental part, a target detection dataset containing 6000 images of gold and sulfuric iron ore is constructed for gold and sulfuric iron ore classification training, and several sets of comparison experiments are set up, including the YOLO series, EfficientDet, Faster-RCNN, and CenterNet, etc., and the experiments prove that OreYOLO outperforms the commonly used high-performance object detection of these architectures ",

To learn graph representations, current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) primarily use message passing to encode the interconnections. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel graph-to-set conversion method that bijectively transforms interconnected nodes into a set of independent points and then uses a set encoder to learn the graph representation. This conversion method holds dual significance. Firstly, it enables using set encoders to learn from graphs, thereby significantly expanding the design space of GNNs. Secondly, for Transformer, a specific set encoder, we provide a novel and principled approach to inject graph information losslessly, different from all the heuristic structural/positional encoding methods adopted in previous graph transformers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce Point Set Transformer (PST), a transformer architecture that accepts a point set converted from a graph as input. Theoretically, PST exhibits superior expressivity for both short-range substructure counting and long-range shortest path distance tasks compared to existing GNNs. Extensive experiments further validate PST's outstanding real-world performance. Besides Transformer, we also devise a Deepset-based set encoder, which achieves performance comparable to representative GNNs, affirming the versatility of our graph-to-set method. ",

While there has been a lot of progress in transferring vision-based navigation policies, the existing sim2real strategy for audio-visual navigation performs data augmentation empirically without measuring the acoustic gap. The sound differs from light in that it spans across much wider frequencies and thus requires a different solution for sim2real. We propose the first treatment of sim2real for audio-visual navigation by disentangling it into acoustic field prediction (AFP) and waypoint navigation. We first validate our design choice in the SoundSpaces simulator and show improvement on the Continuous AudioGoal navigation benchmark. We then collect real-world data to measure the spectral difference between the simulation and the real world by training AFP models that only take a specific frequency subband as input. We further propose a frequency-adaptive strategy that intelligently selects the best frequency band for prediction based on both the measured spectral difference and the energy distribution of the received audio, which improves the performance on the real data. Lastly, we build a real robot platform and show that the transferred policy can successfully navigate to sounding objects. This work demonstrates the potential of building intelligent agents that can see, hear, and act entirely from simulation, and transferring them to the real world. ",

To address it, most methods often incorporate additional information (e.g., boundary, texture, and frequency clues) to guide feature learning for better detecting camouflaged objects from the background. Although progress has been made, these methods are basically individually tailored to specific auxiliary cues, thus lacking adaptability and not consistently achieving high segmentation performance. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive guidance learning network, dubbed \\textit{AGLNet}, which is a unified end-to-end learnable model for exploring and adapting different additional cues in CNN models to guide accurate camouflaged feature learning. Specifically, we first design a straightforward additional information generation (AIG) module to learn additional camouflaged object cues, which can be adapted for the exploration of effective camouflaged features. Then we present a hierarchical feature combination (HFC) module to deeply integrate additional cues and image features to guide camouflaged feature learning in a multi-level fusion manner.Followed by a recalibration decoder (RD), different features are further aggregated and refined for accurate object prediction. Extensive experiments on three widely used COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvements under different additional cues, and outperforms the recent 20 state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our code will be made publicly available at: \\textcolor{blue}{{https://github.com/ZNan-Chen/AGLNet}}. ",

    "abstract": "Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks have caused significant damage worldwide. Various Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems are deployed by enterprises to fight against potential threats. However, EDR suffers from high false positives. In order not to affect normal operations, analysts need to investigate and filter detection results before taking countermeasures, in which heavy manual labor and alarm fatigue cause analysts miss optimal response time, thereby leading to information leakage and destruction. Therefore, we propose Endpoint Forecasting and Interpreting (EFI), a real-time attack forecast and interpretation system, which can automatically predict next move during post-exploitation and explain it in technique-level, then dispatch strategies to EDR for advance reinforcement. First, we use Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports to extract the attack scene graph (ASG) that can be mapped to low-level system logs to strengthen attack samples. Second, we build a serialized graph forecast model, which is combined with the attack provenance graph (APG) provided by EDR to generate an attack forecast graph (AFG) to predict the next move. Finally, we utilize the attack template graph (ATG) and graph alignment plus algorithm for technique-level interpretation to automatically dispatch strategies for EDR to reinforce system in advance. EFI can avoid the impact of existing EDR false positives, and can reduce the attack surface of system without affecting the normal operations. We collect a total of 3,484 CTI reports, generate 1,429 ASGs, label 8,000 sentences, tag 10,451 entities, and construct 256 ATGs. Experimental results on both DARPA Engagement and large scale CTI dataset show that the alignment score between the AFG predicted by EFI and the real attack graph is able to exceed 0.8, the forecast and interpretation precision of EFI can reach 91.8%.

YONA bisects an image, substitutes one half with noise, and applies data augmentation techniques to the remaining half. This method reduces the redundant information in the original image, encourages neural networks to recognize objects from incomplete views, and significantly enhances neural networks' robustness. YONA is distinguished by its properties of parameter-free, straightforward application, enhancing various existing data augmentation strategies, and thereby bolstering neural networks' robustness without additional computational cost. To demonstrate YONA's efficacy, extensive experiments were carried out. These experiments confirm YONA's compatibility with diverse data augmentation methods and neural network architectures, yielding substantial improvements in CIFAR classification tasks, sometimes outperforming conventional image-level data augmentation methods. Furthermore, YONA markedly increases the resilience of neural networks to adversarial attacks. Additional experiments exploring YONA's variants conclusively show that masking half of an image optimizes performance. The code is available at https://github.com/HansMoe/YONA. ",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Sina Weibo play a crucial role in global communication but often encounter strict regulations in geopolitically sensitive regions. This situation has prompted users to ingeniously modify their way of communicating, frequently resorting to coded language in these regulated social media environments. This shift in communication is not merely a strategy to counteract regulation, but a vivid manifestation of language evolution, demonstrating how language naturally evolves under societal and technological pressures. Studying the evolution of language in regulated social media contexts is of significant importance for ensuring freedom of speech, optimizing content moderation, and advancing linguistic research. This paper proposes a multi-agent simulation framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the evolution of user language in regulated social media environments. The framework employs LLM-driven agents: supervisory agent who enforce dialogue supervision and participant agents who evolve their language strategies while engaging in conversation, simulating the evolution of communication styles under strict regulations aimed at evading social media regulation. The study evaluates the framework's effectiveness through a range of scenarios from abstract scenarios to real-world situations. Key findings indicate that LLMs are capable of simulating nuanced language dynamics and interactions in constrained settings, showing improvement in both evading supervision and information accuracy as evolution progresses. Furthermore, it was found that LLM agents adopt different strategies for different scenarios. ",

However, current distributed NeRF registration approaches encounter aliasing artifacts, arising from discrepancies in rendering resolutions and suboptimal pose precision. These factors collectively deteriorate the fidelity of pose estimation within NeRF frameworks, resulting in occlusion artifacts during the NeRF blending stage. In this paper, we present a distributed NeRF system with tri-stage pose optimization. In the first stage, precise poses of images are achieved by bundle adjusting Mip-NeRF 360 with a coarse-to-fine strategy. In the second stage, we incorporate the inverting Mip-NeRF 360, coupled with the truncated dynamic low-pass filter, to enable the achievement of robust and precise poses, termed Frame2Model optimization. On top of this, we obtain a coarse transformation between NeRFs in different coordinate systems. In the third stage, we fine-tune the transformation between NeRFs by Model2Model pose optimization. After obtaining precise transformation parameters, we proceed to implement NeRF blending, showcasing superior performance metrics in both real-world and simulation scenarios.

To effectively coordinate all the clients and aggregate their collected data, FedConPE uses an adaptive approach to construct key terms that minimize uncertainty across all dimensions in the feature space. Furthermore, compared with existing federated linear bandit algorithms, FedConPE offers improved computational and communication efficiency as well as enhanced privacy protections. Our theoretical analysis shows that FedConPE is minimax near-optimal in terms of cumulative regret. We also establish upper bounds for communication costs and conversation frequency. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that FedConPE outperforms existing conversational bandit algorithms while using fewer conversations. ",

Fully convolutional network (FCN)-based methods have made remarkable progress in visual saliency detection over the last few decades.

To address this issue, we proposed a Saliency Fusion Attention U-Net (SalFAU-Net) model, which incorporates a saliency fusion module into each decoder block of the attention U-net model to generate saliency probability maps from each decoder block. SalFAU-Net employs an attention mechanism to selectively focus on the most informative regions of an image and suppress non-salient regions. We train SalFAU-Net on the DUTS dataset using a binary cross-entropy loss function. We conducted experiments on six popular SOD evaluation datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method, SalFAU-Net, achieves competitive performance compared to other methods in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), F-measure, s-measure, and e-measure.

Despite encouraging results, existing approaches rarely consider the effects of the external scene on the motion sequence, leading to pronounced artifacts and physical implausibilities in the predictions. To address this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-modal sense-informed motion prediction approach, which conditions high-fidelity generation on two modal information: external 3D scene, and internal human gaze, and is able to recognize their salience for future human activity. Furthermore, the gaze information is regarded as the human intention, and combined with both motion and scene features, we construct a ternary intention-aware attention to supervise the generation to match where the human wants to reach. Meanwhile, we introduce semantic coherence-aware attention to explicitly distinguish the salient point clouds and the underlying ones, to ensure a reasonable interaction of the generated sequence with the 3D scene. On two real-world benchmarks, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance both in 3D human pose and trajectory prediction. ",

    "abstract": "The test failure causes analysis is critical since it determines the subsequent way of handling different types of bugs, which is the prerequisite to get the bugs properly analyzed and fixed. After a test case fails, software testers have to inspect the test execution logs line by line to identify its root cause. However, manual root cause determination is often tedious and time-consuming, which can cost 30-40% of the time needed to fix a problem. Therefore, there is a need for automatically predicting the test failure causes to lighten the burden of software testers. In this paper, we present a simple but hard-to-beat approach, named NCChecker to automatically identify the failure causes for failed test logs. Our approach can help developers efficiently identify the test failure causes, and flag the most probable log lines of indicating the root causes for investigation. Our approach has three main stages: log abstraction, lookup table construction, and failure causes prediction. We first perform log abstraction to parse the unstructured log messages into structured log events. NCChecker then automatically maintains and updates a lookup table via employing our heuristic rules, which record the matching score between different log events and test failure causes. When it comes to the failure cause prediction stage, for a newly generated failed test log, NCChecker can easily infer its failed reason by checking out the associated log events' scores from the lookup table. We have developed a prototype and evaluated our tool on a real-world industrial dataset with more than 10K test logs. The extensive experiments show the promising performance of our model over a set of benchmarks. Moreover, our approach is highly efficient and memory-saving, and can successfully handle the data imbalance problem. ",

By applying PoMP, patients can gain a clearer comprehension of their conditions, empowering them to directly seek appropriate medical specialists and thereby reducing the time spent navigating healthcare communication to locate suitable doctors.

However, IRN-based methods tend to produce over-smoothed results, while GAN-based methods easily generate fake details, which thus hinders their real applications. To address this issue, we propose Boundary-aware Decoupled Flow Networks (BDFlow) to generate realistic and visually pleasing results. Unlike previous methods that model high-frequency information as standard Gaussian distribution directly, our BDFlow first decouples the high-frequency information into \\textit{semantic high-frequency} that adheres to a Boundary distribution and \\textit{non-semantic high-frequency} counterpart that adheres to a Gaussian distribution. Specifically, to capture semantic high-frequency parts accurately, we use Boundary-aware Mask (BAM) to constrain the model to produce rich textures, while non-semantic high-frequency part is randomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our BDFlow significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods while maintaining lower complexity. Notably, our BDFlow improves the PSNR by $4.4$ dB and the SSIM by $0.1$ on average over GRAIN, utilizing only 74\\% of the parameters and 20\\% of the computation.

    "abstract": "Inverse imaging problems (IIPs) arise in various applications, with the main objective of reconstructing an image from its compressed measurements. This problem is often ill-posed for being under-determined with multiple interchangeably consistent solutions. The best solution inherently depends on prior knowledge or assumptions, such as the sparsity of the image. Furthermore, the reconstruction process for most IIPs relies significantly on the imaging (i.e. forward model) parameters, which might not be fully known, or the measurement device may undergo calibration drifts. These uncertainties in the forward model create substantial challenges, where inaccurate reconstructions usually happen when the postulated parameters of the forward model do not fully match the actual ones. In this work, we devoted to tackling accurate reconstruction under the context of a set of possible forward model parameters that exist. Here, we propose a novel Moment-Aggregation (MA) framework that is compatible with the popular IIP solution by using a neural network prior. Specifically, our method can reconstruct the signal by considering all candidate parameters of the forward model simultaneously during the update of the neural network. We theoretically demonstrate the convergence of the MA framework, which has a similar complexity with reconstruction under the known forward model parameters. Proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that the proposed MA achieves performance comparable to the forward model with the known precise parameter in reconstruction across both compressive sensing and phase retrieval applications, with a PSNR gap of 0.17 to 1.94 over various datasets, including MNIST, X-ray, Glas, and MoNuseg. This highlights our method's significant potential in reconstruction under an uncertain forward model. ",

However, the hyperparameters in the sampling process require subtle tuning, otherwise the results can be severely corrupted by hallucination artifacts, particularly with out-of-distribution test data. In this study, we propose a novel workflow in which SMLD results are regarded as additional priors to guide model-driven network training. First, we adopted a pretrained score network to obtain samples as preliminary guidance images (PGI) without the need for network retraining, parameter tuning and in-distribution test data. Although PGIs are corrupted by hallucination artifacts, we believe that they can provide extra information through effective denoising steps to facilitate reconstruction. Therefore, we designed a denoising module (DM) in the second step to improve the quality of PGIs. The features are extracted from the components of Langevin dynamics and the same score network with fine-tuning; hence, we can directly learn the artifact patterns. Third, we designed a model-driven network whose training is guided by denoised PGIs (DGIs). DGIs are densely connected with intermediate reconstructions in each cascade to enrich the features and are periodically updated to provide more accurate guidance. Our experiments on different sequences revealed that despite the low average quality of PGIs, the proposed workflow can effectively extract valuable information to guide the network training, even with severely reduced training data and sampling steps. Our method outperforms other cutting-edge techniques by effectively mitigating hallucination artifacts, yielding robust and high-quality reconstruction results. ",

With respect to other action recognition tasks, violence detection in surveillance videos shows additional issues, such as the presence of a significant variety of real fight scenes. Unfortunately, available datasets seem to be very small compared with other action recognition datasets. Moreover, in surveillance applications, people in the scenes always differ for each video and the background of the footage differs for each camera. Also, violent actions in real-life surveillance videos must be detected quickly to prevent unwanted consequences, thus models would definitely benefit from a reduction in memory usage and computational costs. Such problems make classical action recognition methods difficult to be adopted. To tackle all these issues, we introduce JOSENet, a novel self-supervised framework that provides outstanding performance for violence detection in surveillance videos. The proposed model receives two spatiotemporal video streams, i.e., RGB frames and optical flows, and involves a new regularized self-supervised learning approach for videos. JOSENet provides improved performance compared to self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, while requiring one-fourth of the number of frames per video segment and a reduced frame rate.

To achieve this spatial-temporal alignment, traditional methods depend on external devices to provide localization and clock signals. However, hardware-generated signals could be vulnerable to noise and potentially malicious attack, jeopardizing the precision of spatial-temporal alignment. Rather than relying on external hardwares, this work proposes a novel approach: aligning by recognizing the inherent geometric patterns within the perceptual data of various agents. Following this spirit, we propose a robust collaborative perception system that operates independently of external localization and clock devices. The key module of our system,~\\emph{FreeAlign}, constructs a salient object graph for each agent based on its detected boxes and uses a graph neural network to identify common subgraphs between agents, leading to accurate relative pose and time. We validate \\emph{FreeAlign} on both real-world and simulated datasets. The results show that, the ~\\emph{FreeAlign} empowered robust collaborative perception system perform comparably to systems relying on precise localization and clock devices. ",

    "abstract": "Currently, the generative model has garnered considerable attention due to its application in addressing the challenge of scarcity of abnormal samples in the industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, challenges persist regarding the edge deployment of generative models and the optimization of joint edge AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks. In this paper, we focus on the edge optimization of AIGC task execution and propose GMEL, a generative model-driven industrial AIGC collaborative edge learning framework. This framework aims to facilitate efficient few-shot learning by leveraging realistic sample synthesis and edge-based optimization capabilities. First, a multi-task AIGC computational offloading model is presented to ensure the efficient execution of heterogeneous AIGC tasks on edge servers. Then, we propose an attention-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMARL) algorithm aimed at refining offloading policies within the IoT system, thereby supporting generative model-driven edge learning. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in optimizing the total system latency of the edge-based AIGC task completion. ",

    "abstract": "Peer-to-Peer (P2P) content delivery, known for scalability and resilience, offers a decentralized alternative to traditional centralized Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). A significant challenge in P2P content delivery remains: the fair compensation of relayers for their bandwidth contributions. Existing solutions employ blockchains for payment settlements, however, they are not practical due to high on-chain costs and over-simplified network assumptions. In this paper, we introduce FairRelay, a fair and cost-efficient protocol that ensures all participants get fair payoff in complex content delivery network settings. We introduce a novel primitive, Enforceable Accumulative Hashed TimeLock Contract (Enforceable A-HTLC), designed to guarantee payment atomicity - ensuring all participants receive their payments upon successful content delivery. The fairness of FairRelay is proved using the Universal Composability (UC) framework. Our evaluation demonstrates that, in optimistic scenarios, FairRelay employs zero on-chain costs. In pessimistic scenarios, the on-chain dispute costs for relayers and customers are constant, irrespective of the network complexity. Specifically, empirical results indicate that the on-chain dispute costs for relayers and customers are 24,902 gas (equivalent to 0.01 USD on Optimism L2) and 290,797 gas (0.07 USD), respectively. In a 10-hop relay path, FairRelay introduces less than 1.5% additional overhead compared to pure data transmission, showcasing the efficiency of FairRelay. ",

However, DERMS controller communication lines are vulnerable to cyberattacks that could potentially impact operational reliability. While a data-driven intrusion detection system (IDS) can potentially thwart attacks during deployment, also known as the evasion attack, the training of the detection algorithm may be corrupted by adversarial data injected into the database, also known as the poisoning attack. In this paper, we propose the first framework of IDS that is robust against joint poisoning and evasion attacks. We formulate the defense mechanism as a bilevel optimization, where the inner and outer levels deal with attacks that occur during training time and testing time, respectively. We verify the robustness of our method on the IEEE-13 bus feeder model against a diverse set of poisoning and evasion attack scenarios. The results indicate that our proposed method outperforms the baseline technique in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall for intrusion detection. ",

While pretrained models from large-scale visual and audio datasets have demonstrably generalized to this task, surprisingly, no studies have explored pretrained speech models, which, as human-originated sounds, intuitively would share closer resemblance to lung sounds. This paper explores the efficacy of pretrained speech models for respiratory sound classification. We find that there is a characterization gap between speech and lung sound samples, and to bridge this gap, data augmentation is essential. However, the most widely used augmentation technique for audio and speech, SpecAugment, requires 2-dimensional spectrogram format and cannot be applied to models pretrained on speech waveforms. To address this, we propose RepAugment, an input-agnostic representation-level augmentation technique that outperforms SpecAugment, but is also suitable for respiratory sound classification with waveform pretrained models. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the SpecAugment, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the accuracy of minority disease classes, reaching up to 7.14%. ",

Traditional signature-based approaches struggle to keep pace with the sheer volume of malware samples. Machine learning offers a promising solution, but faces issues of generalization to unseen samples and a lack of explanation for the instances identified as malware. However, human-understandable explanations are especially important in security-critical fields, where understanding model decisions is crucial for trust and legal compliance. While deep learning models excel at malware detection, their black-box nature hinders explainability. Conversely, interpretable models often fall short in performance. To bridge this gap in this application domain, we propose the use of Logic Explained Networks (LENs), which are a recently proposed class of interpretable neural networks providing explanations in the form of First-Order Logic (FOL) rules. This paper extends the application of LENs to the complex domain of malware detection, specifically using the large-scale EMBER dataset. In the experimental results we show that LENs achieve robustness that exceeds traditional interpretable methods and that are rivaling black-box models. Moreover, we introduce a tailored version of LENs that is shown to generate logic explanations with higher fidelity with respect to the model's predictions. ",

We adopt a hybrid fault model in which up to $f$ nodes may suffer crash or Byzantine faults, and the dynamic message adversary chooses a communication graph for each round. We introduce a stability property of the dynamic network -- $(T,D)$-dynaDegree for $T \\geq 1$ and $n-1 \\geq D \\geq 1$ -- which requires that for every $T$ consecutive rounds, any fault-free node must have incoming directed links from at least $D$ distinct neighbors. These links might occur in different rounds during a $T$-round interval. $(1,n-1)$-dynaDegree means that the graph is a complete graph in every round. $(1,1)$-dynaDegree means that each node has at least one incoming neighbor in every round, but the set of incoming neighbor(s) at each node may change arbitrarily between rounds. We show that exact consensus is impossible even with $(1,n-2)$-dynaDegree. For an arbitrary $T$, we show that for crash-tolerant approximate consensus, $(T,\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor)$-dynaDegree and $n > 2f$ are together necessary and sufficient, whereas for Byzantine approximate consensus, $(T,\\lfloor (n+3f)/2 \\rfloor)$-dynaDegree and $n > 5f$ are together necessary and sufficient.

In the United States, the rise of e-scooters has been marked by a concerning increase in related injuries and fatalities. Recently, while deep-learning object detection holds paramount significance in autonomous vehicles to avoid potential collisions, its application in the context of e-scooters remains relatively unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of cutting-edge object detectors designed for e-scooters. To achieve this, the first comprehensive benchmark involving 22 state-of-the-art YOLO object detectors, including five versions (YOLOv3, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8), has been established for real-time traffic object detection using a self-collected dataset featuring e-scooters. The detection accuracy, measured in terms of mAP@0.5, ranges from 27.4% (YOLOv7-E6E) to 86.8% (YOLOv5s). All YOLO models, particularly YOLOv3-tiny, have displayed promising potential for real-time object detection in the context of e-scooters. Both the traffic scene dataset (https://zenodo.org/records/10578641) and software program codes (https://github.com/DongChen06/ScooterDet) for model benchmarking in this study are publicly available, which will not only improve e-scooter safety with advanced object detection but also lay the groundwork for tailored solutions, promising a safer and more sustainable urban micromobility landscape.

Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations. To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers.

Though a variety of highly optimized libraries and packages (known as DL kernels) have been developed, it is tedious and time-consuming to figure out which kernel to use, where to use, and how to use them correctly. To address this challenge, we propose an Automated Deep learning OPTimization approach called Adopter. We design a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to represent DL model architectures and leverage this DSL to specify model transformation rules required to integrate a DL kernel into a model. Given the source code of a DL model and the transformation rules for a set of kernels, Adopter first performs inter-procedural analysis to identify and express the model architecture in our DSL. Then, Adopter performs scope analysis and sub-sequence matching to identify locations in the model architecture where the transformation rules can be applied. Finally, Adopter proposes a synthesis-based code transformation method to apply the transformation rule. We curated a benchmark with 199 models from Hugging Face and a diverse set of DL kernels. We found that, compared to a state-of-the-art automated code transformation technique, Adopter helps improve the precision and recall by 3% and 56%, respectively. An in-depth analysis of 9 models revealed that on average, Adopter improved the training speed by 22.7% while decreasing the GPU memory usage by 10.5%. ",

Therefore, a plethora of compression and pruning techniques have been proposed in recent years. Low-rank decomposition techniques are among the approaches most utilized to address this problem. Compared to post-training compression, compression-promoted training is still under-explored.

This is achieved without the need to change the structure at inference time or require constrained and/or additional optimization, other than the standard weight decay regularization. Moreover, LoRITa eliminates the need to (i) initialize with pre-trained models and (ii) specify rank selection prior to training. Our experimental results (i) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using MNIST on Fully Connected Networks, CIFAR10 on Vision Transformers, and CIFAR10/100 on Convolutional Neural Networks, and (ii) illustrate that we achieve either competitive or SOTA results when compared to leading structured pruning methods in terms of FLOPs and parameters drop.

However, this alternative approach lacks a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms, including theoretical foundations and rigorous characterization of various phenomena. This work focuses on investigating how different loss functions impact the training of neural networks for solving PDEs. We discover a stable loss-jump phenomenon: when switching the loss function from the data loss to the model loss, which includes different orders of derivative information, the neural network solution significantly deviates from the exact solution immediately. Further experiments reveal that this phenomenon arises from the different frequency preferences of neural networks under different loss functions. We theoretically analyze the frequency preference of neural networks under model loss. This loss-jump phenomenon provides a valuable perspective for examining the underlying mechanisms of neural networks in solving PDEs. ",

Current methods for finding distributed Nash equilibrium require players to send original messages to their neighbors, leading to communication burden and privacy issues. To jointly address these issues, we propose an algorithm that uses stochastic compression to save communication resources and conceal information through random errors induced by compression. Our theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm guarantees convergence accuracy, even with aggressive compression errors used to protect privacy. We prove that the algorithm achieves differential privacy through a stochastic quantization scheme. Simulation results for energy consumption games support the effectiveness of our approach. ",

Opening up 6G access lowers the barrier to innovation but raises the challenge that the required communication specifications are not fully known to all service designers. As such, business innovators must either be familiar with 6G standards or consult with experts. Enabling consistent, unbiased, rapid, and low-cost requirement assessment and specification generation is crucial to the ORAN innovation ecosystem. Here, we discuss our initiative to bridge service specification generation gaps between network service providers and business innovators. We first review the state-of-the-art and motivation in 6G plug-and-play services and capabilities, potential use cases, and relevant advances in Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify an ample innovation space for hybrid use cases that may require diverse and variational wireless functionalities across its operating time. We show that the network specification can be automated and present the first automatic retrieval-augmented specification generation (RAG) framework for 6G use cases. To enable public acceptance and feedback, a website interface is also published for the research and industrial community to experiment with the RAG framework. We hope this review highlights the need and the emerging foundation models that advance this area and motivate researchers to engage with the framework. ",

Nevertheless, the primary concern remains safeguarding the confidentiality of sensitive user data while optimizing the efficiency of secure protocols. To address this, we develop a fast oblivious binarized neural network inference framework, FOBNN. Specifically, we customize binarized convolutional neural networks to enhance oblivious inference, design two fast algorithms for binarized convolutions, and optimize network structures experimentally under constrained costs. Initially, we meticulously analyze the range of intermediate values in binarized convolutions to minimize bit representation, resulting in the Bit Length Bounding (BLB) algorithm. Subsequently, leveraging the efficiency of bitwise operations in BLB, we further enhance performance by employing pure bitwise operations for each binary digit position, yielding the Layer-wise Bit Accumulation (LBA) algorithm. Theoretical analysis validates FOBNN's security and indicates up to $2 \\times$ improvement in computational and communication costs compared to the state-of-the-art method. We demonstrates our framework's effectiveness in RNA function prediction within bioinformatics. Rigorous experimental assessments confirm that our oblivious inference solutions not only maintain but often exceed the original accuracy, surpassing prior efforts. ",

    "abstract": "Effective feature interaction modeling is critical for enhancing the accuracy of click-through rate (CTR) prediction in industrial recommender systems. Most of the current deep CTR models resort to building complex network architectures to better capture intricate feature interactions or user behaviors. However, we identify two limitations in these models: (1) the samples given to the model are undifferentiated, which may lead the model to learn a larger number of easy samples in a single-minded manner while ignoring a smaller number of hard samples, thus reducing the model's generalization ability; (2) differentiated feature interaction encoders are designed to capture different interactions information but receive consistent supervision signals, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the encoder. To bridge the identified gaps, this paper introduces a novel CTR prediction framework by integrating the plug-and-play Twin Focus (TF) Loss, Sample Selection Embedding Module (SSEM), and Dynamic Fusion Module (DFM), named the Twin Focus Framework for CTR (TF4CTR). Specifically, the framework employs the SSEM at the bottom of the model to differentiate between samples, thereby assigning a more suitable encoder for each sample. Meanwhile, the TF Loss provides tailored supervision signals to both simple and complex encoders. Moreover, the DFM dynamically fuses the feature interaction information captured by the encoders, resulting in more accurate predictions. Experiments on five real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and compatibility of the framework, demonstrating its capacity to enhance various representative baselines in a model-agnostic manner.

We reformulate the HJB equations into a stochastic neural network learning process, i.e., training a control network and a value network such that the associated Hamiltonian process is minimized and the cost process becomes a martingale.To enforce the martingale property for the cost process, we employ an adversarial network and construct a loss function based on the projection property of conditional expectations. Then, the control/value networks and the adversarial network are trained adversarially, such that the cost process is driven towards a martingale and the minimum principle is satisfied for the control.Numerical results show that the proposed SOC-MartNet is effective and efficient for solving HJB-type equations and SOCP with a dimension up to $500$ in a small number of training epochs.

Existing methods aim to reconstruct STTD using low-dimensional models. However, they are limited to data-specific dimensions or source-dependent patterns, restricting them from unifying representations. Here, we present a novel paradigm to address the STTD learning problem by parameterizing STTD as an implicit neural representation. To discern the underlying dynamics in low-dimensional regimes, coordinate-based neural networks that can encode high-frequency structures are employed to directly map coordinates to traffic variables. To unravel the entangled spatial-temporal interactions, the variability is decomposed into separate processes. We further enable modeling in irregular spaces such as sensor graphs using spectral embedding. Through continuous representations, our approach enables the modeling of a variety of STTD with a unified input, thereby serving as a generalized learner of the underlying traffic dynamics. It is also shown that it can learn implicit low-rank priors and smoothness regularization from the data, making it versatile for learning different dominating data patterns. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments in real-world scenarios, showcasing applications from corridor to network scales. Empirical results not only indicate that our model has significant superiority over conventional low-rank models, but also highlight that the versatility of the approach extends to different data domains, output resolutions, and network topologies. Comprehensive model analyses provide further insight into the inductive bias of STTD. We anticipate that this pioneering modeling perspective could lay the foundation for universal representation of STTD in various real-world tasks. ",

Then, we propose a geometrically latent diffusion process that is constrained by both radial and angular geometric properties, thereby ensuring the preservation of the original topological properties in the generative graphs.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks, with frequency-domain analysis underscoring the significance of high-frequency components in influencing model predictions. Conversely, targeting low-frequency components has been effective in enhancing attack transferability on black-box models. In this study, we introduce a frequency decomposition-based feature mixing method to exploit these frequency characteristics in both clean and adversarial samples. Our findings suggest that incorporating features of clean samples into adversarial features extracted from adversarial examples is more effective in attacking normally-trained models, while combining clean features with the adversarial features extracted from low-frequency parts decomposed from the adversarial samples yields better results in attacking defense models. However, a conflict issue arises when these two mixing approaches are employed simultaneously. To tackle the issue, we propose a cross-frequency meta-optimization approach comprising the meta-train step, meta-test step, and final update. In the meta-train step, we leverage the low-frequency components of adversarial samples to boost the transferability of attacks against defense models. Meanwhile, in the meta-test step, we utilize adversarial samples to stabilize gradients, thereby enhancing the attack's transferability against normally trained models. For the final update, we update the adversarial sample based on the gradients obtained from both meta-train and meta-test steps. Our proposed method is evaluated through extensive experiments on the ImageNet-Compatible dataset, affirming its effectiveness in improving the transferability of attacks on both normally-trained CNNs and defense models.

However, the imperfect reg-model induces image-mask misalignment, poisoning the seg-model subsequently. Recent StyleSeg bypasses this bottleneck by replacing the unlabeled images with their warped copies of atlas, but needs to borrow the diverse image patterns via style transformation. Here, we present StyleSeg V2, inherited from StyleSeg but granted the ability of perceiving the registration errors. The motivation is that good registration behaves in a mirrored fashion for mirrored images. Therefore, almost at no cost, StyleSeg V2 can have reg-model itself \"speak out\" incorrectly-aligned regions by simply mirroring (symmetrically flipping the brain) its input, and the registration errors are symmetric inconsistencies between the outputs of original and mirrored inputs. Consequently, StyleSeg V2 allows the seg-model to make use of correctly-aligned regions of unlabeled images and also enhances the fidelity of style-transformed warped atlas image by weighting the local transformation strength according to registration errors. The experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our proposed StyleSeg V2 outperforms other state-of-the-arts by considerable margins, and exceeds StyleSeg by increasing the average Dice by at least 2.4%.

    "abstract": "To defend against conflict-based cache side-channel attacks, cache partitioning or remapping techniques were proposed to prevent set conflicts between different security domains or obfuscate the locations of such conflicts. But such techniques complicate cache design and may result in significant performance penalties. Therefore, there have been lightweight prefetching-based schemes proposed to introduce noise to confuse attackers' observation. However, we have validated experimentally that relying on prefetching to only introduce noise is insufficient, as attackers can still reliably distinguish the victim's cache accesses. This paper proposes a novel prefetching-based scheme, called PCG. It combines adding victim-irrelevant cache occupancy changes and reducing victim-relevant cache occupancy changes to disrupt attackers by generating noisy and indistinguishable cache access patterns. Additionally, PCG can either work independently or seamlessly be integrated with most of the commonly used prefetchers. We have implemented and evaluated PCG in both gem5 and the open-source RISC-V core BOOMv3. The evaluation results show the PCG's robust security superior to the existing solutions, while without resulting in significant performance degradation. According to the evaluation based on the SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark suite, PCG even shows an average performance improvement of about 1.64%.

Accurate diagnosis of these diseases relies heavily on advanced medical imaging techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). However, the scarcity of annotated data poses a significant challenge in deploying machine learning models for medical diagnosis. To address this limitation, deep learning techniques have shown considerable promise. Domain adaptation techniques enhance a model's ability to generalize across imaging modalities by transferring knowledge from one domain (e.g., CT images) to another (e.g., MRI images). Such cross-modality adaptation is essential to improve the ability of models to consistently generalize across different imaging modalities. This study collected relevant resources from the Kaggle website and employed the Maximum Mean Difference (MMD) method - a popular domain adaptation method - to reduce the differences between imaging domains. By combining MMD with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the accuracy and utility of the model is obviously enhanced. The excellent experimental results highlight the great potential of data-driven domain adaptation techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, especially in resource-limited environments. By bridging the gap between different imaging modalities, the study aims to provide clinicians with more reliable diagnostic tools. ",

One reason for its popularity is that Katz centrality can be computed very efficiently when the network is sparse, i.e., having only $O(n)$ edges between its $n$ nodes. While sparsity is common in practice, in some applications one faces the opposite situation of a very dense network, where only $O(n)$ potential edges are missing with respect to a complete graph. We explain why and how, even for very dense networks, it is possible to efficiently compute the ranking stemming from Katz centrality for unweighted graphs, possibly directed and possibly with loops, by working on the complement graph. Our approach also provides an interpretation, regardless of sparsity, of \"Katz centrality with negative parameter\" as usual Katz centrality on the complement graph. For weighted graphs, we provide instead an approximation method that is based on removing sufficiently many edges from the network (or from its complement), and we give sufficient conditions for this approximation to provide the correct ranking.

    "abstract": "Assessing drivers' interaction capabilities is crucial for understanding human driving behavior and enhancing the interactive abilities of autonomous vehicles. In scenarios involving strong interaction, existing metrics focused on interaction outcomes struggle to capture the evolutionary process of drivers' interactive behaviors, making it challenging for autonomous vehicles to dynamically assess and respond to other agents during interactions. To address this issue, we propose a framework for assessing drivers' interaction capabilities, oriented towards the interactive process itself, which includes three components: Interaction Risk Perception, Interaction Process Modeling, and Interaction Ability Scoring. We quantify interaction risks through motion state estimation and risk field theory, followed by introducing a dynamic action assessment benchmark based on a game-theoretical rational agent model, and designing a capability scoring metric based on morphological similarity distance. By calculating real-time differences between a driver's actions and the assessment benchmark, the driver's interaction capabilities are scored dynamically. We validated our framework at unsignalized intersections as a typical scenario. Validation analysis on driver behavior datasets from China and the USA shows that our framework effectively distinguishes and evaluates conservative and aggressive driving states during interactions, demonstrating good adaptability and effectiveness in various regional settings.

    "abstract": "Spectral graph convolutional network (SGCN) is a kind of graph neural networks (GNN) based on graph signal filters, and has shown compelling expressivity for modeling graph-structured data. Most SGCNs adopt polynomial filters and learn the coefficients from the training data. Many of them focus on which polynomial basis leads to optimal expressive power and models' architecture is little discussed. In this paper, we propose a general form in terms of spectral graph convolution, where the coefficients of polynomial basis are stored in a third-order tensor. Then, we show that the convolution block in existing SGCNs can be derived by performing a certain coefficient decomposition operation on the coefficient tensor. Based on the generalized view, we develop novel spectral graph convolutions CoDeSGC-CP and -Tucker by tensor decomposition CP and Tucker on the coefficient tensor. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed convolutions achieve favorable performance improvements. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has been demonstrated to be susceptible to backdoor attacks. However, existing academic studies on FL backdoor attacks rely on a high proportion of real clients with main task-related data, which is impractical. In the context of real-world industrial scenarios, even the simplest defense suffices to defend against the state-of-the-art attack, 3DFed. A practical FL backdoor attack remains in a nascent stage of development. To bridge this gap, we present DarkFed. Initially, we emulate a series of fake clients, thereby achieving the attacker proportion typical of academic research scenarios. Given that these emulated fake clients lack genuine training data, we further propose a data-free approach to backdoor FL. Specifically, we delve into the feasibility of injecting a backdoor using a shadow dataset. Our exploration reveals that impressive attack performance can be achieved, even when there is a substantial gap between the shadow dataset and the main task dataset. This holds true even when employing synthetic data devoid of any semantic information as the shadow dataset. Subsequently, we strategically construct a series of covert backdoor updates in an optimized manner, mimicking the properties of benign updates, to evade detection by defenses. A substantial body of empirical evidence validates the tangible effectiveness of DarkFed. ",

These explanations include a layer-wise representation of the features the model extracts from the input. Such features are represented as saliency maps generated by clustering and merging similar feature maps, to which we associate a weight derived by generalizing Grad-CAM for the proposed methodology.

However, transmitting the data to a central machine for model training is impractical due to the large data size and privacy concerns. Conversely, training on a single vehicle would limit the available data and likely result in inferior performance. To address these issues, we propose a federated learning framework for drowsiness detection within a vehicular network, leveraging the YawDD dataset.

    "abstract": "Geospatial data has been transformative for the monitoring of the Earth, yet, as in the case of (geo)physical monitoring, the measurements can have variable spatial and temporal sampling and may be associated with a significant level of perturbations degrading the signal quality. Denoising geospatial data is, therefore, essential, yet often challenging because the observations may comprise noise coming from different origins, including both environmental signals and instrumental artifacts, which are spatially and temporally correlated, thus hard to disentangle. This study addresses the denoising of multivariate time series acquired by irregularly distributed networks of sensors, requiring specific methods to handle the spatiotemporal correlation of the noise and the signal of interest. Specifically, our method focuses on the denoising of geodetic position time series, used to monitor ground displacement worldwide with centimeter- to-millimeter precision. Among the signals affecting GNSS data, slow slip events (SSEs) are of interest to seismologists. These are transients of deformation that are weakly emerging compared to other signals. Here, we design SSEdenoiser, a multi-station spatiotemporal graph-based attentive denoiser that learns latent characteristics of GNSS noise to reveal SSE-related displacement with sub-millimeter precision. It is based on the key combination of graph recurrent networks and spatiotemporal Transformers. The proposed method is applied to the Cascadia subduction zone, where SSEs occur along with bursts of tectonic tremors, a seismic rumbling identified from independent seismic recordings. The extracted events match the spatiotemporal evolution of tremors. This good space-time correlation of the denoised GNSS signals with the tremors validates the proposed denoising procedure. ",

Available parametric methods are limited in their model space, while previous semiparametric methods, e.g., leveraging neural networks to fit only one single nuisance function, may still encounter misspecification problems under networked interference without appropriate assumptions on the data generation process. To mitigate bias stemming from misspecification, we propose a novel doubly robust causal effect estimator under networked interference, by adapting the targeted learning technique to the training of neural networks. Specifically, we generalize the targeted learning technique into the networked interference setting and establish the condition under which an estimator achieves double robustness. Based on the condition, we devise an end-to-end causal effect estimator by transforming the identified theoretical condition into a targeted loss. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of our designed estimator, revealing a faster convergence rate compared to a single nuisance model. Extensive experimental results on two real-world networks with semisynthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed estimators. ",

    "abstract": "This paper delves into the task of arbitrary modality salient object detection (AM SOD), aiming to detect salient objects from arbitrary modalities, eg RGB images, RGB-D images, and RGB-D-T images. A novel modality-adaptive Transformer (MAT) will be proposed to investigate two fundamental challenges of AM SOD, ie more diverse modality discrepancies caused by varying modality types that need to be processed, and dynamic fusion design caused by an uncertain number of modalities present in the inputs of multimodal fusion strategy. Specifically, inspired by prompt learning's ability of aligning the distributions of pre-trained models to the characteristic of downstream tasks by learning some prompts, MAT will first present a modality-adaptive feature extractor (MAFE) to tackle the diverse modality discrepancies by introducing a modality prompt for each modality. In the training stage, a new modality translation contractive (MTC) loss will be further designed to assist MAFE in learning those modality-distinguishable modality prompts. Accordingly, in the testing stage, MAFE can employ those learned modality prompts to adaptively adjust its feature space according to the characteristics of the input modalities, thus being able to extract discriminative unimodal features. Then, MAFE will present a channel-wise and spatial-wise fusion hybrid (CSFH) strategy to meet the demand for dynamic fusion. For that, CSFH dedicates a channel-wise dynamic fusion module (CDFM) and a novel spatial-wise dynamic fusion module (SDFM) to fuse the unimodal features from varying numbers of modalities and meanwhile effectively capture cross-modal complementary semantic and detail information, respectively. Moreover, CSFH will carefully align CDFM and SDFM to different levels of unimodal features based on their characteristics for more effective complementary information exploitation. ",

    "abstract": "Toward desirable saliency prediction, the types and numbers of inputs for a salient object detection (SOD) algorithm may dynamically change in many real-life applications. However, existing SOD algorithms are mainly designed or trained for one particular type of inputs, failing to be generalized to other types of inputs. Consequentially, more types of SOD algorithms need to be prepared in advance for handling different types of inputs, raising huge hardware and research costs. Differently, in this paper, we propose a new type of SOD task, termed Arbitrary Modality SOD (AM SOD). The most prominent characteristics of AM SOD are that the modality types and modality numbers will be arbitrary or dynamically changed. The former means that the inputs to the AM SOD algorithm may be arbitrary modalities such as RGB, depths, or even any combination of them. While, the latter indicates that the inputs may have arbitrary modality numbers as the input type is changed, e.g. single-modality RGB image, dual-modality RGB-Depth (RGB-D) images or triple-modality RGB-Depth-Thermal (RGB-D-T) images. Accordingly, a preliminary solution to the above challenges, \\i.e. a modality switch network (MSN), is proposed in this paper. In particular, a modality switch feature extractor (MSFE) is first designed to extract discriminative features from each modality effectively by introducing some modality indicators, which will generate some weights for modality switching. Subsequently, a dynamic fusion module (DFM) is proposed to adaptively fuse features from a variable number of modalities based on a novel Transformer structure. Finally, a new dataset, named AM-XD, is constructed to facilitate research on AM SOD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AM SOD method can effectively cope with changes in the type and number of input modalities for robust salient object detection. ",

Existing explainable systems generate veracity justifications from investigative journalism, which suffer from debunking delayed and low efficiency.

However, the opinions typically contain some inaccurate or biased information since the wisdom of crowds is uncensored. To detect fake news from a sea of diverse, crowded and even competing narratives, in this paper, we propose a novel defense-based explainable fake news detection framework. Specifically, we first propose an evidence extraction module to split the wisdom of crowds into two competing parties and respectively detect salient evidences. To gain concise insights from evidences, we then design a prompt-based module that utilizes a large language model to generate justifications by inferring reasons towards two possible veracities. Finally, we propose a defense-based inference module to determine veracity via modeling the defense among these justifications.

In this paper, we propose a method for learning UDFs that improves the fidelity of the obtained Neural UDF to the original 3D surface. The key idea of our method is to concentrate the learning effort of the Neural UDF on surface edges. More precisely, we show that sampling more training points around surface edges allows better local accuracy of the trained Neural UDF, and thus improves the global expressiveness of the Neural UDF in terms of Hausdorff distance. To detect surface edges, we propose a new statistical method based on the calculation of a $p$-value at each point on the surface.

In our previous work, EMF exposure map reconstruction was achieved by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) where physical laws or structural constraints were employed as a prior, but they require a large amount of labeled data or simulated full maps for training to produce efficient results. In this paper, we present a method to reconstruct EMF exposure maps using only the generator network in GANs which does not require explicit training, thus overcoming the limitations of GANs, such as using reference full exposure maps.

    "abstract": "This work studies ensemble learning for graph neural networks (GNNs) under the popular semi-supervised setting. Ensemble learning has shown superiority in improving the accuracy and robustness of traditional machine learning by combining the outputs of multiple weak learners. However, adopting a similar idea to integrate different GNN models is challenging because of two reasons. First, GNN is notorious for its poor inference ability, so naively assembling multiple GNN models would deteriorate the inference efficiency. Second, when GNN models are trained with few labeled nodes, their performance are limited. In this case, the vanilla ensemble approach, e.g., majority vote, may be sub-optimal since most base models, i.e., GNNs, may make the wrong predictions. To this end, in this paper, we propose an efficient ensemble learner--E2GNN to assemble multiple GNNs in a learnable way by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled nodes. Specifically, we first pre-train different GNN models on a given data scenario according to the labeled nodes. Next, instead of directly combing their outputs for label inference, we train a simple multi-layer perceptron--MLP model to mimic their predictions on both labeled and unlabeled nodes. Then the unified MLP model is deployed to infer labels for unlabeled or new nodes. Since the predictions of unlabeled nodes from different GNN models may be incorrect, we develop a reinforced discriminator to effectively filter out those wrongly predicted nodes to boost the performance of MLP. By doing this, we suggest a principled approach to tackle the inference issues of GNN ensembles and maintain the merit of ensemble learning: improved performance. Comprehensive experiments over both transductive and inductive settings, across different GNN backbones and 8 benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superiority of E2GNN. ",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the performance of pre-trained neural networks in medical image segmentation using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, specifically Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). We present the concept of Implantable Adaptive Cell (IAC), small but powerful modules identified through Partially-Connected DARTS, designed to be injected into the skip connections of an existing and already trained U-shaped model. Our strategy allows for the seamless integration of the IAC into the pre-existing architecture, thereby enhancing its performance without necessitating a complete retraining from scratch. The empirical studies, focusing on medical image segmentation tasks, demonstrate the efficacy of this method. The integration of specialized IAC cells into various configurations of the U-Net model increases segmentation accuracy by almost 2\\% points on average for the validation dataset and over 3\\% points for the training dataset. The findings of this study not only offer a cost-effective alternative to the complete overhaul of complex models for performance upgrades but also indicate the potential applicability of our method to other architectures and problem domains.

    "title": "DBDH: A Dual-Branch Dual-Head Neural Network for Invisible Embedded  Regions Localization",
    "abstract": "Embedding invisible hyperlinks or hidden codes in images to replace QR codes has become a hot topic recently. This technology requires first localizing the embedded region in the captured photos before decoding. Existing methods that train models to find the invisible embedded region struggle to obtain accurate localization results, leading to degraded decoding accuracy. This limitation is primarily because the CNN network is sensitive to low-frequency signals, while the embedded signal is typically in the high-frequency form. Based on this, this paper proposes a Dual-Branch Dual-Head (DBDH) neural network tailored for the precise localization of invisible embedded regions. Specifically, DBDH uses a low-level texture branch containing 62 high-pass filters to capture the high-frequency signals induced by embedding. A high-level context branch is used to extract discriminative features between the embedded and normal regions. DBDH employs a detection head to directly detect the four vertices of the embedding region. In addition, we introduce an extra segmentation head to segment the mask of the embedding region during training. The segmentation head provides pixel-level supervision for model learning, facilitating better learning of the embedded signals. Based on two state-of-the-art invisible offline-to-online messaging methods, we construct two datasets and augmentation strategies for training and testing localization models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DBDH over existing methods. ",

    "abstract": "Modern image processing tools have made it easy for attackers to crop the region or object of interest in images and paste it into other images. The challenge this cropping-paste attack poses to the watermarking technology is that it breaks the synchronization of the image watermark, introducing multiple superimposed desynchronization distortions, such as rotation, scaling, and translation. However, current watermarking methods can only resist a single type of desynchronization and cannot be applied to protect the object's copyright under the cropping-paste attack. With the finding that the key to resisting the cropping-paste attack lies in robust features of the object to protect, this paper proposes a self-synchronizing object-aligned watermarking method, called SSyncOA. Specifically, we first constrain the watermarked region to be aligned with the protected object, and then synchronize the watermark's translation, rotation, and scaling distortions by normalizing the object invariant features, i.e., its centroid, principal orientation, and minimum bounding square, respectively. To make the watermark embedded in the protected object, we introduce the object-aligned watermarking model, which incorporates the real cropping-paste attack into the encoder-noise layer-decoder pipeline and is optimized end-to-end. Besides, we illustrate the effect of different desynchronization distortions on the watermark training, which confirms the necessity of the self-synchronization process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over other SOTAs. ",

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanism in GTs has limited their scalability, and previous approaches to address this issue often suffer from expressiveness degradation or lack of versatility. To address this issue, we propose AnchorGT, a novel attention architecture for GTs with global receptive field and almost linear complexity, which serves as a flexible building block to improve the scalability of a wide range of GT models. Inspired by anchor-based GNNs, we employ structurally important $k$-dominating node set as anchors and design an attention mechanism that focuses on the relationship between individual nodes and anchors, while retaining the global receptive field for all nodes. With its intuitive design, AnchorGT can easily replace the attention module in various GT models with different network architectures and structural encodings, resulting in reduced computational overhead without sacrificing performance. In addition, we theoretically prove that AnchorGT attention can be strictly more expressive than Weisfeiler-Lehman test, showing its superiority in representing graph structures. Our experiments on three state-of-the-art GT models demonstrate that their AnchorGT variants can achieve better results while being faster and significantly more memory efficient. ",

    "abstract": "Approximate graph pattern mining (A-GPM) is an important data analysis tool for many graph-based applications. There exist sampling-based A-GPM systems to provide automation and generalization over a wide variety of use cases. However, there are two major obstacles that prevent existing A-GPM systems being adopted in practice. First, the termination mechanism that decides when to end sampling lacks theoretical backup on confidence, and is unstable and slow in practice. Second, they suffer poor performance when dealing with the \"needle-in-the-hay\" cases, because a huge number of samples are required to converge, given the extremely low hit rate of their fixed sampling schemes. We build ScaleGPM, an accurate and fast A-GPM system that removes the two obstacles. First, we propose a novel on-the-fly convergence detection mechanism to achieve stable termination and provide theoretical guarantee on the confidence, with negligible overhead. Second, we propose two techniques to deal with the \"needle-in-the-hay\" problem, eager-verify and hybrid sampling. Our eager-verify method improves sampling hit rate by pruning unpromising candidates as early as possible. Hybrid sampling improves performance by automatically choosing the better scheme between fine-grained and coarse-grained sampling schemes. Experiments show that our online convergence detection mechanism can detect convergence and results in stable and rapid termination with theoretically guaranteed confidence. We show the effectiveness of eager-verify in improving the hit rate, and the scheme-selection mechanism in correctly choosing the better scheme for various cases. Overall, ScaleGPM achieves a geomean average of 565x (up to 610169x) speedup over the state-of-the-art A-GPM system, Arya. In particular, ScaleGPM handles billion-scale graphs in seconds, where existing systems either run out of memory or fail to complete in hours. ",

To address this issue, we first propose a generalized loss framework based on expected risk minimization to provide soft pseudo labels, and point out that the former losses can be seamlessly converted into our framework. In particular, we design a novel robust loss based on our framework, which enjoys flexible coordination between false positives and false negatives, and can additionally deal with the imbalance between positive and negative samples.

Recent work has demonstrated that gradient inversion attacks can exploit the gradients of FL to recreate the original user data, posing significant privacy risks. However, these attacks make strong assumptions about the attacker, such as altering the model structure or parameters, gaining batch normalization statistics, or acquiring prior knowledge of the original training set, etc. Consequently, these attacks are not possible in real-world scenarios. To end it, we propose a novel Gradient Inversion attack based on Style Migration Network (GI-SMN), which breaks through the strong assumptions made by previous gradient inversion attacks. The optimization space is reduced by the refinement of the latent code and the use of regular terms to facilitate gradient matching. GI-SMN enables the reconstruction of user data with high similarity in batches. Experimental results have demonstrated that GI-SMN outperforms state-of-the-art gradient inversion attacks in both visual effect and similarity metrics. Additionally, it also can overcome gradient pruning and differential privacy defenses. ",

Particularly, application-layer tasks of file delivery and delay-sensitive communication, e.g., screen projection, in a WLAN with enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mechanism, are jointly scheduled by adjusting the contention window sizes and application-layer throughput limitation, such that their QoS, including the throughput of file delivery and the round trip time of the delay-sensitive communication, can be optimized. Due to the unknown interference and vendor-dependent implementation of the network interface card, the relation between the scheduling policy and the system QoS is unknown. Hence, a reinforcement learning method is proposed, in which a novel Q-network is trained to map from the historical scheduling parameters and QoS observations to the current scheduling action. It is demonstrated on a testbed that the proposed framework can achieve a significantly better QoS than the conventional EDCA mechanism. ",

Recently, attention-based methods have exhibited significant progress which align visual features and attributes via a spatial attention mechanism. However, these methods only explore visual-semantic relationship in the spatial dimension, which can lead to classification ambiguity when different attributes share similar attention regions, and semantic relationship between attributes is rarely discussed. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a Dual Relation Mining Network (DRMN) to enable more effective visual-semantic interactions and learn semantic relationship among attributes for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Attention Block (DAB) for visual-semantic relationship mining, which enriches visual information by multi-level feature fusion and conducts spatial attention for visual to semantic embedding. Moreover, an attribute-guided channel attention is utilized to decouple entangled semantic features. For semantic relationship modeling, we utilize a Semantic Interaction Transformer (SIT) to enhance the generalization of attribute representations among images. Additionally, a global classification branch is introduced as a complement to human-defined semantic attributes, and we then combine the results with attribute-based classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRMN leads to new state-of-the-art performances on three standard ZSL benchmarks, i.e., CUB, SUN, and AwA2. ",

LLMs recently became essential to increase the productivity of software developers and decrease the time and cost of software development. Developers ranging from novices to experts use LLM tools not only to detect and patch bugs, but also to integrate generated code into their software. However, as of today there is no objective assessment of the energy efficiency of the source code generated by LLM tools. Released in August 2023, Code Llama is one of the most recent LLM tools. Goal. In this paper, we present an empirical study that assesses the energy efficiency of Code Llama with respect to human-written source code. Method. We design an experiment involving three human-written benchmarks implemented in C++, JavaScript, and Python. We ask Code Llama to generate the code of the benchmarks using different prompts and temperatures. Therefore, we execute both implementations and profile their energy efficiency. Results. Our study shows that the energy efficiency of code generated by Code Llama is heavily-dependent on the chosen programming language and the specific code problem at hand. Also, human implementations tend to be more energy efficient overall, with generated JavaScript code outperforming its human counterpart. Moreover, explicitly asking Code Llama to generate energy-efficient code results in an equal or worse energy efficiency, as well as using different temperatures seems not to affect the energy efficiency of generated code. Conclusions. According to our results, code generated using Code Llama does not guarantee energy efficiency, even when prompted to do so. Therefore, software developers should evaluate the energy efficiency of generated code before integrating it into the software system under development. ",

    "abstract": "The security of integrated circuits (ICs) can be broken by sophisticated physical attacks relying on failure analysis methods. Optical probing is one of the most prominent examples of such attacks, which can be accomplished in a matter of days, even with limited knowledge of the IC under attack. Unfortunately, few countermeasures are proposed in the literature, and none has been fabricated and tested in practice. These countermeasures usually require changing the standard cell libraries and, thus, are incompatible with digital and programmable platforms, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In this work, we shift our attention from preventing the attack to detecting and responding to it. We introduce LaserEscape, the first fully digital and FPGA-compatible countermeasure to detect and mitigate optical probing attacks. LaserEscape incorporates digital delay-based sensors to reliably detect the physical alteration on the fabric caused by laser beam irradiations in real time. Furthermore, as a response to the attack, LaserEscape deploys real-time hiding approaches using randomized hardware reconfigurability. It realizes 1) moving target defense (MTD) to physically move the sensitive circuity under attack out of the probing field of focus to protect secret keys and 2) polymorphism to logically obfuscate the functionality of the targeted circuit to counter function extraction and reverse engineering attempts. We demonstrate the effectiveness and resiliency of our approach by performing optical probing attacks on protected and unprotected designs on a 28-nm FPGA. Our results show that optical probing attacks can be reliably detected and mitigated without interrupting the chip's operation. ",

    "abstract": "Existing neural field-based SLAM methods typically employ a single monolithic field as their scene representation. This prevents efficient incorporation of loop closure constraints and limits scalability. To address these shortcomings, we propose a neural mapping framework which anchors lightweight neural fields to the pose graph of a sparse visual SLAM system. Our approach shows the ability to integrate large-scale loop closures, while limiting necessary reintegration. Furthermore, we verify the scalability of our approach by demonstrating successful building-scale mapping taking multiple loop closures into account during the optimization, and show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on large scenes in terms of quality and runtime.

The key idea is to tailor a module for each dataset to intelligently decide when an object tracker is failing and so humans should be brought in to re-localize an object for continued tracking. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning on unlabeled videos to learn a tailored representation for a target object that is then used to actively monitor its tracked region and decide when the tracker fails. Since labeled data is not needed, our approach can be applied to novel object categories. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate our method outperforms existing approaches, especially for small, fast moving, or occluded objects. ",

Training classifiers robust to spurious correlations typically relies on annotations of spurious correlations in data, which are often expensive to get. In this paper, we tackle an annotation-free setting and propose a self-guided spurious correlation mitigation framework. Our framework automatically constructs fine-grained training labels tailored for a classifier obtained with empirical risk minimization to improve its robustness against spurious correlations. The fine-grained training labels are formulated with different prediction behaviors of the classifier identified in a novel spuriousness embedding space. We construct the space with automatically detected conceptual attributes and a novel spuriousness metric which measures how likely a class-attribute correlation is exploited for predictions. We demonstrate that training the classifier to distinguish different prediction behaviors reduces its reliance on spurious correlations without knowing them a priori and outperforms prior methods on five real-world datasets.

However, due to this sensitivity, a small outlier mass can also cause a significant increase in the $2$-Wasserstein distance between two similar distributions. Similarly, sampling discrepancy can cause the empirical $2$-Wasserstein distance on $n$ samples in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to converge to the true distance at a rate of $n^{-1/4}$, which is significantly slower than the rate of $n^{-1/2}$ for $1$-Wasserstein distance. We introduce a new family of distances parameterized by $k \\ge 0$, called $k$-RPW, that is based on computing the partial $2$-Wasserstein distance. We show that (1) $k$-RPW satisfies the metric properties, (2) $k$-RPW is robust to small outlier mass while retaining the sensitivity of $2$-Wasserstein distance to minor geometric differences, and (3) when $k$ is a constant, $k$-RPW distance between empirical distributions on $n$ samples in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ converges to the true distance at a rate of $n^{-1/3}$, which is faster than the convergence rate of $n^{-1/4}$ for the $2$-Wasserstein distance. Using the partial $p$-Wasserstein distance, we extend our distance to any $p \\in [1,\\infty]$. By setting parameters $k$ or $p$ appropriately, we can reduce our distance to the total variation, $p$-Wasserstein, and the L\\'evy-Prokhorov distances. Experiments show that our distance function achieves higher accuracy in comparison to the $1$-Wasserstein, $2$-Wasserstein, and TV distances for image retrieval tasks on noisy real-world data sets.

    "abstract": "Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is most known for achieving state-of the-art performances on natural image and language tasks. However, its most pronounced improvements (of tens of percent) is rather in the presence of label noise. Understanding SAM's label noise robustness requires a departure from characterizing the robustness of minimas lying in \"flatter\" regions of the loss landscape. In particular, the peak performance under label noise occurs with early stopping, far before the loss converges. We decompose SAM's robustness into two effects: one induced by changes to the logit term and the other induced by changes to the network Jacobian. The first can be observed in linear logistic regression where SAM provably up-weights the gradient contribution from clean examples. Although this explicit up-weighting is also observable in neural networks, when we intervene and modify SAM to remove this effect, surprisingly, we see no visible degradation in performance. We infer that SAM's effect in deeper networks is instead explained entirely by the effect SAM has on the network Jacobian. We theoretically derive the implicit regularization induced by this Jacobian effect in two layer linear networks. Motivated by our analysis, we see that cheaper alternatives to SAM that explicitly induce these regularization effects largely recover the benefits in deep networks trained on real-world datasets. ",

These models have the potential to be deployed in real-world applications such as robotics, AI assistants, medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles. The widespread adoption of Video-LMMs in our daily lives underscores the importance of ensuring and evaluating their robust performance in mirroring human-like reasoning and interaction capabilities in complex, real-world contexts. However, existing benchmarks for Video-LMMs primarily focus on general video comprehension abilities and neglect assessing their reasoning capabilities over complex videos in the real-world context, and robustness of these models through the lens of user prompts as text queries. In this paper, we present the Complex Video Reasoning and Robustness Evaluation Suite (CVRR-ES), a novel benchmark that comprehensively assesses the performance of Video-LMMs across 11 diverse real-world video dimensions. We evaluate 9 recent models, including both open-source and closed-source variants, and find that most of the Video-LMMs, {especially open-source ones,} struggle with robustness and reasoning when dealing with complex videos. Based on our analysis, we develop a training-free Dual-Step Contextual Prompting (DSCP) technique to enhance the performance of existing Video-LMMs. Our findings provide valuable insights for building the next generation of human-centric AI systems with advanced robustness and reasoning capabilities.

    "abstract": "The multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method is highly efficient for estimating expectations of a functional of a solution to a stochastic differential equation (SDE). However, MLMC estimators may be unstable and have a poor (noncanonical) complexity in the case of low regularity of the functional. To overcome this issue, we extend our previously introduced idea of numerical smoothing in (Quantitative Finance, 23(2), 209-227, 2023), in the context of deterministic quadrature methods to the MLMC setting. The numerical smoothing technique is based on root-finding methods combined with one-dimensional numerical integration with respect to a single well-chosen variable. This study is motivated by the computation of probabilities of events, pricing options with a discontinuous payoff, and density estimation problems for dynamics where the discretization of the underlying stochastic processes is necessary. The analysis and numerical experiments reveal that the numerical smoothing significantly improves the strong convergence, and consequently, the complexity and robustness (by making the kurtosis at deep levels bounded) of the MLMC method. In particular, we show that numerical smoothing enables recovering the MLMC complexities obtained for Lipschitz functionals due to the optimal variance decay rate when using the Euler--Maruyama scheme. For the Milstein scheme, numerical smoothing recovers the canonical MLMC complexity even for the nonsmooth integrand mentioned above. Finally, our approach efficiently estimates univariate and multivariate density functions. ",

The proposed method, BCNN, is composed of two main modules. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained with images of the different classes of galaxies (image augmentation is carried out to balance some classes); the CNN outputs the probability for each class of the hierarchy, and its outputs/predictions feed the second module. The second module consists of a Bayesian network that represents the hierarchy and helps to improve the prediction accuracy by combining the predictions of the first phase while maintaining the hierarchical constraint (in a hierarchy, an instance associated with a node must be associated to all its ancestors), through probabilistic inference over the Bayesian network so that a consistent prediction is obtained. Different images from the Hubble telescope have been collected and labeled by experts, which are used to perform the experiments. The results show that BCNN performed better than several CNNs in multiple evaluation measures, reaching the next scores: 67% in exact match, 78% in accuracy, and 83% in hierarchical F-measure. ",

OCD problem find a wide variety of applications in diverse areas, e.g., security detection in smart grids and intrusion detection in communication networks. Prior research usually assumes precise knowledge of the parameters linked to the data stream. Nevertheless, this presumption often proves unattainable in practical scenarios due to factors such as estimation errors, system updates, etc. This paper aims to take the first attempt to develop a triadic-OCD framework with certifiable robustness, provable optimality, and guaranteed convergence. In addition, the proposed triadic-OCD algorithm can be realized in a fully asynchronous distributed manner, easing the necessity of transmitting the data to a single server. This asynchronous mechanism also could mitigate the straggler issue that faced by traditional synchronous algorithm. We then analyze the non-asymptotic convergence property of triadic-OCD and derive its iteration complexity to achieve an $\\epsilon$-optimal point. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

However, these assumptions prove impractical in large-scale networks. In this paper, we present a pragmatic perspective by exploring two minimal asynchronous protocols: a parallel scheme generating entanglement independently at the link level, and a sequential scheme extending entanglement iteratively from one party to the other. Our analysis incorporates non-uniform repeater spacings and classical communications and accounts for quantum memory decoherence. We evaluate network performance using metrics such as entanglement bit rate, end-to-end fidelity, and secret key rate for entanglement-based quantum key distribution. Our findings suggest the sequential scheme's superiority due to comparable performance with the parallel scheme, coupled with simpler implementation. Additionally, we propose a cutoff strategy to improve performance by discarding attempts with prolonged memory idle time, effectively eliminating low-quality entanglement links. Finally, we apply our methods to the real-world topology of SURFnet and report the performance as a function of memory coherence time. ",

Two additional agents are considered: trend investors use a deep convolutional neural network paired with a deep Q-learning framework to inform trading decisions by analysing price history; and value investors use a static price-target to determine their trade directions and sizes. We demonstrate that our novel inclusion of a network topology with market makers facilitates explorations into various market structures. First, we present the model and an overview of its mechanics. Second, we validate our findings via comparison to the real-world: we demonstrate a fat-tailed distribution of price changes, auto-correlated volatility, a skew negatively correlated to market maker positioning, predictable price-history patterns and more. Finally, we demonstrate that our network-based model can lend insights into the effect of market-structure on price-action. For example, we show that markets with sparsely connected intermediaries can have a critical point of fragmentation, beyond which the market forms distinct clusters and arbitrage becomes rapidly possible between the prices of different market makers.

Harmful space weather events can trigger atmospheric changes that result in physical and economic damages on a global scale. In 1989, Earth experienced the effects of a powerful geomagnetic storm that caused satellites to malfunction, while triggering power blackouts in Canada, along with electricity disturbances in the United States and Europe. With the solar cycle peak rapidly approaching, there is an ever-increasing need to prepare and prevent the damages that can occur, especially to modern-day technology, calling for the need of a comprehensive prediction system. This study aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict instances of space weather (solar flares, coronal mass ejections, geomagnetic storms), based on active region magnetograms of the Sun. This was done through the use of the NASA DONKI service to determine when these solar events occur, then using data from the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory to compile a dataset that includes magnetograms of active regions of the Sun 24 hours before the events. By inputting the magnetograms into a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained from this dataset, it can serve to predict whether a space weather event will occur, and what type of event it will be. The model was designed using a custom architecture CNN, and returned an accuracy of 90.27%, a precision of 85.83%, a recall of 91.78%, and an average F1 score of 92.14% across each class (Solar flare [Flare], geomagnetic storm [GMS], coronal mass ejection [CME]).

This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p < 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity.

    "abstract": "To support mechanism online learning and facilitate digital twin development for biomanufacturing processes, this paper develops an efficient Bayesian inference approach for partially observed enzymatic stochastic reaction network (SRN), a fundamental building block of multi-scale bioprocess mechanistic model. To tackle the critical challenges brought by the nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs)-based mechanistic model with partially observed state and having measurement error, an interpretable Bayesian updating linear noise approximation (LNA) metamodel, incorporating the structure information of the mechanistic model, is proposed to approximate the likelihood of observations. Then, an efficient posterior sampling approach is developed by utilizing the gradients of the derived likelihood to speed up the convergence of MCMC. The empirical study demonstrates that the proposed approach has a promising performance. ",

    "abstract": "Brain tumor segmentation is a fundamental step in assessing a patient's cancer progression. However, manual segmentation demands significant expert time to identify tumors in 3D multimodal brain MRI scans accurately. This reliance on manual segmentation makes the process prone to intra- and inter-observer variability. This work proposes a brain tumor segmentation method as part of the BraTS-GoAT challenge. The task is to segment tumors in brain MRI scans automatically from various populations, such as adults, pediatrics, and underserved sub-Saharan Africa. We employ a recent CNN architecture for medical image segmentation, namely MedNeXt, as our baseline, and we implement extensive model ensembling and postprocessing for inference. Our experiments show that our method performs well on the unseen validation set with an average DSC of 85.54% and HD95 of 27.88.

    "abstract": "Medical imaging is limited by acquisition time and scanning equipment. CT and MR volumes, reconstructed with thicker slices, are anisotropic with high in-plane resolution and low through-plane resolution. We reveal an intriguing phenomenon that due to the mentioned nature of data, performing slice-wise interpolation from the axial view can yield greater benefits than performing super-resolution from other views. Based on this observation, we propose an Inter-Intra-slice Interpolation Network (I$^3$Net), which fully explores information from high in-plane resolution and compensates for low through-plane resolution. The through-plane branch supplements the limited information contained in low through-plane resolution from high in-plane resolution and enables continual and diverse feature learning. In-plane branch transforms features to the frequency domain and enforces an equal learning opportunity for all frequency bands in a global context learning paradigm. We further propose a cross-view block to take advantage of the information from all three views online. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of I$^3$Net, and noticeably outperforms state-of-the-art super-resolution, video frame interpolation and slice interpolation methods by a large margin. We achieve 43.90dB in PSNR, with at least 1.14dB improvement under the upscale factor of $\\times$2 on MSD dataset with faster inference.

Introducing a summation operator to capture common devices that appear in applications -- such as the $do$-calculus of Pearl (2009) for causal inference, which makes ample use of marginalization -- van der Zander et al. (2023) partially extend these earlier complexity results to causal and probabilistic languages with marginalization. We complete this extension, fully characterizing the complexity of probabilistic and causal reasoning with summation, demonstrating that these again remain equally difficult. Surprisingly, allowing free variables for random variable values results in a system that is undecidable, so long as the ranges of these random variables are unrestricted. We finally axiomatize these languages featuring marginalization (or more generally summation), resolving open questions posed by Ibeling et al. (2023). ",

Since the subgroup structure is typically unknown, it is more challenging to identify and evaluate subgroup effects than population effects. We propose a new solution to this problem: Causal k-Means Clustering, which harnesses the widely-used k-means clustering algorithm to uncover the unknown subgroup structure. Our problem differs significantly from the conventional clustering setup since the variables to be clustered are unknown counterfactual functions. We present a plug-in estimator which is simple and readily implementable using off-the-shelf algorithms, and study its rate of convergence. We also develop a new bias-corrected estimator based on nonparametric efficiency theory and double machine learning, and show that this estimator achieves fast root-n rates and asymptotic normality in large nonparametric models. Our proposed methods are especially useful for modern outcome-wide studies with multiple treatment levels. Further, our framework is extensible to clustering with generic pseudo-outcomes, such as partially observed outcomes or otherwise unknown functions. Finally, we explore finite sample properties via simulation, and illustrate the proposed methods in a study of treatment programs for adolescent substance abuse. ",

By leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the convex F-DRO model, we formulate I-DRO as a bi-linear program, which can be solved using off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Additionally, this formulation exhibits several advantageous properties. We demonstrate that I-DRO not only guarantees the existence and uniqueness of an optimal solution but also establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for this optimal solution to accurately match the actual conservativeness level in F-DRO. Furthermore, we identify three extreme scenarios that may impact I-DRO effectiveness. Our case study applies F-DRO for power system scheduling under uncertainty and employs I-DRO to recover the conservativeness level of system operators. Numerical experiments based on an IEEE 5-bus system and a realistic NYISO 11-zone system demonstrate I-DRO performance in both normal and extreme scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "With the growing amount of astronomical data, there is an increasing need for automated data processing pipelines, which can extract scientific information from observation data without human interventions. A critical aspect of these pipelines is the image quality evaluation and masking algorithm, which evaluates image qualities based on various factors such as cloud coverage, sky brightness, scattering light from the optical system, point spread function size and shape, and read-out noise. Occasionally, the algorithm requires masking of areas severely affected by noise. However, the algorithm often necessitates significant human interventions, reducing data processing efficiency. In this study, we present a deep learning based image quality evaluation algorithm that uses an autoencoder to learn features of high quality astronomical images. The trained autoencoder enables automatic evaluation of image quality and masking of noise affected areas. We have evaluated the performance of our algorithm using two test cases: images with point spread functions of varying full width half magnitude, and images with complex backgrounds. In the first scenario, our algorithm could effectively identify variations of the point spread functions, which can provide valuable reference information for photometry. In the second scenario, our method could successfully mask regions affected by complex regions, which could significantly increase the photometry accuracy. Our algorithm can be employed to automatically evaluate image quality obtained by different sky surveying projects, further increasing the speed and robustness of data processing pipelines. ",

    "abstract": "The ability to detect when a system undergoes an incipient fault is of paramount importance in preventing a critical failure. In this work, we propose an information-driven fault detection method based on a novel concept drift detector. The method is tailored to identifying drifts in input-output relationships of additive noise models (i.e., model drifts) and is based on a distribution-free mutual information (MI) estimator. Our scheme does not require prior faulty examples and can be applied distribution-free over a large class of system models. Our core contributions are twofold. First, we demonstrate the connection between fault detection, model drift detection, and testing independence between two random variables. Second, we prove several theoretical properties of the proposed MI-based fault detection scheme: (i) strong consistency, (ii) exponentially fast detection of the non-faulty case, and (iii) control of both significance levels and power of the test. To conclude, we validate our theory with synthetic data and the benchmark dataset N-CMAPSS of aircraft turbofan engines. These empirical results support the usefulness of our methodology in many practical and realistic settings, and the theoretical results show performance guarantees that other methods cannot offer. ",
