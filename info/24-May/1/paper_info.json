    "abstract": "Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) task aims to recognize generic, taxonomy-free boundaries that segment a video into meaningful events. Current methods typically involve a neural model trained on a large volume of data, demanding substantial computational power and storage space. We explore two pivotal questions pertaining to GEBD: Can non-parametric algorithms outperform unsupervised neural methods? Does motion information alone suffice for high performance? This inquiry drives us to algorithmically harness motion cues for identifying generic event boundaries in videos. In this work, we propose FlowGEBD, a non-parametric, unsupervised technique for GEBD. Our approach entails two algorithms utilizing optical flow: (i) Pixel Tracking and (ii) Flow Normalization. By conducting thorough experimentation on the challenging Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets, our results establish FlowGEBD as the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among unsupervised methods. FlowGEBD exceeds the neural models on the Kinetics-GEBD dataset by obtaining an F1@0.05 score of 0.713 with an absolute gain of 31.7% compared to the unsupervised baseline and achieves an average F1 score of 0.623 on the TAPOS validation dataset.

    "abstract": "One of the prime problems of computer science and machine learning is to extract information efficiently from large-scale, heterogeneous data. Text data, with its syntax, semantics, and even hidden information content, possesses an exceptional place among the data types in concern. The processing of the text data requires embedding, a method of translating the content of the text to numeric vectors. A correct embedding algorithm is the starting point for obtaining the full information content of the text data. In this work, a new embedding method based on the graph structure of the meaningful sentences is proposed. The design of the algorithm aims to construct an embedding vector that constitutes syntactic and semantic elements as well as the hidden content of the text data. The success of the proposed embedding method is tested in classification problems. Among the wide range of application areas, text classification is the best laboratory for embedding methods; the classification power of the method can be tested using dimensional reduction without any further processing. Furthermore, the method can be compared with different embedding algorithms and machine learning methods. The proposed method is tested with real-world data sets and eight well-known and successful embedding algorithms. The proposed embedding method shows significantly better classification for binary and multiclass datasets compared to well-known algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the Sub-Adjacent Transformer with a novel attention mechanism for unsupervised time series anomaly detection. Unlike previous approaches that rely on all the points within some neighborhood for time point reconstruction, our method restricts the attention to regions not immediately adjacent to the target points, termed sub-adjacent neighborhoods. Our key observation is that owing to the rarity of anomalies, they typically exhibit more pronounced differences from their sub-adjacent neighborhoods than from their immediate vicinities. By focusing the attention on the sub-adjacent areas, we make the reconstruction of anomalies more challenging, thereby enhancing their detectability. Technically, our approach concentrates attention on the non-diagonal areas of the attention matrix by enlarging the corresponding elements in the training stage. To facilitate the implementation of the desired attention matrix pattern, we adopt linear attention because of its flexibility and adaptability. Moreover, a learnable mapping function is proposed to improve the performance of linear attention. Empirically, the Sub-Adjacent Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance across six real-world anomaly detection benchmarks, covering diverse fields such as server monitoring, space exploration, and water treatment.

We let the devices adjust the transmission probabilities based on their current battery level. Using a Markovian analysis, we derive analytically the average AoI. We further provide an approximate analysis for accurate and easy-to-compute approximations of both the average AoI and the age-violation probability (AVP), i.e., the probability that the AoI exceeds a given threshold. We also analyze the average throughput. Via numerical results, we investigate two baseline strategies: transmit a new update whenever possible to exploit every opportunity to reduce the AoI, and transmit only when sufficient energy is available to increase the chance of successful decoding. The two strategies are beneficial for low and high update-generation rates, respectively. We show that an optimized policy that balances the two strategies outperforms them significantly in terms of both AoI metrics and throughput. Finally, we show the benefit of decoding multiple packets in a slot using successive interference cancellation and adapting the transmission probability based on both the current battery level and the time elapsed since the last transmission.

As a result, cross-architecture binary code analysis has become an emerging problem. Recently, deep learning-based binary analysis has shown promising success. It is widely known that training a deep learning model requires a massive amount of data. However, for some low-resource ISAs, an adequate amount of data is hard to find, preventing deep learning from being widely adopted for binary analysis. To overcome the data scarcity problem and facilitate cross-architecture binary code analysis, we propose to apply the ideas and techniques in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to binary code analysis. Our insight is that a binary, after disassembly, is represented in some assembly language. Given a binary in a low-resource ISA, we translate it to a binary in a high-resource ISA (e.g., x86). Then we can use a model that has been trained on the high-resource ISA to test the translated binary. We have implemented the model called UNSUPERBINTRANS, and conducted experiments to evaluate its performance. Specifically, we conducted two downstream tasks, including code similarity detection and vulnerability discovery. In both tasks, we achieved high accuracies. ",

To overcome these two challenges, we propose a novel generative paradigm \\textit{Embedded Representation Learning Network} (ERLNet) with two learning stages.

    "abstract": "Star trackers are one of the most accurate celestial sensors used for absolute attitude determination. The devices detect stars in captured images and accurately compute their projected centroids on an imaging focal plane with subpixel precision. Traditional algorithms for star detection and centroiding often rely on threshold adjustments for star pixel detection and pixel brightness weighting for centroid computation. However, challenges like high sensor noise and stray light can compromise algorithm performance. This article introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for star detection and centroiding, tailored to address the issues posed by noisy star tracker images in the presence of stray light and other artifacts. Trained using simulated star images overlayed with real sensor noise and stray light, the CNN produces both a binary segmentation map distinguishing star pixels from the background and a distance map indicating each pixel's proximity to the nearest star centroid. Leveraging this distance information alongside pixel coordinates transforms centroid calculations into a set of trilateration problems solvable via the least squares method. Our method employs efficient UNet variants for the underlying CNN architectures, and the variants' performances are evaluated. Comprehensive testing has been undertaken with synthetic image evaluations, hardware-in-the-loop assessments, and night sky tests. The tests consistently demonstrated that our method outperforms several existing algorithms in centroiding accuracy and exhibits superior resilience to high sensor noise and stray light interference. An additional benefit of our algorithms is that they can be executed in real-time on low-power edge AI processors. ",

We posit that certain domain applications, such as anti-money laundering (AML), are inherently subgraph problems and mainstream graph techniques have been operating at a suboptimal level of abstraction. This is due in part to the scarcity of annotated datasets of real-world size and complexity, as well as the lack of software tools for managing subgraph GNN workflows at scale. To enable work in fundamental algorithms as well as domain applications in AML and beyond, we introduce Elliptic2, a large graph dataset containing 122K labeled subgraphs of Bitcoin clusters within a background graph consisting of 49M node clusters and 196M edge transactions. The dataset provides subgraphs known to be linked to illicit activity for learning the set of \"shapes\" that money laundering exhibits in cryptocurrency and accurately classifying new criminal activity. Along with the dataset we share our graph techniques, software tooling, promising early experimental results, and new domain insights already gleaned from this approach.

IoT applications using cloud and edge computing are at higher risk of cyberattacks because of the expanded attack surface from distributed edge and cloud services, the vulnerability of IoT devices, and challenges in managing security across interconnected systems leading to oversights. This led to the rise of ML-based solutions for intrusion detection systems (IDSs), which have proven effective in enhancing network security and defending against diverse threats. However, ML-based IDS in IoT systems encounters challenges, particularly from noisy, redundant, and irrelevant features in varied IoT datasets, potentially impacting its performance. Therefore, reducing such features becomes crucial to enhance system performance and minimize computational costs. This paper focuses on improving the effectiveness of ML-based IDS at the edge level by introducing a novel method to find a balanced trade-off between cost and accuracy through the creation of informative features in a two-tier edge-user IoT environment. A hybrid Binary Quantum-inspired Artificial Bee Colony and Genetic Programming algorithm is utilized for this purpose. Three IoT intrusion detection datasets, namely NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and BoT-IoT, are used for the evaluation of the proposed approach. ",

Using suitable power control mechanisms, we show it is possible to efficiently multiplex eMBB+ and mMTC+ traffic in the same time-frequency resource grid. Numerical experiments reveal interesting trade-offs in the selection of the spreading gain and the number of serving access points within the system. Results also demonstrate that the performance of the mMTC+ devices is slightly affected by the presence of the eMBB+ users.

While many downstream tasks highly rely on the expressive modeling and predictive embedding of KGs, most of the current KG representation learning methods, where each entity is embedded as a vector in the Euclidean space and each relation is embedded as a transformation, follow an entity ranking protocol. On one hand, such an embedding design cannot capture many-to-many relations. On the other hand, in many retrieval cases, the users wish to get an exact set of answers without any ranking, especially when the results are expected to be precise, e.g., which genes cause an illness. Such scenarios are commonly referred to as \"set retrieval\". This work presents a pioneering study on the KG set retrieval problem. We show that the set retrieval highly depends on expressive modeling of many-to-many relations, and propose a new KG embedding model SpherE to address this problem. SpherE is based on rotational embedding methods, but each entity is embedded as a sphere instead of a vector. While inheriting the high interpretability of rotational-based models, our SpherE can more expressively model one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations. Through extensive experiments, we show that our SpherE can well address the set retrieval problem while still having a good predictive ability to infer missing facts.

    "abstract": "Despite widespread applications of knowledge graphs (KGs) in various tasks such as question answering and intelligent conversational systems, existing KGs face two major challenges: information granularity and deficiency in timeliness. These hinder considerably the retrieval and analysis of in-context, fine-grained, and up-to-date knowledge from KGs, particularly in highly specialized themes (e.g., specialized scientific research) and rapidly evolving contexts (e.g., breaking news or disaster tracking). To tackle such challenges, we propose a theme-specific knowledge graph (i.e., ThemeKG), a KG constructed from a theme-specific corpus, and design an unsupervised framework for ThemeKG construction (named TKGCon). The framework takes raw theme-specific corpus and generates a high-quality KG that includes salient entities and relations under the theme. Specifically, we start with an entity ontology of the theme from Wikipedia, based on which we then generate candidate relations by Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct a relation ontology. To parse the documents from the theme corpus, we first map the extracted entity pairs to the ontology and retrieve the candidate relations. Finally, we incorporate the context and ontology to consolidate the relations for entity pairs. We observe that directly prompting GPT-4 for theme-specific KG leads to inaccurate entities (such as \"two main types\" as one entity in the query result) and unclear (such as \"is\", \"has\") or wrong relations (such as \"have due to\", \"to start\"). In contrast, by constructing the theme-specific KG step by step, our model outperforms GPT-4 and could consistently identify accurate entities and relations. Experimental results also show that our framework excels in evaluations compared with various KG construction baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Effective communication is paramount for the inclusion of deaf individuals in society. However, persistent communication barriers due to limited Sign Language (SL) knowledge hinder their full participation. In this context, Sign Language Recognition (SLR) systems have been developed to improve communication between signing and non-signing individuals. In particular, there is the problem of recognizing isolated signs (Isolated Sign Language Recognition, ISLR) of great relevance in the development of vision-based SL search engines, learning tools, and translation systems. This work proposes an ISLR approach where body, hands, and facial landmarks are extracted throughout time and encoded as 2-D images. These images are processed by a convolutional neural network, which maps the visual-temporal information into a sign label. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpassed the state-of-the-art in terms of performance metrics on two widely recognized datasets in Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS), the primary focus of this study. In addition to being more accurate, our method is more time-efficient and easier to train due to its reliance on a simpler network architecture and solely RGB data as input. ",

Let $\\delta(G)=\\max_{(u,v)}\\delta_G(u,v)$, for $(u,v)\\in V\\times V$, which is called the diameter of $G$. Given a disconnected road network modelled as two disjoint trees $T_1$ and $T_2$, this paper first aims at inserting one and two edges (bridges) between them to minimize the (constrained) diameter $\\delta(T_1\\cup T_2\\cup I_j)$ going through the inserted edges, where $I_j, j=1,2$, is the set of inserted edges with $|I_1|=1$ and $|I_2|=2$. The corresponding problems are called the {\\em optimal bridge} and {\\em twin bridges} problems. Since when more than one edge are inserted between two trees the resulting graph is becoming more complex, for the general network $G$ we consider the problem of inserting a minimum of $k$ edges such that the shortest distances between a set of $m$ pairs $P=\\{(u_i,v_i)\\mid u_i,v_i\\in V, i\\in [m]\\}$, $\\delta_G(u_i,v_i)$'s, are all decreased. The main results of this paper are summarized as follows: (1) We show that the optimal bridge problem can be solved in $O(n^2)$ time and that a variation of it has a near-quadratic lower bound unless SETH fails. The proof also implies that the famous 3-SUM problem does have a near-quadratic lower bound for large integers, e.g., each of the $n$ input integers has $\\Omega(\\log n)$ decimal digits. We then give a simple factor-2 $O(n\\log n)$ time approximation algorithm for the optimal bridge problem. (2) We present an $O(n^4)$ time algorithm to solve the twin bridges problem, exploiting some new property not in the optimal bridge problem. (3) For the general problem of inserting $k$ edges to reduce the (graph) distances between $m$ given pairs, we show that the problem is NP-complete. ",

Transmission delays play an important role in shaping these temporal characteristics. Recent work has demonstrated the substantial advantages of learning these delays along with synaptic weights, both in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency. However, these approaches suffer from drawbacks in terms of precision and efficiency, as they operate in discrete time and with approximate gradients, while also requiring membrane potential recordings for calculating parameter updates. To alleviate these issues, we propose an analytical approach for calculating exact loss gradients with respect to both synaptic weights and delays in an event-based fashion. The inclusion of delays emerges naturally within our proposed formalism, enriching the model's search space with a temporal dimension. Our algorithm is purely based on the timing of individual spikes and does not require access to other variables such as membrane potentials. We explicitly compare the impact on accuracy and parameter efficiency of different types of delays - axonal, dendritic and synaptic. Furthermore, while previous work on learnable delays in SNNs has been mostly confined to software simulations, we demonstrate the functionality and benefits of our approach on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic platform.

In this paper, we focus on exploiting the large vision-language model, i.e., CLIP, to address zero/few-shot 3D shape recognition based on multi-view representations. The key challenge for both tasks is to generate a discriminative descriptor of the 3D shape represented by multiple view images under the scenarios of either without explicit training (zero-shot 3D shape recognition) or training with a limited number of data (few-shot 3D shape recognition). We analyze that both tasks are relevant and can be considered simultaneously. Specifically, leveraging the descriptor which is effective for zero-shot inference to guide the tuning of the aggregated descriptor under the few-shot training can significantly improve the few-shot learning efficacy. Hence, we propose Prompt-Enhanced View Aggregation Network (PEVA-Net) to simultaneously address zero/few-shot 3D shape recognition. Under the zero-shot scenario, we propose to leverage the prompts built up from candidate categories to enhance the aggregation process of multiple view-associated visual features. The resulting aggregated feature serves for effective zero-shot recognition of the 3D shapes. Under the few-shot scenario, we first exploit a transformer encoder to aggregate the view-associated visual features into a global descriptor. To tune the encoder, together with the main classification loss, we propose a self-distillation scheme via a feature distillation loss by treating the zero-shot descriptor as the guidance signal for the few-shot descriptor. This scheme can significantly enhance the few-shot learning efficacy. ",

Recent progress has been made using sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) to train such locomotion controllers, with approaches differing mainly in their reward functions. However, prior works lack a clear method to systematically test new reward functions and compare controller performance through repeatable experiments. This limits our understanding of the trade-offs between approaches and hinders progress. To address this, we propose a low-cost, quantitative benchmarking method to evaluate and compare the real-world performance of standing and walking (SaW) controllers on metrics like command following, disturbance recovery, and energy efficiency. We also revisit reward function design and construct a minimally constraining reward function to train SaW controllers. We experimentally verify that our benchmarking framework can identify areas for improvement, which can be systematically addressed to enhance the policies. We also compare our new controller to state-of-the-art controllers on the Digit humanoid robot. The results provide clear quantitative trade-offs among the controllers and suggest directions for future improvements to the reward functions and expansion of the benchmarks. ",

They are trained on large datasets scraped from the Internet, potentially containing unacceptable concepts (e.g., copyright infringing or unsafe). Retraining T2I models after filtering out unacceptable concepts in the training data is inefficient and degrades utility. Hence, there is a need for concept removal techniques (CRTs) which are effective in removing unacceptable concepts, utility-preserving on acceptable concepts, and robust against evasion with adversarial prompts. None of the prior filtering and fine-tuning CRTs satisfy all these requirements simultaneously. We introduce Espresso, the first robust concept filter based on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP). It identifies unacceptable concepts by projecting the generated image's embedding onto the vector connecting unacceptable and acceptable concepts in the joint text-image embedding space. This ensures robustness by restricting the adversary to adding noise only along this vector, in the direction of the acceptable concept. Further fine-tuning Espresso to separate embeddings of acceptable and unacceptable concepts, while preserving their pairing with image embeddings, ensures both effectiveness and utility. We evaluate Espresso on eleven concepts to show that it is effective (~5% CLIP accuracy on unacceptable concepts), utility-preserving (~93% normalized CLIP score on acceptable concepts), and robust (~4% CLIP accuracy on adversarial prompts for unacceptable concepts). Finally, we present theoretical bounds for the certified robustness of Espresso against adversarial prompts, and an empirical analysis. ",

Natural language queries formed to extract information from a KB entail starting from specific nodes and reasoning over multiple edges of the corresponding KG to arrive at the correct set of answer nodes. Traditional approaches of question answering on KG are based on (a) semantic parsing (SP), where a logical form (e.g., S-expression, SPARQL query, etc.) is generated using node and edge embeddings and then reasoning over these representations or tuning language models to generate the final answer directly, or (b) information-retrieval based that works by extracting entities and relations sequentially. In this work, we evaluate the capability of (LLMs) to answer questions over KG that involve multiple hops. We show that depending upon the size and nature of the KG we need different approaches to extract and feed the relevant information to an LLM since every LLM comes with a fixed context window. We evaluate our approach on six KGs with and without the availability of example-specific sub-graphs and show that both the IR and SP-based methods can be adopted by LLMs resulting in an extremely competitive performance.

Although existing OPP mining algorithms have achieved satisfactory performance, they discover all frequent patterns. However, in some cases, users focus on a particular trend and its associated trends. To efficiently discover trend information related to a specific prefix pattern, this paper addresses the issue of co-occurrence OPP mining (COP) and proposes an algorithm named COP-Miner to discover COPs from historical time series. COP-Miner consists of three parts: extracting keypoints, preparation stage, and iteratively calculating supports and mining frequent COPs. Extracting keypoints is used to obtain local extreme points of patterns and time series. The preparation stage is designed to prepare for the first round of mining, which contains four steps: obtaining the suffix OPP of the keypoint sub-time series, calculating the occurrences of the suffix OPP, verifying the occurrences of the keypoint sub-time series, and calculating the occurrences of all fusion patterns of the keypoint sub-time series. To further improve the efficiency of support calculation, we propose a support calculation method with an ending strategy that uses the occurrences of prefix and suffix patterns to calculate the occurrences of superpatterns. Experimental results indicate that COP-Miner outperforms the other competing algorithms in running time and scalability. Moreover, COPs with keypoint alignment yield better prediction performance. ",

Three distinct types of Persistent Homologies were recurrent across datasets that had been plotted through retweeting patterns and analyzed through the k-Nearest-Neighbor filtrations. As these Persistent Homologies continued to appear, they were then categorized and dubbed Nuclear, Bipolar, and Multipolar Constellations. Upon investigating the content of these plotted tweets, specific patterns of interaction and political information dissemination were identified, namely Political Personalism and Political Polarization. Through clustering and application of Gaussian density functions, I have mathematically characterized each category, encapsulating their distinctive topological features. The mathematical generalizations of Bipolar, Nuclear, and Multipolar Constellations developed in this study are designed to inspire other political science digital media researchers to utilize these categories as to identify Persistent Homology in datasets derived from various social media platforms, suggesting the broader hypothesis that such structures are bound to be present on political scraped data regardless of the social media it's derived from. This method aims to offer a new perspective in Network Analysis as it allows for an exploration of the underlying shape of the networks formed by retweeting patterns, enhancing the understanding of digital interactions within the sphere of Computational Social Sciences.

    "abstract": "A vision-based drone-to-drone detection system is crucial for various applications like collision avoidance, countering hostile drones, and search-and-rescue operations. However, detecting drones presents unique challenges, including small object sizes, distortion, occlusion, and real-time processing requirements. Current methods integrating multi-scale feature fusion and temporal information have limitations in handling extreme blur and minuscule objects. To address this, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine detection strategy based on vision transformers. We evaluate our approach on three challenging drone-to-drone detection datasets, achieving F1 score enhancements of 7%, 3%, and 1% on the FL-Drones, AOT, and NPS-Drones datasets, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate real-time processing capabilities by deploying our model on an edge-computing device. Our code will be made publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "There is a gap in risk assessment of trajectories between the trajectory information coming from a traffic motion prediction module and what is actually needed. Closing this gap necessitates advancements in prediction beyond current practices. Existing prediction models yield joint predictions of agents' future trajectories with uncertainty weights or marginal Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) for single agents. Although, these methods achieve high accurate trajectory predictions, they only provide little or no information about the dependencies of interacting agents. Since traffic is a process of highly interdependent agents, whose actions directly influence their mutual behavior, the existing methods are not sufficient to reliably assess the risk of future trajectories. This paper addresses that gap by introducing a novel approach to motion prediction, focusing on predicting agent-pair covariance matrices in a ``scene-centric'' manner, which can then be used to model Gaussian joint PDFs for all agent-pairs in a scene. We propose a model capable of predicting those agent-pair covariance matrices, leveraging an enhanced awareness of interactions. Utilizing the prediction results of our model, this work forms the foundation for comprehensive risk assessment with statistically based methods for analyzing agents' relations by their joint PDFs.

While prior research has primarily concentrated on improving the adversarial robustness of image encoders to guard against attacks on images, the exploration of text-based and multimodal attacks has largely been overlooked. In this work, we initiate the first known and comprehensive effort to study adapting vision-language models for adversarial robustness under the multimodal attack. Firstly, we introduce a multimodal attack strategy and investigate the impact of different attacks. We then propose a multimodal contrastive adversarial training loss, aligning the clean and adversarial text embeddings with the adversarial and clean visual features, to enhance the adversarial robustness of both image and text encoders of CLIP. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets across two tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the adversarial robustness of CLIP. Interestingly, we find that the model fine-tuned against multimodal adversarial attacks exhibits greater robustness than its counterpart fine-tuned solely against image-based attacks, even in the context of image attacks, which may open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs. ",

Moreover, they mainly focus on large models and large-scale datasets, which lack flexibility and feasibility in many practical applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient single-branch SSL method based on non-parametric instance discrimination, aiming to improve the algorithm, model, and data efficiency of SSL. By analyzing the gradient formula, we correct the update rule of the memory bank with improved performance. We further propose a novel self-distillation loss that minimizes the KL divergence between the probability distribution and its square root version. We show that this alleviates the infrequent updating problem in instance discrimination and greatly accelerates convergence. We systematically compare the training overhead and performance of different methods in different scales of data, and under different backbones. Experimental results show that our method outperforms various baselines with significantly less overhead, and is especially effective for limited amounts of data and small models. ",

To address this issue, we propose the sparsity-adaptive depth refinement (SDR) framework, which refines monocular depth estimates using sparse depth points. For SDR, we propose the masked spatial propagation network (MSPN) to perform SDR with a varying number of sparse depths effectively by gradually propagating sparse depth information throughout the entire depth map.

Nevertheless, annotated data is frequently limited in the field of remote sensing image matching. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel keypoint descriptor approach that obtains robust feature descriptors via a self-supervised matching network. A light-weight transformer network, termed as LTFormer, is designed to generate deep-level feature descriptors. Furthermore, we implement an innovative triplet loss function, LT Loss, to enhance the matching performance further. Our approach outperforms conventional hand-crafted local feature descriptors and proves equally competitive compared to state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods, even amidst the shortage of annotated data.

Standard solutions based on Segment Routing (SR), such as Topology-Independent Loop-Free Alternate (TI-LFA), are used in practice to handle failures, but no distributed solutions exist for distributed and tactical congestion mitigation. A promising approach leveraging SR has been recently proposed to quickly steer traffic away from congested links over alternative paths. As the pre-computation of alternative paths plays a paramount role to efficiently mitigating congestions, we investigate the associated path computation problem aiming at maximizing the amount of traffic that can be rerouted as well as the resilience against any 1-link failure. In particular, we focus on two variants of this problem. First, we maximize the residual flow after all possible failures. We show that the problem is NP-Hard, and we solve it via a Benders decomposition algorithm. Then, to provide a practical and scalable solution, we solve a relaxed variant problem, that maximizes, instead of flow, the number of surviving alternative paths after all possible failures. We provide a polynomial algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we compare the two variants and show that they allow to increase the amount of rerouted traffic and the resiliency of the network after any 1-link failure. ",

Often, good summaries are unavailable in software projects, thus making maintenance more difficult. There has been a considerable body of research into automated AI-based methods, using Large Language models (LLMs), to generate summaries of code; there also has been quite a bit work on ways to measure the performance of such summarization methods, with special attention paid to how closely these AI-generated summaries resemble a summary a human might have produced. Measures such as BERTScore and BLEU have been suggested and evaluated with human-subject studies. However, LLMs often err and generate something quite unlike what a human might say. Given an LLM-produced code summary, is there a way to gauge whether it's likely to be sufficiently similar to a human produced summary, or not? In this paper, we study this question, as a calibration problem: given a summary from an LLM, can we compute a confidence measure, which is a good indication of whether the summary is sufficiently similar to what a human would have produced in this situation? We examine this question using several LLMs, for several languages, and in several different settings. We suggest an approach which provides well-calibrated predictions of likelihood of similarity to human summaries. ",

Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.

Then a key problem arises, how to design collaborative AI models for the device side and the network side, so that the transmitted data between the device and the network is efficient enough, which means the transmission overhead is low but the AI task result is accurate. In this paper, we propose the multi-link information bottleneck (ML-IB) scheme for such collaborative models design. We formulate our problem based on a novel performance metric, which can evaluate both task accuracy and transmission overhead. Then we introduce a quantizer that is adjustable in the quantization bit depth, amplitudes, and breakpoints. Given the infeasibility of calculating our proposed metric on high-dimensional data, we establish a variational upper bound for this metric. However, due to the incorporation of quantization, the closed form of the variational upper bound remains uncomputable. Hence, we employ the Log-Sum Inequality to derive an approximation and provide a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we devise the quantized multi-link information bottleneck (QML-IB) algorithm for collaborative AI models generation.

Despite the effectiveness, we observe a noticeable multilingual bias in the generation performance of LCMs. Specifically, LCMs demonstrate proficiency in generating solutions when provided with instructions in English, yet may falter when faced with semantically equivalent instructions in other NLs such as Chinese. Moreover, the ability of LCMs to generate code exhibits variety across different programming languages (PLs), such as Python and C++. The observed phenomenon indicates the presence of multi-lingual bias within the generative capabilities of LCMs, which has remained unexplored. In this paper, we aim to investigate the multi-lingual bias that exists in current LCMs. First, we initiate our investigation by constructing the first multi-lingual evaluation benchmark X-HumanEval-X, enabling us to systematically evaluate the extent of multi-lingual bias that exists in current LCMs. In our large-scale experiments on nine popular LCMs, we observe a pronounced multi-lingual bias of LCMs in code generation, including multi-NL and multi-PL bias. Specifically, when using Chinese instructions, the code generation capabilities of LCMs decrease by at least 13% in terms of the Pass@1 metric. Furthermore, LCMs perform variously across different programming languages, e.g., the performance gap between Python and C++ reaches as high as 20.9%. ... ",

    "abstract": "Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is the main network abstraction technology used in public cloud systems. VPCs are composed of a set of network services that permit the definition of complex network reachability properties among internal and external cloud entities such as tenants' VMs or some generic internet nodes. Although hiding the underlying complexity through a comprehensible abstraction layer, manually enforcing particular reachability intents in VPC networks is still notably error-prone and complex. In this paper, we propose AutoNet, a new model for assisting cloud tenants in managing reachability-based policies in VPC networks. AutoNet is capable of safely generating incremental VPC configurations while satisfying some metric-based high-level intent defined by the tenants. To achieve this goal, we leverage a MaxSAT-based encoding of the network configuration combined with several optimizations to scale to topologies with thousands of nodes. Our results show that the developed system is capable of achieving a sub-second response time for production VPC deployments while still providing fine-grained control over the generated configurations.

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Advanced text-to-image diffusion models raise safety concerns regarding identity privacy violation, copyright infringement, and Not Safe For Work content generation. Towards this, unlearning methods have been developed to erase these involved concepts from diffusion models. However, these unlearning methods only shift the text-to-image mapping and preserve the visual content within the generative space of diffusion models, leaving a fatal flaw for restoring these erased concepts. This erasure trustworthiness problem needs probe, but previous methods are sub-optimal from two perspectives: (1) Lack of transferability: Some methods operate within a white-box setting, requiring access to the unlearned model. And the learned adversarial input often fails to transfer to other unlearned models for concept restoration; (2) Limited attack: The prompt-level methods struggle to restore narrow concepts from unlearned models, such as celebrity identity. Therefore, this paper aims to leverage the transferability of the adversarial attack to probe the unlearning robustness under a black-box setting. This challenging scenario assumes that the unlearning method is unknown and the unlearned model is inaccessible for optimization, requiring the attack to be capable of transferring across different unlearned models. Specifically, we employ an adversarial search strategy to search for the adversarial embedding which can transfer across different unlearned models. This strategy adopts the original Stable Diffusion model as a surrogate model to iteratively erase and search for embeddings, enabling it to find the embedding that can restore the target concept for different unlearning methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of the searched adversarial embedding across several state-of-the-art unlearning methods and its effectiveness for different levels of concepts.

    "abstract": "Recent self-training techniques have shown notable improvements in unsupervised domain adaptation for 3D object detection (3D UDA). These techniques typically select pseudo labels, i.e., 3D boxes, to supervise models for the target domain. However, this selection process inevitably introduces unreliable 3D boxes, in which 3D points cannot be definitively assigned as foreground or background. Previous techniques mitigate this by reweighting these boxes as pseudo labels, but these boxes can still poison the training process. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel pseudo label refinery framework. Specifically, in the selection process, to improve the reliability of pseudo boxes, we propose a complementary augmentation strategy. This strategy involves either removing all points within an unreliable box or replacing it with a high-confidence box. Moreover, the point numbers of instances in high-beam datasets are considerably higher than those in low-beam datasets, also degrading the quality of pseudo labels during the training process. We alleviate this issue by generating additional proposals and aligning RoI features across different domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the quality of pseudo labels and consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on six autonomous driving benchmarks.

Instead, thermal infrared object detection (TIOD) is the most accessible and practical in such environments. In this paper, our team is the first to investigate the security vulnerabilities associated with TIOD in the context of backdoor attacks, spanning both the digital and physical realms. We introduce two novel types of backdoor attacks on TIOD, each offering unique capabilities: Object-affecting Attack and Range-affecting Attack. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of key factors influencing trigger design, which include temperature, size, material, and concealment. These factors, especially temperature, significantly impact the efficacy of backdoor attacks on TIOD. A thorough understanding of these factors will serve as a foundation for designing physical triggers and temperature controlling experiments. Our study includes extensive experiments conducted in both digital and physical environments. In the digital realm, we evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets for TIOD, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of up to 98.21%. In the physical realm, we test our approach in two real-world settings: a traffic intersection and a parking lot, using a thermal infrared camera. Here, we attain an ASR of up to 98.38%. ",

In IoT networks, where connected devices are susceptible to resource-constraint attacks, such as energy consumption attacks, security is paramount.

Key findings include identifying the attack rates of DDoS attacks that disrupt services and quantifying the energy consumption impact of Energy Consumption Distributed Denial of Service (EC-DDoS) and F-APs attacks on smart healthcare devices. The study highlights communication protocols, attack rates, payload sizes, and port states of victim devices as critical factors influencing energy consumption.

This limitation presents a significant hurdle in deploying edge devices in real-world scenarios where information is presented in an inherently sequential manner.

By exploiting key properties of time-to-first-spike encoding and leveraging its high sparsity, we present a novel spiking neural network model enhanced with active dendrites. Our model can efficiently mitigate catastrophic forgetting in temporally-encoded SNNs, which we demonstrate with an end-of-training accuracy across tasks of 88.3% on the test set using the Split MNIST dataset. Furthermore, we provide a novel digital hardware architecture that paves the way for real-world deployment in edge devices.

    "abstract": "Federated Transfer Learning (FTL) is the most general variation of Federated Learning. According to this distributed paradigm, a feature learning pre-step is commonly carried out by only one party, typically the server, on publicly shared data. After that, the Federated Learning phase takes place to train a classifier collaboratively using the learned feature extractor. Each involved client contributes by locally training only the classification layers on a private training set. The peculiarity of an FTL scenario makes it hard to understand whether poisoning attacks can be developed to craft an effective backdoor. State-of-the-art attack strategies assume the possibility of shifting the model attention toward relevant features introduced by a forged trigger injected in the input data by some untrusted clients. Of course, this is not feasible in FTL, as the learned features are fixed once the server performs the pre-training step. Consequently, in this paper, we investigate this intriguing Federated Learning scenario to identify and exploit a vulnerability obtained by combining eXplainable AI (XAI) and dataset distillation. In particular, the proposed attack can be carried out by one of the clients during the Federated Learning phase of FTL by identifying the optimal local for the trigger through XAI and encapsulating compressed information of the backdoor class. Due to its behavior, we refer to our approach as a focused backdoor approach (FB-FTL for short) and test its performance by explicitly referencing an image classification scenario. With an average 80% attack success rate, obtained results show the effectiveness of our attack also against existing defenses for Federated Learning. ",

Yet, these methods frequently fall short of achieving sufficient overlap, consequently restricting the potential for performance enhancements. In our study, we extend the scope of this challenge by considering overlap at the broader training graph level. During the forward pass, we enable non-MoE computations to overlap with all-to-all through careful partitioning and pipelining. In the backward pass, we achieve overlap with all-to-all by scheduling gradient weight computations. We implement these techniques in Lancet, a system using compiler-based optimization to automatically enhance MoE model training. Our extensive evaluation reveals that Lancet significantly reduces the time devoted to non-overlapping communication, by as much as 77%. Moreover, it achieves a notable end-to-end speedup of up to 1.3 times when compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. ",

Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs and then forwards the sensing data to the remote BS. The GUs first backscatter their data to the UAVs and then all UAVs forward data to the BS by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. To solve this problem, we first model the dynamics of the GUs' AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs' AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs' scheduling fairness is also improved greatly by adapting the GUs' access control compared with typical baseline schemes. ",

    "abstract": "ML-enabled systems that are deployed in a production environment typically suffer from decaying model prediction quality through concept drift, i.e., a gradual change in the statistical characteristics of a certain real-world domain. To combat this, a simple solution is to periodically retrain ML models, which unfortunately can consume a lot of energy. One recommended tactic to improve energy efficiency is therefore to systematically monitor the level of concept drift and only retrain when it becomes unavoidable. Different methods are available to do this, but we know very little about their concrete impact on the tradeoff between accuracy and energy efficiency, as these methods also consume energy themselves. To address this, we therefore conducted a controlled experiment to study the accuracy vs. energy efficiency tradeoff of seven common methods for concept drift detection. We used five synthetic datasets, each in a version with abrupt and one with gradual drift, and trained six different ML models as base classifiers. Based on a full factorial design, we tested 420 combinations (7 drift detectors * 5 datasets * 2 types of drift * 6 base classifiers) and compared energy consumption and drift detection accuracy. Our results indicate that there are three types of detectors: a) detectors that sacrifice energy efficiency for detection accuracy (KSWIN), b) balanced detectors that consume low to medium energy with good accuracy (HDDM_W, ADWIN), and c) detectors that consume very little energy but are unusable in practice due to very poor accuracy (HDDM_A, PageHinkley, DDM, EDDM). By providing rich evidence for this energy efficiency tactic, our findings support ML practitioners in choosing the best suited method of concept drift detection for their ML-enabled systems. ",

We introduce temporal analogues of three increasingly restrictive static graph parameters -- cliquewidth, modular-width and neighbourhood diversity -- which take small values for highly structured temporal graphs, even if a large number of edges are active at each timestep. The computational problems solvable efficiently when the temporal cliquewidth of the input graph is bounded form a subset of those solvable efficiently when the temporal modular-width is bounded, which is in turn a subset of problems efficiently solvable when the temporal neighbourhood diversity is bounded. By considering specific temporal graph problems, we demonstrate that (up to standard complexity theoretic assumptions) these inclusions are strict. ",

Second, it outlines a method for establishing an upper bound on the absolute deviation from the exact solution. Third, it introduces a technique for converting problems with Neumann or Robin conditions into equivalent problems with parametric Dirichlet conditions. The proposed optimized neural forms were numerically tested on a set of diverse problems, encompassing first-order and second-order ordinary differential equations, as well as first-order systems. Stiff and delay differential equations were also considered. The obtained solutions were compared against solutions obtained via Runge-Kutta methods and exact solutions wherever available.

We then introduce our framework, which evaluates their effectiveness and efficiency. We measure these characteristics by (i) defining an optimality metric that quantifies how close an attack is to the optimal solution, and (ii) limiting the number of forward and backward queries to the model, such that all attacks are compared within a given maximum query budget. Our extensive experimental analysis compares more than 100 attack implementations with a total of over 800 different configurations against CIFAR-10 and ImageNet models, highlighting that only very few attacks outperform all the competing approaches. Within this analysis, we shed light on several implementation issues that prevent many attacks from finding better solutions or running at all. We release AttackBench as a publicly available benchmark, aiming to continuously update it to include and evaluate novel gradient-based attacks for optimizing adversarial examples. ",

EEG signals with high temporal correlation can effectively capture these responses. Therefore, estimating the functional connectivity of EEG for working memory protocols in different frequency bands plays a significant role in analyzing the brain dynamics with increasing memory and cognitive loads, which remains largely unexplored. The present study introduces a Bayesian structure learning algorithm to learn the functional connectivity of EEG in sensor space. Next, the functional connectivity graphs are taken as input to the graph convolutional network to classify the working memory loads. The intrasubject (subject-specific) classification performed on 154 subjects for six different verbal working memory loads produced the highest classification accuracy of 96% and average classification accuracy of 89%, outperforming state-of-the-art classification models proposed in the literature. Furthermore, the proposed Bayesian structure learning algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art functional connectivity estimation methods through intersubject and intrasubject statistical analysis of variance. The results also show that the alpha and theta bands have better classification accuracy than the beta band. ",

Due to delays and errors in reporting, temporal graphs derived from data are unlikely to perfectly reflect reality, especially with respect to the precise times at which edges appear. To reflect this uncertainty, we consider a model in which some number $\\zeta$ of edge appearances may have their timestamps perturbed by $\\pm\\delta$ for some $\\delta$. Within this model, we investigate temporal reachability and consider the problem of determining the maximum number of vertices any vertex can reach under these perturbations.

We complement this with some contrasting results concerning the complexity of related temporal eccentricity problems under perturbation. ",

An obvious risk of the rapid adoption of these smart devices is that many lack controls for protecting the privacy and security of end users from attacks designed to disrupt lives and incur financial losses. Today the smart home is a system for managing the basic life support processes of both small systems, e.g., commercial, office premises, apartments, cottages, and largely automated complexes, e.g., commercial and industrial complexes. One of the critical tasks to be solved by the concept of a modern smart home is the problem of preventing the usage of IoE resources. Recently, there has been a rapid increase in attacks on consumer IoE devices. Memory corruption vulnerabilities constitute a significant class of vulnerabilities in software security through which attackers can gain control of an entire system. Numerous memory corruption vulnerabilities have been found in IoE firmware already deployed in the consumer market. This paper aims to analyze and explain the resource usage attack and create a low-cost simulation environment to aid in the dynamic analysis of the attack. Further, we perform controlled resource usage attacks while measuring resource consumption on resource-constrained victims' IoE devices, such as CPU and memory utilization. We also build a lightweight algorithm to detect memory usage attacks in the IoE environment. The result shows high efficiency in detecting and mitigating memory usage attacks by detecting when the intruder starts and stops the attack. ",

Under certain conditions output of the training data which they have memorised can be triggered, exposing sensitive data. To mitigate against this risk we propose a safer alternative which sees fragmented data in the form of domain-specific short phrases randomly grouped together shared instead of full texts. Thus, text fragments that could re-identify an individual cannot be reproduced by the model in one sequence, giving significant protection against linkage attacks. We fine-tune several state-of-the-art LLMs using meaningful syntactic chunks to explore their utility. In particular, we fine-tune BERT-based models to predict two cardiovascular diagnoses. Our results demonstrate the capacity of LLMs to benefit from the pre-trained knowledge and deliver classification results when fine-tuned with fragmented data comparable to fine-tuning with full training data.

As opposed to conventional frame-based vision sensors, event-based cameras deliver a microsecond-scale temporal resolution with sparse information encoding, thereby outlining new opportunities for edge vision systems. However, mainstream algorithms for frame-based vision, which mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can hardly exploit the advantages of event-based vision as they are typically optimized for dense matrix-vector multiplications. While event-driven graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for sparse event-based vision, their irregular structure is a challenge that currently hinders the design of efficient hardware accelerators. In this paper, we propose EvGNN, the first event-driven GNN accelerator for low-footprint, ultra-low-latency, and high-accuracy edge vision with event-based cameras. It relies on three central ideas: (i) directed dynamic graphs exploiting single-hop nodes with edge-free storage, (ii) event queues for the efficient identification of local neighbors within a spatiotemporally decoupled search range, and (iii) a novel layer-parallel processing scheme enabling the low-latency execution of multi-layer GNNs. We deployed EvGNN on a Xilinx KV260 Ultrascale+ MPSoC platform and benchmarked it on the N-CARS dataset for car recognition, demonstrating a classification accuracy of 87.8% and an average latency per event of 16$\\mu$s, thereby enabling real-time, microsecond-resolution event-based vision at the edge.

This symbolic representation is a high-level abstraction of the real world, which may render the motion prediction model vulnerable to perception errors (e.g., failures in detecting open-vocabulary obstacles) while missing salient information from the scene context (e.g., poor road conditions). An alternative paradigm is end-to-end learning from raw sensors. However, this approach suffers from the lack of interpretability and requires significantly more training resources. In this work, we propose tokenizing the visual world into a compact set of scene elements and then leveraging pre-trained image foundation models and LiDAR neural networks to encode all the scene elements in an open-vocabulary manner. The image foundation model enables our scene tokens to encode the general knowledge of the open world while the LiDAR neural network encodes geometry information. Our proposed representation can efficiently encode the multi-frame multi-modality observations with a few hundred tokens and is compatible with most transformer-based architectures. To evaluate our method, we have augmented Waymo Open Motion Dataset with camera embeddings. Experiments over Waymo Open Motion Dataset show that our approach leads to significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art. ",

Closed-vocab TAD is typically confined to localizing and classifying actions based on a predefined set of categories. In contrast, Open-vocab TAD goes further and is not limited to these predefined categories. This is particularly useful in real-world scenarios where the variety of actions in videos can be vast and not always predictable. The prevalent methods in Open-vocab TAD typically employ a 2-stage approach, which involves generating action proposals and then identifying those actions. However, errors made during the first stage can adversely affect the subsequent action identification accuracy. Additionally, existing studies face challenges in handling actions of different durations owing to the use of fixed temporal processing methods. Therefore, we propose a 1-stage approach consisting of two primary modules: Multi-scale Video Analysis (MVA) and Video-Text Alignment (VTA). The MVA module captures actions at varying temporal resolutions, overcoming the challenge of detecting actions with diverse durations. The VTA module leverages the synergy between visual and textual modalities to precisely align video segments with corresponding action labels, a critical step for accurate action identification in Open-vocab scenarios. Evaluations on widely recognized datasets THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3, showed that the proposed method achieved superior results compared to the other methods in both Open-vocab and Closed-vocab settings. This serves as a strong demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed method in the TAD task. ",

In this paper, we propose to build a trustworthy IQA model via Causal Perception inspired Representation Learning (CPRL), and a score reflection attack method for IQA model. More specifically, we assume that each image is composed of Causal Perception Representation (CPR) and non-causal perception representation (N-CPR). CPR serves as the causation of the subjective quality label, which is invariant to the imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Inversely, N-CPR presents spurious associations with the subjective quality label, which may significantly change with the adversarial perturbations. To extract the CPR from each input image, we develop a soft ranking based channel-wise activation function to mediate the causally sufficient (beneficial for high prediction accuracy) and necessary (beneficial for high robustness) deep features, and based on intervention employ minimax game to optimize. Experiments on four benchmark databases show that the proposed CPRL method outperforms many state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods and provides explicit model interpretation. ",

To solve this problem, one of the simple and effective methods is based on the propensity score, which adjusts the observational sample distribution to the target one by reweighting observed instances.

However, existing methods usually ignore such constraints or implement them with unreasonable approximations, which may affect the accuracy of the learned propensity scores. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we first analyze the gaps between the causal balancing requirements and existing methods such as learning the propensity with cross-entropy loss or manually selecting functions to balance. Inspired by these gaps, we propose to approximate the balancing functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert space and demonstrate that, based on the universal property and representer theorem of kernel functions, the causal balancing constraints can be better satisfied. Meanwhile, we propose an algorithm that adaptively balances the kernel function and theoretically analyze the generalization error bound of our methods.

Our research focuses on cross-lingual backdoor attacks against multilingual LLMs, particularly investigating how poisoning the instruction-tuning data in one or two languages can affect the outputs in languages whose instruction-tuning data was not poisoned. Despite its simplicity, our empirical analysis reveals that our method exhibits remarkable efficacy in models like mT5, BLOOM, and GPT-3.5-turbo, with high attack success rates, surpassing 95% in several languages across various scenarios. Alarmingly, our findings also indicate that larger models show increased susceptibility to transferable cross-lingual backdoor attacks, which also applies to LLMs predominantly pre-trained on English data, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Gemma. Moreover, our experiments show that triggers can still work even after paraphrasing, and the backdoor mechanism proves highly effective in cross-lingual response settings across 25 languages, achieving an average attack success rate of 50%.

    "abstract": "In this work, we begin to investigate the possibility of training a deep neural network on the task of binary code understanding. Specifically, the network would take, as input, features derived directly from binaries and output English descriptions of functionality to aid a reverse engineer in investigating the capabilities of a piece of closed-source software, be it malicious or benign. Given recent success in applying large language models (generative AI) to the task of source code summarization, this seems a promising direction. However, in our initial survey of the available datasets, we found nothing of sufficiently high quality and volume to train these complex models. Instead, we build our own dataset derived from a capture of Stack Overflow containing 1.1M entries. A major result of our work is a novel dataset evaluation method using the correlation between two distances on sample pairs: one distance in the embedding space of inputs and the other in the embedding space of outputs. Intuitively, if two samples have inputs close in the input embedding space, their outputs should also be close in the output embedding space. We found this Embedding Distance Correlation (EDC) test to be highly diagnostic, indicating that our collected dataset and several existing open-source datasets are of low quality as the distances are not well correlated. We proceed to explore the general applicability of EDC, applying it to a number of qualitatively known good datasets and a number of synthetically known bad ones and found it to be a reliable indicator of dataset value.

In this work, we examine this claim. To study the adversarial robustness of BNNs, we investigate whether it is possible to successfully break state-of-the-art BNN inference methods and prediction pipelines using even relatively unsophisticated attacks for three tasks: (1) label prediction under the posterior predictive mean, (2) adversarial example detection with Bayesian predictive uncertainty, and (3) semantic shift detection. We find that BNNs trained with state-of-the-art approximate inference methods, and even BNNs trained with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. We also identify various conceptual and experimental errors in previous works that claimed inherent adversarial robustness of BNNs and conclusively demonstrate that BNNs and uncertainty-aware Bayesian prediction pipelines are not inherently robust against adversarial attacks.

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction is a powerful tool to generate uncertainty sets with guaranteed coverage using any predictive model, under the assumption that the training and test data are i.i.d.. Recently, it has been shown that adversarial examples are able to manipulate conformal methods to construct prediction sets with invalid coverage rates, as the i.i.d. assumption is violated. To address this issue, a recent work, Randomized Smoothed Conformal Prediction (RSCP), was first proposed to certify the robustness of conformal prediction methods to adversarial noise. However, RSCP has two major limitations: (i) its robustness guarantee is flawed when used in practice and (ii) it tends to produce large uncertainty sets. To address these limitations, we first propose a novel framework called RSCP+ to provide provable robustness guarantee in evaluation, which fixes the issues in the original RSCP method. Next, we propose two novel methods, Post-Training Transformation (PTT) and Robust Conformal Training (RCT), to effectively reduce prediction set size with little computation overhead. Experimental results in CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet suggest the baseline method only yields trivial predictions including full label set, while our methods could boost the efficiency by up to $4.36\\times$, $5.46\\times$, and $16.9\\times$ respectively and provide practical robustness guarantee.

    "abstract": "Weight quantization is used to deploy high-performance deep learning models on resource-limited hardware, enabling the use of low-precision integers for storage and computation. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) share the goal of enhancing efficiency, but adopt an 'event-driven' approach to reduce the power consumption of neural network inference. While extensive research has focused on weight quantization, quantization-aware training (QAT), and their application to SNNs, the precision reduction of state variables during training has been largely overlooked, potentially diminishing inference performance. This paper introduces two QAT schemes for stateful neurons: (i) a uniform quantization strategy, an established method for weight quantization, and (ii) threshold-centered quantization, which allocates exponentially more quantization levels near the firing threshold. Our results show that increasing the density of quantization levels around the firing threshold improves accuracy across several benchmark datasets. We provide an ablation analysis of the effects of weight and state quantization, both individually and combined, and how they impact models. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation includes full precision, 8-bit, 4-bit, and 2-bit quantized SNNs, using QAT, stateful QAT (SQUAT), and post-training quantization methods. The findings indicate that the combination of QAT and SQUAT enhance performance the most, but given the choice of one or the other, QAT improves performance by the larger degree. These trends are consistent all datasets. Our methods have been made available in our Python library snnTorch: https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch. ",

    "abstract": "Neural networks can be thought of as applying a transformation to an input dataset. The way in which they change the topology of such a dataset often holds practical significance for many tasks, particularly those demanding non-homeomorphic mappings for optimal solutions, such as classification problems. In this work, we leverage the fact that neural networks are equivalent to continuous piecewise-affine maps, whose rank can be used to pinpoint regions in the input space that undergo non-homeomorphic transformations, leading to alterations in the topological structure of the input dataset. Our approach enables us to make use of the relative homology sequence, with which one can study the homology groups of the quotient of a manifold $\\mathcal{M}$ and a subset $A$, assuming some minimal properties on these spaces. As a proof of principle, we empirically investigate the presence of low-rank (topology-changing) affine maps as a function of network width and mean weight. We show that in randomly initialized narrow networks, there will be regions in which the (co)homology groups of a data manifold can change. As the width increases, the homology groups of the input manifold become more likely to be preserved. We end this part of our work by constructing highly non-random wide networks that do not have this property and relating this non-random regime to Dale's principle, which is a defining characteristic of biological neural networks. Finally, we study simple feedforward networks trained on MNIST, as well as on toy classification and regression tasks, and show that networks manipulate the topology of data differently depending on the continuity of the task they are trained on.

To this end, we delve into the deobfuscation capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs. Beyond merely discussing a hypothetical scenario, we evaluate four LLMs with real-world malicious scripts used in the notorious Emotet malware campaign.

To address these challenges, this preliminary research introduces the GAME-KG framework, standing for \"Gaming for Augmenting Metadata and Enhancing Knowledge Graphs.\" GAME-KG is a federated approach to modifying explicit as well as implicit connections in KGs by using crowdsourced feedback collected through video games. GAME-KG is shown through two demonstrations: a Unity test scenario from Dark Shadows, a video game that collects feedback on KGs parsed from US Department of Justice (DOJ) Press Releases on human trafficking, and a following experiment where OpenAI's GPT-4 is prompted to answer questions based on a modified and unmodified KG.

In this work, we suggest that training language models to predict multiple future tokens at once results in higher sample efficiency.

Considering multi-token prediction as an auxiliary training task, we measure improved downstream capabilities with no overhead in training time for both code and natural language models. The method is increasingly useful for larger model sizes, and keeps its appeal when training for multiple epochs. Gains are especially pronounced on generative benchmarks like coding, where our models consistently outperform strong baselines by several percentage points. Our 13B parameter models solves 12 % more problems on HumanEval and 17 % more on MBPP than comparable next-token models. Experiments on small algorithmic tasks demonstrate that multi-token prediction is favorable for the development of induction heads and algorithmic reasoning capabilities. As an additional benefit, models trained with 4-token prediction are up to 3 times faster at inference, even with large batch sizes. ",

    "abstract": "Data protection and privacy is becoming increasingly crucial in the digital era. Numerous companies depend on third-party vendors and service providers to carry out critical functions within their operations, encompassing tasks such as data handling and storage. However, this reliance introduces potential vulnerabilities, as these vendors' security measures and practices may not always align with the standards expected by regulatory bodies. Businesses are required, often under the penalty of law, to ensure compliance with the evolving regulatory rules. Interpreting and implementing these regulations pose challenges due to their complexity. Regulatory documents are extensive, demanding significant effort for interpretation, while vendor-drafted privacy policies often lack the detail required for full legal compliance, leading to ambiguity. To ensure a concise interpretation of the regulatory requirements and compliance of organizational privacy policy with said regulations, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) and Semantic Web based approach for privacy compliance. In this paper, we develop the novel Privacy Policy Compliance Verification Knowledge Graph, PrivComp-KG. It is designed to efficiently store and retrieve comprehensive information concerning privacy policies, regulatory frameworks, and domain-specific knowledge pertaining to the legal landscape of privacy. Using Retrieval Augmented Generation, we identify the relevant sections in a privacy policy with corresponding regulatory rules. This information about individual privacy policies is populated into the PrivComp-KG. Combining this with the domain context and rules, the PrivComp-KG can be queried to check for compliance with privacy policies by each vendor against relevant policy regulations. We demonstrate the relevance of the PrivComp-KG, by verifying compliance of privacy policy documents for various organizations. ",

KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline.

For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws.

    "abstract": "4D time-space reconstruction of dynamic events or deforming objects using X-ray computed tomography (CT) is an extremely ill-posed inverse problem. Existing approaches assume that the object remains static for the duration of several tens or hundreds of X-ray projection measurement images (reconstruction of consecutive limited-angle CT scans). However, this is an unrealistic assumption for many in-situ experiments that causes spurious artifacts and inaccurate morphological reconstructions of the object. To solve this problem, we propose to perform a 4D time-space reconstruction using a distributed implicit neural representation (DINR) network that is trained using a novel distributed stochastic training algorithm. Our DINR network learns to reconstruct the object at its output by iterative optimization of its network parameters such that the measured projection images best match the output of the CT forward measurement model. We use a continuous time and space forward measurement model that is a function of the DINR outputs at a sparsely sampled set of continuous valued object coordinates. Unlike existing state-of-the-art neural representation architectures that forward and back propagate through dense voxel grids that sample the object's entire time-space coordinates, we only propagate through the DINR at a small subset of object coordinates in each iteration resulting in an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory and compute for training. DINR leverages distributed computation across several compute nodes and GPUs to produce high-fidelity 4D time-space reconstructions even for extremely large CT data sizes. We use both simulated parallel-beam and experimental cone-beam X-ray CT datasets to demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. ",

    "title": "Longitudinal Mammogram Risk Prediction",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality among women worldwide. Early detection and risk assessment play a crucial role in improving survival rates. Therefore, annual or biennial mammograms are often recommended for screening in high-risk groups. Mammograms are typically interpreted by expert radiologists based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), which provides a uniform way to describe findings and categorizes them to indicate the level of concern for breast cancer. Recently, machine learning (ML) and computational approaches have been developed to automate and improve the interpretation of mammograms. However, both BI-RADS and the ML-based methods focus on the analysis of data from the present and sometimes the most recent prior visit. While it is clear that temporal changes in image features of the longitudinal scans should carry value for quantifying breast cancer risk, no prior work has conducted a systematic study of this. In this paper, we extend a state-of-the-art ML model to ingest an arbitrary number of longitudinal mammograms and predict future breast cancer risk. On a large-scale dataset, we demonstrate that our model, LoMaR, achieves state-of-the-art performance when presented with only the present mammogram. Furthermore, we use LoMaR to characterize the predictive value of prior visits. Our results show that longer histories (e.g., up to four prior annual mammograms) can significantly boost the accuracy of predicting future breast cancer risk, particularly beyond the short-term. Our code and model weights are available at https://github.com/batuhankmkaraman/LoMaR. ",

    "title": "Scalable Bayesian Inference in the Era of Deep Learning: From Gaussian  Processes to Deep Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Large neural networks trained on large datasets have become the dominant paradigm in machine learning. These systems rely on maximum likelihood point estimates of their parameters, precluding them from expressing model uncertainty. This may result in overconfident predictions and it prevents the use of deep learning models for sequential decision making. This thesis develops scalable methods to equip neural networks with model uncertainty. In particular, we leverage the linearised Laplace approximation to equip pre-trained neural networks with the uncertainty estimates provided by their tangent linear models. This turns the problem of Bayesian inference in neural networks into one of Bayesian inference in conjugate Gaussian-linear models. Alas, the cost of this remains cubic in either the number of network parameters or in the number of observations times output dimensions. By assumption, neither are tractable. We address this intractability by using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) -- the workhorse algorithm of deep learning -- to perform posterior sampling in linear models and their convex duals: Gaussian processes. With this, we turn back to linearised neural networks, finding the linearised Laplace approximation to present a number of incompatibilities with modern deep learning practices -- namely, stochastic optimisation, early stopping and normalisation layers -- when used for hyperparameter learning. We resolve these and construct a sample-based EM algorithm for scalable hyperparameter learning with linearised neural networks. We apply the above methods to perform linearised neural network inference with ResNet-50 (25M parameters) trained on Imagenet (1.2M observations and 1000 output dimensions). Additionally, we apply our methods to estimate uncertainty for 3d tomographic reconstructions obtained with the deep image prior network. ",

Our findings indicate statistically different speckle patterns within the retina and between retinal layers and surgical tools, facilitating the segmentation of previously unseen data without the necessity for manual labeling. The research involves fitting various statistical distributions to iOCT data, enabling the differentiation of different ocular structures and surgical tools. The proposed segmentation model aims to refine the statistical findings based on prior tissue understanding to leverage statistical and biological knowledge. Incorporating statistical parameters, physical analysis of light-tissue interaction, and deep learning informed by biological structures enhance segmentation accuracy, offering potential benefits to real-time applications in ophthalmic surgical procedures. The study demonstrates the adaptability and precision of using Gamma distribution parameters and the derived binary maps as sole inputs for segmentation, notably enhancing the model's inference performance on unseen data.

    "title": "Neural Dynamic Data Valuation",
    "abstract": "Data constitute the foundational component of the data economy and its marketplaces. Efficient and fair data valuation has emerged as a topic of significant interest.\\ Many approaches based on marginal contribution have shown promising results in various downstream tasks. However, they are well known to be computationally expensive as they require training a large number of utility functions, which are used to evaluate the usefulness or value of a given dataset for a specific purpose. As a result, it has been recognized as infeasible to apply these methods to a data marketplace involving large-scale datasets. Consequently, a critical issue arises: how can the re-training of the utility function be avoided? To address this issue, we propose a novel data valuation method from the perspective of optimal control, named the neural dynamic data valuation (NDDV). Our method has solid theoretical interpretations to accurately identify the data valuation via the sensitivity of the data optimal control state. In addition, we implement a data re-weighting strategy to capture the unique features of data points, ensuring fairness through the interaction between data points and the mean-field states. Notably, our method requires only training once to estimate the value of all data points, significantly improving the computational efficiency. We conduct comprehensive experiments using different datasets and tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed NDDV method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art data valuation methods in accurately identifying data points with either high or low values and is more computationally efficient.

The asymptotic behavior of the solution is investigated when the random geometric graph is considered and the number of data points goes to infinity. We show that the continuum limit is an appropriately weighted $p$-biharmonic equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The result relies on the uniform $L^p$ estimates for solutions and gradients of nonlocal and graph Poisson equations. The $L^\\infty$ estimates of solutions are also obtained as a byproduct. ",

However, such models sometimes suffer from word skipping and repeating due to the lack of explicit monotonic alignment constraints. In this paper, we notice from the attention maps that some particular attention heads of the decoder-only model indicate the alignments between speech and text. We call the attention maps of those heads Alignment-Emerged Attention Maps (AEAMs). Based on this discovery, we propose a novel inference method without altering the training process, named Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI), to facilitate monotonic synthesis. It first identifies AEAMs using the Attention Sweeping algorithm and then applies constraining masks on AEAMs. Our experimental results on decoder-only TTS model VALL-E show that the WER of synthesized speech is reduced by up to 20.5% relatively with ACI while the naturalness and speaker similarity are comparable.
