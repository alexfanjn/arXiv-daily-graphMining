    "abstract": "Backpropagation-optimized artificial neural networks, while precise, lack robustness, leading to unforeseen behaviors that affect their safety. Biological neural systems do solve some of these issues already. Thus, understanding the biological mechanisms of robustness is an important step towards building trustworthy and safe systems. Unlike artificial models, biological neurons adjust connectivity based on neighboring cell activity. Robustness in neural representations is hypothesized to correlate with the smoothness of the encoding manifold. Recent work suggests power law covariance spectra, which were observed studying the primary visual cortex of mice, to be indicative of a balanced trade-off between accuracy and robustness in representations. Here, we show that unsupervised local learning models with winner takes all dynamics learn such power law representations, providing upcoming studies a mechanistic model with that characteristic. Our research aims to understand the interplay between geometry, spectral properties, robustness, and expressivity in neural representations. Hence, we study the link between representation smoothness and spectrum by using weight, Jacobian and spectral regularization while assessing performance and adversarial robustness. Our work serves as a foundation for future research into the mechanisms underlying power law spectra and optimally smooth encodings in both biological and artificial systems. The insights gained may elucidate the mechanisms that realize robust neural networks in mammalian brains and inform the development of more stable and reliable artificial systems. ",

We manually annotated the collected YouTube comments with three sentiment labels: negative (0), positive (1), and neutral (2). We then constructed models for text sentiment classification and tested the models' performance on both binary and ternary classification tasks in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our results indicate that, in binary classification tasks, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and N-gram get the highest accuracy. In ternary classification tasks, the model using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) significantly outperforms other machine learning models, achieving an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.78. Additionally, we employ the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to generate 10 topics from the comments to explore the public's underlying views on SDRs. Drawing from these findings, we propose targeted recommendations for shaping future policies concerning SDRs. This work provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the SDR sector regarding social perception, interaction, and safety. ",

Although these methods provide a good insight into the physical behaviour of the system, they rely on the exact knowledge of parameters such as inertia, friction and joint flexibility. In addition, the system is often affected by uncertain and nonlinear effects, such as saturation and dead zones, which can be difficult to model. A popular alternative is the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques - e.g., Neural Networks (NNs) - in the context of a \"black-box\" methodology. This paper reports on our experience with this approach for a real-life 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) manipulator. Specifically, we considered several NN architectures: single NN, multiple NNs, and cascade NN. We compared the performance of the system by using different policies for selecting the NN hyperparameters. Our experiments reveal that the best accuracy and performance are obtained by a cascade NN, in which we encode our prior physical knowledge about the dependencies between joints, complemented by an appropriate optimisation of the hyperparameters.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is acknowledged as the next generation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and hold great promise in effectively processing spatial-temporal information. However, the choice of timestep becomes crucial as it significantly impacts the accuracy of the neural network training. Specifically, a smaller timestep indicates better performance in efficient computing, resulting in reduced latency and operations. While, using a small timestep may lead to low accuracy due to insufficient information presentation with few spikes. This observation motivates us to develop an SNN that is more reliable for adaptive timestep by introducing a novel regularisation technique, namely Spatial-Temporal Regulariser (STR). Our approach regulates the ratio between the strength of spikes and membrane potential at each timestep. This effectively balances spatial and temporal performance during training, ultimately resulting in an Anytime Optimal Inference (AOI) SNN. Through extensive experiments on frame-based and event-based datasets, our method, in combination with cutoff based on softmax output, achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both latency and accuracy. Notably, with STR and cutoff, SNN achieves 2.14 to 2.89 faster in inference compared to the pre-configured timestep with near-zero accuracy drop of 0.50% to 0.64% over the event-based datasets.

Aiming for these applications, various device concepts have been proposed to mimic the neuronal dynamics and functions. While till now, the artificial neuron devices with high efficiency, high stability and low power consumption are still far from practical application. Due to the special insulator-metal phase transition, Vanadium Dioxide (VO2) has been considered as an idea candidate for neuronal device fabrication. However, its intrinsic insulating state requires the VO2 neuronal device to be driven under large bias voltage, resulting in high power consumption and low frequency. Thus in the current study, we have addressed this challenge by preparing oxygen vacancies modulated VO2 film(VO2-x) and fabricating the VO2-x neuronal devices for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) construction. Results indicate the neuron devices can be operated under lower voltage with improved processing speed. The proposed VO2-x based back-propagation SNNs (BP-SNNs) system, trained with the MNIST dataset, demonstrates excellent accuracy in image recognition. Our study not only demonstrates the VO2-x based neurons and SNN system for practical application, but also offers an effective way to optimize the future neuromorphic computing systems by defect engineering strategy.

In this survey, We propose a new taxonomy that provides a more comprehensive breakdown of the space of FAIGC methods today. Next, we explore the modalities and generative technologies of FAIGC, categorized under AI-generated disinformation and AI-generated misinformation. From various perspectives, we then introduce FAIGC detection methods, including Deceptive FAIGC Detection, Deepfake Detection, and Hallucination-based FAIGC Detection.

However, existing methods either suffer from the data privacy issue and the susceptibility to cyberattacks or fail to consider the spatial correlation among different stations. To address these challenges, a federated graph learning approach involving multiple charging stations is proposed to collaboratively train a more generalized deep learning model for demand forecasting while capturing spatial correlations among various stations and enhancing robustness against potential attacks. Firstly, for better model performance, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is leveraged to characterize the geographic correlation among different charging stations in a federated manner. Secondly, to ensure robustness and deal with the data heterogeneity in a federated setting, a message passing that utilizes a global attention mechanism to aggregate personalized models for each client is proposed. Thirdly, by concerning cyberattacks, a special credit-based function is designed to mitigate potential threats from malicious clients or unwanted attacks. Extensive experiments on a public EV charging dataset are conducted using various deep learning techniques and federated learning methods to demonstrate the prediction accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach.

To address such increasing demands, designing a scalable hardware architecture became a key problem. Among recent solutions, the 2.5D silicon interposer multi-chip module (MCM)-based AI accelerator has been actively explored as a promising scalable solution due to their significant benefits in the low engineering cost and composability. However, previous MCM accelerators are based on homogeneous architectures with fixed dataflow, which encounter major challenges from highly heterogeneous multi-model workloads due to their limited workload adaptivity. Therefore, in this work, we explore the opportunity in the heterogeneous dataflow MCM AI accelerators. We identify the scheduling of multi-model workload on heterogeneous dataflow MCM AI accelerator is an important and challenging problem due to its significance and scale, which reaches O(10^18) scale even for a single model case on 6x6 chiplets. We develop a set of heuristics to navigate the huge scheduling space and codify them into a scheduler with advanced techniques such as inter-chiplet pipelining. Our evaluation on ten multi-model workload scenarios for datacenter multitenancy and AR/VR use-cases has shown the efficacy of our approach, achieving on average 35.3% and 31.4% less energy-delay product (EDP) for the respective applications settings compared to homogeneous baselines.

IMSI catchers can intercept and manipulate cellular communications, compromising the privacy and security of mobile devices and their users. With the advent of 4G and 5G networks, IMSI catchers have become more sophisticated and pose new challenges to cellular network security [2]. This paper provides an overview of the impact of IMSI catcher deployments on cellular network security in the context of 4G and 5G networks. It discusses the challenges posed by IMSI catchers, including the unauthorized collection of IMSI numbers, interception of communications, and potential misuse of subscriber information. It also highlights the potential consequences of IMSI catcher deployments, including the compromise of user privacy, financial fraud, and unauthorized surveillance. The paper further reviews the countermeasures that can be employed to mitigate the risks posed by IMSI catchers. These countermeasures include network-based solutions such as signal analysis, encryption, and authentication mechanisms, as well as user-based solutions such as mobile applications and device settings. The paper also discusses the limitations and effectiveness of these countermeasures in the context of 4G and 5G networks. Finally, the paper identifies research gaps and future directions for enhancing cellular network security against IMSI catchers in the era of 4G and 5G networks. This includes the need for improved encryption algorithms, authentication mechanisms, and detection techniques to effectively detect and prevent IMSI catcher deployments. The paper also emphasizes the importance of regulatory and policy measures to govern the deployment and use of IMSI catchers to protect user privacy and security. ",

Our method meets the rigorous real-time operational standards essential for autonomous vehicles, enabling prompt trajectory generation that is vital for secure and efficient navigation.

Our work introduces a leap forward in scientific computing and CEM by proposing an original solution of Maxwell's equations that is grounded on graph neural networks (GNNs) and enables the high-performance numerical resolution of these fundamental mathematical expressions. Specifically, we demonstrate that the update equations derived by discretizing Maxwell's partial differential equations can be innately expressed as a two-layer GNN with static and pre-determined edge weights. Given this intuition, a straightforward way to numerically solve Maxwell's equations entails simple message passing between such a GNN's nodes, yielding a significant computational time gain, while preserving the same accuracy as conventional transient CEM methods. Ultimately, our work supports the efficient and precise emulation of electromagnetic wave propagation with GNNs, and more importantly, we anticipate that applying a similar treatment to systems of partial differential equations arising in other scientific disciplines, e.g., computational fluid dynamics, can benefit computational sciences ",

    "abstract": "Research data sets are growing to unprecedented sizes and network modeling is commonly used to extract complex relationships in diverse domains, such as genetic interactions involved in disease, logistics, and social communities. As the number of nodes increases in a network, an increasing sparsity of edges is a practical limitation due to memory restrictions. Moreover, many of these sparse networks exhibit very large numbers of nodes with no adjacent edges, as well as disjoint components of nodes with no edges connecting them. A prevalent aim in network modeling is the identification of clusters, or communities, of nodes that are highly interrelated. Several definitions of strong community structure have been introduced to facilitate this task, each with inherent assumptions and biases. We introduce an intuitive objective function for quantifying the quality of clustering results in large sparse networks. We utilize a two-step method for identifying communities which is especially well-suited for this domain as the first step efficiently divides the network into the disjoint components, while the second step optimizes clustering of the produced components based on the new objective. Using simulated networks, optimization based on the new objective function consistently yields significantly higher accuracy than those based on the modularity function, with the widest gaps appearing for the noisiest networks. Additionally, applications to benchmark problems illustrate the intuitive correctness of our approach. Finally, the practicality of our approach is demonstrated in real-world data in which we identify complex genetic interactions in large-scale networks comprised of tens of thousands of nodes. Based on these three different types of trials, our results clearly demonstrate the usefulness of our two-step procedure and the accuracy of our simple objective. ",

    "abstract": "The behavior and decision making of groups or communities can be dramatically influenced by individuals pushing particular agendas, e.g., to promote or disparage a person or an activity, to call for action, etc.. In the examination of online influence campaigns, particularly those related to important political and social events, scholars often concentrate on identifying the sources responsible for setting and controlling the agenda (e.g., public media). In this article we present a methodology for detecting specific instances of agenda control through social media where annotated data is limited or non-existent. By using a modest corpus of Twitter messages centered on the 2022 French Presidential Elections, we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of various approaches and techniques that can be applied to this problem. Our findings demonstrate that by treating the task as a textual entailment problem, it is possible to overcome the requirement for a large annotated training dataset. ",

    "title": "Efficient and Responsible Adaptation of Large Language Models for Robust  Top-k Recommendations",
    "abstract": "Conventional recommendation systems (RSs) are typically optimized to enhance performance metrics uniformly across all training samples. This makes it hard for data-driven RSs to cater to a diverse set of users due to the varying properties of these users. The performance disparity among various populations can harm the model's robustness with respect to sub-populations. While recent works have shown promising results in adapting large language models (LLMs) for recommendation to address hard samples, long user queries from millions of users can degrade the performance of LLMs and elevate costs, processing times and inference latency. This challenges the practical applicability of LLMs for recommendations. To address this, we propose a hybrid task allocation framework that utilizes the capabilities of both LLMs and traditional RSs. By adopting a two-phase approach to improve robustness to sub-populations, we promote a strategic assignment of tasks for efficient and responsible adaptation of LLMs. Our strategy works by first identifying the weak and inactive users that receive a suboptimal ranking performance by RSs. Next, we use an in-context learning approach for such users, wherein each user interaction history is contextualized as a distinct ranking task and given to an LLM. We test our hybrid framework by incorporating various recommendation algorithms -- collaborative filtering and learning-to-rank recommendation models -- and two LLMs -- both open and close-sourced. Our results on three real-world datasets show a significant reduction in weak users and improved robustness of RSs to sub-populations $(\\approx12\\%)$ and overall performance without disproportionately escalating costs.

Our approach develops a comprehensive framework that detects: (a) the existence, (b) the topic, and (c) the stance of an argument, correctly accounting for the logical dependence among the three tasks. Our algorithm leverages the fine-tuning and prompt-engineering of Large Language Models. We evaluate our approach and show that it performs well in all the three capabilities. First, we develop and release an Argument Detection model that can classify a piece of text as an argument with an F1 score between 79% and 86% on three different benchmark datasets. Second, we release a language model that can identify the topic being argued in a sentence, be it implicit or explicit, with an average similarity score of 71%, outperforming current naive methods by nearly 40%. Finally, we develop a method for Argument Stance Classification, and evaluate the capability of our approach, showing it achieves a classification F1 score between 71% and 78% across three diverse benchmark datasets. Our evaluation demonstrates that WIBA allows the comprehensive understanding of What Is Being Argued in large corpora across diverse contexts, which is of core interest to many applications in linguistics, communication, and social and computer science.

Despite recent advances in safety filters that can keep arbitrary task-driven policies from incurring safety failures, existing solutions for legged robot locomotion still rely on simplified dynamics and may fail when the robot is perturbed away from predefined stable gaits. This paper presents a general approach that leverages offline game-theoretic reinforcement learning to synthesize a highly robust safety filter for high-order nonlinear dynamics. This gameplay filter then maintains runtime safety by continually simulating adversarial futures and precluding task-driven actions that would cause it to lose future games (and thereby violate safety). Validated on a 36-dimensional quadruped robot locomotion task, the gameplay safety filter exhibits inherent robustness to the sim-to-real gap without manual tuning or heuristic designs. Physical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the gameplay safety filter under perturbations, such as tugging and unmodeled irregular terrains, while simulation studies shed light on how to trade off computation and conservativeness without compromising safety.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of learning a binary classifier on the vertices of a graph. In particular, we consider classifiers given by monophonic halfspaces, partitions of the vertices that are convex in a certain abstract sense. Monophonic halfspaces, and related notions such as geodesic halfspaces,have recently attracted interest, and several connections have been drawn between their properties(e.g., their VC dimension) and the structure of the underlying graph $G$. We prove several novel results for learning monophonic halfspaces in the supervised, online, and active settings. Our main result is that a monophonic halfspace can be learned with near-optimal passive sample complexity in time polynomial in $n = |V(G)|$. This requires us to devise a polynomial-time algorithm for consistent hypothesis checking, based on several structural insights on monophonic halfspaces and on a reduction to $2$-satisfiability. We prove similar results for the online and active settings. We also show that the concept class can be enumerated with delay $\\operatorname{poly}(n)$, and that empirical risk minimization can be performed in time $2^{\\omega(G)}\\operatorname{poly}(n)$ where $\\omega(G)$ is the clique number of $G$. These results answer open questions from the literature (Gonz\\'alez et al., 2020), and show a contrast with geodesic halfspaces, for which some of the said problems are NP-hard (Seiffarth et al., 2023).

Methods: This paper proposes the Guided Conditional Diffusion Classifier (ConDiff), a novel deep-learning infection detection model that combines guided image synthesis with a denoising diffusion model and distance-based classification. The process involves (1) generating guided conditional synthetic images by injecting Gaussian noise to a guide image, followed by denoising the noise-perturbed image through a reverse diffusion process, conditioned on infection status and (2) classifying infections based on the minimum Euclidean distance between synthesized images and the original guide image in embedding space. Results: ConDiff demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 83% and an F1-score of 0.858, outperforming state-of-the-art models by at least 3%. The use of a triplet loss function reduces overfitting in the distance-based classifier. Conclusions: ConDiff not only enhances diagnostic accuracy for DFU infections but also pioneers the use of generative discriminative models for detailed medical image analysis, offering a promising approach for improving patient outcomes.

    "abstract": "Automated software testing is integral to the software development process, streamlining workflows and ensuring product reliability. Visual testing within this context, especially concerning user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) validation, stands as one of crucial determinants of overall software quality. Nevertheless, conventional methods like pixel-wise comparison and region-based visual change detection fall short in capturing contextual similarities, nuanced alterations, and understanding the spatial relationships between UI elements. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based method for visual change detection in software test automation. Leveraging a machine learning model, our method accurately identifies UI controls from software screenshots and constructs a graph representing contextual and spatial relationships between the controls. This information is then used to find correspondence between UI controls within screenshots of different versions of a software. The resulting graph encapsulates the intricate layout of the UI and underlying contextual relations, providing a holistic and context-aware model. This model is finally used to detect and highlight visual regressions in the UI. Comprehensive experiments on different datasets showed that our change detector can accurately detect visual software changes in various simple and complex test scenarios. Moreover, it outperformed pixel-wise comparison and region-based baselines by a large margin in more complex testing scenarios. This work not only contributes to the advancement of visual change detection but also holds practical implications, offering a robust solution for real-world software test automation challenges, enhancing reliability, and ensuring the seamless evolution of software interfaces.

    "abstract": "Machine learning applications on extremely low-power devices, commonly referred to as tiny machine learning (TinyML), promises a smarter and more connected world. However, the advancement of current TinyML research is hindered by the limited size and quality of pertinent datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Wake Vision, a large-scale, diverse dataset tailored for person detection -- the canonical task for TinyML visual sensing. Wake Vision comprises over 6 million images, which is a hundredfold increase compared to the previous standard, and has undergone thorough quality filtering. Using Wake Vision for training results in a 2.41\\% increase in accuracy compared to the established benchmark. Alongside the dataset, we provide a collection of five detailed benchmark sets that assess model performance on specific segments of the test data, such as varying lighting conditions, distances from the camera, and demographic characteristics of subjects. These novel fine-grained benchmarks facilitate the evaluation of model quality in challenging real-world scenarios that are often ignored when focusing solely on overall accuracy. Through an evaluation of a MobileNetV2 TinyML model on the benchmarks, we show that the input resolution plays a more crucial role than the model width in detecting distant subjects and that the impact of quantization on model robustness is minimal, thanks to the dataset quality. These findings underscore the importance of a detailed evaluation to identify essential factors for model development.

However, reconstruction quality suffers on street scenes due to largely collinear camera motions and sparser samplings at higher speeds. On the other hand, the application often demands rendering from camera views that deviate from the inputs to accurately simulate behaviors like lane changes. In this paper, we propose several insights that allow a better utilization of Lidar data to improve NeRF quality on street scenes. First, our framework learns a geometric scene representation from Lidar, which is fused with the implicit grid-based representation for radiance decoding, thereby supplying stronger geometric information offered by explicit point cloud. Second, we put forth a robust occlusion-aware depth supervision scheme, which allows utilizing densified Lidar points by accumulation. Third, we generate augmented training views from Lidar points for further improvement. Our insights translate to largely improved novel view synthesis under real driving scenes. ",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, similar to other application domains, social media content has been proven very effective in disaster informatics. However, due to the unstructured nature of the data, several challenges are associated with disaster analysis in social media content. To fully explore the potential of social media content in disaster informatics, access to relevant content and the correct geo-location information is very critical. In this paper, we propose a three-step solution to tackling these challenges. Firstly, the proposed solution aims to classify social media posts into relevant and irrelevant posts followed by the automatic extraction of location information from the posts' text through Named Entity Recognition (NER) analysis. Finally, to quickly analyze the topics covered in large volumes of social media posts, we perform topic modeling resulting in a list of top keywords, that highlight the issues discussed in the tweet. For the Relevant Classification of Twitter Posts (RCTP), we proposed a merit-based fusion framework combining the capabilities of four different models namely BERT, RoBERTa, Distil BERT, and ALBERT obtaining the highest F1-score of 0.933 on a benchmark dataset. For the Location Extraction from Twitter Text (LETT), we evaluated four models namely BERT, RoBERTa, Distil BERTA, and Electra in an NER framework obtaining the highest F1-score of 0.960. For topic modeling, we used the BERTopic library to discover the hidden topic patterns in the relevant tweets. The experimental results of all the components of the proposed end-to-end solution are very encouraging and hint at the potential of social media content and NLP in disaster management. ",

This study describes a self-supervised deep learning approach in digital pathology of emboli for classifying ischemic stroke clot origin from histopathological images. Methods: The dataset included whole slide images (WSI) from the STRIP AI Kaggle challenge, consisting of retrieved clots from ischemic stroke patients following mechanical thrombectomy. Transformer-based deep learning models were developed using transfer learning and self-supervised pretraining for classifying WSI. Customizations included an attention pooling layer, weighted loss function, and threshold optimization. Various model architectures were tested and compared, and model performances were primarily evaluated using weighted logarithmic loss. Results: The model achieved a logloss score of 0.662 in cross-validation and 0.659 on the test set. Different model backbones were compared, with the swin_large_patch4_window12_384 showed higher performance. Thresholding techniques for clot origin classification were employed to balance false positives and negatives. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the extent of efficacy of transformer-based deep learning models in identifying ischemic stroke clot origins from histopathological images and emphasizes the need for refined modeling techniques specifically adapted to thrombi WSI. Further research is needed to improve model performance, interpretability, validate its effectiveness. Future enhancement could include integrating larger patient cohorts, advanced preprocessing strategies, and exploring ensemble multimodal methods for enhanced diagnostic accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "We present EchoScene, an interactive and controllable generative model that generates 3D indoor scenes on scene graphs. EchoScene leverages a dual-branch diffusion model that dynamically adapts to scene graphs. Existing methods struggle to handle scene graphs due to varying numbers of nodes, multiple edge combinations, and manipulator-induced node-edge operations. EchoScene overcomes this by associating each node with a denoising process and enables collaborative information exchange, enhancing controllable and consistent generation aware of global constraints. This is achieved through an information echo scheme in both shape and layout branches. At every denoising step, all processes share their denoising data with an information exchange unit that combines these updates using graph convolution. The scheme ensures that the denoising processes are influenced by a holistic understanding of the scene graph, facilitating the generation of globally coherent scenes. The resulting scenes can be manipulated during inference by editing the input scene graph and sampling the noise in the diffusion model. Extensive experiments validate our approach, which maintains scene controllability and surpasses previous methods in generation fidelity. Moreover, the generated scenes are of high quality and thus directly compatible with off-the-shelf texture generation. Code and trained models are open-sourced. ",

Each restless arm is endowed with a state that evolves independently according to a Markov decision process regardless of being activated or not. In this paper, we consider the task of learning in episodic RMAB with unknown transition functions and adversarial rewards, which can change arbitrarily across episodes. Further, we consider a challenging but natural bandit feedback setting that only adversarial rewards of activated arms are revealed to the decision maker (DM). The goal of the DM is to maximize its total adversarial rewards during the learning process while the instantaneous activation constraint must be satisfied in each decision epoch.

    "abstract": "A common problem in Message-Passing Neural Networks is oversquashing -- the limited ability to facilitate effective information flow between distant nodes. Oversquashing is attributed to the exponential decay in information transmission as node distances increase. This paper introduces a novel perspective to address oversquashing, leveraging properties of global and local non-dissipativity, that enable the maintenance of a constant information flow rate. Namely, we present SWAN, a uniquely parameterized model GNN with antisymmetry both in space and weight domains, as a means to obtain non-dissipativity. Our theoretical analysis asserts that by achieving these properties, SWAN offers an enhanced ability to transmit information over extended distances. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that emphasize long-range interactions validate the theoretical understanding of SWAN, and its ability to mitigate oversquashing. ",

    "abstract": "Decentralized learning is appealing as it enables the scalable usage of large amounts of distributed data and resources (without resorting to any central entity), while promoting privacy since every user minimizes the direct exposure of their data. Yet, without additional precautions, curious users can still leverage models obtained from their peers to violate privacy. In this paper, we propose Decor, a variant of decentralized SGD with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Essentially, in Decor, users securely exchange randomness seeds in one communication round to generate pairwise-canceling correlated Gaussian noises, which are injected to protect local models at every communication round. We theoretically and empirically show that, for arbitrary connected graphs, Decor matches the central DP optimal privacy-utility trade-off. We do so under SecLDP, our new relaxation of local DP, which protects all user communications against an external eavesdropper and curious users, assuming that every pair of connected users shares a secret, i.e., an information hidden to all others. The main theoretical challenge is to control the accumulation of non-canceling correlated noise due to network sparsity. We also propose a companion SecLDP privacy accountant for public use. ",

    "abstract": "Neural networks have been extensively applied to a variety of tasks, achieving astounding results. Applying neural networks in the scientific field is an important research direction that is gaining increasing attention. In scientific applications, the scale of neural networks is generally moderate-size, mainly to ensure the speed of inference during application. Additionally, comparing neural networks to traditional algorithms in scientific applications is inevitable. These applications often require rapid computations, making the reduction of neural network sizes increasingly important. Existing work has found that the powerful capabilities of neural networks are primarily due to their non-linearity. Theoretical work has discovered that under strong non-linearity, neurons in the same layer tend to behave similarly, a phenomenon known as condensation. Condensation offers an opportunity to reduce the scale of neural networks to a smaller subnetwork with similar performance. In this article, we propose a condensation reduction algorithm to verify the feasibility of this idea in practical problems. Our reduction method can currently be applied to both fully connected networks and convolutional networks, achieving positive results. In complex combustion acceleration tasks, we reduced the size of the neural network to 41.7% of its original scale while maintaining prediction accuracy. In the CIFAR10 image classification task, we reduced the network size to 11.5% of the original scale, still maintaining a satisfactory validation accuracy. Our method can be applied to most trained neural networks, reducing computational pressure and improving inference speed. ",

Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has been regarded as an effective method to achieve this goal. It can learn high-quality representations from unlabeled data and achieve promising empirical performance on multiple downstream tasks. Existing SSL methods mainly constrain generality from two aspects: (i) large-scale training data, and (ii) learning task-level shared knowledge. However, these methods lack explicit modeling of the SSL generality in the learning objective, and the theoretical understanding of SSL's generality remains limited. This may cause SSL models to overfit in data-scarce situations and generalize poorly in the real world, making it difficult to achieve true generality. To address these issues, we provide a theoretical definition of generality in SSL and define a $\\sigma$-measurement to help quantify it. Based on this insight, we explicitly model generality into self-supervised learning and further propose a novel SSL framework, called GeSSL. It introduces a self-motivated target based on $\\sigma$-measurement, which enables the model to find the optimal update direction towards generality. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed GeSSL. ",

    "abstract": "The escalation in urban private car ownership has worsened the urban parking predicament, necessitating effective parking availability prediction for urban planning and management. However, the existing prediction methods suffer from low prediction accuracy with the lack of spatial-temporal correlation features related to parking volume, and neglect of flow patterns and correlations between similar parking lots within certain areas. To address these challenges, this study proposes a parking availability prediction framework integrating spatial-temporal deep learning with multi-source data fusion, encompassing traffic demand data from multiple sources (e.g., metro, bus, taxi services), and parking lot data. The framework is based on the Transformer as the spatial-temporal deep learning model and leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones, extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) connected to parking lots. Real-world empirical data was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with different machine learning, deep learning, and traditional statistical models for predicting parking availability. Experimental results reveal that, with the proposed pipeline, the developed Transformer model outperforms other models in terms of various metrics, e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). By fusing multi-source demanding data with spatial-temporal deep learning techniques, this approach offers the potential to develop parking availability prediction systems that furnish more accurate and timely information to both drivers and urban planners, thereby fostering more efficient and sustainable urban mobility.

Prior approaches for enhancing fairness in recommender systems presume the availability of all sensitive attributes, which can be difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns or inadequate means of capturing these attributes. In practice, the efficacy of these approaches is limited, pushing us to investigate ways of promoting fairness with limited sensitive attribute information. Toward this goal, it is important to reconstruct missing sensitive attributes. Nevertheless, reconstruction errors are inevitable due to the complexity of real-world sensitive attribute reconstruction problems and legal regulations. Thus, we pursue fair learning methods that are robust to reconstruction errors. To this end, we propose Distributionally Robust Fair Optimization (DRFO), which minimizes the worst-case unfairness over all potential probability distributions of missing sensitive attributes instead of the reconstructed one to account for the impact of the reconstruction errors. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence to demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure fairness in recommender systems when only limited sensitive attributes are accessible. ",

Due to the rapid development of society, the geographic information captured by remote sensing satellites is changing faster and more complex, which undoubtedly poses a higher challenge and highlights the value of change detection tasks. We propose MFDS-Net: Multi-Scale Feature Depth-Supervised Network for Remote Sensing Change Detection with Global Semantic and Detail Information (MFDS-Net) with the aim of achieving a more refined description of changing buildings as well as geographic information, enhancing the localisation of changing targets and the acquisition of weak features. To achieve the research objectives, we use a modified ResNet_34 as backbone network to perform feature extraction and DO-Conv as an alternative to traditional convolution to better focus on the association between feature information and to obtain better training results. We propose the Global Semantic Enhancement Module (GSEM) to enhance the processing of high-level semantic information from a global perspective. The Differential Feature Integration Module (DFIM) is proposed to strengthen the fusion of different depth feature information, achieving learning and extraction of differential features. The entire network is trained and optimized using a deep supervision mechanism. The experimental outcomes of MFDS-Net surpass those of current mainstream change detection networks. On the LEVIR dataset, it achieved an F1 score of 91.589 and IoU of 84.483, on the WHU dataset, the scores were F1: 92.384 and IoU: 86.807, and on the GZ-CD dataset, the scores were F1: 86.377 and IoU: 76.021.

In this paper, we introduce two novel poisoning attacks on FL tailored to regression tasks within autonomous driving: FLStealth and Off-Track Attack (OTA). FLStealth, an untargeted attack, aims at providing model updates that deteriorate the global model performance while appearing benign. OTA, on the other hand, is a targeted attack with the objective to change the global model's behavior when exposed to a certain trigger. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks by conducting comprehensive experiments pertaining to the task of vehicle trajectory prediction. In particular, we show that, among five different untargeted attacks, FLStealth is the most successful at bypassing the considered defenses employed by the server. For OTA, we demonstrate the inability of common defense strategies to mitigate the attack, highlighting the critical need for new defensive mechanisms against targeted attacks within FL for autonomous driving.

It is well recognized that the global attention mechanism considers a wider receptive field in a fully connected graph, leading many to believe that useful information can be extracted from all the nodes. In this paper, we challenge this belief: does the globalizing property always benefit Graph Transformers? We reveal the over-globalizing problem in Graph Transformer by presenting both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, i.e., the current attention mechanism overly focuses on those distant nodes, while the near nodes, which actually contain most of the useful information, are relatively weakened. Then we propose a novel Bi-Level Global Graph Transformer with Collaborative Training (CoBFormer), including the inter-cluster and intra-cluster Transformers, to prevent the over-globalizing problem while keeping the ability to extract valuable information from distant nodes. Moreover, the collaborative training is proposed to improve the model's generalization ability with a theoretical guarantee.

They exhibit therapeutically relevant in-vivo-like characteristics from 3D cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions to radial pathophysiological gradients related to proliferative activity and nutrient/oxygen supply, altering cellular radioresponse. State-of-the-art assays quantify long-term curative endpoints based on collected brightfield image time series from large treated spheroid populations per irradiation dose and treatment arm. Here, spheroid control probabilities are documented analogous to in-vivo tumor control probabilities based on Kaplan-Meier curves. This analyses require laborious spheroid segmentation of up to 100.000 images per treatment arm to extract relevant structural information from the images, e.g., diameter, area, volume and circularity. While several image analysis algorithms are available for spheroid segmentation, they all focus on compact MCTS with clearly distinguishable outer rim throughout growth. However, treated MCTS may partly be detached and destroyed and are usually obscured by dead cell debris. We successfully train two Fully Convolutional Networks, UNet and HRNet, and optimize their hyperparameters to develop an automatic segmentation for both untreated and treated MCTS. We systematically validate the automatic segmentation on larger, independent data sets of spheroids derived from two human head-and-neck cancer cell lines. We find an excellent overlap between manual and automatic segmentation for most images, quantified by Jaccard indices at around 90%. For images with smaller overlap of the segmentations, we demonstrate that this error is comparable to the variations across segmentations from different biological experts, suggesting that these images represent biologically unclear or ambiguous cases.

Through a comparative analysis against conventional and state-of-the-art methods, our findings reveal the superior convergence rate of FedProx+LA. Notably, if the label distribution is very heterogeneous, our FedProx+LA approach shows substantial improvements in detection performance compared to baseline methods, also outperforming our previous FedLA approach.

Nonlinearities, such as activation functions and nonlinear pooling layers, are handled with integral quadratic constraints. If the neural network contains signal processing layers (convolutional or state space model layers), we realize them as 1-D/2-D/N-D systems and exploit this structure as well. We distinguish ourselves from related work on Lipschitz constant estimation by more extensive structure exploitation (scalability) and a generalization to a large class of common neural network architectures.

To resolve the theoretical dilemma of SFL, we establish sharp convergence guarantees for SFL on heterogeneous data with both upper and lower bounds. Specifically, we derive the upper bounds for strongly convex, general convex and non-convex objective functions, and construct the matching lower bounds for the strongly convex and general convex objective functions. Then, we compare the upper bounds of SFL with those of PFL, showing that SFL outperforms PFL (at least, when the level of heterogeneity is relatively high).

Incremental approaches based on the RETE algorithm provide an adequate solution in many scenarios, but are generally designed to search for query results over the entire graph. However, in certain situations, a user may only be interested in query results for a subgraph, for instance when a developer is working on a large model of which only a part is loaded into their workspace. In this case, the global execution semantics can result in significant computational overhead. Contribution: To mitigate the outlined shortcoming, in this paper we propose an extension of the RETE approach that enables local, yet fully incremental execution of graph queries, while still guaranteeing completeness of results with respect to the relevant subgraph. Results: We empirically evaluate the presented approach via experiments inspired by a scenario from software development and an independent social network benchmark. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique can significantly improve performance regarding memory consumption and execution time in favorable cases, but may incur a noticeable linear overhead in unfavorable cases.

    "abstract": "Satellite constellation systems are becoming more attractive to provide communication services worldwide, especially in areas without network connectivity. While optimizing satellite gateway placement is crucial for operators to minimize deployment and operating costs, reducing the number of gateways may require more inter-satellite link hops to reach the ground network, thereby increasing latency. Therefore, it is of significant importance to develop a framework that optimizes gateway placement, dynamic routing, and flow management in inter-satellite links to enhance network performance. To this end, we model an optimization problem as a mixed-integer problem with a cost function combining the number of gateways, flow allocation, and traffic latency, allowing satellite operators to set priorities based on their policies. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed approach effectively reduces the number of active gateways by selecting their most appropriate locations while balancing the trade-off between the number of gateways and traffic latency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of different weights in the cost function on performance through comparative analysis. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a hybrid beamforming architecture for near-field reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) harnessed in cell-free networks. Specifically, the holographic beamformer of each base station (BS) is designed for maximizing the channel gain based on the local channel state information (CSI). By contrast, the digital beamformer at the central processing unit is designed based on the minimum mean squared error criterion. Furthermore, the near-field spectral efficiency of the RHS in cell-free networks is derived theoretically by harnessing the popular stochastic geometry approach. We consider both the phase shift error (PSE) at the RHS elements and the hardware impairment (HWI) at the radio frequency (RF) chains of the transceivers. Furthermore, we theoretically derive the asymptotic capacity bound, when considering an infinite physical size for the RHS in the near-field channel model. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the PSE at the RHS elements and the HWI at the RF chains of transceivers limit the spectral efficiency in the high signal-to-noise ratio region. Moreover, we show that the PSE at the RHS elements and the HWI at the RF chains of BSs can be compensated by increasing the number of BSs. Finally, we also demonstrate that the ergodic spectral efficiency based on the near-field channel model is higher than that based on the far-field channel model assumption. ",

    "abstract": "An accurate detection and tracking of devices such as guiding catheters in live X-ray image acquisitions is an essential prerequisite for endovascular cardiac interventions. This information is leveraged for procedural guidance, e.g., directing stent placements. To ensure procedural safety and efficacy, there is a need for high robustness no failures during tracking. To achieve that, one needs to efficiently tackle challenges, such as: device obscuration by contrast agent or other external devices or wires, changes in field-of-view or acquisition angle, as well as the continuous movement due to cardiac and respiratory motion. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel approach to learn spatio-temporal features from a very large data cohort of over 16 million interventional X-ray frames using self-supervision for image sequence data. Our approach is based on a masked image modeling technique that leverages frame interpolation based reconstruction to learn fine inter-frame temporal correspondences. The features encoded in the resulting model are fine-tuned downstream. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and in particular robustness compared to ultra optimized reference solutions (that use multi-stage feature fusion, multi-task and flow regularization). The experiments show that our method achieves 66.31% reduction in maximum tracking error against reference solutions (23.20% when flow regularization is used); achieving a success score of 97.95% at a 3x faster inference speed of 42 frames-per-second (on GPU). The results encourage the use of our approach in various other tasks within interventional image analytics that require effective understanding of spatio-temporal semantics. ",

In order to achieve that, we set up an agent-based model reproducing social interaction and an individual decision-making model. Our preliminary results indicate that A/B testing has a substantial influence on the qualitative dynamics of information dissemination on a social network.

    "abstract": "Software vulnerability detection is generally supported by automated static analysis tools, which have recently been reinforced by deep learning (DL) models. However, despite the superior performance of DL-based approaches over rule-based ones in research, applying DL approaches to software vulnerability detection in practice remains a challenge due to the complex structure of source code, the black-box nature of DL, and the domain knowledge required to understand and validate the black-box results for addressing tasks after detection. Conventional DL models are trained by specific projects and, hence, excel in identifying vulnerabilities in these projects but not in others. These models with poor performance in vulnerability detection would impact the downstream tasks such as location and repair. More importantly, these models do not provide explanations for developers to comprehend detection results.

By interconnecting diverse intelligent agents (e.g., autonomous vehicles and VR devices) via semantic communications, the semantic communication networks (SemComNet) supports semantic-oriented transmission, efficient spectrum utilization, and flexible networking among collaborative agents. Consequently, SemComNet stands out for enabling ever-increasing intelligent applications, such as autonomous driving and Metaverse. However, being built on a variety of cutting-edge technologies including AI and knowledge graphs, SemComNet introduces diverse brand-new and unexpected threats, which pose obstacles to its widespread development. Besides, due to the intrinsic characteristics of SemComNet in terms of heterogeneous components, autonomous intelligence, and large-scale structure, a series of critical challenges emerge in securing SemComNet. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of SemComNet from its fundamentals, security, and privacy aspects. Specifically, we first introduce a novel three-layer architecture of SemComNet for multi-agent interaction, which comprises the control layer, semantic transmission layer, and cognitive sensing layer. Then, we discuss its working modes and enabling technologies. Afterward, based on the layered architecture of SemComNet, we outline a taxonomy of security and privacy threats, while discussing state-of-the-art defense approaches. Finally, we present future research directions, clarifying the path toward building intelligent, robust, and green SemComNet. To our knowledge, this survey is the first to comprehensively cover the fundamentals of SemComNet, alongside a detailed analysis of its security and privacy issues. ",

In this paper, we introduce Lying-GCN, a new DGN inspired by opinion dynamics that can adaptively work in both the heterophilic and the homophilic setting. At each layer, each agent (node) shares its own opinions (node embeddings) with its neighbours. Instead of sharing its opinion directly as in GCN, we introduce a mechanism which allows agents to lie. Such a mechanism is adaptive, thus the agents learn how and when to lie according to the task that should be solved. We provide a characterisation of our proposal in terms of dynamical systems, by studying the spectral property of the coefficient matrix of the system. While the steady state of the system collapses to zero, we believe the lying mechanism is still usable to solve node classification tasks. We empirically prove our belief on both synthetic and real-world datasets, by showing that the lying mechanism allows to increase the performances in the heterophilic setting without harming the results in the homophilic one.

    "abstract": "As human-machine interaction continues to evolve, the capacity for environmental perception is becoming increasingly crucial. Integrating the two most common types of sensory data, images, and point clouds, can enhance detection accuracy. However, currently, no model exists that can simultaneously detect an object's position in both point clouds and images and ascertain their corresponding relationship. This information is invaluable for human-machine interactions, offering new possibilities for their enhancement. In light of this, this paper introduces an end-to-end Consistency Object Detection (COD) algorithm framework that requires only a single forward inference to simultaneously obtain an object's position in both point clouds and images and establish their correlation. Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of the object correlation between point clouds and images, this paper proposes a new evaluation metric, Consistency Precision (CP). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, an extensive set of experiments has been conducted on the KITTI and DAIR-V2X datasets. The study also explored how the proposed consistency detection method performs on images when the calibration parameters between images and point clouds are disturbed, compared to existing post-processing methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits excellent detection performance and robustness, achieving end-to-end consistency detection.

To evaluate how each agent influences the overall decision, we adopt a causal framework in order to distinguish the actual influence of agents from mere correlations within the decision-making process. Various scenarios reflecting different agent participation patterns and fusion center policies are investigated. We derive expressions to quantify the causal impact of each agent on the joint decision, which could be beneficial for anticipating and addressing atypical scenarios, such as adversarial attacks or system malfunctions.

    "abstract": "This study highlights the importance of conducting comprehensive model inspection as part of comparative performance analyses. Here, we investigate the effect of modelling choices on the feature learning characteristics of graph neural networks applied to a brain shape classification task. Specifically, we analyse the effect of using parameter-efficient, shared graph convolutional submodels compared to structure-specific, non-shared submodels. Further, we assess the effect of mesh registration as part of the data harmonisation pipeline. We find substantial differences in the feature embeddings at different layers of the models. Our results highlight that test accuracy alone is insufficient to identify important model characteristics such as encoded biases related to data source or potentially non-discriminative features learned in submodels. Our model inspection framework offers a valuable tool for practitioners to better understand performance characteristics of deep learning models in medical imaging. ",

    "abstract": "Non-autoregressive (NAR) language models are known for their low latency in neural machine translation (NMT). However, a performance gap exists between NAR and autoregressive models due to the large decoding space and difficulty in capturing dependency between target words accurately. Compounding this, preparing appropriate training data for NAR models is a non-trivial task, often exacerbating exposure bias. To address these challenges, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to Levenshtein Transformer, a representative edit-based NAR model, demonstrating that RL with self-generated data can enhance the performance of edit-based NAR models. We explore two RL approaches: stepwise reward maximization and episodic reward maximization. We discuss the respective pros and cons of these two approaches and empirically verify them. Moreover, we experimentally investigate the impact of temperature setting on performance, confirming the importance of proper temperature setting for NAR models' training. ",

Recent studies focus on exploring their capabilities for data annotation. This paper provides a comparative overview of twelve studies investigating the potential of LLMs in labelling data. While the models demonstrate promising cost and time-saving benefits, there exist considerable limitations, such as representativeness, bias, sensitivity to prompt variations and English language preference. Leveraging insights from these studies, our empirical analysis further examines the alignment between human and GPT-generated opinion distributions across four subjective datasets. In contrast to the studies examining representation, our methodology directly obtains the opinion distribution from GPT. Our analysis thereby supports the minority of studies that are considering diverse perspectives when evaluating data annotation tasks and highlights the need for further research in this direction.

    "abstract": "Programming recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) to robustly perform multi-timescale computation remains a difficult challenge. To address this, we show how the distributed approach offered by vector symbolic architectures (VSAs), which uses high-dimensional random vectors as the smallest units of representation, can be leveraged to embed robust multi-timescale dynamics into attractor-based RSNNs. We embed finite state machines into the RSNN dynamics by superimposing a symmetric autoassociative weight matrix and asymmetric transition terms. The transition terms are formed by the VSA binding of an input and heteroassociative outer-products between states. Our approach is validated through simulations with highly non-ideal weights; an experimental closed-loop memristive hardware setup; and on Loihi 2, where it scales seamlessly to large state machines. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of VSA representations for embedding robust computation with recurrent dynamics into neuromorphic hardware, without requiring parameter fine-tuning or significant platform-specific optimisation. This advances VSAs as a high-level representation-invariant abstract language for cognitive algorithms in neuromorphic hardware. ",

    "abstract": "Pedestrian detection has significantly progressed in recent years, thanks to the development of DNNs. However, detection performance at occluded scenes is still far from satisfactory, as occlusion increases the intra-class variance of pedestrians, hindering the model from finding an accurate classification boundary between pedestrians and background clutters. From the perspective of reducing intra-class variance, we propose to complete features for occluded regions so as to align the features of pedestrians across different occlusion patterns. An important premise for feature completion is to locate occluded regions. From our analysis, channel features of different pedestrian proposals only show high correlation values at visible parts and thus feature correlations can be used to model occlusion patterns. In order to narrow down the gap between completed features and real fully visible ones, we propose an adversarial learning method, which completes occluded features with a generator such that they can hardly be distinguished by the discriminator from real fully visible features. We report experimental results on the CityPersons, Caltech and CrowdHuman datasets. On CityPersons, we show significant improvements over five different baseline detectors, especially on the heavy occlusion subset. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method FeatComp++ achieves state-of-the-art results on all the above three datasets without relying on extra cues. ",

    "abstract": "We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

Security and safety of future vehicles highly depend on a holistic protection of automotive components, of which the time-sensitive backbone network takes a significant role.

Still a thorough evaluation of anomaly detection methods in the context of hard real-time operations, automotive protocol stacks, and domain specific attack vectors is missing along with appropriate input datasets. In this paper, we present an assessment framework that allows for reproducible, comparable, and rapid evaluation of detection algorithms. It is based on a simulation toolchain, which contributes configurable topologies, traffic streams, anomalies, attacks, and detectors. We demonstrate the assessment of NADSs in a comprehensive in-vehicular network with its communication flows, on which we model traffic anomalies. We evaluate exemplary detection mechanisms and reveal how the detection performance is influenced by different combinations of TSN traffic flows and anomaly types.

The discrepancy between the focus of current defenses and the space of attacks of interest calls to question the practicality of existing defenses and the reliability of their evaluation. In this position paper, we argue that the research community should look beyond single attack robustness, and we draw attention to three potential directions involving robustness against multiple attacks: simultaneous multiattack robustness, unforeseen attack robustness, and a newly defined problem setting which we call continual adaptive robustness. We provide a unified framework which rigorously defines these problem settings, synthesize existing research in these fields, and outline open directions. We hope that our position paper inspires more research in simultaneous multiattack, unforeseen attack, and continual adaptive robustness. ",

However, mainstream GCL methods often favor randomly disrupting graphs for augmentation, which shows limited generalization and inevitably leads to the corruption of high-level graph information, i.e., the graph community. Moreover, current knowledge-based graph augmentation methods can only focus on either topology or node features, causing the model to lack robustness against various types of noise. To address these limitations, this research investigated the role of the graph community in graph augmentation and figured out its crucial advantage for learnable graph augmentation. Based on our observations, we propose a community-invariant GCL framework to maintain graph community structure during learnable graph augmentation. By maximizing the spectral changes, this framework unifies the constraints of both topology and feature augmentation, enhancing the model's robustness. Empirical evidence on 21 benchmark datasets demonstrates the exclusive merits of our framework. Code is released on Github (https://github.com/ShiyinTan/CI-GCL.git). ",

However, the intensive data exchange underlying their proliferation has increased concerns about interdependent privacy (IDP). This paper provides a comprehensive investigation into the previously underinvestigated IDP issues of third-party apps. Specifically, first, we analyze the permission structure of multiple app platforms, identifying permissions that have the potential to cause interdependent privacy issues by enabling a user to share someone else's personal data with an app. Second, we collect datasets and characterize the extent to which existing apps request these permissions, revealing the relationship between characteristics such as the respective app platform, the app's type, and the number of interdependent privacy-related permissions it requests. Third, we analyze the various reasons IDP is neglected by both data protection regulations and app platforms and then devise principles that should be followed when designing a mitigation solution. Finally, based on these principles and satisfying clearly defined objectives, we propose IDPFilter, a platform-agnostic API that enables application providers to minimize collateral information collection by filtering out data collected from their users but implicating others as data subjects. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype, IDPTextFilter, that implements the filtering logic on textual data, and provide its initial performance evaluation with regard to privacy, accuracy, and efficiency.

Recent graph libraries target efficient concurrent read and write support while guaranteeing transactional consistency. However, their performance suffers for updates with strong temporal locality over the same vertexes and edges due to vertex-centric lock contentions. GTX introduces a new delta-chain-centric concurrency-control protocol that eliminates traditional mutually exclusive latches. GTX resolves the conflicts caused by vertex-level locking, and adapts to real-life workloads while maintaining sequential access to the graph's adjacency lists storage. This combination of features has been demonstrated to provide good performance in graph analytical queries. GTX's transactions support fast group commit, novel write-write conflict prevention, and lazy garbage collection. Based on extensive experimental and comparative studies, in addition to maintaining competitive concurrent read and analytical performance, GTX demonstrates high throughput over state-of-the-art techniques when handling concurrent transaction+analytics workloads. For write-heavy transactional workloads, GTX performs up to 11x better than the best-performing state-of-the-art systems in transaction throughput. At the same time, GTX does not sacrifice the performance of read-heavy analytical workloads, and has competitive performance similar to state-of-the-art systems. ",

The widely-adopted TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio)-based communication for mission critical services faces challenges including limited data capacity, coverage limitations, spectrum congestion, and security concerns. Therefore, as an alternative, mission critical communication over cellular networks (4G and 5G) has emerged. While cellular-based MCC enables features like real-time video streaming and high-speed data transmission, the involvement of network operators and application service providers in the MCC architecture raises privacy concerns for mission critical users and services. For instance, the disclosure of a policeman's location details to the network operator raises privacy concerns. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work considers the privacy issues in mission critical system with respect to 5G and upcoming technologies. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse the 3GPP standardised MCC architecture within the context of 5G core network concepts and assess the privacy implications for MC users, network entities, and MC servers. The privacy analysis adheres to the deployment strategies in the standard for MCC. Additionally, we explore emerging 6G technologies, such as off-network communications, joint communication and sensing, and non-3GPP communications, to identify privacy challenges in MCC architecture. Finally, we propose privacy controls to establish a next-generation privacy-preserving MCC architecture. ",

However, FL faces challenges in terms of communication cost and data heterogeneity. One-shot federated learning has emerged as a solution by reducing communication rounds, improving efficiency, and providing better security against eavesdropping attacks. Nevertheless, data heterogeneity remains a significant challenge, impacting performance. This work explores the effectiveness of diffusion models in one-shot FL, demonstrating their applicability in addressing data heterogeneity and improving FL performance. Additionally, we investigate the utility of our diffusion model approach, FedDiff, compared to other one-shot FL methods under differential privacy (DP). Furthermore, to improve generated sample quality under DP settings, we propose a pragmatic Fourier Magnitude Filtering (FMF) method, enhancing the effectiveness of generated data for global model training.

Current watermarking techniques against model extraction attacks, which rely on signal insertion in model logits or post-processing of generated text, remain largely heuristic. We propose a novel method for embedding learnable linguistic watermarks in LLMs, aimed at tracing and preventing model extraction attacks. Our approach subtly modifies the LLM's output distribution by introducing controlled noise into token frequency distributions, embedding an statistically identifiable controllable watermark.We leverage statistical hypothesis testing and information theory, particularly focusing on Kullback-Leibler Divergence, to differentiate between original and modified distributions effectively. Our watermarking method strikes a delicate well balance between robustness and output quality, maintaining low false positive/negative rates and preserving the LLM's original performance. ",

    "abstract": "As an important fundamental task of numerous real-world applications such as social network analysis and online advertising/marketing, several prior works studied influential community search, which retrieves a community with high structural cohesiveness and maximum influences on other users in social networks. However, previous works usually considered the influences of the community on arbitrary users in social networks, rather than specific groups (e.g., customer groups, or senior communities). Inspired by this, we propose a novel Reverse Influential Community Search (RICS) problem, which obtains a seed community with the maximum influence on a user-specified target community, satisfying both structural and keyword constraints. To efficiently tackle the RICS problem, we design effective pruning strategies to filter out false alarms of candidate seed communities, and propose an effective index mechanism to facilitate the community retrieval. We also formulate and tackle an RICS variant, named Relaxed Reverse Influential Community Search (R2ICS), which returns a subgraph with the relaxed structural constraints and having the maximum influence on a user-specified target community. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our RICS and R2ICS approaches on both real-world and synthetic social networks under various parameter settings.

An analysis of a vehicle characteristics can reveal inappropriate or dangerous behaviour. This detection makes it possible to sanction or notify emergency services to take early and practical actions. Vehicle detection and characterisation systems employ complex sensors such as video cameras, especially in urban environments. These sensors provide high precision and performance, although the price and computational requirements are proportional to their accuracy. These sensors offer high accuracy, but the price and computational requirements are directly proportional to their performance. This article introduces a system based on modular devices that is economical and has a low computational cost. These devices use ultrasonic sensors to detect the speed and length of vehicles. The measurement accuracy is improved through the collaboration of the device modules. The experiments were performed using multiple modules oriented to different angles. This module is coupled with another specifically designed to detect distance using previous modules speed and length data. The collaboration between different modules reduces the speed relative error ranges from 1 to 5, depending on the angle configuration used in the modules. ",

Although Transformers are popular for their long-term sequential learning ability in the BCI field, most methods combining Transformers with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fail to capture the coarse-to-fine temporal dynamics of EEG signals. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EEG-Deformer, which incorporates two main novel components into a CNN-Transformer: (1) a Hierarchical Coarse-to-Fine Transformer (HCT) block that integrates a Fine-grained Temporal Learning (FTL) branch into Transformers, effectively discerning coarse-to-fine temporal patterns; and (2) a Dense Information Purification (DIP) module, which utilizes multi-level, purified temporal information to enhance decoding accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on three representative cognitive tasks consistently verify the generalizability of our proposed EEG-Deformer, demonstrating that it either outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods or is comparable to them. Visualization results show that EEG-Deformer learns from neurophysiologically meaningful brain regions for the corresponding cognitive tasks.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) outperform Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in this regard, by leveraging the spatial relationships between EEG electrodes through adjacency matrices. The EEG_GLT-Net framework, featuring the state-of-the-art EEG_GLT adjacency matrix method, has notably enhanced EEG MI signal classification, evidenced by an average accuracy of 83.95% across 20 subjects on the PhysioNet dataset. This significantly exceeds the 76.10% accuracy rate achieved using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) method within the same framework. In this research, we advance the field by applying a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to the classification of EEG MI signals. Our innovative method empowers the RL agent, enabling not only the classification of EEG MI data points with higher accuracy, but effective identification of EEG MI data points that are less distinct. We present the EEG_RL-Net, an enhancement of the EEG_GLT-Net framework, which incorporates the trained EEG GCN Block from EEG_GLT-Net at an adjacency matrix density of 13.39% alongside the RL-centric Dueling Deep Q Network (Dueling DQN) block.

The FL approach allowed collaborative model training without sharing raw data between hospitals while building robust ECG classification models for diagnosing various cardiac conditions.

Our results show that the performance achieved using our implementation of the FL approach is comparable to that of the pooled approach, where the model is trained over the aggregating data from all hospitals. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hospitals with limited ECGs for training can benefit from adopting the FL model compared to single-site training.

This process involves optimising a derived objective function from a defined objective. The objectives are often based on proxy health indicators to determine the filter's parameters. However, these indicators can be compromised by irrelevant extraneous signal components and fluctuating operational conditions, affecting the filter's efficacy. Fault detection primarily uses the fault component's prominence in the squared envelope spectrum, quantified by a squared envelope spectrum-based signal-to-noise ratio. New optimal filter objective functions are derived from the proposed generalised envelope spectrum-based signal-to-noise objective for machines operating under variable speed conditions. Instead of optimising proxy health indicators, the optimal filter coefficients of the formulation directly maximise the squared envelope spectrum-based signal-to-noise ratio over targeted frequency bands using standard gradient-based optimisers. Four derived objective functions from the proposed objective effectively outperform five prominent methods in tests on three experimental datasets. ",

Different from the publicly available AMC dataset ignoring the signal detection step and containing only one signal, our synthetic dataset covers the more realistic multiple-signal coexisting scenario. Then, we present a joint framework for detection and classification (JDM) for such a multiple-signal coexisting environment, which consists of two modules for signal detection and AMC, respectively. In particular, these two modules are interconnected using a designated data structure called \"proposal\".

In this paper we highlight issues that the community should take into account if using CKA as an alignment metric with neural data. Neural data are in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, which is one of the cases where (biased) CKA results in high similarity scores even for pairs of random matrices. Using fMRI and MEG data from the THINGS project, we show that if biased CKA is applied to representations of different sizes in the low-data high-dimensionality domain, they are not directly comparable due to biased CKA's sensitivity to differing feature-sample ratios and not stimuli-driven responses. This situation can arise both when comparing a pre-selected area of interest (e.g. ROI) to multiple ANN layers, as well as when determining to which ANN layer multiple regions of interest (ROIs) / sensor groups of different dimensionality are most similar. We show that biased CKA can be artificially driven to its maximum value when using independent random data of different sample-feature ratios. We further show that shuffling sample-feature pairs of real neural data does not drastically alter biased CKA similarity in comparison to unshuffled data, indicating an undesirable lack of sensitivity to stimuli-driven neural responses. Positive alignment of true stimuli-driven responses is only achieved by using debiased CKA. Lastly, we report findings that suggest biased CKA is sensitive to the inherent structure of neural data, only differing from shuffled data when debiased CKA detects stimuli-driven alignment. ",

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem associated with the task of network reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner that prevents overfitting, and produces an inferred network with a statistically justifiable number of edges. The status quo in this context is based on $L_{1}$ regularization combined with cross-validation. As we demonstrate, besides its high computational cost, this commonplace approach unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity with weight \"shrinkage\". This combination forces a trade-off between the bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which often results in substantial overfitting even after cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach follows the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our approach substantially faster to employ, as it requires a single fit to the complete data. As a result, we have a principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used with a large variety of generative models, without requiring the number of edges to be known in advance. We also demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial communities from large-scale abundance samples involving in the order of $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ species, and demonstrate how the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of interventions in the system.

Through the theoretical analysis, we discuss that the algorithm finds desired solutions to the optimization problem with the population risk, while the guarantee for the empirical risk depends on the hardness of the denoising task in terms of denaturation levels. We also conduct several experiments to investigate the performance of an extended algorithm in practice. The results indicate that the algorithm training with denatured images works, and the empirical performance aligns with the theoretical results.

Here we explore the potential for shaded walking, using building footprints and street networks from both synthetic and real cities. We introduce a route choice model with a sun avoidance parameter $\\alpha$ and define the CoolWalkability metric to measure opportunities for walking in shade. We derive analytically that on a regular grid with constant building heights, CoolWalkability is independent of $\\alpha$, and that the grid provides no CoolWalkability benefit for shade-seeking individuals compared to the shortest path. However, variations in street geometry and building heights create such benefits. We further uncover that the potential for shaded routing differs between grid-like and irregular street networks, forms local clusters, and is sensitive to the mapped network geometry. Our research identifies the limitations and potential of shade for cool, active travel, and is a first step towards a rigorous understanding of shade provision for sustainable mobility in cities. ",

This allows us to learn the observables minimizing the multi-step output prediction error of the Koopman subspace predictor, preventing the propagation of prediction errors. To avoid losing feasibility of our predictive control scheme due to prediction errors, we compute a terminal cost and terminal set in the Koopman space and we obtain recursive feasibility guarantees through an interpolated initial state. As a third contribution, we introduce a novel regularization cost yielding input-to-state stability guarantees with respect to the prediction error for the resulting closed-loop system.

Furthermore, FeNNol leverages the automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation features of the Jax Python library to enable fast evaluation of NNPs, shrinking the performance gap between ML potentials and standard force-fields. This is demonstrated with the popular ANI-2x model reaching simulation speeds nearly on par with the AMOEBA polarizable force-field on commodity GPUs (GPU=Graphics processing unit).
