    "abstract": "We propose to use stochastic Riemannian coordinate descent on the orthogonal group for recurrent neural network training. The algorithm rotates successively two columns of the recurrent matrix, an operation that can be efficiently implemented as a multiplication by a Givens matrix. In the case when the coordinate is selected uniformly at random at each iteration, we prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm under standard assumptions on the loss function, stepsize and minibatch noise. In addition, we numerically demonstrate that the Riemannian gradient in recurrent neural network training has an approximately sparse structure. Leveraging this observation, we propose a faster variant of the proposed algorithm that relies on the Gauss-Southwell rule. Experiments on a benchmark recurrent neural network training problem are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Energy networks should strive for reliability. How can it be assessed, measured, and improved? What are the best trade-offs between investments and their worth? The flow-based framework for the reliability assessment of energy networks proposed in this paper addresses these questions with a focus on power distribution networks. The framework introduces the concept of iflows, or interruption flows, which translate the analytical reliability evaluation into solving a series of node balance equations computable in linear time. The iflows permeate the network, providing relevant information to support linear formulations of reliability optimization problems. Numerical examples showcase the evaluation process obtained through iflows in illustrative distribution networks with distributed generation. A visual representation of the reliability state provides insights into the most critical regions of the network. A case study of the optimal allocation of switches in power distribution systems is described. Computational experiments were conducted using a benchmark of distribution networks, having up to 881 nodes. The results confirm the effectiveness of the approach in terms of providing high-quality information and optimal trade-offs to aid reliability decisions for energy networks. ",

    "abstract": "Local certification consists in assigning labels to the nodes of a network to certify that some given property is satisfied, in such a way that the labels can be checked locally. In the last few years, certification of graph classes received a considerable attention. The goal is to certify that a graph $G$ belongs to a given graph class~$\\mathcal{G}$. Such certifications with labels of size $O(\\log n)$ (where $n$ is the size of the network) exist for trees, planar graphs and graphs embedded on surfaces. Feuilloley et al. ask if this can be extended to any class of graphs defined by a finite set of forbidden minors. In this work, we develop new decomposition tools for graph certification, and apply them to show that for every small enough minor $H$, $H$-minor-free graphs can indeed be certified with labels of size $O(\\log n)$. We also show matching lower bounds with a simple new proof technique. ",

Recent insights have demonstrated that both hierarchical cascades can be compared in terms of both exerted behavior and underlying activation. However, these approaches ignore key differences in spatial priorities of information processing. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate a comparison of human observers (N = 45) and three feedforward DCNNs through eye tracking and saliency maps. The results reveal fundamentally different resolutions in both visualization methods that need to be considered for an insightful comparison. Moreover, we provide evidence that a DCNN with biologically plausible receptive field sizes called vNet reveals higher agreement with human viewing behavior as contrasted with a standard ResNet architecture. We find that image-specific factors such as category, animacy, arousal, and valence have a direct link to the agreement of spatial object recognition priorities in humans and DCNNs, while other measures such as difficulty and general image properties do not. With this approach, we try to open up new perspectives at the intersection of biological and computer vision research. ",

Recently, state-of-the-art methods seek to incorporate graph matching with deep learning. However, there is no research to explain what role the graph matching algorithm plays in the model. Therefore, we propose an approach integrating a MILP formulation of the graph matching problem. This formulation is solved to optimal and it provides inherent baseline. Meanwhile, similar approaches are derived by releasing the optimal guarantee of the graph matching solver and by introducing a quality level. This quality level controls the quality of the solutions provided by the graph matching solver. In addition, several relaxations of the graph matching problem are put to the test. Our experimental evaluation gives several theoretical insights and guides the direction of deep graph matching methods. ",

    "abstract": "It has become a trend to use study with me (SWM) Livestream to create a personalized study ambiance. However, we still have little understanding of the activities of SWM livestream and the streamer's motivation to produce SWM livestream. This paper provides an overview of the activities and how streamers regulate these activities of SWM livestream on a Chinese popular User Generated Content(UGC) website, Bilibili. We observed the number and popularity of the SWM livestreams and analyzed 800 livestreams to understand the streamers' study goals. We analyzed 20 SWM livestreams in detail and interviewed 12 streamers and 10 viewers to understand the activities and the streamer's motivation. We found that streamers produced SWM livestream to seek supervision, find like-minded study partners and help and company others. Streamers don't interact or instruct with the viewers directly but use chat-bot and autonomous interaction to alleviated the interaction burden. Unique sessions like checking-in and study progress reporting promote the viewers' social presence, promoting SOC, and enhancing their engagement. Strict rules and punishment are widely used to concentrate the members on study and contribute to positive atmosphere. We also found that SWM livestream often disappears when the examination is done and the streamer faces doubts on motivation and appearance. These findings suggest that SRL community can provide cognitive and socioemotional support for lonely learners to stick to a long-term study. The activities and streamer's practice inspired how streamers can focus on contemplative efforts while controlling the interaction. ",

In order to test trading strategies before deploying them to real-time trading, multi-agent market environments calibrated so that the time series that result from interaction of simulated agents resemble historical are often used. To ensure adequate testing, one must test trading strategies in a variety of market scenarios -- which includes both scenarios that represent ordinary market days as well as stressed markets (most recently observed due to the beginning of COVID pandemic). In this paper, we address the problem of multi-agent simulator parameter calibration to allow simulator capture characteristics of different market regimes. We propose a novel two-step method to train a discriminator that is able to distinguish between \"real\" and \"fake\" price and volume time series as a part of GAN with self-attention, and then utilize it within an optimization framework to tune parameters of a simulator model with known agent archetypes to represent a market scenario.

To investigate the effects of depth and input dimension of proposed model, careful validations are performed by extensive numerical simulation. The results give an optimal depth (19) and recommend a limited input dimension (under 200). Furthermore, compared with the baseline models including support vector regression, decision tree regression, and residual regression, our proposed model with the optimal depth performs best. Ultimately, DenseNet regression is applied to predict relative humidity, and the outcome shows a high correlation (0.91) with observations, which indicates that our model could advance environmental data analysis.

The information passed to the failed node from the helpers traverses several vertices of the graph, and savings in communication complexity can be attained if the intermediate vertices process the information rather than simply relaying it toward the failed node. We derive simple information-theoretic bounds on the amount of information communicated between the nodes in the course of the repair. Next we show that Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes can be modified to perform the intermediate processing, thereby attaining the lower bound on the information exchange on the graph. We also consider node repair when the underlying graph is random, deriving conditions on the parameters that support recovery of the failed node with communication complexity smaller than required by the simple relaying.

    "abstract": "A connected partition is a partition of the vertices of a graph into sets that induce connected subgraphs. Such partitions naturally occur in many application areas such as road networks, and image processing. We consider Balanced Connected Partitions (BCP), where the two classical objectives for BCP are to maximize the weight of the smallest, or minimize the weight of the largest component. We study BCP on c-claw-free graphs, the class of graphs that do not have $K_{1,c}$ as an induced subgraph, and present efficient (c-1)-approximation algorithms for both objectives. In particular, due to the (3-)claw-freeness of line graphs, this also implies a 2-approximations for the edge-partition version of BCP in general graphs. In the 1970s Gy\\H{o}ri and Lov\\'{a}sz showed for natural numbers $w_1,\\dots,w_k$ where $\\sum_i w_i$ is the vertex size, that if $G$ is k-connected, then there exist a connected k-partition with part sizes $w_1,\\dots,w_k$. However, to this day no polynomial algorithm to compute such partitions exists for k>4. Towards finding such a partition $T_1,\\dots, T_k$, we show how to efficiently compute connected partitions that at least approximately meet the target weights, subject to the mild assumption that each $w_i$ is greater than the weight of the heaviest vertex. In particular, we give a 3-approximation for both the lower and the upper bounded version i.e. we guarantee that each $T_i$ has weight at least $\\frac{w_i}{3}$ or that each $T_i$ has weight most $3w_i$, respectively. Also, we present a both-side bounded version that produces a connected partition where each $T_i$ has size at least $\\frac{w_i}{3}$ and at most $\\max(\\{r,3\\}) w_i$, where $r \\geq 1$ is the ratio between the largest and smallest value in $w_1, \\dots, w_k$. In particular for the balanced version, i.e.~$w_1=w_2=, \\dots,=w_k$, this gives a partition with $\\frac{1}{3}w_i \\leq w(T_i) \\leq 3w_i$. ",

    "abstract": "The spread of COVID-19 and ensuing containment measures have accentuated the profound interdependence among nations or regions. This has been particularly evident in tourism, one of the sectors most affected by uncoordinated mobility restrictions. The impact of this interdependence on the tendency to adopt less or more restrictive measures is hard to evaluate, more so if diversity in economic exposures to citizens' mobility are considered. Here, we address this problem by developing an analytical and computational game-theoretical model encompassing the conflicts arising from the need to control the economic effects of global risks, such as in the COVID-19 pandemic. The model includes the individual costs derived from severe restrictions imposed by governments, including the resulting economic interdependence among all the parties involved in the game. By using tourism-based data, the model is enriched with actual heterogeneous income losses, such that every player has a different economic cost when applying restrictions. We show that economic interdependence enhances cooperation because of the decline in the expected payoffs by free-riding parties (i.e., those neglecting the application of mobility restrictions). Furthermore, we show (analytically and through numerical simulations) that these cross-exposures can transform the nature of the cooperation dilemma each region or country faces, modifying the position of the fixed points and the size of the basins of attraction that characterize this class of games. Finally, our results suggest that heterogeneity among regions may be used to leverage the impact of intervention policies by ensuring an agreement among the most relevant initial set of cooperators.
