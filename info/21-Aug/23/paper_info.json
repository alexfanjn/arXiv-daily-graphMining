    "title": "Comparing concepts of quantum and classical neural network models for  image classification task",
    "abstract": "While quantum architectures are still under development, when available, they will only be able to process quantum data when machine learning algorithms can only process numerical data. Therefore, in the issues of classification or regression, it is necessary to simulate and study quantum systems that will transfer the numerical input data to a quantum form and enable quantum computers to use the available methods of machine learning. This material includes the results of experiments on training and performance of a hybrid quantum-classical neural network developed for the problem of classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set. The comparative results of two models: classical and quantum neural networks of a similar number of training parameters, indicate that the quantum network, although its simulation is time-consuming, overcomes the classical network (it has better convergence and achieves higher training and testing accuracy).

    "abstract": "Electron microscopy is widely used to explore defects in crystal structures, but human detecting of defects is often time-consuming, error-prone, and unreliable, and is not scalable to large numbers of images or real-time analysis. In this work, we discuss the application of machine learning approaches to find the location and geometry of different defect clusters in irradiated steels. We show that a deep learning based Faster R-CNN analysis system has a performance comparable to human analysis with relatively small training data sets. This study proves the promising ability to apply deep learning to assist the development of automated microscopy data analysis even when multiple features are present and paves the way for fast, scalable, and reliable analysis systems for massive amounts of modern electron microscopy data.

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity, security monitoring of malicious events in IP traffic, is an important field largely unexplored by statisticians. Computer scientists have made significant contributions in this area using statistical anomaly detection and other supervised learning methods to detect specific malicious events. In this research, we investigate the detection of botnet command and control (C&C) hosts in massive IP traffic. We use the NetFlow data, the industry standard for monitoring of IP traffic for exploratory analysis and extracting new features. Using statistical as well as deep learning models, we develop a statistical intrusion detection system (SIDS) to predict traffic traces identified with malicious attacks. Employing interpretative machine learning techniques, botnet traffic signatures are derived. These models successfully detected botnet C&C hosts and compromised devices. The results were validated by matching predictions to existing blacklists of published malicious IP addresses. ",

    "abstract": "Large, dense, small-world networks often emerge from social phenomena, including financial networks, social media, or epidemiology. As networks grow in importance, it is often necessary to partition them into meaningful units of analysis. In this work, we propose GUDIE, a message-passing algorithm that extracts relevant context around seed nodes based on user-defined criteria. We design GUDIE for rich, labeled graphs, and expansions consider node and edge attributes. Preliminary results indicate that GUDIE expands to insightful areas while avoiding unimportant connections. The resulting subgraphs contain the relevant context for a seed node and can accelerate and extend analysis capabilities in finance and other critical networks. ",

    "abstract": "Urban rail transit (URT) system plays a dominating role in many megacities like Beijing and Hong Kong. Due to its important role and complex nature, it is always in great need for public agencies to better understand the performance of the URT system. This paper focuses on an essential and hard problem to estimate the network-wide link travel time and station waiting time using the automatic fare collection (AFC) data in the URT system, which is beneficial to better understand the system-wide real-time operation state. The emerging data-driven techniques, such as computational graph (CG) models in the machine learning field, provide a new solution for solving this problem. In this study, we first formulate a data-driven estimation optimization framework to estimate the link travel time and station waiting time. Then, we cast the estimation optimization model into a CG framework to solve the optimization problem and obtain the estimation results. The methodology is verified on a synthetic URT network and applied to a real-world URT network using the synthetic and real-world AFC data, respectively. Results show the robustness and effectiveness of the CG-based framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the CG is applied to the URT. This study can provide critical insights to better understand the operational state in URT. ",
