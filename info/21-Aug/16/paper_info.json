    "title": "Deep adversarial attack on target detection systems",
    "abstract": "Target detection systems identify targets by localizing their coordinates on the input image of interest. This is ideally achieved by labeling each pixel in an image as a background or a potential target pixel. Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) classifiers have proven to be successful tools for computer vision applications. However,prior research confirms that even state of the art classifier models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show how to generate adversarial infrared images by adding small perturbations to the targets region to deceive a DCNN-based target detector at remarkable levels. We demonstrate significant progress in developing visually imperceptible adversarial infrared images where the targets are visually recognizable by an expert but a DCNN-based target detector cannot detect the targets in the image.

    "title": "Non-imaging real-time detection and tracking of fast-moving objects",
    "abstract": "Real-time detection and tracking of fast-moving objects have achieved great success in various fields. However, many existing methods, especially low-cost ones, are difficult to achieve real-time and long-term object detection and tracking. Here, a non-imaging strategy is proposed, including two stages, to realize fast-moving object detection and tracking in real-time and for the long term: 1) a contour-moments-based method is proposed to optimize the Hadamard pattern sequence. And then reconstructing projection curves of the object based on single-pixel imaging technology. The projection curve, which including the object location information, is reconstructed directly with the measurements collected by a single-pixel detector; 2) The fastest changing position in the projection curve can be obtained by solving first-order gradients. A gradient differential is used in two first-order gradients to calculate a differential curve with the sudden change positions. Finally, we can obtain the boundary information of the fast-moving object. We experimentally demonstrate that our approach can achieve a temporal resolution of 105 frames per second at a 1.28% sampling rate by using a 22,000 Hz digital micro-mirror device. The detection and tracking algorithm of the proposed strategy is computationally efficient. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our approach can make the sampling rate lower. Additionally, the strategy acquires not more than 1MB of data for each frame, which is capable of fast-moving object real-time and long-term detection and tracking. ",

    "abstract": "Light-fidelity (LiFi) is an emerging technology for high-speed short-range mobile communications. Inter-cell interference (ICI) is an important issue that limits the system performance in an optical attocell network. Angle diversity receivers (ADRs) have been proposed to mitigate ICI. In this paper, the structure of pyramid receivers (PRs) and truncated pyramid receivers (TPRs) are studied. The coverage problems of PRs and TPRs are defined and investigated, and the lower bound of field of view (FOV) for each PD is given analytically. The impact of random device orientation and diffuse link signal propagation are taken into consideration. The performances of PRs and TPRs are compared and then optimized ADR structures are proposed. The performance comparison between the select best combining (SBC) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) is given under different noise levels. It is shown that SBC will outperform MRC in an interference limited system, otherwise, MRC is a preferred scheme. In addition, the double source system, where each LiFi AP consists of two sources transmitting the same information signals but with opposite polarity, is proved to outperform the single source (SS) system under certain conditions.

    "abstract": "The growing number of AI applications, also for high-stake decisions, increases the interest in Explainable and Interpretable Machine Learning (XI-ML). This trend can be seen both in the increasing number of regulations and strategies for developing trustworthy AI and the growing number of scientific papers dedicated to this topic. To ensure the sustainable development of AI, it is essential to understand the dynamics of the impact of regulation on research papers as well as the impact of scientific discourse on AI-related policies. This paper introduces a novel framework for joint analysis of AI-related policy documents and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) research papers. The collected documents are enriched with metadata and interconnections, using various NLP methods combined with a methodology inspired by Institutional Grammar. Based on the information extracted from collected documents, we showcase a series of analyses that help understand interactions, similarities, and differences between documents at different stages of institutionalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use automatic language analysis tools to understand the dynamics between XI-ML methods and regulations. We believe that such a system contributes to better cooperation between XAI researchers and AI policymakers. ",

    "title": "Graph2MDA: a multi-modal variational graph embedding model for  predicting microbe-drug associations",
    "abstract": "Accumulated clinical studies show that microbes living in humans interact closely with human hosts, and get involved in modulating drug efficacy and drug toxicity. Microbes have become novel targets for the development of antibacterial agents. Therefore, screening of microbe-drug associations can benefit greatly drug research and development. With the increase of microbial genomic and pharmacological datasets, we are greatly motivated to develop an effective computational method to identify new microbe-drug associations. In this paper, we proposed a novel method, Graph2MDA, to predict microbe-drug associations by using variational graph autoencoder (VGAE). We constructed multi-modal attributed graphs based on multiple features of microbes and drugs, such as molecular structures, microbe genetic sequences, and function annotations. Taking as input the multi-modal attribute graphs, VGAE was trained to learn the informative and interpretable latent representations of each node and the whole graph, and then a deep neural network classifier was used to predict microbe-drug associations. The hyperparameter analysis and model ablation studies showed the sensitivity and robustness of our model. We evaluated our method on three independent datasets and the experimental results showed that our proposed method outperformed six existing state-of-the-art methods. We also explored the meaningness of the learned latent representations of drugs and found that the drugs show obvious clustering patterns that are significantly consistent with drug ATC classification. Moreover, we conducted case studies on two microbes and two drugs and found 75\\%-95\\% predicted associations have been reported in PubMed literature. Our extensive performance evaluations validated the effectiveness of our proposed method.\\ ",
