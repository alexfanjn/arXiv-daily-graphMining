    "title": "Simulating progressive intramural damage leading to aortic dissection  using an operator-regression neural network",
    "abstract": "Aortic dissection progresses via delamination of the medial layer of the wall. Notwithstanding the complexity of this process, insight has been gleaned by studying in vitro and in silico the progression of dissection driven by quasi-static pressurization of the intramural space by fluid injection, which demonstrates that the differential propensity of dissection can be affected by spatial distributions of structurally significant interlamellar struts that connect adjacent elastic lamellae. In particular, diverse histological microstructures may lead to differential mechanical behavior during dissection, including the pressure--volume relationship of the injected fluid and the displacement field between adjacent lamellae. In this study, we develop a data-driven surrogate model for the delamination process for differential strut distributions using DeepONet, a new operator--regression neural network. The surrogate model is trained to predict the pressure--volume curve of the injected fluid and the damage progression field of the wall given a spatial distribution of struts, with in silico data generated with a phase-field finite element model. The results show that DeepONet can provide accurate predictions for diverse strut distributions, indicating that this composite branch-trunk neural network can effectively extract the underlying functional relationship between distinctive microstructures and their mechanical properties. More broadly, DeepONet can facilitate surrogate model-based analyses to quantify biological variability, improve inverse design, and predict mechanical properties based on multi-modality experimental data.

    "title": "Deep learning models are not robust against noise in clinical text",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are attracting increasing interest in the medical domain due to their ability to learn complicated tasks that require human intelligence and expert knowledge. AI systems that utilize high-performance Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of clinical text processing benchmarks. They have even outperformed human accuracy on some tasks. However, performance evaluation of such AI systems have been limited to accuracy measures on curated and clean benchmark datasets that may not properly reflect how robustly these systems can operate in real-world situations. In order to address this challenge, we introduce and implement a wide variety of perturbation methods that simulate different types of noise and variability in clinical text data. While noisy samples produced by these perturbation methods can often be understood by humans, they may cause AI systems to make erroneous decisions. Conducting extensive experiments on several clinical text processing tasks, we evaluated the robustness of high-performance NLP models against various types of character-level and word-level noise. The results revealed that the NLP models performance degrades when the input contains small amounts of noise. This study is a significant step towards exposing vulnerabilities of AI models utilized in clinical text processing systems. The proposed perturbation methods can be used in performance evaluation tests to assess how robustly clinical NLP models can operate on noisy data, in real-world settings. ",

    "title": "Motor-imagery classification model for brain-computer interface: a  sparse group filter bank representation model",
    "abstract": "Background: Common spatial pattern (CSP) has been widely used for feature extraction in the case of motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and in MI classification of brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. BCI usually requires relatively long EEG data for reliable classifier training. More specifically, before using general spatial patterns for feature extraction, a training dictionary from two different classes is used to construct a compound dictionary matrix, and the representation of the test samples in the filter band is estimated as a linear combination of the columns in the dictionary matrix. New method: To alleviate the problem of sparse small sample (SS) between frequency bands. We propose a novel sparse group filter bank model (SGFB) for motor imagery in BCI system. Results: We perform a task by representing residuals based on the categories corresponding to the non-zero correlation coefficients. Besides, we also perform joint sparse optimization with constrained filter bands in three different time windows to extract robust CSP features in a multi-task learning framework. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we conduct an experiment on the public EEG dataset of BCI competition to compare it with other competitive methods. Comparison with existing methods: Decent classification performance for different subbands confirms that our algorithm is a promising candidate for improving MI-based BCI performance. ",

    "abstract": "Blood cell detection in microscopic images is an essential branch of medical image processing research. Since disease detection based on manual checking of blood cells is time-consuming and full of errors, testing of blood cells using object detectors with Deep Convolutional Neural Network can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this work, an object detector based on YOLOF has been proposed to detect blood cell objects such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. This object detector is called TE-YOLOF, Tiny and Efficient YOLOF, and it is a One-Stage detector using dilated encoder to extract information from single-level feature maps. For increasing efficiency and flexibility, the EfficientNet Convolutional Neural Network is utilized as the backbone for the proposed object detector. Furthermore, the Depthwise Separable Convolution is applied to enhance the performance and minimize the parameters of the network. In addition, the Mish activation function is employed to increase the precision. Extensive experiments on the BCCD dataset prove the effectiveness of the proposed model, which is more efficient than other existing studies for blood cell detection. ",

    "title": "Reducing quantum annealing biases for solving the graph partitioning  problem",
    "abstract": "Quantum annealers offer an efficient way to compute high quality solutions of NP-hard problems when expressed in a QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) or an Ising form. This is done by mapping a problem onto the physical qubits and couplers of the quantum chip, from which a solution is read after a process called quantum annealing. However, this process is subject to multiple sources of biases, including poor calibration, leakage between adjacent qubits, control biases, etc., which might negatively influence the quality of the annealing results. In this work, we aim at mitigating the effect of such biases for solving constrained optimization problems, by offering a two-step method, and apply it to Graph Partitioning. In the first step, we measure and reduce any biases that result from implementing the constraints of the problem. In the second, we add the objective function to the resulting bias-corrected implementation of the constraints, and send the problem to the quantum annealer. We apply this concept to Graph Partitioning, an important NP-hard problem, which asks to find a partition of the vertices of a graph that is balanced (the constraint) and minimizes the cut size (the objective). We first quantify the bias of the implementation of the constraint on the quantum annealer, that is, we require, in an unbiased implementation, that any two vertices have the same likelihood of being assigned to the same or to different parts of the partition. We then propose an iterative method to correct any such biases. We demonstrate that, after adding the objective, solving the resulting bias-corrected Ising problem on the quantum annealer results in a higher solution accuracy. ",
