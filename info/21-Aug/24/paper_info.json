    "abstract": "Edge offloading for deep neural networks (DNNs) can be adaptive to the input's complexity by using early-exit DNNs. These DNNs have side branches throughout their architecture, allowing the inference to end earlier in the edge. The branches estimate the accuracy for a given input. If this estimated accuracy reaches a threshold, the inference ends on the edge. Otherwise, the edge offloads the inference to the cloud to process the remaining DNN layers. However, DNNs for image classification deals with distorted images, which negatively impact the branches' estimated accuracy. Consequently, the edge offloads more inferences to the cloud. This work introduces expert side branches trained on a particular distortion type to improve robustness against image distortion. The edge detects the distortion type and selects appropriate expert branches to perform the inference. This approach increases the estimated accuracy on the edge, improving the offloading decisions. We validate our proposal in a realistic scenario, in which the edge offloads DNN inference to Amazon EC2 instances. ",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is profoundly heterogeneous in regional microstructure and vasculature. Characterizing the spatial heterogeneity of glioblastoma could lead to more precise treatment. With unsupervised learning techniques, glioblastoma MRI-derived radiomic features have been widely utilized for tumor sub-region segmentation and survival prediction. However, the reliability of algorithm outcomes is often challenged by both ambiguous intermediate process and instability introduced by the randomness of clustering algorithms, especially for data from heterogeneous patients. In this paper, we propose an adaptive unsupervised learning approach for efficient MRI intra-tumor partitioning and glioblastoma survival prediction. A novel and problem-specific Feature-enhanced Auto-Encoder (FAE) is developed to enhance the representation of pairwise clinical modalities and therefore improve clustering stability of unsupervised learning algorithms such as K-means. Moreover, the entire process is modelled by the Bayesian optimization (BO) technique with a custom loss function that the hyper-parameters can be adaptively optimized in a reasonably few steps. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can produce robust and clinically relevant MRI sub-regions and statistically significant survival predictions. ",

    "abstract": "Activation functions play a pivotal role in determining the training dynamics and neural network performance. The widely adopted activation function ReLU despite being simple and effective has few disadvantages including the Dying ReLU problem. In order to tackle such problems, we propose a novel activation function called Serf which is self-regularized and nonmonotonic in nature. Like Mish, Serf also belongs to the Swish family of functions. Based on several experiments on computer vision (image classification and object detection) and natural language processing (machine translation, sentiment classification and multimodal entailment) tasks with different state-of-the-art architectures, it is observed that Serf vastly outperforms ReLU (baseline) and other activation functions including both Swish and Mish, with a markedly bigger margin on deeper architectures. Ablation studies further demonstrate that Serf based architectures perform better than those of Swish and Mish in varying scenarios, validating the effectiveness and compatibility of Serf with varying depth, complexity, optimizers, learning rates, batch sizes, initializers and dropout rates. Finally, we investigate the mathematical relation between Swish and Serf, thereby showing the impact of preconditioner function ingrained in the first derivative of Serf which provides a regularization effect making gradients smoother and optimization faster.

Takagi-Sugeno (TS) Fuzzy models are systems-based approaches and a popular modeling choice for hydrologists in recent decades due to several advantages and improved accuracy in prediction over other existing models. In this paper, we propose a new rainfall-runoff model developed using Gustafson-Kessel (GK) clustering-based TS Fuzzy model. We present comparative performance measures of GK algorithms with two other clustering algorithms: (i) Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), and (ii)Subtractive Clustering (SC). Our proposed TS Fuzzy model predicts surface runoff using: (i) observed rainfall in a drainage basin and (ii) previously observed precipitation flow in the basin outlet. The proposed model is validated using the rainfall-runoff data collected from the sensors installed on the campus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. The optimal number of rules of the proposed model is obtained by different validation indices. A comparative study of four performance criteria: RootMean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Efficiency (CE), Volumetric Error (VE), and Correlation Coefficient of Determination(R) have been quantitatively demonstrated for each clustering algorithm.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks often make decisions based on the spurious correlations inherent in the dataset, failing to generalize in an unbiased data distribution. Although previous approaches pre-define the type of dataset bias to prevent the network from learning it, recognizing the bias type in the real dataset is often prohibitive. This paper proposes a novel bias-tailored augmentation-based approach, BiaSwap, for learning debiased representation without requiring supervision on the bias type. Assuming that the bias corresponds to the easy-to-learn attributes, we sort the training images based on how much a biased classifier can exploits them as shortcut and divide them into bias-guiding and bias-contrary samples in an unsupervised manner. Afterwards, we integrate the style-transferring module of the image translation model with the class activation maps of such biased classifier, which enables to primarily transfer the bias attributes learned by the classifier. Therefore, given the pair of bias-guiding and bias-contrary, BiaSwap generates the bias-swapped image which contains the bias attributes from the bias-contrary images, while preserving bias-irrelevant ones in the bias-guiding images. Given such augmented images, BiaSwap demonstrates the superiority in debiasing against the existing baselines over both synthetic and real-world datasets. Even without careful supervision on the bias, BiaSwap achieves a remarkable performance on both unbiased and bias-guiding samples, implying the improved generalization capability of the model. ",

To tackle this problem, we compared the performance of three well-known deep learning approaches for object detection on the AGAR dataset, namely two-stage, one-stage and transformer based neural networks.

We propose herein Greenshield's traffic model-based fog computing scheme called Fog-based Rogue Nodes Detection (F-RouND), which dynamically utilizes the On-Board Units (OBUs) of all vehicles in the region for rogue node detection. We aim to reduce the data processing delays and FPR in detecting rogue nodes at high vehicle densities. The performance of the F-RouND framework was evaluated via simulations. Results show that the F-RouND framework ensures 45% lower processing delays, 12% lower overhead, and 36% lower FPR at the urban scenario compared to the existing rogue node detection schemes even when the number of rogue nodes increases by up to 40% in the region.

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents unique and unknown problem complexities and modeling challenges, where an imperative task is to model both its process and data uncertainties, represented in implicit and high-proportional undocumented infections, asymptomatic contagion, social reinforcement of infections, and various quality issues in the reported data. These uncertainties become even more phenomenal in the overwhelming mutation-dominated resurgences with vaccinated but still susceptible populations. Here we introduce a novel hybrid approach to (1) characterizing and distinguishing Undocumented (U) and Documented (D) infections commonly seen during COVID-19 incubation periods and asymptomatic infections by expanding the foundational compartmental epidemic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with two compartments, resulting in a new Susceptible-Undocumented infected-Documented infected-Recovered (SUDR) model; (2) characterizing the probabilistic density of infections by empowering SUDR to capture exogenous processes like clustering contagion interactions, superspreading and social reinforcement; and (3) approximating the density likelihood of COVID-19 prevalence over time by incorporating Bayesian inference into SUDR. Different from existing COVID-19 models, SUDR characterizes the undocumented infections during unknown transmission processes. To capture the uncertainties of temporal transmission and social reinforcement during the COVID-19 contagion, the transmission rate is modeled by a time-varying density function of undocumented infectious cases. We solve the modeling by sampling from the mean-field posterior distribution with reasonable priors, making SUDR suitable to handle the randomness, noise and sparsity of COVID-19 observations widely seen in the public COVID-19 case data.
