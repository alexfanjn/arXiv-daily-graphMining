    "title": "Testing for directed information graphs",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a hypothesis test to determine the underlying directed graph structure of nodes in a network, where the nodes represent random processes and the direction of the links indicate a causal relationship between said processes. Specifically, a k-th order Markov structure is considered for them, and the chosen metric to determine a connection between nodes is the directed information. The hypothesis test is based on the empirically calculated transition probabilities which are used to estimate the directed information. For a single edge, it is proven that the detection probability can be chosen arbitrarily close to one, while the false alarm probability remains negligible. When the test is performed on the whole graph, we derive bounds for the false alarm and detection probabilities, which show that the test is asymptotically optimal by properly setting the threshold test and using a large number of samples. Furthermore, we study how the convergence of the measures relies on the existence of links in the true graph. ",

    "title": "Deep few-shot learning for bi-temporal building change detection",
    "abstract": "In real-world applications (e.g., change detection), annotating images is very expensive. To build effective deep learning models in these applications, deep few-shot learning methods have been developed and prove to be a robust approach in small training data. The analysis of building change detection from high spatial resolution remote sensing observations is important research in photogrammetry, computer vision, and remote sensing nowadays, which can be widely used in a variety of real-world applications, such as map updating. As manual high resolution image interpretation is expensive and time-consuming, building change detection methods are of high interest. The interest in developing building change detection approaches from optical remote sensing images is rapidly increasing due to larger coverages, and lower costs of optical images. In this study, we focus on building change detection analysis on a small set of building change from different regions that sit in several cities. In this paper, a new deep few-shot learning method is proposed for building change detection using Monte Carlo dropout and remote sensing observations. The setup is based on a small dataset, including bitemporal optical images labeled for building change detection. ",

    "title": "What do pre-trained code models know about code?",
    "abstract": "Pre-trained models of code built on the transformer architecture have performed well on software engineering (SE) tasks such as predictive code generation, code summarization, among others. However, whether the vector representations from these pre-trained models comprehensively encode characteristics of source code well enough to be applicable to a broad spectrum of downstream tasks remains an open question. One way to investigate this is with diagnostic tasks called probes. In this paper, we construct four probing tasks (probing for surface-level, syntactic, structural, and semantic information) for pre-trained code models. We show how probes can be used to identify whether models are deficient in (understanding) certain code properties, characterize different model layers, and get insight into the model sample-efficiency. We probe four models that vary in their expected knowledge of code properties: BERT (pre-trained on English), CodeBERT and CodeBERTa (pre-trained on source code, and natural language documentation), and GraphCodeBERT (pre-trained on source code with dataflow). While GraphCodeBERT performs more consistently overall, we find that BERT performs surprisingly well on some code tasks, which calls for further investigation. ",

    "title": "Using machine learning for quantum annealing accuracy prediction",
    "abstract": "Quantum annealers, such as the device built by D-Wave Systems, Inc., offer a way to compute solutions of NP-hard problems that can be expressed in Ising or QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization) form. Although such solutions are typically of very high quality, problem instances are usually not solved to optimality due to imperfections of the current generations quantum annealers. In this contribution, we aim to understand some of the factors contributing to the hardness of a problem instance, and to use machine learning models to predict the accuracy of the D-Wave 2000Q annealer for solving specific problems. We focus on the Maximum Clique problem, a classic NP-hard problem with important applications in network analysis, bioinformatics, and computational chemistry. By training a machine learning classification model on basic problem characteristics such as the number of edges in the graph, or annealing parameters such as D-Wave's chain strength, we are able to rank certain features in the order of their contribution to the solution hardness, and present a simple decision tree which allows to predict whether a problem will be solvable to optimality with the D-Wave 2000Q. We extend these results by training a machine learning regression model that predicts the clique size found by D-Wave. ",

    "title": "Temporal envelope and fine structure cues for dysarthric speech  detection using CNNs",
    "abstract": "Deep learning-based techniques for automatic dysarthric speech detection have recently attracted interest in the research community. State-of-the-art techniques typically learn neurotypical and dysarthric discriminative representations by processing time-frequency input representations such as the magnitude spectrum of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Although these techniques are expected to leverage perceptual dysarthric cues, representations such as the magnitude spectrum of the STFT do not necessarily convey perceptual aspects of complex sounds. Inspired by the temporal processing mechanisms of the human auditory system, in this paper we factor signals into the product of a slowly varying envelope and a rapidly varying fine structure. Separately exploiting the different perceptual cues present in the envelope (i.e., phonetic information, stress, and voicing) and fine structure (i.e., pitch, vowel quality, and breathiness), two discriminative representations are learned through a convolutional neural network and used for automatic dysarthric speech detection. Experimental results show that processing both the envelope and fine structure representations yields a considerably better dysarthric speech detection performance than processing only the envelope, fine structure, or magnitude spectrum of the STFT representation.
