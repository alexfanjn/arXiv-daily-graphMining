    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) show great advantages in solving partial differential equations. In this paper, we for the first time propose to study conformable time fractional diffusion equations by using PINNs. By solving the supervise learning task, we design a new spatio-temporal function approximator with high data efficiency. L-BFGS algorithm is used to optimize our loss function, and back propagation algorithm is used to update our parameters to give our numerical solutions. For the forward problem, we can take IC/BCs as the data, and use PINN to solve the corresponding partial differential equation. Three numerical examples are are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. In particular, when the order of the conformable fractional derivative $\\alpha$ tends to $1$, a class of weighted PINNs is introduced to overcome the accuracy degradation caused by the singularity of solutions. For the inverse problem, we use the data obtained to train the neural network, and the estimation of parameter $\\lambda$ in the equation is elaborated. Similarly, we give three numerical examples to show that our method can accurately identify the parameters, even if the training data is corrupted with 1\\% uncorrelated noise. ",

    "abstract": "With the development of Generative Adversarial Network, image-based virtual try-on methods have made great progress. However, limited work has explored the task of video-based virtual try-on while it is important in real-world applications. Most existing video-based virtual try-on methods usually require clothing templates and they can only generate blurred and low-resolution results. To address these challenges, we propose a Memory-based Video virtual Try-On Network (MV-TON), which seamlessly transfers desired clothes to a target person without using any clothing templates and generates high-resolution realistic videos. Specifically, MV-TON consists of two modules: 1) a try-on module that transfers the desired clothes from model images to frame images by pose alignment and region-wise replacing of pixels; 2) a memory refinement module that learns to embed the existing generated frames into the latent space as external memory for the following frame generation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method in the video virtual try-on task and its superiority over other existing methods. ",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal receptive field (STRF) models are frequently used to approximate the computation implemented by a sensory neuron. Typically, such STRFs are assumed to be smooth and sparse. Current state-of-the-art approaches for estimating STRFs based on empirical Bayes are often not computationally efficient in high-dimensional settings, as encountered in sensory neuroscience. Here we pursued an alternative approach and encode prior knowledge for estimation of STRFs by choosing a set of basis functions with the desired properties: natural cubic splines. Our method is computationally efficient and can be easily applied to a wide range of existing models. We compared the performance of spline-based methods to non-spline ones on simulated and experimental data, showing that spline-based methods consistently outperform the non-spline versions. ",

    "title": "A heuristic for listing almost-clique minimal separators of a graph",
    "abstract": "Bodlaender and Koster (Discrete Mathematics 2006) introduced the notion of almost-clique separators in the context of computing the treewidth $\\tw(G)$ of a given graph $G$. A separator $S \\subseteq V(G)$ of $G$ is an \\emph{almost-clique separator} if $S \\setminus \\{v\\}$ is a clique of $G$ for some $v \\in S$. $S$ is a \\emph{minimal separator} if $S$ has at least two full components, where a full component of $S$ is a connected component $C$ of $G \\setminus S$ such that $N_G(C) = S$. They observed that if $S$ is an almost-clique minimal separator of $G$ then $\\tw(G \\cup K(S)) = \\tw(G)$, where $K(S)$ is the complete graph on vertex set $S$: in words, filling an almost-clique minimal separator into a clique does not increase the treewidth. Based on this observation, they proposed a preprocessing method for treewidth computation, a fundamental step of which is to find a preferably maximal set of pairwise non-crossing almost-clique minimal separators of a graph. In this paper, we present a heuristic for this step, which is based on the following empirical observation. For graph $G$ and a minimal triangulation $H$ of $G$, let $\\QQ(H, G)$ denote the set of all almost-clique minimal separators of $G$ that are minimal separators of $H$. Note that since the minimal separators of $H$ are pairwise non-crossing, so are those in $\\QQ(H, G)$. We observe from experiments that $\\QQ(H, G)$ is remarkably close to maximal, especially when the minimal triangulation $H$ is computed by an algorithm aiming for small treewidth. This observation leads to an efficient implementation of the preprocessing method proposed by Bodlaender and Koster. Experiments on instances from PACE 2017 and other sources show that this implementation is extremely fast and effective for graphs of practical interest. ",

    "abstract": "Visual surface anomaly detection aims to detect local image regions that significantly deviate from normal appearance. Recent surface anomaly detection methods rely on generative models to accurately reconstruct the normal areas and to fail on anomalies. These methods are trained only on anomaly-free images, and often require hand-crafted post-processing steps to localize the anomalies, which prohibits optimizing the feature extraction for maximal detection capability. In addition to reconstructive approach, we cast surface anomaly detection primarily as a discriminative problem and propose a discriminatively trained reconstruction anomaly embedding model (DRAEM). The proposed method learns a joint representation of an anomalous image and its anomaly-free reconstruction, while simultaneously learning a decision boundary between normal and anomalous examples. The method enables direct anomaly localization without the need for additional complicated post-processing of the network output and can be trained using simple and general anomaly simulations. On the challenging MVTec anomaly detection dataset, DRAEM outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin and even delivers detection performance close to the fully-supervised methods on the widely used DAGM surface-defect detection dataset, while substantially outperforming them in localization accuracy.

    "abstract": "To study emotions at the macroscopic level, affective scientists have made extensive use of sentiment analysis on social media text. However, this approach can suffer from a series of methodological issues with respect to sampling biases and measurement error. To date, it has not been validated if social media sentiment can measure the day to day temporal dynamics of emotions aggregated at the macro level of a whole online community. We ran a large-scale survey at an online newspaper to gather daily self-reports of affective states from its users and compare these with aggregated results of sentiment analysis of user discussions on the same online platform. Additionally, we preregistered a replication of our study using Twitter text as a macroscope of emotions for the same community. For both platforms, we find strong correlations between text analysis results and levels of self-reported emotions, as well as between inter-day changes of both measurements. We further show that a combination of supervised and unsupervised text analysis methods is the most accurate approach to measure emotion aggregates. We illustrate the application of such social media macroscopes when studying the association between the number of new COVID-19 cases and emotions, showing that the strength of associations is comparable when using survey data as when using social media data. Our findings indicate that macro level dynamics of affective states of users of an online platform can be tracked with social media text, complementing surveys when self-reported data is not available or difficult to gather.

    "abstract": "Sprouts is a two-player pencil-and-paper game invented by John Conway and Michael Paterson in 1967. In the game, the players take turns in joining dots by curves according to simple rules, until one player cannot make a move. The game of Sprouts is very popular and simple-looking, so it may come as a surprise that there are essentially no AI Sprouts players available. This lack of computer opponents is caused by the fact that the game hides a surprisingly high combinatorial complexity and implementing it involves fascinating programming challenges. We overcome all the implementation barriers and create the first user-friendly Sprouts application with a strong artificial intelligence after more than 50 years of the existence of the game. In particular, we combine results from the theory of nimbers with new methods based on Delaunay triangulations and crossing-preserving force-directed algorithms to develop an AI Sprouts player which plays a perfect game on up to 11 spots.

This paper provides a unique stress detection dataset that was created in a natural working environment in a hospital. This dataset is a collection of biometric data of nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak. Studying stress \"in the wild\" in a work environment is complex due to the influence of many social, cultural and individuals experience in dealing with stressful conditions. In order to address these concerns, we captured both the physiological data and associated context pertaining to the stress events. Specific physiological variables that were monitored included electrodermal activity, heart rate, skin temperature, and accelerometer data of the nurse subjects. A periodic smartphone-administered survey also captured the contributing factors for the detected stress events. A database containing the signals, stress events, and survey responses is available upon request. ",

Education, occupation, and age were the strongest sociodemographic predictors of GDPR awareness, with little influence of gender, subjective economic well-being, or locality size. Digital experience was significantly and positively correlated with GDPR awareness in a linear model, but this relationship proved to be more complex when we examined it through a typological analysis. Using an exploratory k-means cluster analysis we identified four clusters of digital citizenship, across both dimensions of digital experience and GDPR awareness: the off-line citizens (22%), the social netizens (32%), the web citizens (17%), and the data citizens (29%). The off-line citizens ranked lowest in internet use and GDPR awareness; the web citizens ranked at about average values, while the data citizens ranked highest in both digital experience and GDPR knowledge and use. The fourth identified cluster, the social netizens, had a discordant profile, with remarkably high social network use, below average online shopping experiences, and low GDPR awareness. Digitalization in human capital and general internet use is a strong country-level correlate of the national frequency of the data citizen type. Our results confirm previous studies of the low privacy awareness and skills associated with intense social media consumption, but we found that young generations are evenly divided between the rather carefree social netizens and the strongly invested data citizens.

    "abstract": "In streaming data applications incoming samples are processed and discarded, therefore, intelligent decision-making is crucial for the performance of lifelong learning systems. In addition, the order in which samples arrive may heavily affect the performance of online (and offline) incremental learners. The recently introduced incremental cluster validity indices (iCVIs) provide valuable aid in addressing such class of problems. Their primary use-case has been cluster quality monitoring; nonetheless, they have been very recently integrated in a streaming clustering method to assist the clustering task itself. In this context, the work presented here introduces the first adaptive resonance theory (ART)-based model that uses iCVIs for unsupervised and semi-supervised online learning. Moreover, it shows for the first time how to use iCVIs to regulate ART vigilance via an iCVI-based match tracking mechanism. The model achieves improved accuracy and robustness to ordering effects by integrating an online iCVI framework as module B of a topological adaptive resonance theory predictive mapping (TopoARTMAP) -- thereby being named iCVI-TopoARTMAP -- and by employing iCVI-driven post-processing heuristics at the end of each learning step. The online iCVI framework provides assignments of input samples to clusters at each iteration in accordance to any of several iCVIs. The iCVI-TopoARTMAP maintains useful properties shared by ARTMAP models, such as stability, immunity to catastrophic forgetting, and the many-to-one mapping capability via the map field module. The performance (unsupervised and semi-supervised) and robustness to presentation order (unsupervised) of iCVI-TopoARTMAP were evaluated via experiments with a synthetic data set and deep embeddings of a real-world face image data set.
