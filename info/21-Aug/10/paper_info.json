    "title": "An output-sensitive algorithm for all-pairs shortest paths in directed  acyclic graphs",
    "abstract": "A straightforward dynamic programming method for the single-source shortest paths problem (SSSP) in an edge-weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) processes the vertices in a topologically sorted order. First, we similarly iterate this method alternatively in a breadth-first search sorted order and the reverse order on an input directed graph with both positive and negative real edge weights, $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. For a positive integer $t,$ after $O(t)$ iterations in $O(tm)$ time, we obtain for each vertex $v$ a path distance from the source to $v$ not exceeding that yielded by the shortest path from the source to $v$ among the so called {\\em$ t+$light paths}. A directed path between two vertices is $t+$light if it contains at most $t$ more edges than the minimum edge-cardinality directed path between these vertices. After $O(n)$ iterations, we obtain an $O(nm)$-time solution to SSSP in directed graphs with real edge weights matching that of Bellman and Ford. Our main result is an output-sensitive algorithm for the all-pairs shortest paths problem (APSP) in DAGs with positive and negative real edge weights. It runs in time $O(\\min \\{n^{\\omega}, nm+n^2\\log n\\}+\\sum_{v\\in V}\\text{indeg}(v)|\\text{leaf}(T_v)|),$ where $n$ is the number of vertices, $m$ is the number of edges, $\\omega$ is the exponent of fast matrix multiplication, $\\text{indeg}(v)$ stands for the indegree of $v,$ $T_v$ is a tree of lexicographically-first shortest directed paths from all ancestors of $v$ to $v$, and $\\text{leaf}(T_v)$ is the set of leaves in $T_v.$ Finally, we discuss an extension of hypothetical improved upper time-bounds for APSP in non-negatively edge-weighted DAGs to include directed graphs with a polynomial number of large directed cycles.

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a very common problem in the field of failure prevention. Fast prevention means lower repair costs and losses. The amount of sensors in novel industry systems makes the anomaly detection process quite difficult for humans. Algorithms which automates the process of detecting anomalies are crucial in modern failure-prevention systems. Therefore, many machine and deep learning models have been designed to address this problem. Mostly, they are autoencoder-based architectures with some generative adversarial elements. In this work, a framework is shown which incorporates neuroevolution methods to boost the anomaly-detection scores of new and already known models. The presented approach adapts evolution strategies for evolving ensemble model, in which every single model works on a subgroup of data sensors. The next goal of neuroevolution is to optimise architecture and hyperparameters like window size, the number of layers, layer depths, etc. The proposed framework shows that it is possible to boost most of the anomaly detection deep learning models in a reasonable time and a fully automated mode. The tests were run on SWAT and WADI datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first approach in which an ensemble deep learning anomaly detection model is built in a fully automatic way using a neuroevolution strategy. ",

    "abstract": "The paper presents four models submitted to Part 2 of the SIGMORPHON 2021 Shared Task 0, which aims at replicating human judgements on the inflection of nonce lexemes. Our goal is to explore the usefulness of combining pre-compiled analogical patterns with an encoder-decoder architecture. Two models are designed using such patterns either in the input or the output of the network. Two extra models controlled for the role of raw similarity of nonce inflected forms to existing inflected forms in the same paradigm cell, and the role of the type frequency of analogical patterns. Our strategy is entirely endogenous in the sense that the models appealing solely to the data provided by the SIGMORPHON organisers, without using external resources. Our model 2 ranks second among all submitted systems, suggesting that the inclusion of analogical patterns in the network architecture is useful in mimicking speakers' predictions. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, a fully automatic and real-time system for the detection of scorpions was developed using computer vision and deep learning techniques. This system is based on the implementation of a double validation process using the shape features and the fluorescent characteristics of scorpions when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. The Haar Cascade Classifier (HCC) and YOLO (You Only Look Once) models have been used and compared as the first mechanism for the scorpion shape detection. The detection of the fluorescence emitted by the scorpions under UV light has been used as a second detection mechanism in order to increase the accuracy and precision of the system. The results obtained show that the system can accurately and reliably detect the presence of scorpions. In addition, values obtained of recall of 100% is essential with the purpose of providing a health security tool. Although the developed system can only be used at night or in dark environment, where the fluorescence emitted by the scorpions can be visualized, the nocturnal activity of scorpions justifies the incorporation of this second validation mechanism.

In this study, the relationship between the flame image obtained by a CCD camera and the excess air coefficient ({\\lambda}) has been modelled.

We further deploy these improvements in quantitative imaging and rapidly obtain T2 and T2* parameter maps from a fast EPTI scan. ",

    "title": "Kinematics clustering enables head impact subtyping for better traumatic  brain injury prediction",
    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury can be caused by various types of head impacts. However, due to different kinematic characteristics, many brain injury risk estimation models are not generalizable across the variety of impacts that humans may sustain. The current definitions of head impact subtypes are based on impact sources (e.g., football, traffic accident), which may not reflect the intrinsic kinematic similarities of impacts across the impact sources. To investigate the potential new definitions of impact subtypes based on kinematics, 3,161 head impacts from various sources including simulation, college football, mixed martial arts, and car racing were collected. We applied the K-means clustering to cluster the impacts on 16 standardized temporal features from head rotation kinematics. Then, we developed subtype-specific ridge regression models for cumulative strain damage (using the threshold of 15%), which significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with the baseline method which mixed impacts from different sources and developed one model (R^2 from 0.7 to 0.9). To investigate the effect of kinematic features, we presented the top three critical features (maximum resultant angular acceleration, maximum angular acceleration along the z-axis, maximum linear acceleration along the y-axis) based on regression accuracy and used logistic regression to find the critical points for each feature that partitioned the subtypes. This study enables researchers to define head impact subtypes in a data-driven manner, which leads to more generalizable brain injury risk estimation. ",
