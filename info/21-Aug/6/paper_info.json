    "abstract": "We propose a new kind of automatic architecture search algorithm. The algorithm alternates pruning connections and adding neurons, and it is not restricted to layered architectures only. Here architecture is an arbitrary oriented graph with some weights (along with some biases and an activation function), so there may be no layered structure in such a network. The algorithm minimizes the complexity of staying within a given error. We demonstrate our algorithm on the brightness prediction problem of the next point through the previous points on an image. Our second test problem is the approximation of the bivariate function defining the brightness of a black and white image. Our optimized networks significantly outperform the standard solution for neural network architectures in both cases. ",

    "title": "Deep Stable neural networks: large-width asymptotics and convergence  rates",
    "abstract": "In modern deep learning, there is a recent and growing literature on the interplay between large-width asymptotics for deep Gaussian neural networks (NNs), i.e. deep NNs with Gaussian-distributed weights, and classes of Gaussian stochastic processes (SPs). Such an interplay has proved to be critical in several contexts of practical interest, e.g. Bayesian inference under Gaussian SP priors, kernel regression for infinite-wide deep NNs trained via gradient descent, and information propagation within infinite-wide NNs. Motivated by empirical analysis, showing the potential of replacing Gaussian distributions with Stable distributions for the NN's weights, in this paper we investigate large-width asymptotics for (fully connected) feed-forward deep Stable NNs, i.e. deep NNs with Stable-distributed weights. First, we show that as the width goes to infinity jointly over the NN's layers, a suitable rescaled deep Stable NN converges weakly to a Stable SP whose distribution is characterized recursively through the NN's layers. Because of the non-triangular NN's structure, this is a non-standard asymptotic problem, to which we propose a novel and self-contained inductive approach, which may be of independent interest. Then, we establish sup-norm convergence rates of a deep Stable NN to a Stable SP, quantifying the critical difference between the settings of ``joint growth\" and ``sequential growth\" of the width over the NN's layers. Our work extends recent results on infinite-wide limits for deep Gaussian NNs to the more general deep Stable NNs, providing the first result on convergence rates for infinite-wide deep NNs. ",

    "abstract": "The amount of multimedia content shared everyday, combined with the level of realism reached by recent fake-generating technologies, threatens to impair the trustworthiness of online information sources. The process of uploading and sharing data tends to hinder standard media forensic analyses, since multiple re-sharing steps progressively hide the traces of past manipulations. At the same time though, new traces are introduced by the platforms themselves, enabling the reconstruction of the sharing history of digital objects, with possible applications in information flow monitoring and source identification. In this work, we propose a supervised framework for the reconstruction of image sharing chains on social media platforms. The system is structured as a cascade of backtracking blocks, each of them tracing back one step of the sharing chain at a time. Blocks are designed as ensembles of classifiers trained to analyse the input image independently from one another by leveraging different feature representations that describe both content and container of the media object. Individual decisions are then properly combined by a late fusion strategy. Results highlight the advantages of employing multiple clues, which allow accurately tracing back up to three steps along the sharing chain. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial lateral movement via compromised accounts remains difficult to discover via traditional rule-based defenses because it generally lacks explicit indicators of compromise. We propose a behavior-based, unsupervised framework comprising two methods of lateral movement detection on enterprise networks: one aimed at generic lateral movement via either exploit or authenticated connections, and one targeting the specific techniques of process injection and hijacking. The first method is based on the premise that the role of a system---the functions it performs on the network---determines the roles of the systems it should make connections with. The adversary meanwhile might move between any systems whatever, possibly seeking out systems with unusual roles that facilitate certain accesses. We use unsupervised learning to cluster systems according to role and identify connections to systems with novel roles as potentially malicious. The second method is based on the premise that the temporal patterns of inter-system processes that facilitate these connections depend on the roles of the systems involved. If a process is compromised by an attacker, these normal patterns might be disrupted in discernible ways. We apply frequent-itemset mining to process sequences to establish regular patterns of communication between systems based on role, and identify rare process sequences as signalling potentially malicious connections.

    "abstract": "In network inference applications, it is often desirable to detect community structure, namely to cluster vertices into groups, or blocks, according to some measure of similarity. Beyond mere adjacency matrices, many real networks also involve vertex covariates that carry key information about underlying block structure in graphs. To assess the effects of such covariates on block recovery, we present a comparative analysis of two model-based spectral algorithms for clustering vertices in stochastic blockmodel graphs with vertex covariates. The first algorithm uses only the adjacency matrix, and directly estimates the block assignments. The second algorithm incorporates both the adjacency matrix and the vertex covariates into the estimation of block assignments, and moreover quantifies the explicit impact of the vertex covariates on the resulting estimate of the block assignments. We employ Chernoff information to analytically compare the algorithms' performance and derive the information-theoretic Chernoff ratio for certain models of interest. Analytic results and simulations suggest that the second algorithm is often preferred: we can often better estimate the induced block assignments by first estimating the effect of vertex covariates. In addition, real data examples also indicate that the second algorithm has the advantages of revealing underlying block structure and taking observed vertex heterogeneity into account in real applications. Our findings emphasize the importance of distinguishing between observed and unobserved factors that can affect block structure in graphs. ",

    "abstract": "In a recent work arXiv:2008.08601, Halverson, Maiti and Stoner proposed a description of neural networks in terms of a Wilsonian effective field theory. The infinite-width limit is mapped to a free field theory, while finite $N$ corrections are taken into account by interactions (non-Gaussian terms in the action). In this paper, we study two related aspects of this correspondence. First, we comment on the concepts of locality and power-counting in this context. Indeed, these usual space-time notions may not hold for neural networks (since inputs can be arbitrary), however, the renormalization group provides natural notions of locality and scaling. Moreover, we comment on several subtleties, for example, that data components may not have a permutation symmetry: in that case, we argue that random tensor field theories could provide a natural generalization. Second, we improve the perturbative Wilsonian renormalization from arXiv:2008.08601 by providing an analysis in terms of the nonperturbative renormalization group using the Wetterich-Morris equation. An important difference with usual nonperturbative RG analysis is that only the effective (IR) 2-point function is known, which requires setting the problem with care. Our aim is to provide a useful formalism to investigate neural networks behavior beyond the large-width limit (i.e.~far from Gaussian limit) in a nonperturbative fashion. A major result of our analysis is that changing the standard deviation of the neural network weight distribution can be interpreted as a renormalization flow in the space of networks. We focus on translations invariant kernels and provide preliminary numerical results. ",

Many works have been devoted to the study of such complex networks, but most often they relate to the spread of one type of activity (influence). In the process of development of the newest technologies various mathematical models are developed and investigated: models with thresholds, models of independent cascades, models of distribution of epidemics, models of Markov processes. The paper proposes to use hypercomplex number systems, which are a mathematical apparatus that allows you to model some network problems and solve them at a new level, ie to consider a complex network with several properties in each node. In this paper, we consider networks where the edges correspond to the mutual influences of the nodes. It is proposed to match the number of properties in each node and the measurability of a hypercomplex number system(HNS) with the same number of basic elements. Each HNS corresponds to the Kelly table, which corresponds to the law of multiplication of these CSF. The properties of the CSF allow you to build an isomorphic transition from a filled Kelly table to a less filled one, which simplifies the calculation. To model the problem using hypercomplex number systems, we offer a specialized software package of hypercomplex computations based on the system of computer algebra Maple. All this made it easy to model a complex system with several effects. ",

The accuracy of the method is proved by studying the spread of an epidemic in the networks using the susceptible-infected-recovered model. We show that if a node with high broadcast is chosen as the origin of the outbreak of infection then the epidemic spreads early while it is delayed and inhibited if the origin of infection is a node with low broadcast. Receiving nodes can be treated as broadcasters if the arrow of time is reversed. ",
