    "title": "Relay a message as far as possible with local decisions in a network",
    "abstract": "Suppose there is a message generated at a node $v$ in a network and $v$ decides to pass the message to one of the neighbors $u$, and $u$ next decides to pass the message to one of its own neighbors, and so on. How to relay the message as far as possible with local decisions? To the best of our knowledge no general solution other than randomly picking available adjacent node exists. Here we report some progress. Our first contribution is a new framework called \\tp-separate chain decomposition for studying network structures. Each \\tp-separate chain induces a ranking of nodes. We then prove that the ranks can be locally and distributively computed via searching some stable states of certain dynamical systems on the network and can be used to search long paths of a guaranteed length containing any given node. Numerical analyses on a number of typical real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. ",

    "title": "A volumetric change detection framework using UAV oblique photogrammetry  - A case study of ultra-high-resolution monitoring of progressive building  collapse",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a case study that performs an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based fine-scale 3D change detection and monitoring of progressive collapse performance of a building during a demolition event. Multi-temporal oblique photogrammetry images are collected with 3D point clouds generated at different stages of the demolition. The geometric accuracy of the generated point clouds has been evaluated against both airborne and terrestrial LiDAR point clouds, achieving an average distance of 12 cm and 16 cm for roof and facade respectively. We propose a hierarchical volumetric change detection framework that unifies multi-temporal UAV images for pose estimation (free of ground control points), reconstruction, and a coarse-to-fine 3D density change analysis. This work has provided a solution capable of addressing change detection on full 3D time-series datasets where dramatic scene content changes are presented progressively. Our change detection results on the building demolition event have been evaluated against the manually marked ground-truth changes and have achieved an F-1 score varying from 0.78 to 0.92, with consistently high precision (0.92 - 0.99). Volumetric changes through the demolition progress are derived from change detection and have shown to favorably reflect the qualitative and quantitative building demolition progression. ",

    "title": "Efficient recurrent neural network methods for anomalously diffusing  single particle short and noisy trajectories",
    "abstract": "Anomalous diffusion occurs at very different scales in nature, from atomic systems to motions in cell organelles, biological tissues or ecology, and also in artificial materials, such as cement. Being able to accurately measure the anomalous exponent associated with a given particle trajectory, thus determining whether the particle subdiffuses, superdiffuses or performs normal diffusion is of key importance to understand the diffusion process. Also, it is often important to trustingly identify the model behind the trajectory, as this gives a large amount of information on the system dynamics. Both aspects are particularly difficult when the input data are short and noisy trajectories. It is even more difficult if one cannot guarantee that the trajectories output in experiments is homogeneous, hindering the statistical methods based on ensembles of trajectories. We present a data-driven method able to infer the anomalous exponent and to identify the type of anomalous diffusion process behind single, noisy and short trajectories, with good accuracy. This model was used in our participation in the Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge. A combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks were used to achieve state-of-the-art results when compared to methods participating in the AnDi Challenge, ranking top 4 in both classification and diffusion exponent regression.

    "abstract": "Chord diagrams, under the name of Gauss diagrams, are used in low-dimensional topology as an important tool for studying curves or knots. Those Gauss diagrams that correspond to curves or knots are called realizable. The theme of our paper is the fact that realizability of a Gauss diagram can be expressed via its circle graph. Accordingly, one can define and study realizable circle graphs (with realizability of a circle graph understood as realizability of any one of chord diagrams corresponding to the graph). Several studies contain theorems purporting to prove the fact. We check several of these descriptions experimentally and find counterexamples to the descriptions of realizable Gauss diagrams in some of these publications. We formulate new descriptions of realizable circle graphs and present an elegant algorithm for checking if a circle graph is realizable. We enumerate realizable circle graphs for small sizes and comment on these numbers. Then we concentrate on one type of curves, called meanders, and study the circle graphs of their Gauss diagrams. ",

    "abstract": "Numerous recent works show that overparameterization implicitly reduces variance for min-norm interpolators and max-margin classifiers. These findings suggest that ridge regularization has vanishing benefits in high dimensions. We challenge this narrative by showing that, even in the absence of noise, avoiding interpolation through ridge regularization can significantly improve generalization. We prove this phenomenon for the robust risk of both linear regression and classification and hence provide the first theoretical result on robust overfitting. ",

    "abstract": "We investigate the functioning of a classifying biological neural network from the perspective of statistical learning theory, modelled, in a simplified setting, as a continuous-time stochastic recurrent neural network (RNN) with identity activation function. In the purely stochastic (robust) regime, we give a generalisation error bound that holds with high probability, thus showing that the empirical risk minimiser is the best-in-class hypothesis. We show that RNNs retain a partial signature of the paths they are fed as the unique information exploited for training and classification tasks. We argue that these RNNs are easy to train and robust and back these observations with numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data. We also exhibit a trade-off phenomenon between accuracy and robustness. ",
