The model, initially devised for studies on complex networks, is employed here for the classification of texture images. The work is motivated by an alternative viewpoint provided by these graphs over the original data. The performance of the proposed method is verified in the classification of four benchmark databases, namely, KTHTIPS-2b, FMD, UIUC, and UMD and in a practical problem, which is the identification of plant species using scanned images of their leaves. Our method was competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches, confirming the potential of techniques used for data analysis in different contexts to give more meaningful interpretation to the use of neural networks in texture classification.

    "abstract": "Automatic detection of prohibited items within complex and cluttered X-ray security imagery is essential to maintaining transport security, where prior work on automatic prohibited item detection focus primarily on pseudo-colour (rgb}) X-ray imagery. In this work we study the impact of variant X-ray imagery, i.e., X-ray energy response (high, low}) and effective-z compared to rgb, via the use of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the joint object detection and segmentation task posed within X-ray baggage security screening. We evaluate state-of-the-art CNN architectures (Mask R-CNN, YOLACT, CARAFE and Cascade Mask R-CNN) to explore the transferability of models trained with such 'raw' variant imagery between the varying X-ray security scanners that exhibits differing imaging geometries, image resolutions and material colour profiles. Overall, we observe maximal detection performance using CARAFE, attributable to training using combination of rgb, high, low, and effective-z X-ray imagery, obtaining 0.7 mean Average Precision (mAP) for a six class object detection problem. Our results also exhibit a remarkable degree of generalisation capability in terms of cross-scanner transferability (AP: 0.835/0.611) for a one class object detection problem by combining rgb, high, low, and effective-z imagery.

Automatic identification of invasive insects would greatly speedup the identification of pests and expedite their removal. In this paper, we generate ensembles of CNNs based on different topologies (ResNet50, GoogleNet, ShuffleNet, MobileNetv2, and DenseNet201) altered by random selection from a simple set of data augmentation methods or optimized with different Adam variants for pest identification. Two new Adam algorithms for deep network optimization based on DGrad are proposed that introduce a scaling factor in the learning rate. Sets of the five CNNs that vary in either data augmentation or the type of Adam optimization were trained on both the Deng (SMALL) and the large IP102 pest data sets. Ensembles were compared and evaluated using three performance indicators. The best performing ensemble, which combined the CNNs using the different augmentation methods and the two new Adam variants proposed here, achieved state of the art on both insect data sets: 95.52% on Deng and 73.46% on IP102, a score on Deng that competed with human expert classifications. Additional tests were performed on data sets for medical imagery classification that further validated the robustness and power of the proposed Adam optimization variants.

    "abstract": "It is generally accepted that \"diversity\" is associated with success in evolutionary algorithms. However, diversity is a broad concept that can be measured and defined in a multitude of ways. To date, most evolutionary computation research has measured diversity using the richness and/or evenness of a particular genotypic or phenotypic property. While these metrics are informative, we hypothesize that other diversity metrics are more strongly predictive of success. Phylogenetic diversity metrics are a class of metrics popularly used in biology, which take into account the evolutionary history of a population. Here, we investigate the extent to which 1) these metrics provide different information than those traditionally used in evolutionary computation, and 2) these metrics better predict the long-term success of a run of evolutionary computation. We find that, in most cases, phylogenetic metrics behave meaningfully differently from other diversity metrics. Moreover, our results suggest that phylogenetic diversity is indeed a better predictor of success. ",

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art performance for several real-world problems is currently reached by convolutional neural networks (CNN). Such learning models exploit recent results in the field of deep learning, typically leading to highly performing, yet very large neural networks with (at least) millions of parameters. As a result, the deployment of such models is not possible when only small amounts of RAM are available, or in general within resource-limited platforms, and strategies to compress CNNs became thus of paramount importance. In this paper we propose a novel lossless storage format for CNNs based on source coding and leveraging both weight pruning and quantization. We theoretically derive the space upper bounds for the proposed structures, showing their relationship with both sparsity and quantization levels of the weight matrices. Both compression rates and excution times have been tested against reference methods for matrix compression, and an empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art quantization schemes based on weight sharing is also discussed, to assess their impact on the performance when applied to both convolutional and fully connected layers. On four benchmarks for classification and regression problems and comparing to the baseline pre-trained uncompressed network, we achieved a reduction of space occupancy up to 0.6% on fully connected layers and 5.44% on the whole network, while performing at least as competitive as the baseline.

This connectivity could be realized over the licensed spectrum like Narrowband-IoT (NBIoT) networks, or over the unlicensed spectrum like NBIoT-Unlicensed, SigFox and LoRa networks. In this paper, performance of IoT communications utilizing the unlicensed band, e.g. the 863-870 MHz in the Europe, in indoor use-cases like smart home, is investigated. More specifically, we focus on two scenarios for channel access management: i) coordinated access, where the activity patterns of gateways and sensors are coordinated with neighbors, and ii) uncoordinated access, in which each gateway and its associated nodes work independently from the neighbor ones. We further investigate a distributed coordination scheme in which, devices learn to coordinate their activity patterns leveraging tools from reinforcement learning. Closed-form expressions for capacity of the system, in terms of the number of sustained connections per gateway fulfilling a minimum quality of service (QoS) constraint are derived, and are further evaluated using simulations. Furthermore, delay-reliability and inter network interference-intra network collision performance tradeoffs offered by coordination are figured out. The simulation results highlight the impact of system and traffic parameters on the performance tradeoffs and characterize performance regions in which coordinated scheme outperforms the uncoordinated one, and vice versa. For example, for a packet loss requirement of 1%, the number of connected devices could be doubled by coordination. ",

    "abstract": "We propose to apply non-linear representation learning to voxelwise rs-fMRI data. Learning the non-linear representations is done using a variational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE is trained on voxelwise rs-fMRI data and performs non-linear dimensionality reduction that retains meaningful information. The retention of information in the model's representations is evaluated using downstream age regression and sex classification tasks. The results on these tasks are highly encouraging and a linear regressor trained with the representations of our unsupervised model performs almost as well as a supervised neural network, trained specifically for age regression on the same dataset. The model is also evaluated with a schizophrenia diagnosis prediction task, to assess its feasibility as a dimensionality reduction method for neuropsychiatric datasets. These results highlight the potential for pre-training on a larger set of individuals who do not have mental illness, to improve the downstream neuropsychiatric task results. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned for a variable number of epochs on a schizophrenia dataset and we find that fine-tuning for 1 epoch yields the best results. This work therefore not only opens up non-linear dimensionality reduction for voxelwise rs-fMRI data but also shows that pre-training a deep learning model on voxelwise rs-fMRI datasets greatly increases performance even on smaller datasets. It also opens up the ability to look at the distribution of rs-fMRI time series in the latent space of the VAE for heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia in future work. This can be complemented with the generative aspect of the model that allows us to reconstruct points from the model's latent space back into brain space and obtain an improved understanding of the relation that the VAE learns between subjects, timepoints, and a subject's characteristics.

In this paper, we design several reduction rules and a fast exact algorithm for the maximum weighted independent set problem, and use the measure-and-conquer technique to analyze the running time bound of the algorithm. Our algorithm works on general weighted graphs and it has a good running time bound on sparse graphs.

This stirred up hopes that counting perfect matchings might be polynomial-time solvable for graph classes excluding any fixed minor $H$.

It is successful in many applications; however, the accuracy of the PINN is not satisfactory when it is used to solve multiscale equations. Homogenization is a way of approximating a multiscale equation by a homogenized equation without multiscale property; it includes solving cell problems and the homogenized equation. The cell problems are periodic; and we propose an oversampling strategy which greatly improves the PINN accuracy on periodic problems. The homogenized equation has constant or slow dependency coefficient and can also be solved by PINN accurately. We hence proposed a 3-step method to improve the PINN accuracy for solving multiscale problems with the help of the homogenization. We apply our method to solve three equations which represent three different homogenization. The results show that the proposed method greatly improves the PINN accuracy. Besides, we also find that the PINN aided homogenization may achieve better accuracy than the numerical methods driven homogenization; PINN hence is a potential alternative to implementing the homogenization.

Trust in automatically generated patches is an important matter to drive greater adoption of program repair. Towards this goal, we conduct a survey with more than 100 software practitioners to understand the artifacts and setups needed to enhance trust in automatically generated patches. Based on the feedback from the survey, we quantitatively evaluate existing test-suite based program repair tools. We find that existing test-suite based repair tools cannot produce high-quality patches within a top-10 ranking and an acceptable time period of 1 hour. The developer feedback from our qualitative study and the observations from our quantitative examination of existing repair tools point to actionable insights to drive program repair research. Specifically, we note that producing repairs within an acceptable time-bound is very much dependent on leveraging an abstract search space representation of a rich enough search space. At the same time, while additional developer inputs are valuable to generate or rank patches, developers seem not to desire a significant human-in-the-loop interaction. ",

Independent FE and material discretization, as well as flexible incorporation of experimental data, offer high robustness and control. Three elementary test cases, which exhibit large deformations and different challenges, are considered: uniaxial tension, pure bending, and sheet inflation. Experiment-like results are generated from high-resolution simulations with the subsequent addition of up to 4% noise. Local optimization based on the trust-region approach is used. The results show that with a sufficient amount of experimental measurements, the algorithm is capable to reconstruct material distributions with high precision even in the presence of large noise.

Dimensionality reduction methods are thus required to extract useful and relevant information. Here we devise a machine learning method, Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (GMVAE) that can simultaneously perform dimensionality reduction and clustering of biomolecular conformations in an unsupervised way. We show that GMVAE can learn a reduced representation of the free energy landscape of protein folding with highly separated clusters that correspond to the metastable states during folding. Since GMVAE uses a mixture of Gaussians as the prior, it can directly acknowledge the multi-basin nature of protein folding free-energy landscape. To make the model end-to-end differentialble, we use a Gumbel-softmax distribution. We test the model on three long-timescale protein folding trajectories and show that GMVAE embedding resembles the folding funnel with folded states down the funnel and unfolded states outer in the funnel path. Additionally, we show that the latent space of GMVAE can be used for kinetic analysis and Markov state models built on this embedding produce folding and unfolding timescales that are in close agreement with other rigorous dynamical embeddings such as time independent component analysis (TICA).
