    "title": "SITHCon: A neural network robust to variations in input scaling on the  time dimension",
    "abstract": "In machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extremely influential in both computer vision and in recognizing patterns extended over time. In computer vision, part of the flexibility arises from the use of max-pooling operations over the convolutions to attain translation invariance. In the mammalian brain, neural representations of time use a set of temporal basis functions. Critically, these basis functions appear to be arranged in a geometric series such that the basis set is evenly distributed over logarithmic time. This paper introduces a Scale-Invariant Temporal History Convolution network (SITHCon) that uses a logarithmically-distributed temporal memory. A max-pool over a logarithmically-distributed temporal memory results in scale-invariance in time. We compare performance of SITHCon to a Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) and demonstrate that, although both networks can learn classification and regression problems on both univariate and multivariate time series $f(t)$, only SITHCon has the property that it generalizes without retraining to rescaled versions of the input $f(at)$. This property, inspired by findings from neuroscience and psychology, could lead to large-scale networks with dramatically different capabilities, including faster training and greater generalizability, even with significantly fewer free parameters.

    "abstract": "Reeb graphs are widely used in a range of fields for the purposes of analyzing and comparing complex spaces via a simpler combinatorial object. Further, they are closely related to extended persistence diagrams, which largely but not completely encode the information of the Reeb graph. In this paper, we investigate the effect on the persistence diagram of a particular continuous operation on Reeb graphs; namely the (truncated) smoothing operation. This construction arises in the context of the Reeb graph interleaving distance, but separately from that viewpoint provides a simplification of the Reeb graph which continuously shrinks small loops. We then use this characterization to initiate the study of inverse problems for Reeb graphs using smoothing by showing which paths in persistence diagram space (commonly known as vineyards) can be realized by a path in the space of Reeb graphs via these simple operations. This allows us to solve the inverse problem on a certain family of piecewise linear vineyards when fixing an initial Reeb graph. ",

    "title": "Formal context reduction in deriving concept hierarchies from corpora  using adaptive evolutionary clustering algorithm star",
    "abstract": "It is beneficial to automate the process of deriving concept hierarchies from corpora since a manual construction of concept hierarchies is typically a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. As such, the overall process of learning concept hierarchies from corpora encompasses a set of steps: parsing the text into sentences, splitting the sentences and then tokenising it. After the lemmatisation step, the pairs are extracted using FCA. However, there might be some uninteresting and erroneous pairs in the formal context. Generating formal context may lead to a time-consuming process, so formal context size reduction is required to remove uninterested and erroneous pairs, taking less time to extract the concept lattice and concept hierarchies accordingly. In this premise, this study aims to propose two frameworks: (1) A framework to review the current process of deriving concept hierarchies from corpus utilising FCA; (2) A framework to decrease the formal contexts ambiguity of the first framework using an adaptive version of ECA*. Experiments are conducted by applying 385 sample corpora from Wikipedia on the two frameworks to examine the reducing size of formal context, which leads to yield concept lattice and concept hierarchy. The resulting lattice of formal context is evaluated to the standard one using concept lattice-invariants. Accordingly, the homomorphic between the two lattices preserves the quality of resulting concept hierarchies by 89% in contrast to the basic ones, and the reduced concept lattice inherits the structural relation of the standard one. The adaptive ECA* is examined against its four counterpart baseline algorithms to measure the execution time on random datasets with different densities (fill ratios). The results show that adaptive ECA* performs concept lattice faster than other mentioned competitive techniques in different fill ratios. ",

The microscopic view of the reduction instances reveals that the instances are $P_9$-free chordal bipartite graphs, and hence the status of Hamiltonicity in $P_8$-free chordal bipartite graphs is open. In this paper, we identify the first non-trivial subclass of $P_8$-free chordal bipartite graphs which is $P_5$-free chordal bipartite graphs, and present structural and algorithmic results on $P_5$-free chordal bipartite graphs. We investigate the structure of $P_5$-free chordal bipartite graphs and show that these graphs have a {\\em Nested Neighborhood Ordering (NNO)}, a special ordering among its vertices. Further, using this ordering, we present polynomial-time algorithms for classical problems such as the Hamiltonian cycle (path), also the variants and generalizations of the Hamiltonian cycle (path) problem. We also obtain polynomial-time algorithms for treewidth (pathwidth), and minimum fill-in in $P_5$-free chordal bipartite graph.

    "abstract": "The Panopticon (which means \"watcher of everything\") is a well-known structure of continuous surveillance and discipline proposed by Bentham in 1785. This device was, later, used by Foucault and other philosophers as a paradigm and metaphor for the study of constitutional power and knowledge as well as a model of individuals' deprivation of freedom. Nowadays, technological achievements have given rise to new, non-physical (unlike prisons), means of constant surveillance that transcend physical boundaries. This, combined with the confession of some governmental institutions that they actually collaborate with these Internet giants to collect or deduce information about people, creates a worrisome situation of several co-existing Panopticons that can act separately or in close collaboration. Thus, they can only be detected and identified through the expense of (perhaps considerable) effort. In this paper we provide a theoretical framework for studying the detectability status of Panopticons that fall under two theoretical, but not unrealistic, definitions. We show, using Oracle Turing Machines, that detecting modern day, ICT-based, Panopticons is an undecidable problem. Furthermore, we show that for each sufficiently expressive formal system, we can effectively construct a Turing Machine for which it is impossible to prove, within the formal system, either that it is a Panopticon or it is not a Panopticon.

Specifically, we propose a poisoning attack in which a malicious adversary inserts a small poisoned sample of monolingual text into the training set of a system trained using back-translation. This sample is designed to induce a specific, targeted translation behaviour, such as peddling misinformation. We present two methods for crafting poisoned examples, and show that only a tiny handful of instances, amounting to only 0.02% of the training set, is sufficient to enact a successful attack. We outline a defence method against said attacks, which partly ameliorates the problem. However, we stress that this is a blind-spot in modern NMT, demanding immediate attention. ",

We experiment with our entropy formulation at quantizing and compressing well-known network architectures over multiple datasets. Our approach compares favorably over similar methods, enjoying the benefits of higher order entropy estimate, showing flexibility towards non-uniform quantization (we use Lloyd-max quantization), scalability towards any entropy order to be minimized and efficiency in terms of compression. We show that HEMP is able to work in synergy with other approaches aiming at pruning or quantizing the model itself, delivering significant benefits in terms of storage size compressibility without harming the model's performance.

    "abstract": "For graphs $G$ and $H$, we say that $G$ is $H$-free if it does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. Already in the early 1980s Alekseev observed that if $H$ is connected, then the \\textsc{Max Weight Independent Set} problem (MWIS) remains \\textsc{NP}-hard in $H$-free graphs, unless $H$ is a path or a subdivided claw, i.e., a graph obtained from the three-leaf star by subdividing each edge some number of times (possibly zero). Since then determining the complexity of MWIS in these remaining cases is one of the most important problems in algorithmic graph theory. A general belief is that the problem is polynomial-time solvable, which is witnessed by algorithmic results for graphs excluding some small paths or subdivided claws. A more conclusive evidence was given by the recent breakthrough result by Gartland and Lokshtanov [FOCS 2020]: They proved that MWIS can be solved in quasipolynomial time in $H$-free graphs, where $H$ is any fixed path. If $H$ is an arbitrary subdivided claw, we know much less: The problem admits a QPTAS and a subexponential-time algorithm [Chudnovsky et al., SODA 2019]. In this paper we make an important step towards solving the problem by showing that for any subdivided claw $H$, MWIS is polynomial-time solvable in $H$-free graphs of bounded degree. ",

    "abstract": "As infamous invaders to the North American ecosystem, the Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia) is devastating not only to native bee colonies, but also to local apiculture. One of the most effective way to combat the harmful species is to locate and destroy their nests. By mobilizing the public to actively report possible sightings of the Asian giant hornet, the governmentcould timely send inspectors to confirm and possibly destroy the nests. However, such confirmation requires lab expertise, where manually checking the reports one by one is extremely consuming of human resources. Further given the limited knowledge of the public about the Asian giant hornet and the randomness of report submission, only few of the numerous reports proved positive, i.e. existing nests. How to classify or prioritize the reports efficiently and automatically, so as to determine the dispatch of personnel, is of great significance to the control of the Asian giant hornet. In this paper, we propose a method to predict the priority of sighting reports based on machine learning. We model the problem of optimal prioritization of sighting reports as a problem of classification and prediction. We extracted a variety of rich features in the report: location, time, image(s), and textual description. Based on these characteristics, we propose a classification model based on logistic regression to predict the credibility of a certain report. Furthermore, our model quantifies the impact between reports to get the priority ranking of the reports. Extensive experiments on the public dataset from the WSDA (the Washington State Department of Agriculture) have proved the effectiveness of our method. ",

    "abstract": "A key aspect for the forklifts is the state-of-health (SoH) assessment to ensure the safety and the reliability of uninterrupted power source. Forecasting the battery SoH well is imperative to enable preventive maintenance and hence to reduce the costs. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of gradient boosting regression for predicting the SoH timeseries under circumstances when there is little prior information available about the batteries. We compared the gradient boosting method with light gradient boosting, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, random forests, long short-term memory networks and with combined convolutional neural network and long short-term memory networks methods. We used multiple predictors and lagged target signal decomposition results as additional predictors and compared the yielded prediction results with different sets of predictors for each method. For this work, we are in possession of a unique data set of 45 lithium-ion battery packs with large variation in the data. The best model that we derived was validated by a novel walk-forward algorithm that also calculates point-wise confidence intervals for the predictions; we yielded reasonable predictions and confidence intervals for the predictions. Furthermore, we verified this model against five other lithium-ion battery packs; the best model generalised to greater extent to this set of battery packs. The results about the final model suggest that we were able to enhance the results in respect to previously developed models. Moreover, we further validated the model for extracting cycle counts presented in our previous work with data from new forklifts; their battery packs completed around 3000 cycles in a 10-year service period, which corresponds to the cycle life for commercial Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese (NMC) cells.

To solve this problem, we present a Context-aware Virtual Adversarial Training (CaVAT) method for generating anatomically plausible segmentation. Unlike approaches focusing solely on accuracy, our method also considers complex topological constraints like connectivity which cannot be easily modeled in a differentiable loss function. We use adversarial training to generate examples violating the constraints, so the network can learn to avoid making such incorrect predictions on new examples, and employ the Reinforce algorithm to handle non-differentiable segmentation constraints. The proposed method offers a generic and efficient way to add any constraint on top of any segmentation network. Experiments on two clinically-relevant datasets show our method to produce segmentations that are both accurate and anatomically-plausible in terms of region connectivity. ",

In 5G communications, the traffic rate is high, necessitating high data rates and low latency. Deep learning is a potential solution for overcoming these constraints. Secure slicing avoids resource wastage; however, DDoS attackers can exploit the sliced network. Therefore, we focused on secure slicing with resource allocation under massive network traffic. Traffic-aware scheduling is proposed for secure slicing and resource allocation over SDN/NFV-enabled 5G networks. In this approach (T-S3RA), user devices are authenticated using Boolean logic with a password-based key derivation function. The traffic is scheduled in 5G access points, and secure network slicing and resource allocation are implemented using deep learning models such as SliceNet and HopFieldNet, respectively. To predict DDoS attackers, we computed the Renyi entropy for packet classification. Experiments were conducted using a network simulator with 250 nodes in the network topology. Performance was evaluated using metrics such as throughput, latency, packet transmission ratio, packet loss ratio, slice capacity, bandwidth consumption, and slice acceptance ratio. T-S3RA was implemented in three 5G use cases with different requirements including massive machine-type communication, ultrareliable low-latency communication, and enhanced mobile broadband. ",

The denoiser is independent of the downstream ASR model, and thus can be rapidly deployed in existing systems. We found that training the denoisier using a perceptually motivated loss function resulted in increased adversarial robustness without compromising ASR performance on benign samples. Our defense was evaluated (as a part of the DARPA GARD program) on the 'Kenansville' attack strategy across a range of attack strengths and speech samples.
