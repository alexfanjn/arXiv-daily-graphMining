    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) techniques are being increasingly used in mobile networks for network planning, operation, management, optimisation and much more. These techniques are realised using a set of logical nodes known as ML pipeline. A single network operator might have thousands of such ML pipelines distributed across its network. These pipelines need to be managed and orchestrated across network domains. Thus it is essential to have autonomic multi-domain orchestration of ML pipelines in mobile networks. International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has provided an architectural framework for management and orchestration of ML pipelines in future networks. We extend this framework to enable autonomic orchestration of ML pipelines across multiple network domains. We present our system architecture and describe its application using a smart factory use case. Our work allows autonomic orchestration of multi-domain ML pipelines in a standardised, technology agnostic, privacy preserving fashion. ",

    "abstract": "Transcending the binary categorization of racist and xenophobic texts, this research takes cues from social science theories to develop a four dimensional category for racism and xenophobia detection, namely stigmatization, offensiveness, blame, and exclusion. With the aid of deep learning techniques, this categorical detection enables insights into the nuances of emergent topics reflected in racist and xenophobic expression on Twitter. Moreover, a stage wise analysis is applied to capture the dynamic changes of the topics across the stages of early development of Covid-19 from a domestic epidemic to an international public health emergency, and later to a global pandemic. The main contributions of this research include, first the methodological advancement. By bridging the state-of-the-art computational methods with social science perspective, this research provides a meaningful approach for future research to gain insight into the underlying subtlety of racist and xenophobic discussion on digital platforms. Second, by enabling a more accurate comprehension and even prediction of public opinions and actions, this research paves the way for the enactment of effective intervention policies to combat racist crimes and social exclusion under Covid-19.

    "abstract": "Measuring the predictability and complexity of time series is an essential tool in designing and controlling the nonlinear system. There exist different entropy measures in the literature to analyze the predictability and complexity of time series. However, these measures have some drawbacks especially in short time series. To overcome the difficulties, this paper proposes a new method for estimating the entropy of a time series using the LogNNet 784:25:10 neural network model. The LogNNet reservoir matrix consists of 19625 elements which is filled with the time series elements. After that, the network is trained on MNIST-10 dataset and the classification accuracy is calculated. The accuracy is considered as the entropy measure and denoted by NNetEn. A more complex transformation of the input information by the time series in the reservoir leads to higher NNetEn values. Many practical time series data have less than 19625 elements. Some duplicating or stretching methods are investigated to overcome this difficulty and the most successful method is identified for practical applications. The epochs number in the training process of LogNNet is considered as the input parameter. A new time series characteristic called time series learning inertia is introduced to investigate the effect of epochs number in the efficiency of neural network. To show the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method, it is applied on some chaotic, periodic, random, binary and constant time series. The NNetEn is compared with some existing entropy measures. The results show that the proposed method is more robust and accurate than existing methods. ",

Compared with the traditional sampler of PyTorch, such as sequential sampler, batch sampler, the training loss of the proposed stepped sampler converges faster in the training of the model, and the training loss after convergence is more stable.

Therefore, in this work we study the problem of how to efficiently learn a model in a peer-to-peer system with non-iid client data. We propose a method named Performance-Based Neighbor Selection (PENS) where clients with similar data distributions detect each other and cooperate by evaluating their training losses on each other's data to learn a model suitable for the local data distribution. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show that our proposed method is able to achieve higher accuracies as compared to strong baselines. ",

Our architecture, named PE-Net, learns the representation of point clouds in high-dimensional space, and encodes the unordered input points to feature vectors, which standard 2D CNNs can be applied to. The recommended network can adapt to changes in the number of input points which is the limit of current methods.

Secondly, a reference input of the proposed controller that is achieved from desired hip joint's angle in a walking cycle is utilized. Then, a backstepping based sliding mode force control approach is employed to ensure the precise movement of robot's link as well as meeting the requirement of robustness for the whole system, which is significant for the task of walking of a humanoid.

By detecting a lesion as keypoints, we provide a more conceptually straightforward formulation for detection, and overcome several drawbacks (e.g., requiring extensive effort in designing data-appropriate anchors and losing shape information) of existing bounding-box-based methods while exploring a single-task, one-stage approach compared to other RECIST-based approaches. Experiments show that RECIST-Net achieves a sensitivity of 92.49% at four false positives per image, outperforming other recent methods including those using multi-task learning. ",

    "abstract": "Flow and multicomponent reactive transport in saturated/unsaturated porous media are modeled by ensembles of computational particles moving on regular lattices according to specific random walk rules. The occupation number of the lattice sites is updated with a global random walk (GRW) procedure which simulates the evolution of the ensemble with computational costs comparable to those for a single random walk simulation in sequential procedures. To cope with the nonlinearity and the degeneracy of the Richards equation the GRW flow solver uses linearization techniques similar to the $L$-scheme developed in finite element/volume approaches. Numerical schemes for reactive transport, coupled with the flow solver via numerical solutions for saturation and water flux, are implemented in splitting procedures. Diffusion-advection steps are solved by GRW algorithms using either biased or unbiased random walk probabilities. Since the number of particles in GRW simulations can be as large as the number of molecules involved in chemical reactions, one avoids the cumbersome problem of rescaling particle densities to approximate concentrations. Reaction steps are therefore formulated in terms of concentrations, as in deterministic approaches. The numerical convergence of the new schemes is demonstrated by comparisons with manufactured analytical solutions. Coupled flow and reactive transport problems of contaminant biodegradation described by the Monod model are further solved and the influence of flow nonlinearity/degeneracy and of the spatial heterogeneity of the medium is investigated numerically.

    "abstract": "In combating the ongoing global health threat of the Covid-19 pandemic, decision-makers have to take actions based on a multitude of relevant health data with severe potential consequences for the affected patients. Because of their presumed advantages in handling and analyzing vast amounts of data, computer systems of automated decision-making (ADM) are implemented and substitute humans in decision-making processes. In this study, we focus on a specific application of ADM in contrast to human decision-making (HDM), namely the allocation of Covid-19 vaccines to the public. In particular, we elaborate on the role of trust and social group preference on the legitimacy of vaccine allocation. We conducted a survey with a 2x2 randomized factorial design among n=1602 German respondents, in which we utilized distinct decision-making agents (HDM vs. ADM) and prioritization of a specific social group (teachers vs. prisoners) as design factors. Our findings show that general trust in ADM systems and preference for vaccination of a specific social group influence the legitimacy of vaccine allocation. However, contrary to our expectations, trust in the agent making the decision did not moderate the link between social group preference and legitimacy. Moreover, the effect was also not moderated by the type of decision-maker (human vs. algorithm). We conclude that trustworthy ADM systems must not necessarily lead to the legitimacy of ADM systems.

The nested framework subsumes all nonconformity scores, including recent proposals based on quantile regression and density estimation. While these ideas were originally derived based on sample splitting, our framework seamlessly extends them to other aggregation schemes like cross-conformal, jackknife+ and out-of-bag methods. We use the framework to derive a new algorithm (QOOB, pronounced cube) that combines four ideas: quantile regression, cross-conformalization, ensemble methods and out-of-bag predictions. We develop a computationally efficient implementation of cross-conformal, that is also used by QOOB.

With a focus towards calibration, we establish a 'tripod' of theorems that connect these three notions for score-based classifiers. A direct implication is that distribution-free calibration is only possible, even asymptotically, using a scoring function whose level sets partition the feature space into at most countably many sets. Parametric calibration schemes such as variants of Platt scaling do not satisfy this requirement, while nonparametric schemes based on binning do. To close the loop, we derive distribution-free confidence intervals for binned probabilities for both fixed-width and uniform-mass binning. As a consequence of our 'tripod' theorems, these confidence intervals for binned probabilities lead to distribution-free calibration. We also derive extensions to settings with streaming data and covariate shift. ",

Numerical experiments are presented for the aforementioned example which supports our theoretical findings. Hence, in this setting, we demonstrate both theoretically and numerically that the TUSLA algorithm can solve the optimization problem involving neural networks with ReLU activation function. Besides, we provide simulation results for synthetic examples where popular algorithms, e.g. ADAM, AMSGrad, RMSProp, and (vanilla) SGD, may fail to find the minimizer of the objective functions due to the super-linear growth and the discontinuity of the corresponding stochastic gradient, while the TUSLA algorithm converges rapidly to the optimal solution.

These power flows can create technical challenges and their pricing poses socio-economic questions regarding fairness and equity. This paper demonstrates how these challenges can be addressed in unison by deploying Community-scale Energy Storage (CES) and updating DN pricing structures with a tier of local network tariffs. While both of these interventions have been studied in isolation, we for the first time show how their combination can be symbiotic and resolve the shortcomings that each faces when deployed in isolation - the feasibility of CES is no longer blocked by network tariffs and local network tariffs are no longer a zero-sum trade off between DN operators and customer segments. Our study simulates the operation of a CES under a range of local network tariff models, using current Australian electricity prices and current network prices as a reference. We assess the financial outcomes for solar and non-solar owning customers and the DN operator, as well as the self-sufficiency of the local network and self-consumption of locally generated solar power. Our results establish that it is critical for local network tariffs to be set to less than half the standard distribution network tariff in order for the CES to achieve its full potential and for all stakeholders to benefit. This finding provides clear guidance to regulators and policy makers and promises to make both innovations financially and politically feasible. ",
