    "title": "Correlation detection in trees for partial graph alignment",
    "abstract": "We consider alignment of sparse graphs, which consists in finding a mapping between the nodes of two graphs which preserves most of the edges. Our approach is to compare local structures in the two graphs, matching two nodes if their neighborhoods are 'close enough': for correlated Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs, this problem can be locally rephrased in terms of testing whether a pair of branching trees is drawn from either a product distribution, or a correlated distribution. We design an optimal test for this problem which gives rise to a message-passing algorithm for graph alignment, which provably returns in polynomial time a positive fraction of correctly matched vertices, and a vanishing fraction of mismatches. With an average degree $\\lambda = O(1)$ in the graphs, and a correlation parameter $s \\in [0,1]$, this result holds with $\\lambda s$ large enough, and $1-s$ small enough, completing the recent state-of-the-art diagram. Tighter conditions for determining whether partial graph alignment (or correlation detection in trees) is feasible in polynomial time are given in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergences. ",

    "title": "Versatile modular neural locomotion control with fast learning",
    "abstract": "Legged robots have significant potential to operate in highly unstructured environments. The design of locomotion control is, however, still challenging. Currently, controllers must be either manually designed for specific robots and tasks, or automatically designed via machine learning methods that require long training times and yield large opaque controllers. Drawing inspiration from animal locomotion, we propose a simple yet versatile modular neural control structure with fast learning. The key advantages of our approach are that behavior-specific control modules can be added incrementally to obtain increasingly complex emergent locomotion behaviors, and that neural connections interfacing with existing modules can be quickly and automatically learned. In a series of experiments, we show how eight modules can be quickly learned and added to a base control module to obtain emergent adaptive behaviors allowing a hexapod robot to navigate in complex environments. We also show that modules can be added and removed during operation without affecting the functionality of the remaining controller. Finally, the control approach was successfully demonstrated on a physical hexapod robot. Taken together, our study reveals a significant step towards fast automatic design of versatile neural locomotion control for complex robotic systems. ",

    "abstract": "This work develops optimal preconditioners for the discrete H(curl) and H(div) problems on two and three-dimensional hypersurfaces by nodal auxiliary space preconditioning [R. Hiptmair, J. Xu: SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 45, 2483-2509 (2007)]. In particular, on unstructured triangulated surfaces, we develop fast and user-friendly preconditioners for the edge and face element discretizations of curl-curl and grad-div problems based on inverting several discrete surface Laplacians. The proposed preconditioners lead to efficient iterative methods for computing harmonic tangential vector fields on discrete surfaces. Numerical experiments on hypersurfaces are presented to test the performance of those surface preconditioners. ",

    "title": "Exploiting generative self-supervised learning for the assessment of  biological images with lack of annotations: a COVID-19 case-study",
    "abstract": "Computer-aided analysis of biological images typically requires extensive training on large-scale annotated datasets, which is not viable in many situations. In this paper we present GAN-DL, a Discriminator Learner based on the StyleGAN2 architecture, which we employ for self-supervised image representation learning in the case of fluorescent biological images. We show that Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks combined with linear Support Vector Machines enable high-throughput compound screening based on raw images. We demonstrate this by classifying active and inactive compounds tested for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in VERO and HRCE cell lines. In contrast to previous methods, our deep learning based approach does not require any annotation besides the one that is normally collected during the sample preparation process. We test our technique on the RxRx19a Sars-CoV-2 image collection. The dataset consists of fluorescent images that were generated to assess the ability of regulatory-approved or in late-stage clinical trials compound to modulate the in vitro infection from SARS-CoV-2 in both VERO and HRCE cell lines. We show that our technique can be exploited not only for classification tasks, but also to effectively derive a dose response curve for the tested treatments, in a self-supervised manner. Lastly, we demonstrate its generalization capabilities by successfully addressing a zero-shot learning task, consisting in the categorization of four different cell types of the RxRx1 fluorescent images collection.
