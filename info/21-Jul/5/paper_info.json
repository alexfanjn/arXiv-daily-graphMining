    "title": "Transformer-F: A Transformer network with effective methods for learning  universal sentence representation",
    "abstract": "The Transformer model is widely used in natural language processing for sentence representation. However, the previous Transformer-based models focus on function words that have limited meaning in most cases and could merely extract high-level semantic abstraction features. In this paper, two approaches are introduced to improve the performance of Transformers. We calculated the attention score by multiplying the part-of-speech weight vector with the correlation coefficient, which helps extract the words with more practical meaning. The weight vector is obtained by the input text sequence based on the importance of the part-of-speech. Furthermore, we fuse the features of each layer to make the sentence representation results more comprehensive and accurate. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model Transformer-F on three standard text classification datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed model significantly boosts the performance of text classification as compared to the baseline model. Specifically, we obtain a 5.28% relative improvement over the vanilla Transformer on the simple tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Motivated by finite volume scheme, a cell-average based neural network method is proposed. The method is based on the integral or weak formulation of partial differential equations. A simple feed forward network is forced to learn the solution average evolution between two neighboring time steps. Offline supervised training is carried out to obtain the optimal network parameter set, which uniquely identifies one finite volume like neural network method. Once well trained, the network method is implemented as a finite volume scheme, thus is mesh dependent. Different to traditional numerical methods, our method can be relieved from the explicit scheme CFL restriction and can adapt to any time step size for solution evolution. For Heat equation, first order of convergence is observed and the errors are related to the spatial mesh size but are observed independent of the mesh size in time. The cell-average based neural network method can sharply evolve contact discontinuity with almost zero numerical diffusion introduced. Shock and rarefaction waves are well captured for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. ",

    "abstract": "In this technical report, we briefly introduce the solution of our team \"TAL-ai\" for (Semi-) supervised Face detection in the low light condition in UG2+ Challenge in CVPR 2021. By conducting several experiments with popular image enhancement methods and image transfer methods, we pulled the low light image and the normal image to a more closer domain. And it is observed that using these data to training can achieve better performance. We also adapt several popular object detection frameworks, e.g., DetectoRS, Cascade-RCNN, and large backbone like Swin-transformer. Finally, we ensemble several models which achieved mAP 74.89 on the testing set, ranking 1st on the final leaderboard. ",

    "title": "Two-phase geothermal model with fracture network and multi-branch wells",
    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the numerical simulation of geothermal systems in complex geological settings. The physical model is based on two-phase Darcy flows coupling the mass conservation of the water component with the energy conservation and the liquid vapor thermodynamical equilibrium. The discretization exploits the flexibility of unstructured meshes to model complex geology including conductive faults as well as complex wells. The polytopal and essentially nodal Vertex Approximate Gradient scheme is used for the approximation of the Darcy and Fourier fluxes combined with a Control Volume approach for the transport of mass and energy. Particular attention is paid to the faults which are modelled as two-dimensional interfaces defined as collection of faces of the mesh and to the flow inside deviated or multi-branch wells defined as collection of edges of the mesh with rooted tree data structure. By using an explicit pressure drop calculation, the well model reduces to a single equation based on complementarity constraints with only one well implicit unknown. The coupled systems are solved fully implicitely at each time step using efficient nonlinear and linear solvers on parallel distributed architectures. The convergence of the discrete model is investigated numerically on a simple test case with a Cartesian geometry and a single vertical producer well. Then, the ability of our approach to deal efficiently with realistic test cases is assessed on a high energy faulted geothermal reservoir operated using a doublet of two deviated wells. ",

    "abstract": "Infant motility assessment using intelligent wearables is a promising new approach for assessment of infant neurophysiological development, and where efficient signal analysis plays a central role. This study investigates the use of different end-to-end neural network architectures for processing infant motility data from wearable sensors. We focus on the performance and computational burden of alternative sensor encoder and time-series modelling modules and their combinations. In addition, we explore the benefits of data augmentation methods in ideal and non-ideal recording conditions. The experiments are conducted using a data-set of multi-sensor movement recordings from 7-month-old infants, as captured by a recently proposed smart jumpsuit for infant motility assessment. Our results indicate that the choice of the encoder module has a major impact on classifier performance. For sensor encoders, the best performance was obtained with parallel 2-dimensional convolutions for intra-sensor channel fusion with shared weights for all sensors. The results also indicate that a relatively compact feature representation is obtainable for within-sensor feature extraction without a drastic loss to classifier performance. Comparison of time-series models revealed that feed-forward dilated convolutions with residual and skip connections outperformed all RNN-based models in performance, training time, and training stability. The experiments also indicate that data augmentation improves model robustness in simulated packet loss or sensor dropout scenarios. In particular, signal- and sensor-dropout-based augmentation strategies provided considerable boosts to performance without negatively affecting the baseline performance. Overall the results provide tangible suggestions on how to optimize end-to-end neural network training for multi-channel movement sensor data. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial computations are a widely studied class of computations where resource-bounded probabilistic adversaries have access to oracles, i.e., probabilistic procedures with private state. These computations arise routinely in several domains, including security, privacy and machine learning. In this paper, we develop program logics for reasoning about adversarial computations in a higher-order setting. Our logics are built on top of a simply typed $\\lambda$-calculus extended with a graded monad for probabilities and state. The grading is used to model and restrict the memory footprint and the cost (in terms of oracle calls) of computations. Under this view, an adversary is a higher-order expression that expects as arguments the code of its oracles. We develop unary program logics for reasoning about error probabilities and expected values, and a relational logic for reasoning about coupling-based properties. All logics feature rules for adversarial computations, and yield guarantees that are valid for all adversaries that satisfy a fixed resource policy. We prove the soundness of the logics in the category of quasi-Borel spaces, using a general notion of graded predicate liftings, and we use logical relations over graded predicate liftings to establish the soundness of proof rules for adversaries. We illustrate the working of our logics with simple but illustrative examples. ",

In order to verify the effect of MSGCN model, the model is compared with the method of calculating molecular three-dimensional conformation in RDKit, and the result is better than it.

    "title": "Unveiling the structure of wide flat minima in neural networks",
    "abstract": "The success of deep learning has revealed the application potential of neural networks across the sciences and opened up fundamental theoretical problems. In particular, the fact that learning algorithms based on simple variants of gradient methods are able to find near-optimal minima of highly nonconvex loss functions is an unexpected feature of neural networks which needs to be understood in depth. Such algorithms are able to fit the data almost perfectly, even in the presence of noise, and yet they have excellent predictive capabilities. Several empirical results have shown a reproducible correlation between the so-called flatness of the minima achieved by the algorithms and the generalization performance. At the same time, statistical physics results have shown that in nonconvex networks a multitude of narrow minima may coexist with a much smaller number of wide flat minima, which generalize well. Here we show that wide flat minima arise from the coalescence of minima that correspond to high-margin classifications. Despite being exponentially rare compared to zero-margin solutions, high-margin minima tend to concentrate in particular regions. These minima are in turn surrounded by other solutions of smaller and smaller margin, leading to dense regions of solutions over long distances. Our analysis also provides an alternative analytical method for estimating when flat minima appear and when algorithms begin to find solutions, as the number of model parameters varies. ",
