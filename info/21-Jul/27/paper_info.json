    "abstract": "Natural convection in porous media is a highly nonlinear multiphysical problem relevant to many engineering applications (e.g., the process of $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ sequestration). Here, we present a non-intrusive reduced order model of natural convection in porous media employing deep convolutional autoencoders for the compression and reconstruction and either radial basis function (RBF) interpolation or artificial neural networks (ANNs) for mapping parameters of partial differential equations (PDEs) on the corresponding nonlinear manifolds. To benchmark our approach, we also describe linear compression and reconstruction processes relying on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and ANNs. We present comprehensive comparisons among different models through three benchmark problems. The reduced order models, linear and nonlinear approaches, are much faster than the finite element model, obtaining a maximum speed-up of $7 \\times 10^{6}$ because our framework is not bound by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition; hence, it could deliver quantities of interest at any given time contrary to the finite element model. Our model's accuracy still lies within a mean squared error of 0.07 (two-order of magnitude lower than the maximum value of the finite element results) in the worst-case scenario. We illustrate that, in specific settings, the nonlinear approach outperforms its linear counterpart and vice versa. We hypothesize that a visual comparison between principal component analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) could indicate which method will perform better prior to employing any specific compression strategy.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a PINN training framework that employs (1) pre-training steps that accelerates and improve the robustness of the training of physics-informed neural network with auxiliary data stored in point clouds, (2) a net-to-net knowledge transfer algorithm that improves the weight initialization of the neural network and (3) a multi-objective optimization algorithm that may improve the performance of a physical-informed neural network with competing constraints. We consider the training and transfer and multi-task learning of physics-informed neural network (PINN) as multi-objective problems where the physics constraints such as the governing equation, boundary conditions, thermodynamic inequality, symmetry, and invariant properties, as well as point cloud used for pre-training can sometimes lead to conflicts and necessitating the seek of the Pareto optimal solution. In these situations, weighted norms commonly used to handle multiple constraints may lead to poor performance, while other multi-objective algorithms may scale poorly with increasing dimensionality. To overcome this technical barrier, we adopt the concept of vectorized objective function and modify a gradient descent approach to handle the issue of conflicting gradients. Numerical experiments are compared the benchmark boundary value problems solved via PINN. The performance of the proposed paradigm is compared against the classical equal-weighted norm approach. Our numerical experiments indicate that the brittleness and lack of robustness demonstrated in some PINN implementations can be overcome with the proposed strategy. ",

Communication with the general mass is thus always a challenge for this minority group. Especially in Bangla sign language (BdSL), there are 38 alphabets with some having nearly identical symbols. As a result, in BdSL recognition, the posture of hand is an important factor in addition to visual features extracted from traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In this paper, a novel architecture \"Concatenated BdSL Network\" is proposed which consists of a CNN based image network and a pose estimation network. While the image network gets the visual features, the relative positions of hand keypoints are taken by the pose estimation network to obtain the additional features to deal with the complexity of the BdSL symbols. A score of 91.51% was achieved by this novel approach in test set and the effectiveness of the additional pose estimation network is suggested by the experimental results. ",

The focus is laid on multi-class classification with number of samples significantly skewed toward one of the classes. The algorithm leverages out-of-bag datasets to estimate prediction errors of individual trees, which are then used in accordance with the Bayes rule to refine the decision of the ensemble. The algorithm takes prevalence of individual classes into account and does not require setting of any additional parameters related to class weights or decision-score thresholds. Evaluation is based on publicly available datasets as well as on an proprietary dataset comprising network traffic telemetry from hundreds of enterprise networks with over a million of users overall. The aim is to increase the detection capabilities of an operating malware detection system. While we were able to keep precision of the system higher than 94\\%, that is only 6 out of 100 detections shown to the network administrator are false alarms, we were able to achieve increase of approximately 7\\% in the number of detections. The algorithm effectively handles large amounts of data, and can be used in conjunction with most of the state-of-the-art algorithms used to train decision forests. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the great promise of the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in solving forward and inverse problems, several technical challenges are present as roadblocks for more complex and realistic applications. First, most existing PINNs are based on point-wise formulation with fully-connected networks to learn continuous functions, which suffer from poor scalability and hard boundary enforcement. Second, the infinite search space over-complicates the non-convex optimization for network training. Third, although the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based discrete learning can significantly improve training efficiency, CNNs struggle to handle irregular geometries with unstructured meshes. To properly address these challenges, we present a novel discrete PINN framework based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and variational structure of PDE to solve forward and inverse partial differential equations (PDEs) in a unified manner. The use of a piecewise polynomial basis can reduce the dimension of search space and facilitate training and convergence. Without the need of tuning penalty parameters in classic PINNs, the proposed method can strictly impose boundary conditions and assimilate sparse data in both forward and inverse settings. The flexibility of GCNs is leveraged for irregular geometries with unstructured meshes. The effectiveness and merit of the proposed method are demonstrated over a variety of forward and inverse computational mechanics problems governed by both linear and nonlinear PDEs. ",

In the literature this problem is usually solved by turning it into a combinatorial optimization problem, often solved through generic heruristic methods such as Genetic Algorithms or Tabu Search. In this paper, we take a different route and obtain the grid partition by exploiting the synchronization dynamics of a cyberlayer of Kuramoto oscillators, each parameterized as a rough approximation of the dynamics of the grid's node it corresponds to. We present first a centralised algorithm and then a decentralised strategy. In the former, nodes are aggregated based on their internode synchronization times while in the latter they exploit synchronization of the oscillators in the cyber layer to selforganise into islands. Our preliminary results show that the heuristic synchronization based algorithms do converge towards partitions that are comparable to those obtained via other more cumbersome and computationally expensive optimization-based methods.

    "abstract": "Many numerical methods for evaluating matrix functions can be naturally viewed as computational graphs. Rephrasing these methods as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) is a particularly effective way to study existing techniques, improve them, and eventually derive new ones. As the accuracy of these matrix techniques is determined by the accuracy of their scalar counterparts, the design of algorithms for matrix functions can be viewed as a scalar-valued optimization problem. The derivatives needed during the optimization can be calculated automatically by exploiting the structure of the DAG, in a fashion akin to backpropagation. The Julia package GraphMatFun.jl offers the tools to generate and manipulate computational graphs, to optimize their coefficients, and to generate Julia, MATLAB, and C code to evaluate them efficiently. The software also provides the means to estimate the accuracy of an algorithm and thus obtain numerically reliable methods. For the matrix exponential, for example, using a particular form (degree-optimal) of polynomials produces algorithms that are cheaper, in terms of computational cost, than the Pad\\'e-based techniques typically used in mathematical software. The optimized graphs and the corresponding generated code are available online. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a decentralised \"local2global\" approach to graph representation learning, that one can a-priori use to scale any embedding technique. Our local2global approach proceeds by first dividing the input graph into overlapping subgraphs (or \"patches\") and training local representations for each patch independently. In a second step, we combine the local representations into a globally consistent representation by estimating the set of rigid motions that best align the local representations using information from the patch overlaps, via group synchronization. A key distinguishing feature of local2global relative to existing work is that patches are trained independently without the need for the often costly parameter synchronisation during distributed training. This allows local2global to scale to large-scale industrial applications, where the input graph may not even fit into memory and may be stored in a distributed manner. Preliminary results on medium-scale data sets (up to $\\sim$7K nodes and $\\sim$200K edges) are promising, with a graph reconstruction performance for local2global that is comparable to that of globally trained embeddings. A thorough evaluation of local2global on large scale data and applications to downstream tasks, such as node classification and link prediction, constitutes ongoing work. ",

We leverage longitudinal GPS mobility data of hundreds of thousands of anonymous individuals in four US states and empirically show the dramatic disruption in people's life. We find that local interventions did not just impact the number of visits to different venues but also how people experience them. Individuals spend less time in venues, preferring simpler and more predictable routines and reducing person-to-person contact activities. Moreover, we show that the stringency of interventions alone does explain the number and duration of visits to venues: individual patterns of visits seem to be influenced by the local severity of the pandemic and a risk adaptation factor, which increases the people's mobility regardless of the stringency of interventions.

It is widely assumed that Bayesian neural networks (BNN) are well suited for this task, as the endowed epistemic uncertainty should lead to disagreement in predictions on outliers. In this paper, we question this assumption and provide empirical evidence that proper Bayesian inference with common neural network architectures does not necessarily lead to good OOD detection. To circumvent the use of approximate inference, we start by studying the infinite-width case, where Bayesian inference can be exact considering the corresponding Gaussian process. Strikingly, the kernels induced under common architectural choices lead to uncertainties that do not reflect the underlying data generating process and are therefore unsuited for OOD detection. Finally, we study finite-width networks using HMC, and observe OOD behavior that is consistent with the infinite-width case. Overall, our study discloses fundamental problems when naively using BNNs for OOD detection and opens interesting avenues for future research. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we examine the advantages of using multiple types of behaviour in recommendation systems. Intuitively, each user has to do some implicit actions (e.g., click) before making an explicit decision (e.g., purchase). Previous studies showed that implicit and explicit feedback have different roles for a useful recommendation. However, these studies either exploit implicit and explicit behaviour separately or ignore the semantic of sequential interactions between users and items. In addition, we go from the hypothesis that a user's preference at a time is a combination of long-term and short-term interests. In this paper, we propose some Deep Learning architectures. The first one is Implicit to Explicit (ITE), to exploit users' interests through the sequence of their actions. And two versions of ITE with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers based (BERT-based) architecture called BERT-ITE and BERT-ITE-Si, which combine users' long- and short-term preferences without and with side information to enhance user representation. The experimental results show that our models outperform previous state-of-the-art ones and also demonstrate our views on the effectiveness of exploiting the implicit to explicit order as well as combining long- and short-term preferences in two large-scale datasets.
