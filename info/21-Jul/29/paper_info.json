    "title": "Discrete Lehmann representation of imaginary time Green's functions",
    "abstract": "We present an efficient basis for imaginary time Green's functions based on a low rank decomposition of the spectral Lehmann representation. The basis functions are simply a set of well-chosen exponentials, so the corresponding expansion may be thought of as a discrete form of the Lehmann representation using an effective spectral density which is a sum of $\\delta$ functions. The basis is determined only by an upper bound on the product $\\beta \\omega_{\\max}$, with $\\beta$ the inverse temperature and $\\omega_{\\max}$ an energy cutoff, and a user-defined error tolerance $\\epsilon$. The number $r$ of basis functions scales as $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\log(\\beta \\omega_{\\max}) \\log (1/\\epsilon)\\right)$. The discrete Lehmann representation of a particular imaginary time Green's function can be recovered by interpolation at a set of $r$ imaginary time nodes. Both the basis functions and the interpolation nodes can be obtained rapidly using standard numerical linear algebra routines. Due to the simple form of the basis, the discrete Lehmann representation of a Green's function can be explicitly transformed to the Matsubara frequency domain, or obtained directly by interpolation on a Matsubara frequency grid. We benchmark the efficiency of the representation on simple cases, and with a high precision solution of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev equation at low temperature. We compare our approach with the related intermediate representation method, and introduce an improved algorithm to build the intermediate representation basis and a corresponding sampling grid. ",

    "title": "Dense Graph Partitioning on sparse and dense graphs",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of partitioning a graph into a non-fixed number of non-overlapping subgraphs of maximum density. The density of a partition is the sum of the densities of the subgraphs, where the density of the subgraph is the ratio of its number of edges and its number of vertices. This problem, called Dense Graph Partition, is known to be NP-hard on general graphs and polynomial-time solvable on trees, and polynomial-time 2-approximable. In this paper we study the restriction of Dense Graph Partition to particular sparse and dense graph classes. In particular, we prove that it is NP-hard on dense bipartite graphs as well as on cubic graphs. On dense bipartite graphs, we further show that it is W[2]-hard parameterized by the number of sets in the optimum solution. On dense graphs on $n$ vertices, it is polynomial-time solvable on graphs with minimum degree $n-3$ and NP-hard on $(n-4)$-regular graphs. We prove that it is polynomial-time $4/3$-approximable on cubic graphs and admits an efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme on $(n-4)$-regular graphs. ",

    "title": "Exploring and mining attributed sequences of interactions",
    "abstract": "We are faced with data comprised of entities interacting over time: this can be individuals meeting, customers buying products, machines exchanging packets on the IP network, among others. Capturing the dynamics as well as the structure of these interactions is of crucial importance for analysis. These interactions can almost always be labeled with content: group belonging, reviews of products, abstracts, etc. We model these stream of interactions as stream graphs, a recent framework to model interactions over time. Formal Concept Analysis provides a framework for analyzing concepts evolving within a context. Considering graphs as the context, it has recently been applied to perform closed pattern mining on social graphs. In this paper, we are interested in pattern mining in sequences of interactions. After recalling and extending notions from formal concept analysis on graphs to stream graphs, we introduce algorithms to enumerate closed patterns on a labeled stream graph, and introduce a way to select relevant closed patterns. We run experiments on two real-world datasets of interactions among students and citations between authors, and show both the feasibility and the relevance of our method. ",

    "title": "Growing knowledge culturally across generations to solve novel, complex  tasks",
    "abstract": "Knowledge built culturally across generations allows humans to learn far more than an individual could glean from their own experience in a lifetime. Cultural knowledge in turn rests on language: language is the richest record of what previous generations believed, valued, and practiced. The power and mechanisms of language as a means of cultural learning, however, are not well understood. We take a first step towards reverse-engineering cultural learning through language. We developed a suite of complex high-stakes tasks in the form of minimalist-style video games, which we deployed in an iterated learning paradigm. Game participants were limited to only two attempts (two lives) to beat each game and were allowed to write a message to a future participant who read the message before playing. Knowledge accumulated gradually across generations, allowing later generations to advance further in the games and perform more efficient actions. Multigenerational learning followed a strikingly similar trajectory to individuals learning alone with an unlimited number of lives. These results suggest that language provides a sufficient medium to express and accumulate the knowledge people acquire in these diverse tasks: the dynamics of the environment, valuable goals, dangerous risks, and strategies for success. The video game paradigm we pioneer here is thus a rich test bed for theories of cultural transmission and learning from language. ",

    "title": "Deep learning based cough detection camera using enhanced features",
    "abstract": "Coughing is a typical symptom of COVID-19. To detect and localize coughing sounds remotely, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning model was developed in this work and integrated with a sound camera for the visualization of the cough sounds. The cough detection model is a binary classifier of which the input is a two second acoustic feature and the output is one of two inferences (Cough or Others). Data augmentation was performed on the collected audio files to alleviate class imbalance and reflect various background noises in practical environments. For effective featuring of the cough sound, conventional features such as spectrograms, mel-scaled spectrograms, and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) were reinforced by utilizing their velocity (V) and acceleration (A) maps in this work. VGGNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet were simplified to binary classifiers, and were named V-net, G-net, and R-net, respectively. To find the best combination of features and networks, training was performed for a total of 39 cases and the performance was confirmed using the test F1 score. Finally, a test F1 score of 91.9% (test accuracy of 97.2%) was achieved from G-net with the MFCC-V-A feature (named Spectroflow), an acoustic feature effective for use in cough detection. The trained cough detection model was integrated with a sound camera (i.e., one that visualizes sound sources using a beamforming microphone array). In a pilot test, the cough detection camera detected coughing sounds with an F1 score of 90.0% (accuracy of 96.0%), and the cough location in the camera image was tracked in real time. ",

    "title": "High-speed object detection with a single-photon time-of-flight image  sensor",
    "abstract": "3D time-of-flight (ToF) imaging is used in a variety of applications such as augmented reality (AR), computer interfaces, robotics and autonomous systems. Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are one of the enabling technologies providing accurate depth data even over long ranges. By developing SPADs in array format with integrated processing combined with pulsed, flood-type illumination, high-speed 3D capture is possible. However, array sizes tend to be relatively small, limiting the lateral resolution of the resulting depth maps, and, consequently, the information that can be extracted from the image for applications such as object detection. In this paper, we demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome through the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for high-performance object detection. We present outdoor results from a portable SPAD camera system that outputs 16-bin photon timing histograms with 64x32 spatial resolution. The results, obtained with exposure times down to 2 ms (equivalent to 500 FPS) and in signal-to-background (SBR) ratios as low as 0.05, point to the advantages of providing the CNN with full histogram data rather than point clouds alone. Alternatively, a combination of point cloud and active intensity data may be used as input, for a similar level of performance. In either case, the GPU-accelerated processing time is less than 1 ms per frame, leading to an overall latency (image acquisition plus processing) in the millisecond range, making the results relevant for safety-critical computer vision applications which would benefit from faster than human reaction times.
