    "abstract": "The success of neural network embeddings has entailed a renewed interest in using knowledge graphs for a wide variety of machine learning and information retrieval tasks. In particular, recent recommendation methods based on graph embeddings have shown state-of-the-art performance. In general, these methods encode latent rating patterns and content features. Differently from previous work, in this paper, we propose to exploit embeddings extracted from graphs that combine information from ratings and aspect-based opinions expressed in textual reviews. We then adapt and evaluate state-of-the-art graph embedding techniques over graphs generated from Amazon and Yelp reviews on six domains, outperforming baseline recommenders. Additionally, our method has the advantage of providing explanations that involve the coverage of aspect-based opinions given by users about recommended items. ",

    "abstract": "A selection of intellectual goods produced by online communities - e.g. open source software or knowledge bases like Wikipedia - are in daily use by a broad audience, and thus their quality impacts the public at large. Yet, it is still unclear what contributes to the effectiveness of such online peer production systems: what conditions or social processes help them deliver quality products. Specifically, while co-contribution (i.e. bipartite networks) are often investigated in online collaboration, the role of interpersonal communication in coordination of online peer-production is much less investigated. To address this gap we have reconstructed networks of personal communication (direct messaging) between Wikipedia editors gathered in so called Wikiprojects - teams of contributors who focus on articles within specific topical areas. We found that effective projects exchange larger volume of direct messages and that their communication structure allows for complex coordination: for sharing of information locally through selective ties, and at the same time globally across the whole group. To verify how these network measures relate to the subjective perception of importance of group communication we conducted semi-structured interviews with members of selected projects. Our interviewees used direct communication for providing feedback, for maintaining close relations and for tapping on the social capital of the Wikipedia community. Our results underscore the importance of communication structure in online collaboration: online peer production communities rely on interpersonal communication to coordinate their work and to maintain high levels of engagement. Design of platforms for such communities should allow for ample group level communication as well as for one-on-one interactions. ",

To ensure functionality under manufacturing inaccuracies, the robust or three-field formulation is employed, involving dilated, intermediate and eroded realizations of the design. Darcy's law in conjunction with a conceptualized drainage term is used to model the pressure load as a function of the design vector. The consistent nodal loads are evaluated from the obtained pressure field using the standard finite element method. The objective and load sensitivities are obtained using the adjoint-variable approach. A multi-criteria objective involving both the stiffness and flexibility of the mechanism is employed in the robust formulation, and min-max optimization problems are solved to obtain pressure-actuated inverter and gripper compliant mechanisms with different minimum feature sizes. Limitations of the linear elasticity assumptions while designing mechanisms are identified with high pressure loads. ",

Our experiments, based on image classification tasks according to the labels of the Places dataset, are performed by first considering only the visual part, and then adding the associated texts as support. The results obtained demonstrated that trained neural networks such as CLIP can be successfully applied to image classification with little fine-tuning, and considering the associated texts to the images can help to improve the accuracy depending on the goal. The results demonstrated what seems to be a promising research direction. ",

However, for improved performance, not only past images but also future images should be used along with corresponding facial images, but there are obstacles to the application of this technique to real-time environments. In this paper, we propose the causal affect prediction network (CAPNet), which uses only past facial images to predict corresponding affective valence and arousal. We train CAPNet to learn causal inference between past images and corresponding affective valence and arousal through supervised learning by pairing the sequence of past images with the current label using the Aff-Wild2 dataset. We show through experiments that the well-trained CAPNet outperforms the baseline of the second challenge of the Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW2) Competition by predicting affective valence and arousal only with past facial images one-third of a second earlier. Therefore, in real-time application, CAPNet can reliably predict affective valence and arousal only with past data. ",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is quickly becoming the customary means for identification of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to its ability to obtain high resolution information about the genes and mechanisms that are causing resistance and driving pathogen mobility. By contrast, traditional phenotypic (antibiogram) testing cannot easily elucidate such information. Yet development of AMR prediction tools from genotype-phenotype data can be biased, since sampling is non-randomized. Sample provenience, period of collection, and species representation can confound the association of genetic traits with AMR. Thus, prediction models can perform poorly on new data with sampling distribution shifts. In this work -- under an explicit set of causal assumptions -- we evaluate the effectiveness of propensity-based rebalancing and confounding adjustment on AMR prediction using genotype-phenotype AMR data from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC). We select bacterial genotypes (encoded as k-mer signatures, i.e. DNA fragments of length k), country, year, species, and AMR phenotypes for the tetracycline drug class, preparing test data with recent genomes coming from a single country. We test boosted logistic regression (BLR) and random forests (RF) with/without bias-handling. On 10,936 instances, we find evidence of species, location and year imbalance with respect to the AMR phenotype. The crude versus bias-adjusted change in effect of genetic signatures on AMR varies but only moderately (selecting the top 20,000 out of 40+ million k-mers). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of the RF (0.95) is comparable to that of BLR (0.94) on both out-of-bag samples from bootstrap and the external test (n=1,085), where AUROCs do not decrease. We observe a 1%-5% gain in AUROC with bias-handling compared to the sole use of genetic signatures. ... ",

A Fast Fourier Transform is applied to 30 seconds long epochs of EEG recordings to provide localized time-frequency information, and a deep convolutional LSTM neural network is trained for sleep stage classification. Automating sleep stages detection from EEG data offers great potential to tackling sleep irregularities on a daily basis. Thereby, a novel approach for sleep stage classification is proposed which combines the best of signal processing and statistics. In this study, we used the PhysioNet Sleep European Data Format (EDF) Database.

Non-trainable variables are rapidly driven towards stochastic equilibrium and trainable variables are slowly driven towards learning equilibrium described by a scale-invariant distribution on a wide range of scales. Our results suggest that the scale invariance observed in many physical and biological systems might be due to some kind of learning dynamics and support the claim that the universe might be a neural network.

    "abstract": "Modern Internet of Things solutions are used in a variety of different areas, ranging from connected vehicles and healthcare to industrial applications. They rely on a large amount of interconnected sensors, which can lead to both technical and economical challenges. Virtual sensing techniques aim to reduce the number of physical sensors in a system by using data from available measurements to estimate additional unknown quantities of interest. Successful model-based solutions include Kalman filters or the combination of finite element models and modal analysis, while many data-driven methods rely on machine learning algorithms. The presented hybrid virtual sensing approach combines Long Short-Term Memory networks with frequency response function models in order to estimate the behavior of non-linear dynamic systems with multiple input and output channels. Network training and prediction make use of short signal subsequences, which are later recombined by applying a windowing technique. The frequency response function model acts as a baseline estimate which perfectly captures linear dynamic systems and is augmented by the non-linear Long Short-Term Memory network following two different hybrid modeling strategies. The approach is tested using a non-linear experimental dataset, which results from measurements of a three-component servo-hydraulic fatigue test bench. A variety of metrics in time and frequency domains, as well as fatigue strength under variable amplitudes are used to evaluate the approximation quality of the proposed method. In addition to virtual sensing, the algorithm is also applied to a forward prediction task. Synthetic data are used in a separate study to estimate the prediction quality on datasets of different size. ",

Commonly, yielding is measured through controlled mechanical testing at small or large scales, in ways that either distinguish elastic (stress) from total deformation measurements, or by identifying plastic slip contributions. In this paper we argue that instead of separate elastic/plastic measurements, yielding can be unraveled through statistical analysis of total strain fluctuations during the evolution sequence of profiles measured in-situ, through digital image correlation. We demonstrate two distinct ways of precisely quantifying yield locations in widely applicable crystal plasticity models, that apply in polycrystalline solids, either by using principal component analysis or discrete wavelet transforms. We test and compare these approaches in synthetic data of polycrystal simulations and a variety of yielding responses, through changes of the applied loading rates and the strain-rate sensitivity exponents.

We focus onCOVID-19and its information during the period when the disease was widely spread in China, i.e., from January 25th to March 24th, 2020. We first explore how the disease and information co-evolve via the spatial analysis of the two spreading processes. We visualize the geo-location of both disease and information at the province level and find that disease is more geo-localized compared to information. We find a high correlation between the disease and information data, and also people care about the spread only when it comes to their neighborhood. Regard to the content of the information, we find that positive messages are more negatively correlated with the disease compared to negative and neutral messages. Additionally, we introduce machine learning algorithms, i.e., linear regression and random forest, to further predict the number of infected using different disease spatial related and information-related characteristics. We obtain that the disease spatial related characteristics of nearby cities can help to improve the prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, information-related characteristics can also help to improve the prediction performance, but with a delay, i.e., the improvement comes from using, for instance, the number of messages 10 days ago, for disease prediction.
