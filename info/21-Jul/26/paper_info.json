    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely used to solve various scientific computing problems. However, large training costs limit PINNs for some real-time applications. Although some works have been proposed to improve the training efficiency of PINNs, few consider the influence of initialization. To this end, we propose a New Reptile initialization based Physics-Informed Neural Network (NRPINN). The original Reptile algorithm is a meta-learning initialization method based on labeled data. PINNs can be trained with less labeled data or even without any labeled data by adding partial differential equations (PDEs) as a penalty term into the loss function. Inspired by this idea, we propose the new Reptile initialization to sample more tasks from the parameterized PDEs and adapt the penalty term of the loss. The new Reptile initialization can acquire initialization parameters from related tasks by supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. Then, PINNs with initialization parameters can efficiently solve PDEs. Besides, the new Reptile initialization can also be used for the variants of PINNs. Finally, we demonstrate and verify the NRPINN considering both forward problems, including solving Poisson, Burgers, and Schr\\\"odinger equations, as well as inverse problems, where unknown parameters in the PDEs are estimated. Experimental results show that the NRPINN training is much faster and achieves higher accuracy than PINNs with other initialization methods. ",

    "abstract": "Crises such as natural disasters, global pandemics, and social unrest continuously threaten our world and emotionally affect millions of people worldwide in distinct ways. Understanding emotions that people express during large-scale crises helps inform policy makers and first responders about the emotional states of the population as well as provide emotional support to those who need such support. We present CovidEmo, ~1K tweets labeled with emotions. We examine how well large pre-trained language models generalize across domains and crises in the task of perceived emotion prediction in the context of COVID-19. Our results show that existing models do not directly transfer from one disaster type to another but using labeled emotional corpora for domain adaptation is beneficial. ",

To do so, it comprises two modules that are plugged after any anomaly detection algorithm: (i) a first attention mechanism, that ranks the present features in terms of their relation with the anomaly and (ii) a second module able to incorporates previous expert knowledge seamlessly, without any need of human interaction nor decisions. We show the efficacy of these simple processes on a collection of real router datasets obtained from tens of ISPs which exhibit a rich variety of anomalies and very heterogeneous set of KPIs, on which we gather manually annotated ground truth by the operator solving the troubleshooting ticket. Our experimental evaluation shows that (i) the proposed system is effective in achieving high levels of agreement with the expert, that (ii) even a simple statistical approach is able to extracting useful information from expert knowledge gained in past cases to further improve performance and finally that (iii) the main difficulty in live deployment concerns the automated selection of the anomaly detection algorithm and the tuning of its hyper-parameters.

Their impact has been seen mainly in the computer vision field with realistic image and video manipulation, especially generation, making significant advancements. While these computer vision advances have garnered much attention, GAN applications have diversified across disciplines such as time series and sequence generation. As a relatively new niche for GANs, fieldwork is ongoing to develop high quality, diverse and private time series data. In this paper, we review GAN variants designed for time series related applications. We propose a taxonomy of discrete-variant GANs and continuous-variant GANs, in which GANs deal with discrete time series and continuous time series data. Here we showcase the latest and most popular literature in this field; their architectures, results, and applications. We also provide a list of the most popular evaluation metrics and their suitability across applications. Also presented is a discussion of privacy measures for these GANs and further protections and directions for dealing with sensitive data. We aim to frame clearly and concisely the latest and state-of-the-art research in this area and their applications to real-world technologies. ",

    "abstract": "This article proposes a mortar type finite element formulation for consistently embedding curved, slender beams, i.e. 1D Cosserat continua, into 3D solid volumes. A consistent 1D-3D coupling scheme for this problem type is proposed, which enforces both positional and rotational constraints. Since Boltzmann continua exhibit no inherent rotational degrees of freedom, suitable definitions of orthonormal triads are investigated that are representative for the orientation of material directions in the 3D solid. The rotation tensor defined by the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient is demonstrated to represent these material directions in a L2-optimal manner. Subsequently, objective rotational coupling constraints between beam and solid are formulated and enforced in a variationally consistent framework. Eventually, finite element discretization of all primary fields results in an embedded mortar formulation for rotational and translational constraint enforcement. Based on carefully chosen numerical test cases, the proposed scheme is demonstrated to exhibit a consistent spatial convergence behavior and to offer the up-scaling potential for studying real-life engineering applications such as fiber-reinforced composite materials.

    "abstract": "Mobile malware are malicious programs that target mobile devices. They are an increasing problem, as seen in the rise of detected mobile malware samples per year. The number of active smartphone users is expected to grow, stressing the importance of research on the detection of mobile malware. Detection methods for mobile malware exist but are still limited. In this paper, we provide an overview of the performance of machine learning (ML) techniques to detect malware on Android, without using privileged access. The ML-classifiers use device information such as the CPU usage, battery usage, and memory usage for the detection of 10 subtypes of Mobile Trojans on the Android Operating System (OS). We use a real-life dataset containing device and malware data from 47 users for a year (2016). We examine which features, i.e. aspects, of a device, are most important to monitor to detect (subtypes of) Mobile Trojans. The focus of this paper is on dynamic hardware features. Using these dynamic features we apply state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, and AdaBoost. We show classification results on different feature sets, making a distinction between global device features, and specific app features. None of the measured feature sets require privileged access. Our results show that the Random Forest classifier performs best as a general malware classifier: across 10 subtypes of Mobile Trojans, it achieves an F1 score of 0.73 with a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.009 and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.380. The Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, and AdaBoost classifiers achieve F1 scores above 0.72, an FPR below 0.02 and, an FNR below 0.33, when trained separately to detect each subtype of Mobile Trojans.

Furthermore, we tested the robustness of our transfer learning strategies under viewpoint and lighting changes using the KTH-Idol2 database. Also, the impact of inference optimization techniques on the general performance and the robustness under different transfer learning strategies is evaluated. Experimental results show that when employing transfer learning, Fine-Tuning in combination with extensive data augmentation improves the general accuracy and robustness in mobile scene recognition. We achieved state-of-the-art results using various baseline convolutional neural networks and showed the robustness against lighting and viewpoint changes in challenging mobile robot place recognition.

    "abstract": "Viewing neural network models in terms of their loss landscapes has a long history in the statistical mechanics approach to learning, and in recent years it has received attention within machine learning proper. Among other things, local metrics (such as the smoothness of the loss landscape) have been shown to correlate with global properties of the model (such as good generalization). Here, we perform a detailed empirical analysis of the loss landscape structure of thousands of neural network models, systematically varying learning tasks, model architectures, and/or quantity/quality of data. By considering a range of metrics that attempt to capture different aspects of the loss landscape, we demonstrate that the best test accuracy is obtained when: the loss landscape is globally well-connected; ensembles of trained models are more similar to each other; and models converge to locally smooth regions. We also show that globally poorly-connected landscapes can arise when models are small or when they are trained to lower quality data; and that, if the loss landscape is globally poorly-connected, then training to zero loss can actually lead to worse test accuracy. Based on these results, we develop a simple one-dimensional model with load-like and temperature-like parameters, we introduce the notion of an \\emph{effective loss landscape} depending on these parameters, and we interpret our results in terms of a \\emph{rugged convexity} of the loss landscape. When viewed through this lens, our detailed empirical results shed light on phases of learning (and consequent double descent behavior), fundamental versus incidental determinants of good generalization, the role of load-like and temperature-like parameters in the learning process, different influences on the loss landscape from model and data, and the relationships between local and global metrics, all topics of recent interest.

We propose an algorithm to factorize the homology embedding into subspaces corresponding to a manifold's simplest topological components.

    "abstract": "Identification of the so-called dynamic networks is one of the most challenging problems appeared recently in control literature. Such systems consist of large-scale interconnected systems, also called modules. To recover full networks dynamics the two crucial steps are topology detection, where one has to infer from data which connections are active, and modules estimation. Since a small percentage of connections are effective in many real systems, the problem finds also fundamental connections with group-sparse estimation. In particular, in the linear setting modules correspond to unknown impulse responses expected to have null norm but in a small fraction of samples. This paper introduces a new Bayesian approach for linear dynamic networks identification where impulse responses are described through the combination of two particular prior distributions. The first one is a block version of the horseshoe prior, a model possessing important global-local shrinkage features. The second one is the stable spline prior, that encodes information on smooth-exponential decay of the modules. The resulting model is called stable spline horseshoe (SSH) prior. It implements aggressive shrinkage of small impulse responses while larger impulse responses are conveniently subject to stable spline regularization. Inference is performed by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme, tailored to the dynamic context and able to efficiently return the posterior of the modules in sampled form. We include numerical studies that show how the new approach can accurately reconstruct sparse networks dynamics also when thousands of unknown impulse response coefficients must be inferred from data sets of relatively small size.
