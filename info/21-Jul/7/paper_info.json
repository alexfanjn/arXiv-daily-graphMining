    "abstract": "Automatic sentiment analysis play vital role in decision making. Many organizations spend a lot of budget to understand their customer satisfaction by manually going over their feedback/comments or tweets. Automatic sentiment analysis can give overall picture of the comments received against any event, product, or activity. Usually, the comments/tweets are classified into two main classes that are negative or positive. However, the negative comments are too abstract to understand the basic reason or the context. organizations are interested to identify the exact reason for the negativity. In this research study, we hierarchically goes down into negative comments, and link them with more classes. Tweets are extracted from social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. If the sentiment analysis classifies any tweet into negative class, then we further try to associates that negative comments with more possible negative classes. Based on expert opinions, the negative comments/tweets are further classified into 8 classes. Different machine learning algorithms are evaluated and their accuracy are reported. ",

    "abstract": "Imperfect labels limit the quality of predictions learned by deep neural networks. This is particularly relevant in medical image segmentation, where reference annotations are difficult to collect and vary significantly even across expert annotators. Prior work on mitigating label noise focused on simple models of mostly uniform noise. In this work, we explore biased and unbiased errors artificially introduced to brain tumour annotations on MRI data. We found that supervised and semi-supervised segmentation methods are robust or fairly robust to unbiased errors but sensitive to biased errors. It is therefore important to identify the sorts of errors expected in medical image labels and especially mitigate the biased errors. ",

    "abstract": "Neural models based on pre-trained transformers, such as BERT or XLM-RoBERTa, demonstrate SOTA results in many NLP tasks, including non-topical classification, such as genre identification. However, often these approaches exhibit low reliability to minor alterations of the test texts. A related probelm concerns topical biases in the training corpus, for example, the prevalence of words on a specific topic in a specific genre can trick the genre classifier to recognise any text on this topic in this genre. In order to mitigate the reliability problem, this paper investigates techniques for attacking genre classifiers to understand the limitations of the transformer models and to improve their performance. While simple text attacks, such as those based on word replacement using keywords extracted by tf-idf, are not capable of deceiving powerful models like XLM-RoBERTa, we show that embedding-based algorithms which can replace some of the most ``significant'' words with words similar to them, for example, TextFooler, have the ability to influence model predictions in a significant proportion of cases.

Directional transmission used to combat the large pathloss of mmWave communications helps to realize the device-to-device (D2D) communication in ultra-dense networks. In this paper, we consider the problem of joint beam selection and link activation across a set of communication pairs in ultra-dense D2D mmWave networks. The resulting optimization problem is formulated as an integer programming problem that is nonconvex and NP-hard problem. Consequently, the global optimal solution, even the local optimal solution, cannot be generally obtained. To overcome this challenge, we resort to design a deep learning architecture based on graphic neural network to finish the joint beam selection and link activation, called as GBLinks model, with taking into account the network topology information. We further present an unsupervised Lagrangian dual learning framework to train the parameters of GBLinks. Numerical results show that the proposed GBLinks model can converges to a stable point with the number of iterations increases, in terms of the average sum rate. It also shows that GBLinks can reach near-optimal solution through comparing with the exhaustively search in small-scale D2D mmWave networks and outperforms selfish beam selection strategy with activating all links.

In the symmetric case, methods depend on the generic equivariant bifurcation theory of irreducible representations of the symmetric group on $n$ symbols, $S_n$; in particular, the standard representation of $S_n$. It is shown that spurious minima do not arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking but rather through a complex deformation of the landscape geometry that can be encoded by a generic $S_n$-equivariant bifurcation. We describe minimal models for forced symmetry breaking that give a lower bound on the dynamic complexity involved in the creation of spurious minima when there is no symmetry. Results on generic bifurcation when there are quadratic equivariants are also proved; this work extends and clarifies results of Ihrig & Golubitsky and Chossat, Lauterback & Melbourne on the instability of solutions when there are quadratic equivariants.

However, the number of possible drug combinations is so huge that it is hard to screen synergistic drug combinations through wet-lab experiments. Therefore, computational screening has become an important way to prioritize drug combinations. Graph neural network have recently shown remarkable performance in the prediction of compound-protein interactions, but it has not been applied to the screening of drug combinations. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning model based on graph neural networks and attention mechanism to identify drug combinations that can effectively inhibit the viability of specific cancer cells. The feature embeddings of drug molecule structure and gene expression profiles were taken as input to multi-layer feedforward neural network to identify the synergistic drug combinations. We compared DeepDDS with classical machine learning methods and other deep learning-based methods on benchmark data set, and the leave-one-out experimental results showed that DeepDDS achieved better performance than competitive methods. Also, on an independent test set released by well-known pharmaceutical enterprise AstraZeneca, DeepDDS was superior to competitive methods by more than 16\\% predictive precision. Furthermore, we explored the interpretability of the graph attention network, and found the correlation matrix of atomic features revealed important chemical substructures of drugs. We believed that DeepDDS is an effective tool that prioritized synergistic drug combinations for further wet-lab experiment validation. ",

Unfortunately, the information necessary to decide on an appropriate reconfiguration - details of on-going and upcoming data transfers such as their source and destination and, most importantly, their volume and duration - is usually lacking. Fortunately, the increased use of scheduled transfer services, such as FTS, makes it possible to collect the necessary information. However, the mere detection and characterisation of larger transfers is not sufficient to predict with confidence the likelihood a network link will become overloaded.

In this work, we propose a new CNN architecture that is pose and scale invariant thanks to the use of Spatial Transformer Network (STN). Our architecture is composed of three sequential modules that are estimated together during training: (i) a regression module to estimate a similarity matrix to normalize the input image to a reference one; (ii) a differentiable module to find the region of interest to segment; (iii) a segmentation module, based on the popular UNet architecture, to delineate the object. Unlike the original UNet, which strives to learn a complex mapping, including pose and scale variations, from a finite training dataset, our segmentation module learns a simpler mapping focusing on images with normalized pose and size. Furthermore, the use of an automatic bounding box detection through STN allows saving time and especially memory, while keeping similar performance. We test the proposed method in kidney and renal tumor segmentation on abdominal pediatric CT scanners. Results indicate that the estimated STN homogenization of size and pose accelerates the segmentation (25h), compared to standard data-augmentation (33h), while obtaining a similar quality for the kidney (88.01\\% of Dice score) and improving the renal tumor delineation (from 85.52\\% to 87.12\\%).

To describe the semantic overlap between strong-correlated predicate classes, a Predicate Correlation Matrix (PCM) is defined to quantify the relationship between predicate pairs, which is dynamically updated to remove the matrix's long-tailed bias. In addition, PCM is integrated into a Predicate Correlation Loss function ($L_{PC}$) to reduce discouraging gradients of unannotated classes. The proposed method is evaluated on Visual Genome benchmark, where the performance of the tail classes is significantly improved when built on the existing methods. ",

Here, we investigate employing deep autoencoders for discovering the reduced basis representation, the dynamics of which are then approximated by NODE. The ability of deep autoencoders to represent the latent-space is compared to the traditional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach, again in conjunction with NODE for capturing the dynamics. Additionally, we compare their behavior with two classical non-intrusive methods based on POD and radial basis function interpolation as well as dynamic mode decomposition. The test problems we consider include incompressible flow around a cylinder as well as a real-world application of shallow water hydrodynamics in an estuarine system. Our findings indicate that deep autoencoders can leverage nonlinear manifold learning to achieve a highly efficient compression of spatial information and define a latent-space that appears to be more suitable for capturing the temporal dynamics through the NODE framework.

To date, most of the proposed methods for DL-SR have only been assessed by use of traditional measures of image quality (IQ) that are commonly employed in the field of computer vision. However, the impact of these methods on objective measures of image quality that are relevant to medical imaging tasks remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of DL-SR methods on binary signal detection performance. Two popular DL-SR methods, the super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and the super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN), were trained by use of simulated medical image data. Binary signal-known-exactly with background-known-statistically (SKE/BKS) and signal-known-statistically with background-known-statistically (SKS/BKS) detection tasks were formulated. Numerical observers, which included a neural network-approximated ideal observer and common linear numerical observers, were employed to assess the impact of DL-SR on task performance. The impact of the complexity of the DL-SR network architectures on task-performance was quantified. In addition, the utility of DL-SR for improving the task-performance of sub-optimal observers was investigated. Our numerical experiments confirmed that, as expected, DL-SR could improve traditional measures of IQ. However, for many of the study designs considered, the DL-SR methods provided little or no improvement in task performance and could even degrade it. It was observed that DL-SR could improve the task-performance of sub-optimal observers under certain conditions. The presented study highlights the urgent need for the objective assessment of DL-SR methods and suggests avenues for improving their efficacy in medical imaging applications. ",

In recent years, several network architectures have been proposed to automate this process and alleviate the burden of manual annotation. Although the performance of these models has achieved promising results, there is still room for improvement before these models can be used safely and effectively in clinical practice. One of the major challenges in prostate MR image segmentation is the presence of class imbalance in the image labels where the background pixels dominate over the prostate. In the present work we propose a DL-based pipeline for cropping the region around the prostate from MRI images to produce a more balanced distribution of the foreground pixels (prostate) and the background pixels and improve segmentation accuracy. The effect of DL-cropping for improving the segmentation performance compared to standard center-cropping is assessed using five popular DL networks for prostate segmentation, namely U-net, U-net+, Res Unet++, Bridge U-net and Dense U-net. The proposed smart-cropping outperformed the standard center cropping in terms of segmentation accuracy for all the evaluated prostate segmentation networks. In terms of Dice score, the highest improvement was achieved for the U-net+ and ResU-net++ architectures corresponding to 8.9% and 8%, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Modelling the process that a listener actuates in deriving the words intended by a speaker requires setting a hypothesis on how lexical items are stored in memory. This work aims at developing a system that imitates humans when identifying words in running speech and, in this way, provide a framework to better understand human speech processing. We build a speech recognizer for Italian based on the principles of Stevens' model of Lexical Access in which words are stored as hierarchical arrangements of distinctive features (Stevens, K. N. (2002). \"Toward a model for lexical access based on acoustic landmarks and distinctive features,\" J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 111(4):1872-1891). Over the past few decades, the Speech Communication Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed a speech recognition system for English based on this approach. Italian will be the first language beyond English to be explored; the extension to another language provides the opportunity to test the hypothesis that words are represented in memory as a set of hierarchically-arranged distinctive features, and reveal which of the underlying mechanisms may have a language-independent nature. This paper also introduces a new Lexical Access corpus, the LaMIT database, created and labeled specifically for this work, that will be provided freely to the speech research community. Future developments will test the hypothesis that specific acoustic discontinuities - called landmarks - that serve as cues to features, are language independent, while other cues may be language-dependent, with powerful implications for understanding how the human brain recognizes speech.
