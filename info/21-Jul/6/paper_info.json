    "abstract": "Solar energy is a clean and renewable energy. Photovoltaic (PV) power is an important way to utilize solar energy. Accurate PV power forecast is crucial to the large-scale application of PV power and the stability of electricity grid. This paper proposes a novel method for short-term photovoltaic power forecast using deep convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network and kernel density estimation (KDE). In the proposed method, ConvLSTM is used to forecast the future photovoltaic power and KDE is used for estimating the joint probabilistic density function and giving the probabilistic confidence interval. Experiments in an actual photovoltaic power station verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison experiments with convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM)shows that ConvLSTM can combine the advantages of both CNN and LSTM and significantly outperform CNN and LSTM in terms of forecast accuracy. Through further comparison with other five conventional methods including multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector regression (SVR), extreme learning machine (ELM), classification and regression tree (CART) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), ConvLSTM can significantly improve the forecast accuracy by more than 20% for most of the five methods and the superiorities of ConvLSTM are further verified.

    "abstract": "Making predictions in a robust way is not easy for nonlinear systems. In this work, a neural network computing framework, i.e., a spatiotemporal convolutional network (STCN), was developed to efficiently and accurately render a multistep-ahead prediction of a time series by employing a spatial-temporal information (STI) transformation. The STCN combines the advantages of both the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and the STI equation, which maps the high-dimensional/spatial data to the future temporal values of a target variable, thus naturally providing the prediction of the target variable. From the observed variables, the STCN also infers the causal factors of the target variable in the sense of Granger causality, which are in turn selected as effective spatial information to improve the prediction robustness. The STCN was successfully applied to both benchmark systems and real-world datasets, all of which show superior and robust performance in multistep-ahead prediction, even when the data were perturbed by noise. From both theoretical and computational viewpoints, the STCN has great potential in practical applications in artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning fields as a model-free method based only on the observed data, and also opens a new way to explore the observed high-dimensional data in a dynamical manner for machine learning.

In particular, the random diffusivity coefficient is described by a finite-dimensional random variable or a truncated combination of random variables with the Karhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve decomposition, then a probabilistic collocation method (PCM) with sparse grids is employed to sample the stochastic process. On each sample, the deterministic nonlocal diffusion problem is discretized with an optimization-based meshfree quadrature rule. We present rigorous analysis for the proposed scheme and demonstrate convergence for a number of benchmark problems, showing that it sustains the asymptotic compatibility spatially and achieves an algebraic or sub-exponential convergence rate in the random coefficients space as the number of collocation points grows. Finally, to validate the applicability of this approach we consider a randomly heterogeneous nonlocal problem with a given spatial correlation structure, demonstrating that the proposed PCM approach achieves substantial speed-up compared to conventional Monte Carlo simulations.

    "abstract": "Deep learning networks generally use non-biological learning methods. By contrast, networks based on more biologically plausible learning, such as Hebbian learning, show comparatively poor performance and difficulties of implementation. Here we show that hierarchical, convolutional Hebbian learning can be implemented almost trivially with modern deep learning frameworks, by using specific losses whose gradients produce exactly the desired Hebbian updates. We provide expressions whose gradients exactly implement a plain Hebbian rule (dw ~= xy), Grossberg's instar rule (dw ~= y(x-w)), and Oja's rule (dw ~= y(x-yw)). As an application, we build Hebbian convolutional multi-layer networks for object recognition. We observe that higher layers of such networks tend to learn large, simple features (Gabor-like filters and blobs), explaining the previously reported decrease in decoding performance over successive layers. To combat this tendency, we introduce interventions (denser activations with sparse plasticity, pruning of connections between layers) which result in sparser learned features, massively increase performance, and allow information to increase over successive layers. We hypothesize that more advanced techniques (dynamic stimuli, trace learning, feedback connections, etc.), together with the massive computational boost offered by modern deep learning frameworks, could greatly improve the performance and biological relevance of multi-layer Hebbian networks.

    "abstract": "Can we use machine learning to compress graph data? The absence of ordering in graphs poses a significant challenge to conventional compression algorithms, limiting their attainable gains as well as their ability to discover relevant patterns. On the other hand, most graph compression approaches rely on domain-dependent handcrafted representations and cannot adapt to different underlying graph distributions. This work aims to establish the necessary principles a lossless graph compression method should follow to approach the entropy storage lower bound. Instead of making rigid assumptions about the graph distribution, we formulate the compressor as a probabilistic model that can be learned from data and generalise to unseen instances. Our \"Partition and Code\" framework entails three steps: first, a partitioning algorithm decomposes the graph into elementary structures, then these are mapped to the elements of a small dictionary on which we learn a probability distribution, and finally, an entropy encoder translates the representation into bits. All three steps are parametric and can be trained with gradient descent. We theoretically compare the compression quality of several graph encodings and prove, under mild conditions, a total ordering of their expected description lengths. Moreover, we show that, under the same conditions, PnC achieves compression gains w.r.t. the baselines that grow either linearly or quadratically with the number of vertices. Our algorithms are quantitatively evaluated on diverse real-world networks obtaining significant performance improvements with respect to different families of non-parametric and parametric graph compressors.

We propose the use of a high-order extended Luenberger-type observer for the plant states, disturbances, and their finite difference variables. Then, a new method for computation of the prediction is proposed which, under certain assumptions, allows for enhanced prediction and consequently improved attenuation of the unknown disturbances. Detailed analysis of the performance of the proposed scheme is carried out, while linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are used for the observer design in order to mitigate the prediction errors. ",

Despite the statistically high accuracy of deep learning models, their output is often a decision of \"black box\". Thus, Interpretability methods have become a popular way to gain insight into the decision-making process of deep learning models. Explanation of a deep learning model is desirable in the medical domain since the experts have to justify their judgments to the patient. In this work, we proposed a method for explanation-guided training that uses a Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique to force the model to focus only on the relevant part of the image. We experimentally verified our method on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for low-grade and high-grade glioma classification problems.

While standard methods aim to form images based upon optical absorption or fluorescent emission, it is also well-established that the temporal correlation of scattered coherent light diffuses through tissue much like optical intensity. Few works to date, however, have aimed to experimentally measure and process such data to demonstrate deep-tissue imaging of decorrelation dynamics. In this work, we take advantage of a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array camera, with over one thousand detectors, to simultaneously detect speckle fluctuations at the single-photon level from 12 different phantom tissue surface locations delivered via a customized fiber bundle array. We then apply a deep neural network to convert the acquired single-photon measurements into video of scattering dynamics beneath rapidly decorrelating liquid tissue phantoms. We demonstrate the ability to record video of dynamic events occurring 5-8 mm beneath a decorrelating tissue phantom with mm-scale resolution and at a 2.5-10 Hz frame rate. ",

    "abstract": "Human social behavior plays a crucial role in how pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 or fake news spread in a population. Social interactions determine the contact network among individuals, while spreading, requiring individual-to-individual transmission, takes place on top of the network. Studying the topological aspects of a contact network, therefore, not only has the potential of leading to valuable insights into how the behavior of individuals impacts spreading phenomena, but it may also open up possibilities for devising effective behavioral interventions. Because of the temporal nature of interactions - since the topology of the network, containing who is in contact with whom, when, for how long, and in which precise sequence, varies (rapidly) in time - analyzing them requires developing network methods and metrics that respect temporal variability, in contrast to those developed for static (i.e., time-invariant) networks. Here, by means of event mapping, we propose a method to quantify how quickly agents mingle by transforming temporal network data of agent contacts. We define a novel measure called 'contact sequence centrality', which quantifies the impact of an individual on the contact sequences, reflecting the individual's behavioral potential for spreading. Comparing contact sequence centrality across agents allows for ranking the impact of agents and identifying potential 'behavioral super-spreaders'. The method is applied to social interaction data collected at an art fair in Amsterdam. We relate the measure to the existing network metrics, both temporal and static, and find that (mostly at longer time scales) traditional metrics lose their resemblance to contact sequence centrality. Our work highlights the importance of accounting for the sequential nature of contacts when analyzing social interactions. ",

Fracture detection is a fundamental task for reservoir characterization. From prestack seismic gathers, anisotropic analysis and inversion were commonly applied to characterize the dominant orientations and relative intensities of fractures. However, the existing methods were mostly based on the vertical aligned facture hypothesis, it is impossible for them to recognize fracture dip. Furthermore, it is difficult or impractical for existing methods to attain the real fracture densities. Based on data-driven deep learning, this paper designed a convolutional neural network to perform prestack fracture detection. Capitalizing on the connections between seismic responses and fracture parameters, a suitable azimuth dataset was firstly generated through fracture effective medium modeling and anisotropic plane wave analyzing. Then a multi-input and multi-output convolutional neural network was constructed to simultaneously detect fracture density, dip and strike azimuth. The application on a practical survey validated the effectiveness of the proposed CNN model. ",

From a statistical point of view, fitting a neural network may be seen as a kind of regression, where we seek a function from the input space to a space of classification probabilities that follows the \"general\" shape of the data, but avoids overfitting by avoiding memorization of individual data points. In statistics, this can be done by controlling the geometric complexity of the regression function. We propose to do something similar when fitting neural networks by controlling the slope of the network. After defining the slope and discussing some of its theoretical properties, we go on to show empirically in examples, using ReLU networks, that the distribution of the slope of a well-trained neural network classifier is generally independent of the width of the layers in a fully connected network, and that the mean of the distribution only has a weak dependence on the model architecture in general. The slope is of similar size throughout the relevant volume, and varies smoothly. It also behaves as predicted in rescaling examples. We discuss possible applications of the slope concept, such as using it as a part of the loss function or stopping criterion during network training, or ranking data sets in terms of their complexity.

Assessing a system's proneness to facilitate spreading phenomena, which we refer to as its spreading vulnerability, from its topological information alone remains a challenging task. We report a methodological advance in terms of a novel metric for topological complexity: 'entanglement entropy'. Using publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that the metric naturally allows for topological comparisons across vastly different systems, and importantly, reveals that the spreading vulnerability of a system can be quantitatively related to its topological complexity. In doing so, the metric opens itself for applications in a wide variety of natural, social, biological and engineered systems. ",

    "abstract": "Spectral embedding of network adjacency matrices often produces node representations living approximately around low-dimensional submanifold structures. In particular, hidden substructure is expected to arise when the graph is generated from a latent position model. Furthermore, the presence of communities within the network might generate community-specific submanifold structures in the embedding, but this is not explicitly accounted for in most statistical models for networks. In this article, a class of models called latent structure block models (LSBM) is proposed to address such scenarios, allowing for graph clustering when community-specific one dimensional manifold structure is present. LSBMs focus on a specific class of latent space model, the random dot product graph (RDPG), and assign a latent submanifold to the latent positions of each community. A Bayesian model for the embeddings arising from LSBMs is discussed, and shown to have a good performance on simulated and real world network data. The model is able to correctly recover the underlying communities living in a one-dimensional manifold, even when the parametric form of the underlying curves is unknown, achieving remarkable results on a variety of real data.
