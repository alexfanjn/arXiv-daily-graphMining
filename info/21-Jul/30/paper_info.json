    "title": "Subsequent embedding in image steganalysis: Theoretical framework and  practical applications",
    "abstract": "Steganalysis is a collection of techniques used to detect whether secret information is embedded in a carrier using steganography. Most of the existing steganalytic methods are based on machine learning, which typically requires training a classifier with \"laboratory\" data. However, applying machine-learning classification to a new source of data is challenging, since there is typically a mismatch between the training and the testing sets. In addition, other sources of uncertainty affect the steganlytic process, including the mismatch between the targeted and the true steganographic algorithms, unknown parameters -- such as the message length -- and even having a mixture of several algorithms and parameters, which would constitute a realistic scenario. This paper presents subsequent embedding as a valuable strategy that can be incorporated into modern steganalysis. Although this solution has been applied in previous works, a theoretical basis for this strategy was missing. Here, we cover this research gap by introducing the \"directionality\" property of features with respect to data embedding. Once this strategy is sustained by a consistent theoretical framework, new practical applications are also described and tested against standard steganography, moving steganalysis closer to real-world conditions.

    "abstract": "Accurate forecasting of solar power generation with fine temporal and spatial resolution is vital for the operation of the power grid. However, state-of-the-art approaches that combine machine learning with numerical weather predictions (NWP) have coarse resolution. In this paper, we take a graph signal processing perspective and model multi-site photovoltaic (PV) production time series as signals on a graph to capture their spatio-temporal dependencies and achieve higher spatial and temporal resolution forecasts. We present two novel graph neural network models for deterministic multi-site PV forecasting dubbed the graph-convolutional long short term memory (GCLSTM) and the graph-convolutional transformer (GCTrafo) models. These methods rely solely on production data and exploit the intuition that PV systems provide a dense network of virtual weather stations. The proposed methods were evaluated in two data sets for an entire year: 1) production data from 304 real PV systems, and 2) simulated production of 1000 PV systems, both distributed over Switzerland. The proposed models outperform state-of-the-art multi-site forecasting methods for prediction horizons of six hours ahead. Furthermore, the proposed models outperform state-of-the-art single-site methods with NWP as inputs on horizons up to four hours ahead. ",

    "abstract": "We describe two formalisms for defining graph languages, and prove that they are equivalent: 1. Separator logic. This is first-order logic on graphs which is allowed to use the edge relation, and for every $n \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots \\}$ a relation of arity $n+2$ which says that ``vertex $s$ can be connected to vertex $t$ by a path that avoids vertices $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$''. 2. Star-free graph expressions. These are expressions that describe graphs with distinguished vertices called ports, and which are built from finite languages via Boolean combinations and the operations on graphs with ports used to construct tree decompositions. Furthermore, we prove a variant of Sch\\\"utzenberger's theorem (about star-free languages being those recognized by a periodic monoids) for graphs of bounded pathwidth. A corollary is that, given $k$ and a graph language represented by an \\mso formula, one can decide if the language can be defined in either of two equivalent formalisms on graphs of pathwidth at most $k$.

    "abstract": "The Computational Metaphor, comparing the brain to the computer and vice versa, is the most prominent metaphor in neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI). Its appropriateness is highly debated in both fields, particularly with regards to whether it is useful for the advancement of science and technology. Considerably less attention, however, has been devoted to how the Computational Metaphor is used outside of the lab, and particularly how it may shape society's interactions with AI. As such, recently publicized concerns over AI's role in perpetuating racism, genderism, and ableism suggest that the term \"artificial intelligence\" is misplaced, and that a new lexicon is needed to describe these computational systems. Thus, there is an essential question about the Computational Metaphor that is rarely asked by neuroscientists: whom does it help and whom does it harm? This essay invites the neuroscience community to consider the social implications of the field's most controversial metaphor. ",

To study the optimal allocation of limited testing and vaccination resources in a heterogeneous contact network of interacting susceptible, recovered, and infected individuals, we present a degree-based testing and vaccination model for which we use control-theoretic methods to derive optimal testing and vaccination policies using control-theoretic methods. Within our framework, we find that optimal intervention policies first target high-degree nodes before shifting to lower-degree nodes in a time-dependent manner. Using such optimal policies, it is possible to delay outbreaks and reduce incidence rates to a greater extent than uniform and reinforcement-learning-based interventions, particularly on certain scale-free networks.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to differentiate malignant and benign mediastinal lesions by using the three-dimensional convolutional neural network through the endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) image. Compared with previous study, our proposed model is robust to noise and able to fuse various imaging features and spatiotemporal features of EBUS videos. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a diagnostic tool for intrathoracic lymph nodes. Physician can observe the characteristics of the lesion using grayscale mode, doppler mode, and elastography during the procedure. To process the EBUS data in the form of a video and appropriately integrate the features of multiple imaging modes, we used a time-series three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) to learn the spatiotemporal features and design a variety of architectures to fuse each imaging mode. Our model (Res3D_UDE) took grayscale mode, Doppler mode, and elastography as training data and achieved an accuracy of 82.00% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 on the validation set. Compared with previous study, we directly used videos recorded during procedure as training and validation data, without additional manual selection, which might be easier for clinical application. In addition, model designed with 3D CNN can also effectively learn spatiotemporal features and improve accuracy. In the future, our model may be used to guide physicians to quickly and correctly find the target lesions for slice sampling during the inspection process, reduce the number of slices of benign lesions, and shorten the inspection time.

    "title": "Day-to-day and seasonal regularity of network passenger delay for metro  networks",
    "abstract": "In an effort to improve user satisfaction and transit image, transit service providers worldwide offer delay compensations. Smart card data enables the estimation of passenger delays throughout the network and aid in monitoring service performance. Notwithstanding, in order to prioritize measures for improving service reliability and hence reducing passenger delays, it is paramount to identify the system components - stations and track segments - where most passenger delay occurs. To this end, we propose a novel method for estimating network passenger delay from individual trajectories. We decompose the delay along a passenger trajectory into its corresponding track segment delay, initial waiting time and transfer delay. We distinguish between two different types of passenger delay in relation to the public transit network: average passenger delay and total passenger delay. We employ temporal clustering on these two quantities to reveal daily and seasonal regularity in delay patterns of the transit network. The estimation and clustering methods are demonstrated on one year of data from Washington metro network. The data consists of schedule information and smart card data which includes passenger-train assignment of the metro network for the months of August 2017 to August 2018. Our findings show that the average passenger delay is relatively stable throughout the day. The temporal clustering reveals pronounced and recurrent and thus predictable daily and weekly patterns with distinct characteristics for certain months. ",
