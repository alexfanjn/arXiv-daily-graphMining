    "abstract": "We propose a novel service framework to detect changes in crowdsourced images. We use a service-oriented approach to model and represent crowdsourced images as image services. Non-functional attributes of an image service are leveraged to detect changes in an image. The changes are reported in form of a version tree. The version tree is constructed in a way that it reflects the extent of changes introduced in different versions. Afterwards, we find semantic differences in between different versions to determine the extent of changes introduced in a specific version. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "Automatically generating function summaries for binaries is an extremely valuable but challenging task, since it involves translating the execution behavior and semantics of the low-level language (assembly code) into human-readable natural language. However, most current works on understanding assembly code are oriented towards generating function names, which involve numerous abbreviations that make them still confusing. To bridge this gap, we focus on generating complete summaries for binary functions, especially for stripped binary (no symbol table and debug information in reality). To fully exploit the semantics of assembly code, we present a control flow graph and pseudo code guided binary code summarization framework called CP-BCS. CP-BCS utilizes a bidirectional instruction-level control flow graph and pseudo code that incorporates expert knowledge to learn the comprehensive binary function execution behavior and logic semantics. We evaluate CP-BCS on 3 different binary optimization levels (O1, O2, and O3) for 3 different computer architectures (X86, X64, and ARM). The evaluation results demonstrate CP-BCS is superior and significantly improves the efficiency of reverse engineering. ",

Recently, some methods aiming for flexible editing static scenes represented by neural radiance field (NeRF) have shown impressive synthesis quality, while similar capabilities in time-variant dynamic scenes remain limited. To solve this problem, we propose 4D-Editor, an interactive semantic-driven editing framework, allowing editing multiple objects in dynamic NeRF based on user strokes on a single frame. Our dynamic scene representation is built upon hybrid semantic feature fields so that the spatial-temporal consistency can be maintained after editing. In addition, we design recursive selection refinement that significantly boosts segmentation accuracy in a dynamic NeRF to aid the editing process. Moreover, we develop multi-view reprojection inpainting to fill holes caused by incomplete scene capture after editing. Extensive experiments and editing examples on real-world demonstrate that 4D-Editor achieves photo-realistic dynamic NeRF editing. Project page: https://patrickddj.github.io/4D-Editor ",

    "abstract": "Signed graph neural networks (SGNNs) has recently drawn more attention as many real-world networks are signed networks containing two types of edges: positive and negative. The existence of negative edges affects the SGNN robustness on two aspects. One is the semantic imbalance as the negative edges are usually hard to obtain though they can provide potentially useful information. The other is the structural unbalance, e.g. unbalanced triangles, an indication of incompatible relationship among nodes. In this paper, we propose a balancing augmentation method to address the above two aspects for SGNNs. Firstly, the utility of each negative edge is measured by calculating its occurrence in unbalanced structures. Secondly, the original signed graph is selectively augmented with the use of (1) an edge perturbation regulator to balance the number of positive and negative edges and to determine the ratio of perturbed edges to original edges and (2) an edge utility filter to remove the negative edges with low utility to make the graph structure more balanced. Finally, a SGNN is trained on the augmented graph which effectively explores the credible relationships. A detailed theoretical analysis is also conducted to prove the effectiveness of each module. Experiments on five real-world datasets in link prediction demonstrate that our method has the advantages of effectiveness and generalization and can significantly improve the performance of SGNN backbones.

We present an approach in which complex tasks are divided into simpler subtasks. Multiple transformer models are fine-tuned to one subtask each, and lined up to accomplish the complex task. This simplifies the compilation of fine-tuning datasets and increases overall controllability.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel multi-bit box-free watermarking method for the protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of GANs with improved robustness against white-box attacks like fine-tuning, pruning, quantization, and surrogate model attacks. The watermark is embedded by adding an extra watermarking loss term during GAN training, ensuring that the images generated by the GAN contain an invisible watermark that can be retrieved by a pre-trained watermark decoder. In order to improve the robustness against white-box model-level attacks, we make sure that the model converges to a wide flat minimum of the watermarking loss term, in such a way that any modification of the model parameters does not erase the watermark. To do so, we add random noise vectors to the parameters of the generator and require that the watermarking loss term is as invariant as possible with respect to the presence of noise. This procedure forces the generator to converge to a wide flat minimum of the watermarking loss. The proposed method is architectureand dataset-agnostic, thus being applicable to many different generation tasks and models, as well as to CNN-based image processing architectures. We present the results of extensive experiments showing that the presence of the watermark has a negligible impact on the quality of the generated images, and proving the superior robustness of the watermark against model modification and surrogate model attacks.

Progress in quality estimation research provides techniques to automatically assess MT quality, but these techniques have primarily been evaluated in vitro by comparison against human judgments outside of a specific context of use. This paper evaluates quality estimation feedback in vivo with a human study simulating decision-making in high-stakes medical settings. Using Emergency Department discharge instructions, we study how interventions based on quality estimation versus backtranslation assist physicians in deciding whether to show MT outputs to a patient. We find that quality estimation improves appropriate reliance on MT, but backtranslation helps physicians detect more clinically harmful errors that QE alone often misses. ",

In this paper, we seek to better understand the role of novelty search and the efficacy of using clustering to discover novel emergent behaviors. Through a large set of experiments and ablations, we analyze the effect of representations, evolutionary search, and various clustering methods in the search for novel behaviors in a heterogeneous swarm. Our results indicate that prior methods fail to discover many interesting behaviors and that an iterative human-in-the-loop discovery process discovers more behaviors than random search, swarm chemistry, and automated behavior discovery. The combined discoveries of our experiments uncover 23 emergent behaviors, 18 of which are novel discoveries.

We propose a data-driven method based on machine learning that leverages the universal function approximation capability of artificial neural networks. We find that our neural network-based compression scheme, based on variational vector quantization, recovers some principles of the optimum theoretical solution of the Wyner-Ziv setup, such as binning in the source space as well as optimal combination of the quantization index and side information, for exemplary sources. These behaviors emerge although no structure exploiting knowledge of the source distributions was imposed.

Existing research in literary fiction analysis explains these real-world phenomena through the manual critical analysis of stories. Conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, including sentiment analysis, narrative summarization, and topic modeling, have demonstrated substantial efficacy in analyzing and identifying similarities within fictional works. However, the intricate dynamics of character interactions within fiction necessitate a more nuanced approach that incorporates visualization techniques. Character interaction graphs (or networks) emerge as a highly suitable means for visualization and information retrieval from the realm of fiction. Therefore, we leverage character interaction graphs with NLP-derived features to explore a diverse spectrum of societal inquiries about contemporary culture's impact on the landscape of literary fiction. Our study involves constructing character interaction graphs from fiction, extracting relevant graph features, and exploiting these features to resolve various real-life queries. Experimental evaluation of influential Bengali fiction over half a century demonstrates that character interaction graphs can be highly effective in specific assessments and information retrieval from literary fiction.

Consequently, techniques based on these feature sets cannot give desired results across domains.

We leverage this connection to obtain new convergence results in large games -- wherein the number of players $n \\gg 1$ -- under the well-documented property of full efficiency via smoothness in the limit. Surprisingly, our framework unifies equilibrium computation in disparate classes of problems including games with vanishing strategic sensitivity and two-player zero-sum games, illuminating en route an immediate but overlooked equivalence between smoothness and a well-studied condition in the optimization literature known as the Minty property. Finally, we establish that a family of no-regret dynamics attains a welfare bound that improves over the smoothness framework while at the same time guaranteeing convergence to the set of coarse correlated equilibria.

A well-designed auxiliary network will produce high-quality predictions when the input segmentations are accurate, but will produce low-quality predictions when the segmentations are incorrect. Checking the predictions of such a network with the original image allows us to detect bad segmentations. However, to ensure the verification method is truly robust, we need a method for checking the quality of the predictions that does not itself rely on a black-box neural network. Indeed, we show that previous methods for segmentation evaluation that do use deep neural regression networks are vulnerable to false negatives i.e. can inaccurately label bad segmentations as good. We describe the design of a verification network that avoids such vulnerability and present results to demonstrate its robustness compared to previous methods. ",

Our hybrid architecture exploits the strengths of both Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) and Transformers to accurately detect PD and determine the severity stage. In particular, we take advantage of ConvNets to capture local patterns and correlations in the data, while we exploit Transformers for handling long-term dependencies in the input signal.

Nevertheless, it faces challenges with limited high-quality labels and non-IID client data, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. To address these hurdles, we navigate the uncharted waters of Semi-Supervised Federated Object Detection (SSFOD). We present a pioneering SSFOD framework, designed for scenarios where labeled data reside only at the server while clients possess unlabeled data. Notably, our method represents the inaugural implementation of SSFOD for clients with 0% labeled non-IID data, a stark contrast to previous studies that maintain some subset of labels at each client. We propose FedSTO, a two-stage strategy encompassing Selective Training followed by Orthogonally enhanced full-parameter training, to effectively address data shift (e.g. weather conditions) between server and clients. Our contributions include selectively refining the backbone of the detector to avert overfitting, orthogonality regularization to boost representation divergence, and local EMA-driven pseudo label assignment to yield high-quality pseudo labels. Extensive validation on prominent autonomous driving datasets (BDD100K, Cityscapes, and SODA10M) attests to the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating state-of-the-art results. Remarkably, FedSTO, using just 20-30% of labels, performs nearly as well as fully-supervised centralized training methods. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Network (GNN) research has produced strategies to modify a graph's edges using gradients from a trained GNN, with the goal of network design. However, the factors which govern gradient-based editing are understudied, obscuring why edges are chosen and if edits are grounded in an edge's importance. Thus, we begin by analyzing the gradient computation in previous works, elucidating the factors that influence edits and highlighting the potential over-reliance on structural properties. Specifically, we find that edges can achieve high gradients due to structural biases, rather than importance, leading to erroneous edits when the factors are unrelated to the design task. To improve editing, we propose ORE, an iterative editing method that (a) edits the highest scoring edges and (b) re-embeds the edited graph to refresh gradients, leading to less biased edge choices. We empirically study ORE through a set of proposed design tasks, each with an external validation method, demonstrating that ORE improves upon previous methods by up to 50%. ",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenging problem of open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) where an object detector must identify both seen and unseen classes in test images without labeled examples of the unseen classes in training. A typical approach for OVOD is to use joint text-image embeddings of CLIP to assign box proposals to their closest text label. However, this method has a critical issue: many low-quality boxes, such as over- and under-covered-object boxes, have the same similarity score as high-quality boxes since CLIP is not trained on exact object location information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, LP-OVOD, that discards low-quality boxes by training a sigmoid linear classifier on pseudo labels retrieved from the top relevant region proposals to the novel text. Experimental results on COCO affirm the superior performance of our approach over the state of the art, achieving $\\textbf{40.5}$ in $\\text{AP}_{novel}$ using ResNet50 as the backbone and without external datasets or knowing novel classes during training.

Experiments show improved model calibration, i.e., with TTA, model confidence better reflects prediction accuracy. Improvements in prediction accuracy are observed for some models, but for other models, TTA leads to degradation. Error analysis identifies the difficulty of producing high-quality prompt variations as the main challenge for TTA. ",

To bridge this gap, we propose an Explainable Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STExplainer) framework that enhances STGNNs with inherent explainability, enabling them to provide accurate predictions and faithful explanations simultaneously. Our framework integrates a unified spatio-temporal graph attention network with a positional information fusion layer as the STG encoder and decoder, respectively.

    "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for ensuring the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world scenarios. While previous research has predominantly investigated the disparity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data through forward information analysis, the discrepancy in parameter gradients during the backward process of DNNs has received insufficient attention. Existing studies on gradient disparities mainly focus on the utilization of gradient norms, neglecting the wealth of information embedded in gradient directions. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into leveraging the entirety of gradient information for OOD detection. The primary challenge arises from the high dimensionality of gradients due to the large number of network parameters. To solve this problem, we propose performing linear dimension reduction on the gradient using a designated subspace that comprises principal components. This innovative technique enables us to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the gradient with minimal information loss. Subsequently, by integrating the reduced gradient with various existing detection score functions, our approach demonstrates superior performance across a wide range of detection tasks. For instance, on the ImageNet benchmark, our method achieves an average reduction of 11.15% in the false positive rate at 95% recall (FPR95) compared to the current state-of-the-art approach.

In this article, we explore the connections among reachability, control invariance, and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) by examining the forward reachability problem associated with control invariant sets. We present the notion of an \"inevitable Forward Reachable Tube\" (FRT) as a tool for analyzing control invariant sets. Our findings show that the inevitable FRT of a robust control invariant set with a differentiable boundary is the set itself. We highlight the role of the differentiability of the boundary in shaping the FRTs of the sets through numerical examples. We also formulate a zero-sum differential game between the control and disturbance, where the inevitable FRT is characterized by the zero-superlevel set of the value function. By incorporating a discount factor in the cost function of the game, the barrier constraint of the CBF naturally arises as the constraint that is imposed on the optimal control policy. As a result, the value function of our FRT formulation serves as a CBF-like function, which has not been previously realized in reachability studies. Conversely, any valid CBF is also a forward reachability value function inside the control invariant set, thereby revealing the inverse optimality of the CBF. As such, our work establishes a strong link between reachability, control invariance, and CBFs, filling a gap that prior formulations based on backward reachability were unable to bridge. ",

    "abstract": "Tone mapping aims to convert high dynamic range (HDR) images to low dynamic range (LDR) representations, a critical task in the camera imaging pipeline. In recent years, 3-Dimensional LookUp Table (3D LUT) based methods have gained attention due to their ability to strike a favorable balance between enhancement performance and computational efficiency. However, these methods often fail to deliver satisfactory results in local areas since the look-up table is a global operator for tone mapping, which works based on pixel values and fails to incorporate crucial local information. To this end, this paper aims to address this issue by exploring a novel strategy that integrates global and local operators by utilizing closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. Specifically, we employ image-adaptive 3D LUTs to manipulate the tone in the low-frequency image by leveraging the specific characteristics of the frequency information. Furthermore, we utilize local Laplacian filters to refine the edge details in the high-frequency components in an adaptive manner. Local Laplacian filters are widely used to preserve edge details in photographs, but their conventional usage involves manual tuning and fixed implementation within camera imaging pipelines or photo editing tools. We propose to learn parameter value maps progressively for local Laplacian filters from annotated data using a lightweight network. Our model achieves simultaneous global tone manipulation and local edge detail preservation in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "In the problem of quickest change detection, a change occurs at some unknown time in the distribution of a sequence of random vectors that are monitored in real time, and the goal is to detect this change as quickly as possible subject to a certain false alarm constraint. In this work we consider this problem in the presence of parametric uncertainty in the post-change regime and controlled sensing. That is, the post-change distribution contains an unknown parameter, and the distribution of each observation, before and after the change, is affected by a control action. In this context, in addition to a stopping rule that determines the time at which it is declared that the change has occurred, one also needs to determine a sequential control policy, which chooses the control action at each time based on the already collected observations. We formulate this problem mathematically using Lorden's minimax criterion, and assuming that there are finitely many possible actions and post-change parameter values. We then propose a specific procedure for this problem that employs an adaptive CuSum statistic in which (i) the estimate of the parameter is based on a fixed number of the more recent observations, and (ii) each action is selected to maximize the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the next observation based on the current parameter estimate, apart from a small number of exploration times. We show that this procedure, which we call the Windowed Chernoff-CuSum (WCC), is first-order asymptotically optimal under Lorden's minimax criterion, for every possible possible value of the unknown post-change parameter, as the mean time to false alarm goes to infinity. We also provide simulation results to illustrate the performance of the WCC procedure. ",

    "abstract": "Understanding neural networks is challenging in part because of the dense, continuous nature of their hidden states. We explore whether we can train neural networks to have hidden states that are sparse, discrete, and more interpretable by quantizing their continuous features into what we call codebook features. Codebook features are produced by finetuning neural networks with vector quantization bottlenecks at each layer, producing a network whose hidden features are the sum of a small number of discrete vector codes chosen from a larger codebook. Surprisingly, we find that neural networks can operate under this extreme bottleneck with only modest degradation in performance. This sparse, discrete bottleneck also provides an intuitive way of controlling neural network behavior: first, find codes that activate when the desired behavior is present, then activate those same codes during generation to elicit that behavior. We validate our approach by training codebook Transformers on several different datasets. First, we explore a finite state machine dataset with far more hidden states than neurons. In this setting, our approach overcomes the superposition problem by assigning states to distinct codes, and we find that we can make the neural network behave as if it is in a different state by activating the code for that state. Second, we train Transformer language models with up to 410M parameters on two natural language datasets. We identify codes in these models representing diverse, disentangled concepts (ranging from negative emotions to months of the year) and find that we can guide the model to generate different topics by activating the appropriate codes during inference. Overall, codebook features appear to be a promising unit of analysis and control for neural networks and interpretability.

EMMA-X unifies the cross-lingual representation learning task and an extra semantic relation prediction task within an EM framework.

To evaluate EMMA-X, we conduct experiments on XRETE, a newly introduced benchmark containing 12 widely studied cross-lingual tasks that fully depend on sentence-level representations. Results reveal that EMMA-X achieves state-of-the-art performance. Further geometric analysis of the built representation space with three requirements demonstrates the superiority of EMMA-X over advanced models. ",

Recent marker-based pipeline models achieve state-of-the-art performance, but still suffer from the error propagation issue.

To alleviate error propagation,we use a high-recall pruner mechanism to transfer the burden of entity identification and labeling from the NER module to the joint module of our model. For higher-order modeling, we build a hypergraph, where nodes are entities (provided by the span pruner) and relations thereof, and hyperedges encode interactions between two different relations or between a relation and its associated subject and object entities. We then run a hypergraph neural network for higher-order inference by applying message passing over the built hypergraph. Experiments on three widely used benchmarks (\\acef{}, \\ace{} and \\scierc{}) for ERE task show significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art PL-marker. ",

    "abstract": "In some settings neural networks exhibit a phenomenon known as grokking, where they achieve perfect or near-perfect accuracy on the validation set long after the same performance has been achieved on the training set. In this paper, we discover that grokking is not limited to neural networks but occurs in other settings such as Gaussian process (GP) classification, GP regression and linear regression. We also uncover a mechanism by which to induce grokking on algorithmic datasets via the addition of dimensions containing spurious information. The presence of the phenomenon in non-neural architectures provides evidence that grokking is not specific to SGD or weight norm regularisation. Instead, grokking may be possible in any setting where solution search is guided by complexity and error. Based on this insight and further trends we see in the training trajectories of a Bayesian neural network (BNN) and GP regression model, we make progress towards a more general theory of grokking. Specifically, we hypothesise that the phenomenon is governed by the accessibility of certain regions in the error and complexity landscapes. ",

To accomplish the seamless integration between terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, substantial changes in radio access network (RAN) architecture are required. These changes involve the development of new RAN solutions that can efficiently manage the diverse characteristics of both terrestrial and non-terrestrial components, ensuring smooth handovers, resource allocation, and quality of service across the integrated network ecosystem.

    "abstract": "A network intrusion usually involves a number of network locations. Data flow (including the data generated by intrusion behaviors) among these locations (usually represented by IP addresses) naturally forms a graph. Thus, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been used in the construction of intrusion detection models in recent years since they have an excellent ability to capture graph topological features of intrusion data flow. However, existing GNN models treat node mean aggregation equally in node information aggregation. In reality, the correlations of nodes and their neighbors as well as the linked edges are different. Assigning higher weights to nodes and edges with high similarity can highlight the correlation among them, which will enhance the accuracy and expressiveness of the model. To this end, this paper proposes novel Edge-Directed Graph Multi-Head Attention Networks (EDGMAT) for network intrusion detection. The proposed EDGMAT model introduces a multi-head attention mechanism into the intrusion detection model. Additional weight learning is realized through the combination of a multi-head attention mechanism and edge features. Weighted aggregation makes better use of the relationship between different network traffic data. Experimental results on four recent NIDS benchmark datasets show that the performance of EDGMAT in terms of weighted F1-Score is significantly better than that of four state-of-the-art models in multi-class detection tasks.

    "abstract": "Association rule mining techniques can generate a large volume of sequential data when implemented on transactional databases. Extracting insights from a large set of association rules has been found to be a challenging process. When examining a ruleset, the fundamental question is how to summarise and represent meaningful mined knowledge efficiently. Many algorithms and strategies have been developed to address issue of knowledge extraction; however, the effectiveness of this process can be limited by the data structures. A better data structure can sufficiently affect the speed of the knowledge extraction process. This paper proposes a novel data structure, called the Trie of rules, for storing a ruleset that is generated by association rule mining. The resulting data structure is a prefix-tree graph structure made of pre-mined rules. This graph stores the rules as paths within the prefix-tree in a way that similar rules overlay each other. Each node in the tree represents a rule where a consequent is this node, and an antecedent is a path from this node to the root of the tree. The evaluation showed that the proposed representation technique is promising. It compresses a ruleset with almost no data loss and benefits in terms of time for basic operations such as searching for a specific rule and sorting, which is the base for many knowledge discovery methods. Moreover, our method demonstrated a significant improvement in traversing time, achieving an 8-fold increase compared to traditional data structures. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce an SE(3) diffusion model-based point cloud registration framework for 6D object pose estimation in real-world scenarios. Our approach formulates the 3D registration task as a denoising diffusion process, which progressively refines the pose of the source point cloud to obtain a precise alignment with the model point cloud. Training our framework involves two operations: An SE(3) diffusion process and an SE(3) reverse process. The SE(3) diffusion process gradually perturbs the optimal rigid transformation of a pair of point clouds by continuously injecting noise (perturbation transformation). By contrast, the SE(3) reverse process focuses on learning a denoising network that refines the noisy transformation step-by-step, bringing it closer to the optimal transformation for accurate pose estimation. Unlike standard diffusion models used in linear Euclidean spaces, our diffusion model operates on the SE(3) manifold. This requires exploiting the linear Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{se}(3)$ associated with SE(3) to constrain the transformation transitions during the diffusion and reverse processes. Additionally, to effectively train our denoising network, we derive a registration-specific variational lower bound as the optimization objective for model learning. Furthermore, we show that our denoising network can be constructed with a surrogate registration model, making our approach applicable to different deep registration networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our diffusion registration framework presents outstanding pose estimation performance on the real-world TUD-L, LINEMOD, and Occluded-LINEMOD datasets. ",

Existing approaches tackle different learning tasks independently, tailoring their models to unique task characteristics. These methods, however, fall short of modeling intrinsic uncertainties in the spatio-temporal data. Meanwhile, their specialized designs limit their universality as general spatio-temporal learning solutions. In this paper, we propose to model the learning tasks in a unified perspective, viewing them as predictions based on conditional information with shared spatio-temporal patterns. Based on this proposal, we introduce Unified Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models (USTD) to address the tasks uniformly within the uncertainty-aware diffusion framework. USTD is holistically designed, comprising a shared spatio-temporal encoder and attention-based denoising networks that are task-specific. The shared encoder, optimized by a pre-training strategy, effectively captures conditional spatio-temporal patterns. The denoising networks, utilizing both cross- and self-attention, integrate conditional dependencies and generate predictions. Opting for forecasting and kriging as downstream tasks, we design Gated Attention (SGA) and Temporal Gated Attention (TGA) for each task, with different emphases on the spatial and temporal dimensions, respectively. By combining the advantages of deterministic encoders and probabilistic diffusion models, USTD achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to deterministic and probabilistic baselines in both tasks, while also providing valuable uncertainty estimates.

Recently, a new paradigm \"pre-train, prompt\" has shown promising results in adapting GNNs to various tasks with less supervised data. The success of such paradigm can be attributed to the more consistent objectives of pre-training and task-oriented prompt tuning, where the pre-trained knowledge can be effectively transferred to downstream tasks. However, an overlooked issue of existing studies is that the structure information of graph is usually exploited during pre-training for learning node representations, while neglected in the prompt tuning stage for learning task-specific parameters. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel structure-based prompting method for GNNs, namely SAP, which consistently exploits structure information in both pre-training and prompt tuning stages. In particular, SAP 1) employs a dual-view contrastive learning to align the latent semantic spaces of node attributes and graph structure, and 2) incorporates structure information in prompted graph to elicit more pre-trained knowledge in prompt tuning. We conduct extensive experiments on node classification and graph classification tasks to show the effectiveness of SAP. Moreover, we show that SAP can lead to better performance in more challenging few-shot scenarios on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs. ",

Therefore, they pose a realistic threat to real-world motion detection and its downstream applications. Potential remedies are defense strategies that detect and remove adversarial patches, but their influence on the underlying motion prediction has not been investigated. In this paper, we thoroughly examine the currently available detect-and-remove defenses ILP and LGS for a wide selection of state-of-the-art optical flow methods, and illuminate their side effects on the quality and robustness of the final flow predictions. In particular, we implement defense-aware attacks to investigate whether current defenses are able to withstand attacks that take the defense mechanism into account. Our experiments yield two surprising results: Detect-and-remove defenses do not only lower the optical flow quality on benign scenes, in doing so, they also harm the robustness under patch attacks for all tested optical flow methods except FlowNetC.

    "abstract": "Invariances in neural networks are useful and necessary for many tasks. However, the representation of the invariance of most neural network models has not been characterized. We propose measures to quantify the invariance of neural networks in terms of their internal representation. The measures are efficient and interpretable, and can be applied to any neural network model. They are also more sensitive to invariance than previously defined measures. We validate the measures and their properties in the domain of affine transformations and the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets, including their stability and interpretability. Using the measures, we perform a first analysis of CNN models and show that their internal invariance is remarkably stable to random weight initializations, but not to changes in dataset or transformation. We believe the measures will enable new avenues of research in invariance representation. ",

The IDS is composed of supervised and unsupervised modules, namely, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, respectively. The proposed system is near-autonomous since the intervention of the expert is minimized through the active learning (AL) approach. A query strategy for the labeling process is presented, it aims at teaching the supervised module to detect unknown attacks and improve the detection of the already-known attacks. This teaching is achieved through sliding windows (SW) in an incremental fashion where the DNN is retrained when the data is available over time, thus rendering the IDS adaptive to cope with the evolutionary aspect of the network traffic. A set of experiments was conducted on the CICIDS2017 dataset in order to evaluate the performance of the IDS, promising results were obtained. ",

The main challenges are two-fold: one is symbol assignment, i.e. bonding latent factors of neural visual generators with meaningful symbols from knowledge reasoning systems. Another is rule learning, i.e. learning new rules, which govern the generative process of the data, to augment the knowledge reasoning systems. To deal with these symbol grounding problems, we propose a neural-symbolic learning approach, Abductive Visual Generation (AbdGen), for integrating logic programming systems with neural visual generative models based on the abductive learning framework. To achieve reliable and efficient symbol assignment, the quantized abduction method is introduced for generating abduction proposals by the nearest-neighbor lookups within semantic codebooks. To achieve precise rule learning, the contrastive meta-abduction method is proposed to eliminate wrong rules with positive cases and avoid less-informative rules with negative cases simultaneously. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets show that compared to the baselines, AbdGen requires significantly fewer instance-level labeling information for symbol assignment. Furthermore, our approach can effectively learn underlying logical generative rules from data, which is out of the capability of existing approaches. ",

In our BNCDE, the time dimension is modeled through a coupled system of neural controlled differential equations and neural stochastic differential equations, where the neural stochastic differential equations allow for tractable variational Bayesian inference. Thereby, for an assigned sequence of treatments, our BNCDE provides meaningful posterior predictive distributions of the potential outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first tailored neural method to provide uncertainty estimates of treatment effects in continuous time.

Existing approaches to interpreting the actions taking place within a video clip are based upon Temporal Action Localisation (TAL), which typically identifies short-term actions. The emerging field of Complex Activity Detection (CompAD) extends this analysis to long-term activities, with a deeper understanding obtained by modelling the internal structure of a complex activity taking place within the video. We address the CompAD problem using a hybrid graph neural network which combines attention applied to a graph encoding the local (short-term) dynamic scene with a temporal graph modelling the overall long-duration activity. Our approach is as follows: i) Firstly, we propose a novel feature extraction technique which, for each video snippet, generates spatiotemporal `tubes' for the active elements (`agents') in the (local) scene by detecting individual objects, tracking them and then extracting 3D features from all the agent tubes as well as the overall scene. ii) Next, we construct a local scene graph where each node (representing either an agent tube or the scene) is connected to all other nodes. Attention is then applied to this graph to obtain an overall representation of the local dynamic scene. iii) Finally, all local scene graph representations are interconnected via a temporal graph, to estimate the complex activity class together with its start and end time. The proposed framework outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods on all three datasets including ActivityNet-1.3, Thumos-14, and ROAD. ",

During testing, samples embedded with a backdoor trigger will be misclassified as an adversarial target by a backdoored model, while samples without the backdoor trigger will be correctly classified. In this paper, we present the first certified backdoor detector (CBD), which is based on a novel, adjustable conformal prediction scheme based on our proposed statistic local dominant probability. For any classifier under inspection, CBD provides 1) a detection inference, 2) the condition under which the attacks are guaranteed to be detectable for the same classification domain, and 3) a probabilistic upper bound for the false positive rate. Our theoretical results show that attacks with triggers that are more resilient to test-time noise and have smaller perturbation magnitudes are more likely to be detected with guarantees. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets considering various backdoor types, such as BadNet, CB, and Blend. CBD achieves comparable or even higher detection accuracy than state-of-the-art detectors, and it in addition provides detection certification. Notably, for backdoor attacks with random perturbation triggers bounded by $\\ell_2\\leq0.75$ which achieves more than 90\\% attack success rate, CBD achieves 100\\% (98\\%), 100\\% (84\\%), 98\\% (98\\%), and 72\\% (40\\%) empirical (certified) detection true positive rates on the four benchmark datasets GTSRB, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and TinyImageNet, respectively, with low false positive rates.

At the edge, dynamic computing requests require advanced resource management for adaptive network slicing, including resource allocations, function scaling and load balancing to utilize only the necessary resources in resource-constraint networks. Recent solutions are designed for a static number of slices. Therefore, the painful process of optimization is required again with any update on the number of slices. In addition, these solutions intend to maximize instant rewards, neglecting long-term resource scheduling. Unlike these efforts, we propose an algorithmic approach based on multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) for optimizing resource management for edge network slicing. Our objective is two-fold: (i) maximizing long-term network slicing benefits in terms of delay and energy consumption, and (ii) adapting to slice number changes. Through simulations, we demonstrate that MADDPG outperforms benchmark solutions including a static slicing-based one from the literature, achieving stable and high long-term performance. Additionally, we leverage incremental learning to facilitate a dynamic number of edge slices, with enhanced performance compared to pre-trained base models. Remarkably, this approach yields superior reward performance while saving approximately 90% of training time costs. ",

    "abstract": "Numerous works study black-box attacks on image classifiers. However, these works make different assumptions on the adversary's knowledge and current literature lacks a cohesive organization centered around the threat model. To systematize knowledge in this area, we propose a taxonomy over the threat space spanning the axes of feedback granularity, the access of interactive queries, and the quality and quantity of the auxiliary data available to the attacker. Our new taxonomy provides three key insights. 1) Despite extensive literature, numerous under-explored threat spaces exist, which cannot be trivially solved by adapting techniques from well-explored settings. We demonstrate this by establishing a new state-of-the-art in the less-studied setting of access to top-k confidence scores by adapting techniques from well-explored settings of accessing the complete confidence vector, but show how it still falls short of the more restrictive setting that only obtains the prediction label, highlighting the need for more research. 2) Identification the threat model of different attacks uncovers stronger baselines that challenge prior state-of-the-art claims. We demonstrate this by enhancing an initially weaker baseline (under interactive query access) via surrogate models, effectively overturning claims in the respective paper. 3) Our taxonomy reveals interactions between attacker knowledge that connect well to related areas, such as model inversion and extraction attacks. We discuss how advances in other areas can enable potentially stronger black-box attacks. Finally, we emphasize the need for a more realistic assessment of attack success by factoring in local attack runtime. This approach reveals the potential for certain attacks to achieve notably higher success rates and the need to evaluate attacks in diverse and harder settings, highlighting the need for better selection criteria.

In this work, we introduce a novel graph SPectral Alignment (SPA) framework to tackle the tradeoff.

On standardized benchmarks, the extensive experiments of SPA demonstrate that its performance has surpassed the existing cutting-edge DA methods.

But the pros and cons of these different embeddings were not yet well studied. Therefore, we want to study the impact of the program logic's embedding on logic's proof rules in this paper. This paper considers a set of useful extended proof rules, and four different logic embeddings: one deep embedding and three common shallow embeddings. We prove the validity of these extended rules under these embeddings and discuss their main challenges. Furthermore, we propose a method to lift existing shallowly embedded logics to deeply embedded ones to greatly simplify proofs of extended rules in specific proof systems. We evaluate our results on two existing verification tools. We lift the originally shallowly embedded VST to our deeply embedded VST to support extended rules, and we implement Iris-CF and deeply embedded Iris-Imp based on the Iris framework to evaluate our theory in real verification projects.

Nevertheless, when facing the long-tailed distribution in real-world applications, it is still hard for existing methods to capture transferable and robust representation.

To address this problem, we propose a novel Geometric Harmonization (GH) method to encourage category-level uniformity in representation learning, which is more benign to the minority and almost does not hurt the majority under long-tailed distribution. Specially, GH measures the population statistics of the embedding space on top of self-supervised learning, and then infer an fine-grained instance-wise calibration to constrain the space expansion of head classes and avoid the passive collapse of tail classes. Our proposal does not alter the setting of SSL and can be easily integrated into existing methods in a low-cost manner. Extensive results on a range of benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of GH with high tolerance to the distribution skewness.

    "abstract": "Instruction-based language modeling has received significant attention in pretrained language models. However, the efficiency of instruction engineering remains low and hinders the development of instruction studies. Recent studies have focused on automating instruction generation, but they primarily aim to improve performance without considering other crucial objectives that impact instruction quality, such as instruction length and perplexity. Therefore, we propose a novel approach (i.e., InstOptima) that treats instruction generation as an evolutionary multi-objective optimization problem. In contrast to text edition-based methods, our approach utilizes a large language model (LLM) to simulate instruction operators, including mutation and crossover. Furthermore, we introduce an objective-guided mechanism for these operators, allowing the LLM to comprehend the objectives and enhance the quality of the generated instructions. Experimental results demonstrate improved fine-tuning performance and the generation of a diverse set of high-quality instructions. ",

    "abstract": "Concerns about data privacy are omnipresent, given the increasing usage of digital applications and their underlying business model that includes selling user data. Location data is particularly sensitive since they allow us to infer activity patterns and interests of users, e.g., by categorizing visited locations based on nearby points of interest (POI). On top of that, machine learning methods provide new powerful tools to interpret big data. In light of these considerations, we raise the following question: What is the actual risk that realistic, machine learning based privacy attacks can obtain meaningful semantic information from raw location data, subject to inaccuracies in the data? In response, we present a systematic analysis of two attack scenarios, namely location categorization and user profiling. Experiments on the Foursquare dataset and tracking data demonstrate the potential for abuse of high-quality spatial information, leading to a significant privacy loss even with location inaccuracy of up to 200m. With location obfuscation of more than 1 km, spatial information hardly adds any value, but a high privacy risk solely from temporal information remains. The availability of public context data such as POIs plays a key role in inference based on spatial information. Our findings point out the risks of ever-growing databases of tracking data and spatial context data, which policymakers should consider for privacy regulations, and which could guide individuals in their personal location protection measures.

    "title": "Defending Against Transfer Attacks From Public Models",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks have been a looming and unaddressed threat in the industry. However, through a decade-long history of the robustness evaluation literature, we have learned that mounting a strong or optimal attack is challenging. It requires both machine learning and domain expertise. In other words, the white-box threat model, religiously assumed by a large majority of the past literature, is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a new practical threat model where the adversary relies on transfer attacks through publicly available surrogate models. We argue that this setting will become the most prevalent for security-sensitive applications in the future. We evaluate the transfer attacks in this setting and propose a specialized defense method based on a game-theoretic perspective. The defenses are evaluated under 24 public models and 11 attack algorithms across three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet). Under this threat model, our defense, PubDef, outperforms the state-of-the-art white-box adversarial training by a large margin with almost no loss in the normal accuracy. For instance, on ImageNet, our defense achieves 62% accuracy under the strongest transfer attack vs only 36% of the best adversarially trained model. Its accuracy when not under attack is only 2% lower than that of an undefended model (78% vs 80%). We release our code at https://github.com/wagner-group/pubdef. ",

    "abstract": "Detection of anomalous events in videos is an important problem in applications such as surveillance. Video anomaly detection (VAD) is well-studied in the one-class classification (OCC) and weakly supervised (WS) settings. However, fully unsupervised (US) video anomaly detection methods, which learn a complete system without any annotation or human supervision, have not been explored in depth. This is because the lack of any ground truth annotations significantly increases the magnitude of the VAD challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a simple-but-effective two-stage pseudo-label generation framework that produces segment-level (normal/anomaly) pseudo-labels, which can be further used to train a segment-level anomaly detector in a supervised manner. The proposed coarse-to-fine pseudo-label (C2FPL) generator employs carefully-designed hierarchical divisive clustering and statistical hypothesis testing to identify anomalous video segments from a set of completely unlabeled videos. The trained anomaly detector can be directly applied on segments of an unseen test video to obtain segment-level, and subsequently, frame-level anomaly predictions. Extensive studies on two large-scale public-domain datasets, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised approach achieves superior performance compared to all existing OCC and US methods , while yielding comparable performance to the state-of-the-art WS methods.

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is at the core of personalized decision making. While there is a plethora of models for CATE estimation, model selection is a nontrivial task, due to the fundamental problem of causal inference. Recent empirical work provides evidence in favor of proxy loss metrics with double robust properties and in favor of model ensembling. However, theoretical understanding is lacking. Direct application of prior theoretical work leads to suboptimal oracle model selection rates due to the non-convexity of the model selection problem. We provide regret rates for the major existing CATE ensembling approaches and propose a new CATE model ensembling approach based on Q-aggregation using the doubly robust loss. Our main result shows that causal Q-aggregation achieves statistically optimal oracle model selection regret rates of $\\frac{\\log(M)}{n}$ (with $M$ models and $n$ samples), with the addition of higher-order estimation error terms related to products of errors in the nuisance functions. Crucially, our regret rate does not require that any of the candidate CATE models be close to the truth. We validate our new method on many semi-synthetic datasets and also provide extensions of our work to CATE model selection with instrumental variables and unobserved confounding. ",

Both approaches enable sampling and density estimation of conditional probability distributions, which are core tasks in Bayesian inference. Our methods represent the target conditional distributions as transformations of a tractable reference distribution and, therefore, fall into the framework of measure transport. COT maps are a canonical choice within this framework, with desirable properties such as uniqueness and monotonicity. However, the associated COT problems are computationally challenging, even in moderate dimensions. To improve the scalability, our numerical algorithms leverage neural networks to parameterize COT maps. Our methods exploit the structure of the static and dynamic formulations of the COT problem. PCP-Map models conditional transport maps as the gradient of a partially input convex neural network (PICNN) and uses a novel numerical implementation to increase computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. COT-Flow models conditional transports via the flow of a regularized neural ODE; it is slower to train but offers faster sampling. We demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency by comparing them with state-of-the-art approaches using benchmark datasets and Bayesian inverse problems. ",

Several AI models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), and Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), have been assessed with various data types. Earlier studies highlighted the combination of the YOLO object detector and a linear Kalman filter for object detection and tracking. Building on this, our project introduces CosmosDSR, a novel methodology combining YOLOv3 with an Unscented Kalman Filter for tracking satellites in sequential images, compared to a linear Kalman filter. Using the SPARK dataset from the University of Luxembourg for training and testing, the YOLOv3 precisely detected and classified all satellite categories (mAP=97.18%, F1=0.95) with few errors (TP=4163, FP=209, FN=237). Both CosmosDSR and the LKF tracked satellites accurately (UKF: MSE=2.83/RMSE=1.66, LKF: MSE=2.84/RMSE=1.66). Despite concerns of class imbalance and the absence of real images, the model shows promise. Future work should address these limitations, increase tracking sample size, and improve metrics. This research suggests the algorithm's potential in detecting and tracking satellites, paving the way for solutions to the Kessler syndrome. ",

First, we present a novel and very compact modular encoding of a binary multiplier circuit into the Pegasus architecture of current D-Wave QA devices. The key contribution is a compact encoding of a controlled full-adder into an 8-qubit module in the Pegasus topology, which we synthesized offline by means of Optimization Modulo Theories. This allows us to encode up to a 21*12-bit multiplier (and a 22*8-bit one) into the Pegasus 5760-qubit topology of current annealers. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest factorization problems ever encoded into a quantum annealer. Second, we have investigated the problem of actually solving encoded PF problems by running an extensive experimental evaluation on a D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum annealer. In order to help the annealer in reaching the global minimum, in the experiments we introduced different approaches to initialize the multiplier qubits and adopted several performance enhancement techniques. Overall, exploiting all the encoding and solving techniques described in this paper, 8, 219, 999 = 32, 749 * 251 was the highest prime product we were able to factorize within the limits of our QPU resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number which was ever factorized by means of a quantum annealer, and, more generally, by a quantum device. ",
