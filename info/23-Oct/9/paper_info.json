    "abstract": "Biomedical knowledge is growing in an astounding pace with a majority of this knowledge is represented as scientific publications. Text mining tools and methods represents automatic approaches for extracting hidden patterns and trends from this semi structured and unstructured data. In Biomedical Text mining, Literature Based Discovery (LBD) is the process of automatically discovering novel associations between medical terms otherwise mentioned in disjoint literature sets. LBD approaches proven to be successfully reducing the discovery time of potential associations that are hidden in the vast amount of scientific literature. The process focuses on creating concept profiles for medical terms such as a disease or symptom and connecting it with a drug and treatment based on the statistical significance of the shared profiles. This knowledge discovery approach introduced in 1989 still remains as a core task in text mining. Currently the ABC principle based two approaches namely open discovery and closed discovery are mostly explored in LBD process. This review starts with general introduction about text mining followed by biomedical text mining and introduces various literature resources such as MEDLINE, UMLS, MESH, and SemMedDB. This is followed by brief introduction of the core ABC principle and its associated two approaches open discovery and closed discovery in LBD process. This review also discusses the deep learning applications in LBD by reviewing the role of transformer models and neural networks based LBD models and its future aspects. Finally, reviews the key biomedical discoveries generated through LBD approaches in biomedicine and conclude with the current limitations and future directions of LBD. ",

The main idea is to transform the functional data into a 28 by 28 image. We use a specific but typical architecture of a convolutional neural network to perform all the regression exercises of parameter estimation and functional form classification. First, we use some functional case studies of functional data with and without random noise to showcase the strength of the new method. In particular, we use it to estimate exponential growth and decay rates, the bandwidths of sine and cosine functions, and the magnitudes and widths of curve peaks. We also use it to classify the monotonicity and curvatures of functional data, algebraic versus exponential growth, and the number of peaks of functional data. Second, we apply the same convolutional neural networks to Lyapunov exponent estimation in noisy and non-noisy chaotic data, in estimating rates of disease transmission from epidemic curves, and in detecting the similarity of drug dissolution profiles. Finally, we apply the method to real-life data to detect Parkinson's disease patients in a classification problem. The method, although simple, shows high accuracy and is promising for future use in engineering and medical applications. ",

The strategic interactions among the individuals acting independently and selfishly naturally portray a noncooperative game. Nash equilibrium allows for self-enforcing strategic interactions between selfish and self-interested individuals. This paper presents a differential game approach to the opinion formation problem in social networks to investigate the evolution of opinions as a result of a Nash equilibrium. The opinion of each individual is described by a differential equation, which is the continuous-time Hegselmann-Krause model for opinion dynamics with a time delay in input. The objective of each individual is to seek optimal strategies for her own opinion evolution by minimizing an individual cost function. Two differential game problems emerge, one for a population that is not stubborn and another for a population that is stubborn. The open-loop Nash equilibrium actions and their associated opinion trajectories are derived for both differential games using Pontryagin's principle. Additionally, the receding horizon control scheme is used to practice feedback strategies where the information flow is restricted by fixed and complete social graphs as well as the second neighborhood concept. The game strategies were executed on the well-known Zachary's Karate Club social network. The resulting opinion trajectories associated with the game strategies showed consensus, polarization, and disagreement in final opinions. ",

Accurate stock price predictions can help traders make better investment decisions, leading to increased profits. In this article, we trained and tested a Hidden Markov Model for the purpose of predicting a stock closing price based on its opening price and the preceding day's prices.

Through extensive experimentation on six benchmark datasets (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, WildReceipts, XFUND, and DOCILE), we demonstrate that large document foundation models can be effectively fine-tuned for the KIE task under private settings to achieve adequate performance while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Moreover, by thoroughly analyzing the impact of various training and model parameters on model performance, we propose simple yet effective guidelines for achieving an optimal privacy-utility trade-off for the KIE task under global DP. Finally, we introduce FeAm-DP, a novel DP-FL algorithm that enables efficiently upscaling global DP from a standalone context to a multi-client federated environment. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm across various client and privacy settings, and demonstrate its capability to achieve comparable performance and privacy guarantees to standalone DP, even when accommodating an increasing number of participating clients. Overall, our study offers valuable insights into the development of private KIE systems, and highlights the potential of document foundation models for privacy-preserved Document AI applications. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first work that explores privacy preserved document KIE using document foundation models. ",

HandMeThat contains 10,000 episodes of human-robot interactions. In each episode, the robot first observes a trajectory of human actions towards her internal goal. Next, the robot receives a human instruction and should take actions to accomplish the subgoal set through the instruction. In this paper, we present a textual interface for our benchmark, where the robot interacts with a virtual environment through textual commands. We evaluate several baseline models on HandMeThat, and show that both offline and online reinforcement learning algorithms perform poorly on HandMeThat, suggesting significant room for future work on physical and social human-robot communications and interactions.

We show that by adopting a Fishnets aggregation scheme for message passing, GNNs can achieve state-of-the-art performance versus architecture size on ogbn-protein data over existing benchmarks with a fraction of learnable parameters and faster training time.

Yet, without any target annotations, the performance gap between the UDA approaches and the fully-supervised approach is still noticeable, which is impractical for real-world applications. On the other hand, weakly-supervised domain adaptation (WDA) is an underexplored yet practical task that only requires few labeling effort on the target domain. To improve the DA performance in a cost-effective way, we propose a general weak labels guided self-training framework, WLST, designed for WDA on 3D object detection. By incorporating autolabeler, which can generate 3D pseudo labels from 2D bounding boxes, into the existing self-training pipeline, our method is able to generate more robust and consistent pseudo labels that would benefit the training process on the target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and detector-agnosticism of our WLST framework. Notably, it outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on all evaluation tasks. ",

In this paper we propose to learn a neural network-based data representation using a loss function that can be used to project the unlabeled data into two (positive and negative) clusters that can be easily identified using simple clustering techniques, effectively emulating the phenomenon observed in low-dimensional settings. We adopt a vector quantization technique for the learned representations to amplify the separation between the learned unlabeled data clusters.

Current state-of-the-art MI attacks capitalize on access to the model's predicted confidence scores to successfully perform membership inference, and employ data poisoning to further enhance their effectiveness. In this work, we focus on the less explored and more realistic label-only setting, where the model provides only the predicted label on a queried sample. We show that existing label-only MI attacks are ineffective at inferring membership in the low False Positive Rate (FPR) regime.

These deepfakes pose a concerning threat to voice biometrics due to recent advancements in generative AI and speech synthesis technologies.

Therefore, this paper presents Quick-SpoofNet, an approach for detecting both seen and unseen synthetic attacks in the ASV system using one-shot learning and metric learning techniques. By using the effective spectral feature set, the proposed method extracts compact and representative temporal embeddings from the voice samples and utilizes metric learning and triplet loss to assess the similarity index and distinguish different embeddings. The system effectively clusters similar speech embeddings, classifying bona fide speeches as the target class and identifying other clusters as spoofing attacks. The proposed system is evaluated using the ASVspoof 2019 logical access (LA) dataset and tested against unseen deepfake attacks from the ASVspoof 2021 dataset. Additionally, its generalization ability towards unseen bona fide speech is assessed using speech data from the VSDC dataset. ",

Framework suitability hinges on task complexity and computational constraints, demanding a balance between computational efficiency and mission-critical accuracy. This study leverages recent advancements in neuromorphic computing, particularly spiking neural networks (SNNs), for estimation and control applications. Our presented framework employs a recurrent network of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, mimicking a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) through a robust filtering strategy, a modified sliding innovation filter (MSIF). Benefiting from both the robustness of MSIF and the computational efficiency of SNN, our framework customizes SNN weight matrices to match the desired system model without requiring training. Additionally, the network employs a biologically plausible firing rule similar to predictive coding. In the presence of uncertainties, we compare the SNN-LQR-MSIF with non-spiking LQR-MSIF and the optimal linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) strategy. Evaluation across a workbench linear problem and a satellite rendezvous maneuver, implementing the Clohessy-Wiltshire (CW) model in space robotics, demonstrates that the SNN-LQR-MSIF achieves acceptable performance in computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy. This positions it as a promising solution for addressing dynamic systems' concurrent estimation and control challenges in dynamic systems. ",

From the optimization perspective, it is known that the behavior of first order methods such as gradient descent crucially depend on the separability of datasets. In fact, even in the most simplest case of binary classification, the rate of convergence depends on two factors: (1) condition number of data matrix, and (2) separability of the dataset. With no further pre-processing techniques such as over-parametrization, data augmentation etc., separability is an intrinsic quantity of the data distribution under consideration. We focus on the landscape design of the logistic function and derive a novel sequence of {\\em strictly} convex functions that are at least as strict as logistic loss. The minimizers of these functions coincide with those of the minimum norm solution wherever possible. The strict convexity of the derived function can be extended to finetune state-of-the-art models and applications.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new approach called HDNA (HTML DNA) is introduced for analyzing and comparing Document Object Model (DOM) trees in order to detect differences in HTML pages. This method assigns an identifier to each HTML page based on its structure, which proves to be particularly useful for detecting variations caused by server-side updates, user interactions or potential security risks. The process involves preprocessing the HTML content generating a DOM tree and calculating the disparities between two or more trees. By assigning weights to the nodes valuable insights about their hierarchical importance are obtained. The effectiveness of the HDNA approach has been demonstrated in identifying changes in DOM trees even when dynamically generated content is involved. Not does this method benefit web developers, testers, and security analysts by offering a deeper understanding of how web pages evolve. It also helps ensure the functionality and performance of web applications. Additionally, it enables detection and response to vulnerabilities that may arise from modifications in DOM structures. As the web ecosystem continues to evolve HDNA proves to be a tool, for individuals engaged in web development, testing, or security analysis. ",

A protein's three-dimensional structure often poses nontrivial computation costs, when classical simulation algorithms are utilized. Advances in the transformer neural network architecture -- such as AlphaFold2 -- achieve significant improvements for this problem, by learning from a large dataset of sequence information and corresponding protein structures. Yet, such methods only focus on sequence information; other available prior knowledge, such as protein crystallography and partial structure of amino acids, could be potentially utilized. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first transformer-based model that directly utilizes protein crystallography and partial structure information to predict the electron density maps of proteins. Via two new datasets of peptide fragments (2-residue and 15-residue) , we demonstrate our method, dubbed \\texttt{CrysFormer}, can achieve accurate predictions, based on a much smaller dataset size and with reduced computation costs.

    "abstract": "In a social network, individuals express their opinions on several interdependent topics, and therefore the evolution of their opinions on these topics is also mutually dependent. In this work, we propose a differential game model for the multi-dimensional opinion formation of a social network whose population of agents interacts according to a communication graph. Each individual's opinion evolves according to an aggregation of disagreements between the agent's opinions and its graph neighbors on multiple interdependent topics exposed to an unknown extraneous disturbance. For a social network with strategist agents the opinions evolve over time with respect to the minimization of a quadratic cost function that solely represents each individual's motives against the disturbance. We find the unique Nash/worst-case equilibrium solution for the proposed differential game model of coupled multi-dimensional opinions under an open-loop information structure. Moreover, we propose a distributed implementation of the Nash/worst-case equilibrium solution. We examine the non-distributed and proposed distributed open-loop Nash/worst-case strategies on a small social network with strategist agents in a two-dimensional opinion space. Then we compare the opinions evolved based on the Nash/worst-case strategy with the opinions corresponding to social optimality actions for non-strategist agents. ",

    "abstract": "Developing autonomous agents that can interact with changing environments is an open challenge in machine learning. Robustness is particularly important in these settings as agents are often fit offline on expert demonstrations but deployed online where they must generalize to the closed feedback loop within the environment. In this work, we explore the application of recurrent neural networks to tasks of this nature and understand how a parameterization of their recurrent connectivity influences robustness in closed-loop settings. Specifically, we represent the recurrent connectivity as a function of rank and sparsity and show both theoretically and empirically that modulating these two variables has desirable effects on network dynamics. The proposed low-rank, sparse connectivity induces an interpretable prior on the network that proves to be most amenable for a class of models known as closed-form continuous-time neural networks (CfCs). We find that CfCs with fewer parameters can outperform their full-rank, fully-connected counterparts in the online setting under distribution shift. This yields memory-efficient and robust agents while opening a new perspective on how we can modulate network dynamics through connectivity. ",

The effectiveness of these proposed structural enhancements is evaluated by integrating high-level models into the BindsNET framework.

This paper presents Open-Fusion, a groundbreaking approach for real-time open-vocabulary 3D mapping and queryable scene representation using RGB-D data. Open-Fusion harnesses the power of a pre-trained vision-language foundation model (VLFM) for open-set semantic comprehension and employs the Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) for swift 3D scene reconstruction. By leveraging the VLFM, we extract region-based embeddings and their associated confidence maps.

Notably, Open-Fusion delivers outstanding annotation-free 3D segmentation for open-vocabulary without necessitating additional 3D training. Benchmark tests on the ScanNet dataset against leading zero-shot methods highlight Open-Fusion's superiority. Furthermore, it seamlessly combines the strengths of region-based VLFM and TSDF, facilitating real-time 3D scene comprehension that includes object concepts and open-world semantics.

The framework is expanded in twofold: first, we interpret low-level image geometry as high-level concepts, allowing us to prompt VLMs and to select geometric features of points and lines for motor control skills; then, we create an event knowledge graph (EKG) to conceptualize a robot manipulation task of interest, where the main body of the EKG is characterized by an executable behavior tree, and the leaves by semantic concepts relevant to the manipulation context. We demonstrate, in an uncalibrated environment with real robot trials, that our method lowers the reliance of human annotation during task interfacing, allows the robot to perform activities of daily living more easily by treating low-level geometric-based motor control skills as high-level concepts, and is beneficial in building cognitive thinking for smart robot applications.

While previous studies have utilized traditional survey methods like the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) to elucidate these disparities, this paper explores the role of social media platforms in both highlighting and addressing these challenges. Drawing from real-time data sourced from Twitter, we analyzed language patterns related to four major types of adverse experiences: loss of employment income (LI), food scarcity (FS), housing insecurity (HI), and unmet needs for mental health services (UM). We first formulate a sparsity optimization problem that extracts low-level language features from social media data sources. Second, we propose novel constraints on feature similarity exploiting prior knowledge about the similarity of the language patterns among the adverse experiences. The proposed problem is challenging to solve due to the non-convexity objective and non-smoothness penalties. We develop an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework to solve the proposed formulation. Extensive experiments and comparisons to other models on real-world social media and the detection of adverse experiences justify the efficacy of our model. ",

In building this framework, we evaluate many combinations of individual models, training databases, and linear and nonlinear meta-modeling approaches. We show that many of our meta-models significantly improve affinity predictions over individual base models. Our best meta-models achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art exclusively structure-based deep learning tools.

There is some ongoing research to incorporate pothole avoidance into these autonomous systems.

Perturbations in the camera angle when hitting a pothole can cause errors in the predicted steering angle. In this paper, we present a new model to compensate for such angle perturbations and reduce any errors in steering control prediction algorithms. We evaluate our model on perturbations of publicly available datasets and show our model can reduce the errors in the estimated steering angle from perturbed images to 2.3%, making autonomous steering control robust against the dash cam image angle perturbations induced when one wheel of a car goes over a pothole.

However, existing prompting approaches cannot reuse insights of solving similar problems and suffer from accumulated errors in multi-step reasoning, since they prompt LLMs to reason \\textit{from scratch}. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Thought Propagation} (TP)}, which explores the analogous problems and leverages their solutions to enhance the complex reasoning ability of LLMs. These analogous problems are related to the input one, with reusable solutions and problem-solving strategies. Thus, it is promising to propagate insights of solving previous analogous problems to inspire new problem-solving. To achieve this, TP first prompts LLMs to propose and solve a set of analogous problems that are related to the input one. Then, TP reuses the results of analogous problems to directly yield a new solution or derive a knowledge-intensive plan for execution to amend the initial solution obtained from scratch. TP is compatible with existing prompting approaches, allowing plug-and-play generalization and enhancement in a wide range of tasks without much labor in task-specific prompt engineering. Experiments across three challenging tasks demonstrate TP enjoys a substantial improvement over the baselines by an average of 12\\% absolute increase in finding the optimal solutions in Shortest-path Reasoning, 13\\% improvement of human preference in Creative Writing, and 15\\% enhancement in the task completion rate of LLM-Agent Planning.

These artifacts result in coarsely quantized features, which negatively impact performance, especially on downstream dense prediction tasks. We present a zero-shot method to improve how pre-trained ViTs handle spatial quantization. In particular, we propose to ensemble the features obtained from perturbing input images via sub-token spatial translations, inspired by Stochastic Resonance, a method traditionally applied to climate dynamics and signal processing. We term our method ``Stochastic Resonance Transformer\" (SRT), which we show can effectively super-resolve features of pre-trained ViTs, capturing more of the local fine-grained structures that might otherwise be neglected as a result of tokenization. SRT can be applied at any layer, on any task, and does not require any fine-tuning. The advantage of the former is evident when applied to monocular depth prediction, where we show that ensembling model outputs are detrimental while applying SRT on intermediate ViT features outperforms the baseline models by an average of 4.7% and 14.9% on the RMSE and RMSE-log metrics across three different architectures. When applied to semi-supervised video object segmentation, SRT also improves over the baseline models uniformly across all metrics, and by an average of 2.4% in F&J score. We further show that these quantization artifacts can be attenuated to some extent via self-distillation. On the unsupervised salient region segmentation, SRT improves upon the base model by an average of 2.1% on the maxF metric. Finally, despite operating purely on pixel-level features, SRT generalizes to non-dense prediction tasks such as image retrieval and object discovery, yielding consistent improvements of up to 2.6% and 1.0% respectively.

Many of these models, as exemplified by HuBERT and WavLM, use pseudo-labels generated from spectral features or the model's own representation features. From previous studies, it is known that the pseudo-labels contain semantic information. However, the masked prediction task, the learning criterion of HuBERT, focuses on local contextual information and may not make effective use of global semantic information such as speaker, theme of speech, and so on. In this paper, we propose a new approach to enrich the semantic representation of HuBERT. We apply topic model to pseudo-labels to generate a topic label for each utterance. An auxiliary topic classification task is added to HuBERT by using topic labels as teachers. This allows additional global semantic information to be incorporated in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or better performance than the baseline in most tasks, including automatic speech recognition and five out of the eight SUPERB tasks. Moreover, we find that topic labels include various information about utterance, such as gender, speaker, and its theme.

However, limited research has been conducted on the inner law behind specific augmentations used in graph-based learning. What kind of augmentation will help downstream performance, how does contrastive learning actually influence downstream tasks, and why the magnitude of augmentation matters? This paper seeks to address these questions by establishing a connection between augmentation and downstream performance, as well as by investigating the generalization of contrastive learning. Our findings reveal that GCL contributes to downstream tasks mainly by separating different classes rather than gathering nodes of the same class. So perfect alignment and augmentation overlap which draw all intra-class samples the same can not explain the success of contrastive learning. Then in order to comprehend how augmentation aids the contrastive learning process, we conduct further investigations into its generalization, finding that perfect alignment that draw positive pair the same could help contrastive loss but is poisonous to generalization, on the contrary, imperfect alignment enhances the model's generalization ability. We analyse the result by information theory and graph spectrum theory respectively, and propose two simple but effective methods to verify the theories. The two methods could be easily applied to various GCL algorithms and extensive experiments are conducted to prove its effectiveness. ",

It is desirable for redundancies in the data to make multimodal systems robust to missing or corrupted observations in some correlated modalities. However, we observe that the performance of several existing multimodal networks significantly deteriorates if one or multiple modalities are absent at test time. To enable robustness to missing modalities, we propose simple and parameter-efficient adaptation procedures for pretrained multimodal networks. In particular, we exploit low-rank adaptation and modulation of intermediate features to compensate for the missing modalities. We demonstrate that such adaptation can partially bridge performance drop due to missing modalities and outperform independent, dedicated networks trained for the available modality combinations in some cases. The proposed adaptation requires extremely small number of parameters (e.g., fewer than 0.7% of the total parameters in most experiments). We conduct a series of experiments to highlight the robustness of our proposed method using diverse datasets for RGB-thermal and RGB-Depth semantic segmentation, multimodal material segmentation, and multimodal sentiment analysis tasks. Our proposed method demonstrates versatility across various tasks and datasets, and outperforms existing methods for robust multimodal learning with missing modalities. ",

A margin-based constraint is used to enhance its robustness. To show the advantages of our algorithm, we propose a \"bigram\" paraphrase attack using the paraphrase that has the fewest bigram overlaps with the original sentence. This attack is shown to be effective against the existing token-level watermarking method.

    "title": "Layer-Adapted Implicit Distribution Alignment Networks for Cross-Corpus  Speech Emotion Recognition",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) method called layer-adapted implicit distribution alignment networks (LIDAN) to address the challenge of cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER). LIDAN extends our previous ICASSP work, deep implicit distribution alignment networks (DIDAN), whose key contribution lies in the introduction of a novel regularization term called implicit distribution alignment (IDA). This term allows DIDAN trained on source (training) speech samples to remain applicable to predicting emotion labels for target (testing) speech samples, regardless of corpus variance in cross-corpus SER. To further enhance this method, we extend IDA to layer-adapted IDA (LIDA), resulting in LIDAN. This layer-adpated extention consists of three modified IDA terms that consider emotion labels at different levels of granularity. These terms are strategically arranged within different fully connected layers in LIDAN, aligning with the increasing emotion-discriminative abilities with respect to the layer depth. This arrangement enables LIDAN to more effectively learn emotion-discriminative and corpus-invariant features for SER across various corpora compared to DIDAN. It is also worthy to mention that unlike most existing methods that rely on estimating statistical moments to describe pre-assumed explicit distributions, both IDA and LIDA take a different approach. They utilize an idea of target sample reconstruction to directly bridge the feature distribution gap without making assumptions about their distribution type. As a result, DIDAN and LIDAN can be viewed as implicit cross-corpus SER methods. To evaluate LIDAN, we conducted extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on EmoDB, eNTERFACE, and CASIA corpora. The experimental results demonstrate that LIDAN surpasses recent state-of-the-art explicit unsupervised DA methods in tackling cross-corpus SER tasks. ",

    "abstract": "The global semiconductor supply chain involves design and fabrication at various locations, which leads to multiple security vulnerabilities, e.g., Hardware Trojan (HT) insertion. Although most HTs target digital circuits, HTs can be inserted in analog circuits. Therefore, several techniques have been developed for HT insertions in analog circuits. Capacitance-based Analog Hardware Trojan (AHT) is one of the stealthiest HT that can bypass most existing HT detection techniques because it uses negligible charge accumulation in the capacitor to generate stealthy triggers. To address the charge sharing and accumulation issues, we propose a novel way to detect such capacitance-based AHT in this paper. Secondly, we critically analyzed existing AHTs to highlight their respective limitations. We proposed a stealthier capacitor-based AHT (fortified AHT) that can bypass our novel AHT detection technique by addressing these limitations. Finally, by critically analyzing the proposed fortified AHT and existing AHTs, we developed a robust two-phase framework (DeMiST) in which a synchronous system can mitigate the effects of capacitance-based stealthy AHTs by turning off the triggering capability of AHT. In the first phase, we demonstrate how the synchronous system can avoid the AHT during run-time by controlling the supply voltage of the intermediate combinational circuits. In the second phase, we proposed a supply voltage duty cycle-based validation technique to detect capacitance-based AHTs. Furthermore, DeMiST amplified the switching activity for charge accumulation to such a degree that it can be easily detectable using existing switching activity-based HT detection techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Various control strategies and field experiments have been designed for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to stabilize mixed traffic that contains both CAVs and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs). The effect of these stabilizing CAV control strategies on traffic safety is still under investigation. In an effort to prioritize safety over stability, a safety-critical filter via control barrier functions (CBFs) can be designed by modifying the stabilizing nominal control input in a minimal fashion and imparting collision-free driving behaviors for CAVs and HVs. However, such formal safety guarantees can be violated if there are delays in the actuation and communication channels of the CAV. Considering both actuator and sensor delays, and disturbances, we propose robust safety-critical traffic control (RSTC) design to ensure ``robust safety'' of the mixed traffic. While predictor-based CBF has been developed to compensate for the actuator delay, uncertain speed disturbances from the head vehicle cause prediction error and require novel robust CBF design. Besides, safety-critical control with sensor delay also remains an open question. In RSTC, a state predictor with bounded error is designed, and robust CBF constraints are constructed to guarantee safety under actuator delay and disturbances. When there is a sensor delay, a state observer is designed and integrated with a predictor-based CBF to ensure robust safety. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed RSTC avoids rear-end collisions for two unsafe traffic scenarios in the presence of actuator, sensor delays and disturbances. ",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) in surface inspection is an essential yet challenging task in manufacturing due to the quantity imbalance problem of scarce abnormal data. To overcome the above, a reconstruction encoder-decoder (ED) such as autoencoder or U-Net which is trained with only anomaly-free samples is widely adopted, in the hope that unseen abnormals should yield a larger reconstruction error than normal. Over the past years, researches on self-supervised reconstruction-by-inpainting have been reported. They mask out suspected defective regions for inpainting in order to make them invisible to the reconstruction ED to deliberately cause inaccurate reconstruction for abnormals. However, their limitation is multiple random masking to cover the whole input image due to defective regions not being known in advance. We propose a novel reconstruction-by-inpainting method dubbed Excision and Recovery (EAR) that features single deterministic masking. For this, we exploit a pre-trained spatial attention model to predict potential suspected defective regions that should be masked out. We also employ a variant of U-Net as our ED to further limit the reconstruction ability of the U-Net model for abnormals, in which skip connections of different layers can be selectively disabled. In the training phase, all the skip connections are switched on to fully take the benefits from the U-Net architecture. In contrast, for inferencing, we only keep deeper skip connections with shallower connections off. We validate the effectiveness of EAR using an MNIST pre-trained attention for a commonly used surface AD dataset, KolektorSDD2. The experimental results show that EAR achieves both better AD performance and higher throughput than state-of-the-art methods. We expect that the proposed EAR model can be widely adopted as training and inference strategies for AD purposes. ",

A key aspect of drug discovery involves identifying novel drug-target (DT) interactions. Existing computational methods for predicting DT interactions have primarily focused on binary classification tasks, aiming to determine whether a DT pair interacts or not. However, protein-ligand interactions exhibit a continuum of binding strengths, known as binding affinity, presenting a persistent challenge for accurate prediction. In this study, we investigate various techniques employed in Drug Target Interaction (DTI) prediction and propose novel enhancements to enhance their performance. Our approaches include the integration of Protein Language Models (PLMs) and the incorporation of Contact Map information as an inductive bias within current models. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our proposed approaches outperform the baseline models considered in this study, presenting a compelling case for further development in this direction.

Conventional algorithms suffer from low accuracy due to their reliance on limited representations, such as point clouds. In contrast, our previous graph-based model, GraphDistNet, achieves high accuracy using edge information but incurs higher message-passing costs with growing graph size, limiting its applicability to 3D geometries. To overcome these challenges, we propose GDN-R, a novel 3D graph-based estimation network.GDN-R employs a layer-wise probabilistic graph-rewiring algorithm leveraging the differentiable Gumbel-top-K relaxation. Our method accurately infers minimum distances through iterative graph rewiring and updating relevant embeddings. The probabilistic rewiring enables fast and robust embedding with respect to unforeseen categories of geometries. Through 41,412 random benchmark tasks with 150 pairs of 3D objects, we show GDN-R outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of accuracy and generalizability. We also show that the proposed rewiring improves the update performance reducing the size of the estimation model.

Even experienced developers need to spend considerable time finding parallelism opportunities and then actually writing parallel versions of sequentially written programs. To address this issue, we present AUTOPARLLM, a framework for automatically discovering parallelism and generating the parallel version of the sequentially written program. Our framework consists of two major components: i) a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) based parallelism discovery and parallel pattern detection module, and ii) an LLM-based code generator to generate the parallel counterpart of the sequential programs. We use the GNN to learn the flow-aware characteristics of the programs to identify parallel regions in sequential programs and then construct an enhanced prompt using the GNN's results for the LLM-based generator to finally produce the parallel counterparts of the sequential programs. We evaluate AUTOPARLLM on 11 applications of 2 well-known benchmark suites: NAS Parallel Benchmark and Rodinia Benchmark. Our results show that AUTOPARLLM is indeed effective in improving the state-of-the-art LLM-based models for the task of parallel code generation in terms of multiple code generation metrics. AUTOPARLLM also improves the average runtime of the parallel code generated by the state-of-the-art LLMs by as high as 3.4% and 2.9% for the NAS Parallel Benchmark and Rodinia Benchmark respectively. Additionally, to overcome the issue that well-known metrics for translation evaluation have not been optimized to evaluate the quality of the generated parallel code, we propose OMPScore for evaluating the quality of the generated code. We show that OMPScore exhibits a better correlation with human judgment than existing metrics, measured by up to 75% improvement of Spearman correlation. ",

This is because adversaries typically do not announce their intentions before attacking, and re-weighting might change aggregation results even in the absence of attacks. To address these challenges in real FL systems, this paper introduces a cutting-edge anomaly detection approach with the following features: i) Detecting the occurrence of attacks and performing defense operations only when attacks happen; ii) Upon the occurrence of an attack, further detecting the malicious client models and eliminating them without harming the benign ones; iii) Ensuring honest execution of defense mechanisms at the server by leveraging a zero-knowledge proof mechanism.

    "abstract": "In PCNs, nodes that forward payments between a source and a receiver are paid a small fee if the payment is successful. The fee is a compensation for temporarily committing funds to the payment. However, payments may fail due to insufficient funds or attacks, often after considerable delays of up to several days, leaving a node without compensation. Furthermore, attackers can intentionally cause failed payments, e.g., to infer private information (like channel balances), without any cost in fees. In this paper, we first use extensive form games to formally characterize the conditions that lead to rational intermediaries refusing (or agreeing) to forward payments. A decision made by an intermediary to forward or not depends on the probability of failure, which they approximate based on past experience. We then propose and analyze an alternative fee model that allows the sender to determine and pay a fraction of the fee to intermediaries in a non refundable manner. A rational sender chooses the fraction such that the intermediaries' utility for forwarding the payment exceeds their utility for not forwarding. Our simulation study, based on real world Lightning snapshots, confirms that our novel mechanism can increase the probability of successful payments by 12 percent and decrease routing fees for senders by about 6 percent if all nodes behave rationally. Furthermore, previously cost free probing attacks now require that the attacker pays 1500 satoshis for every 1 million satoshis inferred. Finally, we propose a modification to the Hash Time Locked Contract to enable secure payments of the non refundable fees. ",

Despite the plethora of research on resource allocation design for IRS-assisted multiuser communication systems, the optimal design and the corresponding performance upper bound are still not fully understood. To bridge this gap in knowledge, in this paper, we investigate the optimal resource allocation design for IRS-assisted multiuser systems employing practical discrete IRS phase shifters. In particular, we jointly optimize the beamforming vector at the base station (BS) and the discrete IRS phase shifts to minimize the total transmit power for the cases of perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge. To this end, two novel algorithms based on the generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) method are developed to obtain the globally optimal solution for perfect and imperfect CSI, respectively. Moreover, to facilitate practical implementation, we propose two corresponding low-complexity suboptimal algorithms with guaranteed convergence by capitalizing on successive convex approximation (SCA). In particular, for imperfect CSI, we adopt a bounded error model to characterize the CSI uncertainty and propose a new transformation to convexify the robust quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Our numerical results confirm the optimality of the proposed GBD-based algorithms for the considered system for both perfect and imperfect CSI. Furthermore, we unveil that both proposed SCA-based algorithms can achieve a close-to-optimal performance within a few iterations. Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-art solution based on the alternating optimization (AO) method, the proposed SCA-based scheme achieves a significant performance gain with low complexity. ",

From this an edge excess index is calculated for the fully connected edge graph in the range [1.0..2.0], where 1.0 indicate no edges. The ratio can be interpreted as a sampled Bernoulli process with unknown probability. The Bayesian posterior estimate of the probability can be associated with its conjugate prior which is a Beta($\\alpha$, $\\beta$) distribution, with hyper parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ related to the number of edge crossings. Low values of $\\beta$ indicate a texture rich area, higher values less rich.

By extracting semantic information from unlabeled data, self-supervised methods can improve the performance of downstream tasks, among which the mask image model (MIM) has been widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in recovering original information from masked images. However, due to the high degree of structural locality in EM images, as well as the existence of considerable noise, many voxels contain little discriminative information, making MIM pretraining inefficient on the neuron segmentation task. To overcome this challenge, we propose a decision-based MIM that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically search for optimal image masking ratio and masking strategy. Due to the vast exploration space, using single-agent RL for voxel prediction is impractical. Therefore, we treat each input patch as an agent with a shared behavior policy, allowing for multi-agent collaboration. Furthermore, this multi-agent model can capture dependencies between voxels, which is beneficial for the downstream segmentation task. Experiments conducted on representative EM datasets demonstrate that our approach has a significant advantage over alternative self-supervised methods on the task of neuron segmentation.

    "title": "Improving Neural Radiance Field using Near-Surface Sampling with Point  Cloud Generation",
    "abstract": "Neural radiance field (NeRF) is an emerging view synthesis method that samples points in a three-dimensional (3D) space and estimates their existence and color probabilities. The disadvantage of NeRF is that it requires a long training time since it samples many 3D points. In addition, if one samples points from occluded regions or in the space where an object is unlikely to exist, the rendering quality of NeRF can be degraded. These issues can be solved by estimating the geometry of 3D scene. This paper proposes a near-surface sampling framework to improve the rendering quality of NeRF. To this end, the proposed method estimates the surface of a 3D object using depth images of the training set and sampling is performed around there only. To obtain depth information on a novel view, the paper proposes a 3D point cloud generation method and a simple refining method for projected depth from a point cloud. Experimental results show that the proposed near-surface sampling NeRF framework can significantly improve the rendering quality, compared to the original NeRF and a state-of-the-art depth-based NeRF method. In addition, one can significantly accelerate the training time of a NeRF model with the proposed near-surface sampling framework. ",

To address the intricacies of planning and overcome the high dimensionality inherent to such decision-making problems, we design an Amortize Network Interventions (ANI) framework, allowing for the pooling of optimal policies from history and other contexts, while ensuring a permutation equivalent property. This property enables efficient knowledge transfer and sharing across diverse contexts. Our approach has broad applications, from curbing infectious disease spread to reducing carbon emissions through traffic light optimization, and thus has the potential to address critical societal and environmental challenges.

Graph-based fraud detection methods consider this task as a classification problem with two classes: frauds or normal. We address this problem using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by proposing a dynamic relation-attentive aggregation mechanism. Based on the observation that many real-world graphs include different types of relations, we propose to learn a node representation per relation and aggregate the node representations using a learnable attention function that assigns a different attention coefficient to each relation. Furthermore, we combine the node representations from different layers to consider both the local and global structures of a target node, which is beneficial to improving the performance of fraud detection on graphs with heterophily. By employing dynamic graph attention in all the aggregation processes, our method adaptively computes the attention coefficients for each node. Experimental results show that our method, DRAG, outperforms state-of-the-art fraud detection methods on real-world benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "The transient-execution attack Meltdown leaks sensitive information by transiently accessing inaccessible data during out-of-order execution. Although Meltdown is fixed in hardware for recent CPU generations, most currently-deployed CPUs have to rely on software mitigations, such as KPTI. Still, Meltdown is considered non-exploitable on current systems. In this paper, we show that adding another layer of indirection to Meltdown transforms a transient-execution attack into a side-channel attack, leaking metadata instead of data. We show that despite software mitigations, attackers can still leak metadata from other security domains by observing the success rate of Meltdown on non-secret data. With LeakIDT, we present the first cache-line granular monitoring of kernel addresses. LeakIDT allows an attacker to obtain cycle-accurate timestamps for attacker-chosen interrupts. We use our attack to get accurate inter-keystroke timings and fingerprint visited websites. While we propose a low-overhead software mitigation to prevent the exploitation of LeakIDT, we emphasize that the side-channel aspect of transient-execution attacks should not be underestimated. ",

The repeated exchange and encoding of identical information in message passing amplifies oversquashing. We propose a novel aggregation scheme based on neighborhood trees, which allows for controlling the redundancy by pruning branches of the unfolding trees underlying standard message passing. We prove that reducing redundancy improves expressivity and experimentally show that it alleviates oversquashing. We investigate the interaction between redundancy in message passing and redundancy in computation and propose a compact representation of neighborhood trees, from which we compute node and graph embeddings via a neural tree canonization technique. Our method is provably more expressive than the Weisfeiler-Leman method, less susceptible to oversquashing than message passing neural networks, and provides high classification accuracy on widely-used benchmark datasets.

As the number of N-k scenarios increases exponentially with increasing system size, such problems are extremely time-consuming to solve with traditional solvers. In this paper, we combine Physics-Informed Neural Networks with both a Guided-Dropout (GD) (which associates dedicated neurons with specific line connections/disconnections) and an edge-varying Graph Neural Neural Network (GNN) architecture to learn the setpoints for a grid that considers all probable single-line reconfigurations (all critical N-1 scenarios) and subsequently apply the trained models to N-k scenarios. We demonstrate how incorporating the underlying physical equations for the network equations along with the GD and the GNN methods, performs with N-1, N-2, and N-3 case studies. Using the AC Power Flow as a guiding application, we test our methods on the 14-bus, 30-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems, and we compare the models in terms of the accuracy and computational performance that each one achieves for each study and provide recommendations on their adoption for contingency analysis of power systems.

Unlike traditional methods, ScoreAG maintains the core semantics of images while generating realistic adversarial examples, either by transforming existing images or synthesizing new ones entirely from scratch. We further exploit the generative capability of ScoreAG to purify images, empirically enhancing the robustness of classifiers. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that ScoreAG matches the performance of state-of-the-art attacks and defenses across multiple benchmarks. This work highlights the importance of investigating adversarial examples bounded by semantics rather than $\\ell_p$-norm constraints. ScoreAG represents an important step towards more encompassing robustness assessments. ",

    "abstract": "Group-level emotion recognition (GER) is an inseparable part of human behavior analysis, aiming to recognize an overall emotion in a multi-person scene. However, the existing methods are devoted to combing diverse emotion cues while ignoring the inherent uncertainties under unconstrained environments, such as congestion and occlusion occurring within a group. Additionally, since only group-level labels are available, inconsistent emotion predictions among individuals in one group can confuse the network. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) method to extract more robust representations for GER. By explicitly modeling the uncertainty of each individual, we utilize stochastic embedding drawn from a Gaussian distribution instead of deterministic point embedding. This representation captures the probabilities of different emotions and generates diverse predictions through this stochasticity during the inference stage. Furthermore, uncertainty-sensitive scores are adaptively assigned as the fusion weights of individuals' face within each group. Moreover, we develop an image enhancement module to enhance the model's robustness against severe noise. The overall three-branch model, encompassing face, object, and scene component, is guided by a proportional-weighted fusion strategy and integrates the proposed uncertainty-aware method to produce the final group-level output. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method across three widely used databases. ",

    "abstract": "Latent graph inference (LGI) aims to jointly learn the underlying graph structure and node representations from data features. However, existing LGI methods commonly suffer from the issue of supervision starvation, where massive edge weights are learned without semantic supervision and do not contribute to the training loss. Consequently, these supervision-starved weights, which may determine the predictions of testing samples, cannot be semantically optimal, resulting in poor generalization. In this paper, we observe that this issue is actually caused by the graph sparsification operation, which severely destroys the important connections established between pivotal nodes and labeled ones. To address this, we propose to restore the corrupted affinities and replenish the missed supervision for better LGI. The key challenge then lies in identifying the critical nodes and recovering the corrupted affinities. We begin by defining the pivotal nodes as $k$-hop starved nodes, which can be identified based on a given adjacency matrix. Considering the high computational burden, we further present a more efficient alternative inspired by CUR matrix decomposition. Subsequently, we eliminate the starved nodes by reconstructing the destroyed connections. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that reducing the starved nodes consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art LGI methods, especially under extremely limited supervision (6.12% improvement on Pubmed with a labeling rate of only 0.3%).

    "abstract": "Designing effective policies for the online 3D bin packing problem (3D-BPP) has been a long-standing challenge, primarily due to the unpredictable nature of incoming box sequences and stringent physical constraints. While current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods for online 3D-BPP have shown promising results in optimizing average performance over an underlying box sequence distribution, they often fail in real-world settings where some worst-case scenarios can materialize. Standard robust DRL algorithms tend to overly prioritize optimizing the worst-case performance at the expense of performance under normal problem instance distribution. To address these issues, we first introduce a permutation-based attacker to investigate the practical robustness of both DRL-based and heuristic methods proposed for solving online 3D-BPP. Then, we propose an adjustable robust reinforcement learning (AR2L) framework that allows efficient adjustment of robustness weights to achieve the desired balance of the policy's performance in average and worst-case environments. Specifically, we formulate the objective function as a weighted sum of expected and worst-case returns, and derive the lower performance bound by relating to the return under a mixture dynamics. To realize this lower bound, we adopt an iterative procedure that searches for the associated mixture dynamics and improves the corresponding policy. We integrate this procedure into two popular robust adversarial algorithms to develop the exact and approximate AR2L algorithms. Experiments demonstrate that AR2L is versatile in the sense that it improves policy robustness while maintaining an acceptable level of performance for the nominal case. ",

To account for the quality of the decision made based on the prediction, decision-focused learning (end-to-end predict-then-optimize) aims at training the predictive model to minimize regret, i.e., the loss incurred by making a suboptimal decision. Despite the challenge of this loss function being possibly non-convex and in general non-differentiable, effective gradient-based learning approaches have been proposed to minimize the expected loss, using the empirical loss as a surrogate. However, empirical regret can be an ineffective surrogate because the uncertainty in the optimization model makes the empirical regret unequal to the expected regret in expectation. To illustrate the impact of this inequality, we evaluate the effect of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on the accuracy of empirical regret as a surrogate. Next, we propose three robust loss functions that more closely approximate expected regret. Experimental results show that training two state-of-the-art decision-focused learning approaches using robust regret losses improves test-sample empirical regret in general while keeping computational time equivalent relative to the number of training epochs.

Biased BP with shortest path awareness can address the first two drawbacks, and sojourn time-based backlog metrics have been proposed for the last packet problem. Furthermore, these BP variations require no additional signaling overhead in each time step compared to the basic BP. In this work, we further address three long-standing challenges associated with the aforementioned low-cost BP variations, including optimal scaling of the biases, bias maintenance under mobility, and incorporating sojourn time awareness into biased BP. Our analysis and experimental results show that proper scaling of biases can be achieved with the help of common link features, which can effectively reduce end-to-end delay of BP by mitigating the random walk of packets under low-to-medium traffic, including the last packet scenario. In addition, our low-overhead bias maintenance scheme is shown to be effective under mobility, and our bio-inspired sojourn time-aware backlog metric is demonstrated to be more efficient and effective for the last packet problem than existing approaches when incorporated into biased BP.

    "abstract": "Basecalling, an essential step in many genome analysis studies, relies on large Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to achieve high accuracy. Unfortunately, these DNNs are computationally slow and inefficient, leading to considerable delays and resource constraints in the sequence analysis process. A Computation-In-Memory (CIM) architecture using memristors can significantly accelerate the performance of DNNs. However, inherent device non-idealities and architectural limitations of such designs can greatly degrade the basecalling accuracy, which is critical for accurate genome analysis. To facilitate the adoption of memristor-based CIM designs for basecalling, it is important to (1) conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential CIM architectures and (2) develop effective strategies for mitigating the possible adverse effects of inherent device non-idealities and architectural limitations. This paper proposes Swordfish, a novel hardware/software co-design framework that can effectively address the two aforementioned issues. Swordfish incorporates seven circuit and device restrictions or non-idealities from characterized real memristor-based chips. Swordfish leverages various hardware/software co-design solutions to mitigate the basecalling accuracy loss due to such non-idealities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Swordfish, we take Bonito, the state-of-the-art (i.e., accurate and fast), open-source basecaller as a case study. Our experimental results using Sword-fish show that a CIM architecture can realistically accelerate Bonito for a wide range of real datasets by an average of 25.7x, with an accuracy loss of 6.01%. ",

We propose an implicit personalized enhancement (IPE) stage based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation, which further improves the performance of MBTFNet. Experiments show that our proposed model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art SE and MSS models. ",

Finally, we compile these logical formulas to generate transitions and create the formal model as finite state machines. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Hermes, we evaluate it on 4G NAS, 5G NAS, and 5G RRC specifications and obtain an overall accuracy of 81-87%, which is a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art. Our security analysis of the extracted models uncovers 3 new vulnerabilities and identifies 19 previous attacks in 4G and 5G specifications, and 7 deviations in commercial 4G basebands. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep foundation models have led to a promising trend of developing large recommendation models to leverage vast amounts of available data. However, we experiment to scale up existing recommendation models and observe that the enlarged models do not improve satisfactorily. In this context, we investigate the embedding layers of enlarged models and identify a phenomenon of embedding collapse, which ultimately hinders scalability, wherein the embedding matrix tends to reside in a low-dimensional subspace. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the feature interaction module specific to recommendation models has a two-sided effect. On the one hand, the interaction restricts embedding learning when interacting with collapsed embeddings, exacerbating the collapse issue. On the other hand, feature interaction is crucial in mitigating the fitting of spurious features, thereby improving scalability. Based on this analysis, we propose a simple yet effective multi-embedding design incorporating embedding-set-specific interaction modules to capture diverse patterns and reduce collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this proposed design provides consistent scalability for various recommendation models. ",

However, these documents, often spanning hundreds of words, make inference substantially more expensive. We propose compressing the retrieved documents into textual summaries prior to in-context integration. This not only reduces the computational costs but also relieves the burden of LMs to identify relevant information in long retrieved documents. We present two compressors -- an extractive compressor which selects useful sentences from retrieved documents and an abstractive compressor which generates summaries by synthesizing information from multiple documents. Both compressors are trained to improve LMs' performance on end tasks when the generated summaries are prepended to the LMs' input, while keeping the summary concise.If the retrieved documents are irrelevant to the input or offer no additional information to LM, our compressor can return an empty string, implementing selective augmentation.We evaluate our approach on language modeling task and open domain question answering task. We achieve a compression rate of as low as 6% with minimal loss in performance for both tasks, significantly outperforming the off-the-shelf summarization models. We show that our compressors trained for one LM can transfer to other LMs on the language modeling task and provide summaries largely faithful to the retrieved documents. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the abundant neurophysiological information in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, EEG signals integrated with deep learning methods have gained substantial traction across numerous real-world tasks. However, the development of supervised learning methods based on EEG signals has been hindered by the high cost and significant label discrepancies to manually label large-scale EEG datasets. Self-supervised frameworks are adopted in vision and language fields to solve this issue, but the lack of EEG-specific theoretical foundations hampers their applicability across various tasks. To solve these challenges, this paper proposes a knowledge-driven cross-view contrastive learning framework (KDC2), which integrates neurological theory to extract effective representations from EEG with limited labels. The KDC2 method creates scalp and neural views of EEG signals, simulating the internal and external representation of brain activity. Sequentially, inter-view and cross-view contrastive learning pipelines in combination with various augmentation methods are applied to capture neural features from different views. By modeling prior neural knowledge based on homologous neural information consistency theory, the proposed method extracts invariant and complementary neural knowledge to generate combined representations. Experimental results on different downstream tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the superior generalization of neural knowledge-supported EEG representations across various brain tasks.

We propose a neural network called SCVCNet, which eliminates task- and individual-set-related interferences in EEGs by analyzing finer-grained frequency structures in the power spectral densities. The SCVCNet utilizes a sliding cross-vector convolution (SCVC) operation, where paired input layers representing the theta and alpha power are employed. By extracting the weights from a kernel matrix's central row and column, we compute the weighted sum of the two vectors around a specified scalp location. Next, we introduce an inter-frequency-point feature integration module to fuse the SCVC feature maps. Finally, we combined the two modules with the output-channel pooling and classification layers to construct the model. To train the SCVCNet, we employ the regularized least-square method with ridge regression and the extreme learning machine theory. We validate its performance using three databases, each consisting of distinct tasks performed by independent participant groups. The average accuracy (0.6813 and 0.6229) and F1 score (0.6743 and 0.6076) achieved in two different validation paradigms show partially higher performance than the previous works.

The GAN models have achieved remarkable results in reproducing ECG signals but are only designed for multiple lead inputs and the features the GAN model preserves have not been identified-limiting the generated signals use in cardiovascular disease (CVD)-predictive models. This paper presents ECGNet which is a procedure that generates a complete set of 12-lead ECG signals from any single lead input using a GAN framework with a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) generator and a convolutional neural network (CNN) discriminator. Cross and auto-correlation analysis performed on the generated signals identifies features conserved during the signal generation-i.e., features that can characterize the unique-nature of each signal and thus likely indicators of CVD. Finally, by using ECG signals annotated with the CVD-indicative features detailed by the correlation analysis as inputs for a CVD-onset-predictive CNN model, we overcome challenges preventing the prediction of multiple-CVD targets. Our models are experimented on 15s 12-lead ECG dataset recorded using MyoVista's wavECG. Functional outcome data for each patient is recorded and used in the CVD-predictive model. Our best GAN model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with Frechet Distance (FD) scores of 4.73, 4.89, 5.18, 4.77, 4.71, and 5.55 on the V1-V6 pre-cordial leads respectively and shows strength in preserving the P-Q segments and R-peaks in the generated signals.

Here we apply a recent development in the theory of feature learning, the adaptive kernel approach, to two teacher-student models with cubic-polynomial and modular addition teachers. We provide analytical predictions on feature learning and Grokking properties of these models and demonstrate a mapping between Grokking and the theory of phase transitions. We show that after Grokking, the state of the DNN is analogous to the mixed phase following a first-order phase transition. In this mixed phase, the DNN generates useful internal representations of the teacher that are sharply distinct from those before the transition. ",

Inspired by applications where customers' demand can only be affected through posted prices and real-time two-way communication with customers is not available, we require an algorithm to generate ``safe prices''. This means that at no iteration should the realized demand in response to the posted prices violate the safety constraints of the network. Thus, in contrast to existing distributed first-order methods, our algorithm, called safe pricing for NUM (SPNUM), is guaranteed to produce feasible primal iterates at all iterations. At the heart of the algorithm lie two key steps that must go hand in hand to guarantee safety and convergence: 1) applying a projected gradient method on a shrunk feasible set to get the desired demand, and 2) estimating the price response function of the users and determining the price so that the induced demand is close to the desired demand. We ensure safety by adjusting the shrinkage to account for the error between the induced demand and the desired demand. In addition, by gradually reducing the amount of shrinkage and the step size of the gradient method, we prove that the primal iterates produced by the SPNUM achieve a sublinear static regret of ${\\cal O}(\\log{(T)})$ after $T$ time steps.

To address this limitation, we introduce FNOSeg3D, a 3D segmentation model robust to training image resolution based on the Fourier neural operator (FNO). The FNO is a deep learning framework for learning mappings between functions in partial differential equations, which has the appealing properties of zero-shot super-resolution and global receptive field. We improve the FNO by reducing its parameter requirement and enhancing its learning capability through residual connections and deep supervision, and these result in our FNOSeg3D model which is parameter efficient and resolution robust.

Specifically, we propose an event-relational graph representation learning (ERGL) framework for ASC to classify scenes, and simultaneously answer clearly and straightly which cues are used in classifying. In the event-relational graph, embeddings of each event are treated as nodes, while relationship cues derived from each pair of nodes are described by multi-dimensional edge features. Experiments on a real-life ASC dataset show that the proposed ERGL achieves competitive performance on ASC by learning embeddings of only a limited number of AEs. The results show the feasibility of recognizing diverse acoustic scenes based on the audio event-relational graph.

To solve that problem, a large quantum circuit is partitioned and distributed to small quantum computers for execution. Partitions running on different quantum computers share quantum information using entangled Bell pairs.

In this paper we study that trade-off by proposing two techniques for partitioning large quantum circuits and for distribution to small quantum computers. Our techniques map a quantum circuit to a graph representation. We study two approaches: one that considers only gate teleportation, and another that considers both gate and state teleportation to achieve the distributed execution. Then we apply the METIS graph partitioning algorithm to obtain the partitions and the number of entanglement requests between them. We use the SeQUeNCe quantum communication simulator to measure the time required for generating all the entanglements required to execute the distributed circuit.

The primary simulation methods are based on state vectors and tensor networks. As the number of qubits and quantum gates grows larger in current quantum devices, traditional state-vector based quantum circuit simulation methods prove inadequate due to the overwhelming size of the Hilbert space and extensive entanglement. Consequently, brutal force tensor network simulation algorithms become the only viable solution in such scenarios. The two main challenges faced in tensor network simulation algorithms are optimal contraction path finding and efficient execution on modern computing devices, with the latter determines the actual efficiency. In this study, we investigate the optimization of such tensor network simulations on modern GPUs and propose general optimization strategies from two aspects: computational efficiency and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to transform critical Einstein summation operations into GEMM operations, leveraging the specific features of tensor network simulations to amplify the efficiency of GPUs. Secondly, by analyzing the data characteristics of quantum circuits, we employ extended precision to ensure the accuracy of simulation results and mixed precision to fully exploit the potential of GPUs, resulting in faster and more precise simulations. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 3.96x reduction in verification time for random quantum circuit samples in the 18-cycle case of Sycamore, with sustained performance exceeding 21 TFLOPS on one A100. This method can be easily extended to the 20-cycle case, maintaining the same performance, accelerating by 12.5x compared to the state-of-the-art CPU-based results and 4.48-6.78x compared to the state-of-the-art GPU-based results reported in the literature.

In the iterative MPC, at each iteration, safe states visited and stored in the previous iterations are imposed as terminal constraints. Furthermore, samples collected during the iteration are used in the subsequent iterations to tune the ambiguity set of the DR constraints employed in the MPC. In this method, the MPC problem becomes computationally burdensome when the iteration number goes high. To overcome this challenge, the emphasis of this paper is to reduce the real-time computational effort using two approximations. First one involves clustering of data at the beginning of each iteration and modifying the ambiguity set for the MPC scheme so that safety guarantees still holds. The second approximation considers determining DR-safe regions at the start of iteration and constraining the state in the MPC scheme to such safe sets. We analyze the computational tractability of these approximations and present a simulation example that considers path planning in the presence of randomly moving obstacle. ",

While AE initially demonstrate higher accuracy, POD's precision improves as more modes are considered. Notably, our work recognizes that the classical POD-MOR approach, although capable of accurately representing the non-linear solution manifold of the kinetic equation, may not provide a parsimonious model of the data due to the inherently non-linear nature of the data manifold. We demonstrate how AEs are used in finding the intrinsic dimension of a system and to allow correlating the intrinsic quantities with macroscopic quantities that have a physical interpretation. ",

    "title": "Neur2RO: Neural Two-Stage Robust Optimization",
    "abstract": "Robust optimization provides a mathematical framework for modeling and solving decision-making problems under worst-case uncertainty. This work addresses two-stage robust optimization (2RO) problems (also called adjustable robust optimization), wherein first-stage and second-stage decisions are made before and after uncertainty is realized, respectively. This results in a nested min-max-min optimization problem which is extremely challenging computationally, especially when the decisions are discrete. We propose Neur2RO, an efficient machine learning-driven instantiation of column-and-constraint generation (CCG), a classical iterative algorithm for 2RO. Specifically, we learn to estimate the value function of the second-stage problem via a novel neural network architecture that is easy to optimize over by design. Embedding our neural network into CCG yields high-quality solutions quickly as evidenced by experiments on two 2RO benchmarks, knapsack and capital budgeting. For knapsack, Neur2RO finds solutions that are within roughly $2\\%$ of the best-known values in a few seconds compared to the three hours of the state-of-the-art exact branch-and-price algorithm; for larger and more complex instances, Neur2RO finds even better solutions. For capital budgeting, Neur2RO outperforms three variants of the $k$-adaptability algorithm, particularly on the largest instances, with a 5 to 10-fold reduction in solution time. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/khalil-research/Neur2RO. ",

    "title": "A Marketplace Price Anomaly Detection System at Scale",
    "abstract": "Online marketplaces execute large volume of price updates that are initiated by individual marketplace sellers each day on the platform. This price democratization comes with increasing challenges with data quality. Lack of centralized guardrails that are available for a traditional online retailer causes a higher likelihood for inaccurate prices to get published on the website, leading to poor customer experience and potential for revenue loss. We present MoatPlus (Masked Optimal Anchors using Trees, Proximity-based Labeling and Unsupervised Statistical-features), a scalable price anomaly detection framework for a growing marketplace platform. The goal is to leverage proximity and historical price trends from unsupervised statistical features to generate an upper price bound. We build an ensemble of models to detect irregularities in price-based features, exclude irregular features and use optimized weighting scheme to build a reliable price bound in real-time pricing pipeline. We observed that our approach improves precise anchor coverage by up to 46.6% in high-vulnerability item subsets ",
