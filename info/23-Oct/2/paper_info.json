    "abstract": "Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a de-facto technology for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, promising very low energy consumption. However, this low energy consumption accounts only for the radio part, and it overlooks the energy consumption of other hardware and software components. Monitoring and predicting the energy consumption of IoT nodes after deployment can substantially aid in ensuring low energy consumption, calculating the remaining battery lifetime, predicting needed energy for energy-harvesting nodes, and detecting anomalies. In this paper, we introduce a Long Short-Term Memory Projection (LSTMP)-based BLE energy consumption prediction framework together with a dataset for a healthcare application scenario where BLE is widely adopted. Unlike radio-focused theoretical energy models, our framework provides a comprehensive energy consumption prediction, considering all components of the IoT node, including the radio, sensor as well as microcontroller unit (MCU). Our measurement-based results show that the proposed framework predicts the energy consumption of different BLE nodes with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of up to 12%, giving comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art energy consumption prediction with a five times smaller prediction model size.

Based on a spatio-temporal vehicle interaction graph, an observed traffic scenario can be transformed into the graph spectral domain by means of the multidimensional Graph Fourier Transformation. Since these spectral scenario representations have shown to successfully incorporate the complex and interactive nature of traffic scenarios, the beneficial feature representation is employed for the purpose of predicting vehicle trajectories. This work introduces GFTNNv2, a deep learning network predicting vehicle trajectories in the graph spectral domain. Evaluation of the GFTNNv2 on the publicly available datasets highD and NGSIM shows a performance gain of up to 25% in comparison to state-of-the-art prediction approaches. ",

    "abstract": "A wireless communications system usually consists of a transmitter which transmits the information and a receiver which recovers the original information from the received distorted signal. Deep learning (DL) has been used to improve the performance of the receiver in complicated channel environments and state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance has been achieved. However, its robustness has not been investigated. In order to evaluate the robustness of DL-based information recovery models under adversarial circumstances, we investigate adversarial attacks on the SOTA DL-based information recovery model, i.e., DeepReceiver. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem with power and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) constraints. We design different adversarial attack methods according to the adversary's knowledge of DeepReceiver's model and/or testing samples. Extensive experiments show that the DeepReceiver is vulnerable to the designed attack methods in all of the considered scenarios. Even in the scenario of both model and test sample restricted, the adversary can attack the DeepReceiver and increase its bit error rate (BER) above 10%. It can also be found that the DeepReceiver is vulnerable to adversarial perturbations even with very low power and limited PAPR. These results suggest that defense measures should be taken to enhance the robustness of DeepReceiver. ",

Within each dimension, we identify and define relevant components and attributes, establishing a clear hierarchical structure. Moreover, we illustrate the relationships and dependencies among the identified components, highlighting the interplay between governance models, hardware architectures, networking protocols, token mechanisms, and distributed ledger technologies.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a high demand for accelerating and improving the detection of automatic cadastral mapping. As this problem is in its starting point, there are many methods of computer vision and deep learning that have not been considered yet. In this paper, we focus on deep learning and provide three geometric post-processing methods that improve the quality of the work. Our framework includes two parts, each of which consists of a few phases. Our solution to this problem uses instance segmentation. In the first part, we use Mask R-CNN with the backbone of pre-trained ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset. In the second phase, we apply three geometric post-processing methods to the output of the first part to get better overall output. Here, we also use computational geometry to introduce a new method for simplifying lines which we call it pocket-based simplification algorithm. For evaluating the quality of our solution, we use popular formulas in this field which are recall, precision and F-score. The highest recall we gain is 95 percent which also maintains high Precision of 72 percent. This resulted in an F-score of 82 percent. Implementing instance segmentation using Mask R-CNN with some geometric post-processes to its output gives us promising results for this field. Also, results show that pocket-based simplification algorithms work better for simplifying lines than Douglas-Puecker algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning protects users' data privacy through sharing users' local model parameters (instead of raw data) with a server. However, when massive users train a large machine learning model through federated learning, the dynamically varying and often heavy communication overhead can put significant pressure on the network operator. The operator may choose to dynamically change the network prices in response, which will eventually affect the payoffs of the server and users. This paper considers the under-explored yet important issue of the joint design of participation incentives (for encouraging users' contribution to federated learning) and network pricing (for managing network resources). Due to heterogeneous users' private information and multi-dimensional decisions, the optimization problems in Stage I of multi-stage games are non-convex. Nevertheless, we are able to analytically derive the corresponding optimal contract and pricing mechanism through proper transformations of constraints, variables, and functions, under both vertical and horizontal interaction structures of the participants. We show that the vertical structure is better than the horizontal one, as it avoids the interests misalignment between the server and the network operator. Numerical results based on real-world datasets show that our proposed mechanisms decrease server's cost by up to 24.87% comparing with the state-of-the-art benchmarks. ",

Our proposed method builds upon physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) trained with a hybrid loss function that combines observed data with simulated data generated by a known (approximate) physical model. Experimental results on an orbit restitution problem demonstrate that our approach surpasses the performance of standard PINNs, providing improved accuracy and robustness. ",

In addition, there are significant interactions between serum metabolites and duration of diabetes. We develop a predictive model by XGB algorithm to screen for DN.

Diabetic nephropathy, one of the chronic complication of diabetes, adversely affects the kidneys, leading to kidney damage. Diagnosing diabetic nephropathy involves considering various criteria, one of which is the presence of a pathologically significant quantity of albumin in urine, known as albuminuria. Thus, early prediction of albuminuria in diabetic patients holds the potential for timely preventive measures. This study aimed to develop a supervised learning model to predict the risk of developing albuminuria in T2DM patients. The selected supervised learning algorithms included Na\\\"ive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Our private dataset, comprising 184 entries of diabetes complications risk factors, was used to train the algorithms. It consisted of 10 attributes as features and 1 attribute as the target (albuminuria). Upon conducting the experiments, the MLP demonstrated superior performance compared to the other algorithms. It achieved accuracy and f1-score values as high as 0.74 and 0.75, respectively, making it suitable for screening purposes in predicting albuminuria in T2DM. Nonetheless, further studies are warranted to enhance the model's performance. ",

Recent works have extended GPs to model scalar and vector quantities distributed over non-Euclidean domains, including smooth manifolds appearing in numerous fields such as computer vision, dynamical systems, and neuroscience. However, these approaches assume that the manifold underlying the data is known, limiting their practical utility. We introduce RVGP, a generalisation of GPs for learning vector signals over latent Riemannian manifolds. Our method uses positional encoding with eigenfunctions of the connection Laplacian, associated with the tangent bundle, readily derived from common graph-based approximation of data. We demonstrate that RVGP possesses global regularity over the manifold, which allows it to super-resolve and inpaint vector fields while preserving singularities. Furthermore, we use RVGP to reconstruct high-density neural dynamics derived from low-density EEG recordings in healthy individuals and Alzheimer's patients. We show that vector field singularities are important disease markers and that their reconstruction leads to a comparable classification accuracy of disease states to high-density recordings. Thus, our method overcomes a significant practical limitation in experimental and clinical applications. ",

Here, we investigate if scale can have a similar impact for models designed to aid small molecule drug discovery. We address this question through a large-scale and systematic analysis of how DNN size, data diet, and learning routines interact to impact accuracy on our Phenotypic Chemistry Arena (Pheno-CA) benchmark: a diverse set of drug development tasks posed on image-based high content screening data. Surprisingly, we find that DNNs explicitly supervised to solve tasks in the Pheno-CA do not continuously improve as their data and model size is scaled-up. To address this issue, we introduce a novel precursor task, the Inverse Biological Process (IBP), which is designed to resemble the causal objective functions that have proven successful for NLP. We indeed find that DNNs first trained with IBP then probed for performance on the Pheno-CA significantly outperform task-supervised DNNs. More importantly, the performance of these IBP-trained DNNs monotonically improves with data and model scale. Our findings reveal that the DNN ingredients needed to accurately solve small molecule drug development tasks are already in our hands, and project how much more experimental data is needed to achieve any desired level of improvement. We release our Pheno-CA benchmark and code to encourage further study of neural scaling laws for small molecule drug discovery. ",

The ability for such field robots to proactively identify and avoid failures is thus crucial for ensuring efficiency and avoiding damage. However, the cluttered field environment introduces various sources of noise (such as sensor occlusions) that make proactive anomaly detection difficult. Existing approaches can show poor performance in sensor occlusion scenarios as they typically do not explicitly model occlusions and only leverage current sensory inputs. In this work, we present an attention-based recurrent neural network architecture for proactive anomaly detection that fuses current sensory inputs and planned control actions with a latent representation of prior robot state. We enhance our model with an explicitly-learned model of sensor occlusion that is used to modulate the use of our latent representation of prior robot state. Our method shows improved anomaly detection performance and enables mobile field robots to display increased resilience to predicting false positives regarding navigation failure during periods of sensor occlusion, particularly in cases where all sensors are briefly occluded.

We first present an innovative method for deriving the least conservative robust safe control under additive multi-modal uncertainties. Next, we propose a strategy to identify a locally least-conservative robust safe control under multiplicative uncertainties. Following these, we introduce a unique safety index synthesis method. This provides the foundation for a robust safe controller that ensures a high probability of realizability under control limits and multi-modal uncertainties. Experiments on a simulated Segway validate our approach, showing consistent realizability and less conservatism than controllers designed using uni-modal uncertainty methods.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a generic and unified model of the power flow (PF) problem for multiterminal hybrid AC/DC networks. The proposed model is an extension of the standard AC-PF. The DC network is treated as an AC one and, in addition to the Slack, PV and PQ nodes, four new node types are introduced to model the DC buses and the buses connecting the AC/DC interfacing converters (IC). The unified model is solved using the Newton-Raphson method. The extended PF equations can be used in the presence of multiple ICs operating under different control modes. Compared to other recent works, the proposed method allows multiple ICs to regulate the DC voltage simultaneously. This corresponds to more realistic operational conditions that ensure redundancy and allow for more flexible control of the hybrid grid. The proposed model can be used for networks under unbalanced conditions and allows for an intentionally negative sequence power injection. In addition to the operational advantages of this method, it is shown that the computational performance of the proposed method is one order of magnitude better than that of other methods presented in the existing recent literature while having the same accuracy.

    "abstract": "Motion planning under sensing uncertainty is critical for robots in unstructured environments to guarantee safety for both the robot and any nearby humans. Most work on planning under uncertainty does not scale to high-dimensional robots such as manipulators, assumes simplified geometry of the robot or environment, or requires per-object knowledge of noise. Instead, we propose a method that directly models sensor-specific aleatoric uncertainty to find safe motions for high-dimensional systems in complex environments, without exact knowledge of environment geometry. We combine a novel implicit neural model of stochastic signed distance functions with a hierarchical optimization-based motion planner to plan low-risk motions without sacrificing path quality. Our method also explicitly bounds the risk of the path, offering trustworthiness. We empirically validate that our method produces safe motions and accurate risk bounds and is safer than baseline approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Copy detection patterns (CDP) present an efficient technique for product protection against counterfeiting. However, the complexity of studying CDP production variability often results in time-consuming and costly procedures, limiting CDP scalability. Recent advancements in computer modelling, notably the concept of a \"digital twin\" for printing-imaging channels, allow for enhanced scalability and the optimization of authentication systems. Yet, the development of an accurate digital twin is far from trivial. This paper extends previous research which modelled a printing-imaging channel using a machine learning-based digital twin for CDP. This model, built upon an information-theoretic framework known as \"Turbo\", demonstrated superior performance over traditional generative models such as CycleGAN and pix2pix. However, the emerging field of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) presents a potential advancement in generative models due to its ability to stochastically model the inherent randomness of the printing-imaging process, and its impressive performance in image-to-image translation tasks. This study aims at comparing the capabilities of the Turbo framework and DDPM on the same CDP datasets, with the goal of establishing the real-world benefits of DDPM models for digital twin applications in CDP security. Furthermore, the paper seeks to evaluate the generative potential of the studied models in the context of mobile phone data acquisition. Despite the increased complexity of DDPM methods when compared to traditional approaches, our study highlights their advantages and explores their potential for future applications. ",

    "abstract": "Real-time video streaming relies on rate control mechanisms to adapt video bitrate to network capacity while maintaining high utilization and low delay. However, the current video rate controllers, such as Google Congestion Control (GCC) in WebRTC, are very slow to respond to network changes, leading to link under-utilization and latency spikes. While recent delay-based congestion control algorithms promise high efficiency and rapid adaptation to variable conditions, low-latency video applications have been unable to adopt these schemes due to the intertwined relationship between video encoders and rate control in current systems. This paper introduces Vidaptive, a new rate control mechanism designed for low-latency video applications. Vidaptive decouples packet transmission decisions from encoder output, injecting dummy padding traffic as needed to treat video streams akin to backlogged flows controlled by a delay-based congestion controller. Vidaptive then adapts the frame rate, resolution, and target bitrate of the encoder to align the video bitrate with the congestion controller's sending rate. Our evaluations atop WebRTC show that, across a set of cellular traces, Vidaptive achieves ~2x higher video bitrate and 1.6 dB higher PSNR, and it reduces 95th-percentile frame latency by 2.7s with a slight increase in median frame latency.

Our method conducts late-to-early feature fusion in a recurrent manner. This is achieved by enforcing window-based attention blocks upon temporally calibrated and aligned sparse pillar tokens. Leveraging bird's eye view foreground pillar segmentation, we reduce the number of sparse history features that our model needs to fuse into its current frame by 10$\\times$. We also propose a stochastic-length FrameDrop training technique, which generalizes the model to variable frame lengths at inference for improved performance without retraining. We evaluate our method on the widely adopted Waymo Open Dataset and demonstrate improvement on 3D object detection against the baseline model, especially for the challenging category of large objects.

This vulnerability has implications for real-world applications. While much research has been conducted, the underlying reasons why neural networks fall prey to adversarial attacks are not yet fully understood. Central to our study, which explores up to five attack algorithms across three datasets, is the identification of human-identifiable features in adversarial perturbations. Additionally, we uncover two distinct effects manifesting within human-identifiable features. Specifically, the masking effect is prominent in untargeted attacks, while the generation effect is more common in targeted attacks. Using pixel-level annotations, we extract such features and demonstrate their ability to compromise target models. In addition, our findings indicate a notable extent of similarity in perturbations across different attack algorithms when averaged over multiple models. This work also provides insights into phenomena associated with adversarial perturbations, such as transferability and model interpretability. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind adversarial attacks and offers insights for the development of more resilient defense strategies for neural networks.

In this work, we focus on algorithmic recourse in time series anomaly detection, which is to recommend fixing actions on abnormal time series with a minimum cost so that domain experts can understand how to fix the abnormal behavior.

    "abstract": "In industrial defect segmentation tasks, while pixel accuracy and Intersection over Union (IoU) are commonly employed metrics to assess segmentation performance, the output consistency (also referred to equivalence) of the model is often overlooked. Even a small shift in the input image can yield significant fluctuations in the segmentation results. Existing methodologies primarily focus on data augmentation or anti-aliasing to enhance the network's robustness against translational transformations, but their shift equivalence performs poorly on the test set or is susceptible to nonlinear activation functions. Additionally, the variations in boundaries resulting from the translation of input images are consistently disregarded, thus imposing further limitations on the shift equivalence. In response to this particular challenge, a novel pair of down/upsampling layers called component attention polyphase sampling (CAPS) is proposed as a replacement for the conventional sampling layers in CNNs. To mitigate the effect of image boundary variations on the equivalence, an adaptive windowing module is designed in CAPS to adaptively filter out the border pixels of the image. Furthermore, a component attention module is proposed to fuse all downsampled features to improve the segmentation performance. The experimental results on the micro surface defect (MSD) dataset and four real-world industrial defect datasets demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits higher equivalence and segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.Our code will be available at https://github.com/xiaozhen228/CAPS.

There has been significant efforts, both in academia and in industry, to develop annotated resources that capture various aspects of problematic content. Due to researchers' diverse objectives, the annotations are inconsistent and hence, reports of progress on detection of problematic content are fragmented. This pattern is expected to persist unless we consolidate resources considering the dynamic nature of the problem. We propose integrating the available resources, and leveraging their dynamic nature to break this pattern. In this paper, we introduce a continual learning benchmark and framework for problematic content detection comprising over 84 related tasks encompassing 15 annotation schemas from 8 sources. Our benchmark creates a novel measure of progress: prioritizing the adaptability of classifiers to evolving tasks over excelling in specific tasks. To ensure the continuous relevance of our framework, we designed it so that new tasks can easily be integrated into the benchmark. Our baseline results demonstrate the potential of continual learning in capturing the evolving content and adapting to novel manifestations of problematic content. ",

A special property of these models is that they permit concept interventions, wherein users can correct mispredicted concepts and thus improve the model's performance. Recent work, however, has shown that intervention efficacy can be highly dependent on the order in which concepts are intervened on and on the model's architecture and training hyperparameters. We argue that this is rooted in a CBM's lack of train-time incentives for the model to be appropriately receptive to concept interventions. To address this, we propose Intervention-aware Concept Embedding models (IntCEMs), a novel CBM-based architecture and training paradigm that improves a model's receptiveness to test-time interventions. Our model learns a concept intervention policy in an end-to-end fashion from where it can sample meaningful intervention trajectories at train-time. This conditions IntCEMs to effectively select and receive concept interventions when deployed at test-time. Our experiments show that IntCEMs significantly outperform state-of-the-art concept-interpretable models when provided with test-time concept interventions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "By facilitating communication among multiple agents, collaborative perception can substantially boost each agent's perception ability. However, temporal asynchrony among agents is inevitable in real-world due to communication delays, interruptions, and clock misalignments. This issue causes information mismatch during multi-agent fusion, seriously shaking the foundation of collaboration. To address this issue, we propose CoBEVFlow, an asynchrony-robust collaborative 3D perception system based on bird's eye view (BEV) flow. The key intuition of CoBEVFlow is to compensate motions to align asynchronous collaboration messages sent by multiple agents. To model the motion in a scene, we propose BEV flow, which is a collection of the motion vector corresponding to each spatial location. Based on BEV flow, asynchronous perceptual features can be reassigned to appropriate positions, mitigating the impact of asynchrony. CoBEVFlow has two advantages: (i) CoBEVFlow can handle asynchronous collaboration messages sent at irregular, continuous time stamps without discretization; and (ii) with BEV flow, CoBEVFlow only transports the original perceptual features, instead of generating new perceptual features, avoiding additional noises. To validate CoBEVFlow's efficacy, we create IRregular V2V(IRV2V), the first synthetic collaborative perception dataset with various temporal asynchronies that simulate different real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on both IRV2V and the real-world dataset DAIR-V2X show that CoBEVFlow consistently outperforms other baselines and is robust in extremely asynchronous settings.

In G4SATBench, we meticulously curate a large and diverse set of SAT datasets comprising 7 problems with 3 difficulty levels and benchmark a broad range of GNN models across various prediction tasks, training objectives, and inference algorithms. To explore the learning abilities and comprehend the strengths and limitations of GNN-based SAT solvers, we also compare their solving processes with the heuristics in search-based SAT solvers. Our empirical results provide valuable insights into the performance of GNN-based SAT solvers and further suggest that existing GNN models can effectively learn a solving strategy akin to greedy local search but struggle to learn backtracking search in the latent space.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of safe control synthesis of general controlled nonlinear systems in the presence of bounded additive disturbances. Towards this aim, we first construct a governing augmented state space model consisting of the equations of motion of the original system, the integral control law and the nonlinear disturbance observer. Next, we propose the concept of Disturbance Observer based Integral Control Barrier Functions (DO-ICBFs) which we utilize to synthesize safe control inputs. The characterization of the safe controller is obtained after modifying the governing integral control law with an additive auxiliary control input which is computed via the solution of a quadratic problem. In contrast to prior methods in the relevant literature which can be unnecessarily cautious due to their reliance on the worst case disturbance estimates, our DO-ICBF based controller uses the available control effort frugally by leveraging the disturbance estimates computed by the disturbance observer. By construction, the proposed DO-ICBF based controller can ensure state and input constraint satisfaction at all times. Further, we propose Higher Order DO-ICBFs that extend our proposed method to nonlinear systems with higher relative degree with respect to the auxiliary control input. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to validate our proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "Traditional grid analytics are model-based, relying strongly on accurate models of power systems, especially the dynamic models of generators, controllers, loads and other dynamic components. However, acquiring thorough power system models can be impractical in real operation due to inaccessible system parameters and privacy of consumers, which necessitate data-driven dynamic equivalencing of unknown subsystems. Learning reliable dynamic equivalent models for the external systems from SCADA and PMU data, however, is a long-standing intractable problem in power system analysis due to complicated nonlinearity and unforeseeable dynamic modes of power systems. This paper advances a practical application of neural dynamic equivalence (NeuDyE) called Driving Port NeuDyE (DP-NeuDyE), which exploits physics-informed machine learning and neural-ordinary-differential-equations (ODE-NET) to discover a dynamic equivalence of external power grids while preserving its dynamic behaviors after disturbances. The new contributions are threefold: A NeuDyE formulation to enable a continuous-time, data-driven dynamic equivalence of power systems, saving the effort and expense of acquiring inaccessible system; An introduction of a Physics-Informed NeuDyE learning (PI-NeuDyE) to actively control the closed-loop accuracy of NeuDyE; and A DP-NeuDyE to reduce the number of inputs required for the training. We conduct extensive case studies on the NPCC system to validate the generalizability and accuracy of both PI-NeuDyE and DP-NeuDyE, which span a multitude of scenarios, differing in the time required for fault clearance, the specific fault locations, and the limitations of data. Test results have demonstrated the scalability and practicality of NeuDyE, showing its potential to be used in ISO and utility control centers for online transient stability analysis and for planning purposes.

    "abstract": "Untrustworthy users can misuse image generators to synthesize high-quality deepfakes and engage in online spam or disinformation campaigns. Watermarking deters misuse by marking generated content with a hidden message, enabling its detection using a secret watermarking key. A core security property of watermarking is robustness, which states that an attacker can only evade detection by substantially degrading image quality. Assessing robustness requires designing an adaptive attack for the specific watermarking algorithm. A challenge when evaluating watermarking algorithms and their (adaptive) attacks is to determine whether an adaptive attack is optimal, i.e., it is the best possible attack. We solve this problem by defining an objective function and then approach adaptive attacks as an optimization problem. The core idea of our adaptive attacks is to replicate secret watermarking keys locally by creating surrogate keys that are differentiable and can be used to optimize the attack's parameters. We demonstrate for Stable Diffusion models that such an attacker can break all five surveyed watermarking methods at negligible degradation in image quality. These findings emphasize the need for more rigorous robustness testing against adaptive, learnable attackers. ",

In this paper, we propose Model2Scene, a novel paradigm that learns free 3D scene representation from Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models and languages. The main challenges are the domain gaps between the CAD models and the real scene's objects, including model-to-scene (from a single model to the scene) and synthetic-to-real (from synthetic model to real scene's object). To handle the above challenges, Model2Scene first simulates a crowded scene by mixing data-augmented CAD models. Next, we propose a novel feature regularization operation, termed Deep Convex-hull Regularization (DCR), to project point features into a unified convex hull space, reducing the domain gap. Ultimately, we impose contrastive loss on language embedding and the point features of CAD models to pre-train the 3D network. Extensive experiments verify the learned 3D scene representation is beneficial for various downstream tasks, including label-free 3D object salient detection, label-efficient 3D scene perception and zero-shot 3D semantic segmentation. Notably, Model2Scene yields impressive label-free 3D object salient detection with an average mAP of 46.08\\% and 55.49\\% on the ScanNet and S3DIS datasets, respectively.

However, collecting training data for the FNO is a costly bottleneck in practice, because it often demands expensive physical simulations. To overcome this problem, we propose Multi-Resolution Active learning of FNO (MRA-FNO), which can dynamically select the input functions and resolutions to lower the data cost as much as possible while optimizing the learning efficiency. Specifically, we propose a probabilistic multi-resolution FNO and use ensemble Monte-Carlo to develop an effective posterior inference algorithm. To conduct active learning, we maximize a utility-cost ratio as the acquisition function to acquire new examples and resolutions at each step. We use moment matching and the matrix determinant lemma to enable tractable, efficient utility computation. Furthermore, we develop a cost annealing framework to avoid over-penalizing high-resolution queries at the early stage. The over-penalization is severe when the cost difference is significant between the resolutions, which renders active learning often stuck at low-resolution queries and inferior performance. Our method overcomes this problem and applies to general multi-fidelity active learning and optimization problems. We have shown the advantage of our method in several benchmark operator learning tasks. ",

    "abstract": "To obtain a near-optimal policy with fewer interactions in Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising approach involves the combination of offline RL, which enhances sample efficiency by leveraging offline datasets, and online RL, which explores informative transitions by interacting with the environment. Offline-to-Online (O2O) RL provides a paradigm for improving an offline trained agent within limited online interactions. However, due to the significant distribution shift between online experiences and offline data, most offline RL algorithms suffer from performance drops and fail to achieve stable policy improvement in O2O adaptation. To address this problem, we propose the Robust Offline-to-Online (RO2O) algorithm, designed to enhance offline policies through uncertainty and smoothness, and to mitigate the performance drop in online adaptation. Specifically, RO2O incorporates Q-ensemble for uncertainty penalty and adversarial samples for policy and value smoothness, which enable RO2O to maintain a consistent learning procedure in online adaptation without requiring special changes to the learning objective. Theoretical analyses in linear MDPs demonstrate that the uncertainty and smoothness lead to a tighter optimality bound in O2O against distribution shift. Experimental results illustrate the superiority of RO2O in facilitating stable offline-to-online learning and achieving significant improvement with limited online interactions. ",

Although these problems have been studied extensively, predicting multiple simultaneously occurring events can be challenging. For instance, more often than not, a patient gets admitted to a hospital with multiple conditions at a time. Similarly people buy more than one stock and multiple news breaks out at the same time. Moreover, these events do not occur at discrete time intervals, and forecasting event sets in the continuous time domain remains an open problem. Naive approaches for extending the existing TPP models for solving this problem lead to dealing with an exponentially large number of events or ignoring set dependencies among events. In this work, we propose a scalable and efficient approach based on TPPs to solve this problem. Our proposed approach incorporates contextual event embeddings, temporal information, and domain features to model the temporal event sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, showing that our model outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction metrics and computational efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that solves the problem of predicting event set intensities in the continuous time domain by using TPPs. ",

This hierarchy is located between the complexity classes $\\mathbf{P}$ and $\\mathbf{P/poly}$. Then, we generalize this result to the case of evolving networks. A similar hierarchy of Kolomogorov-based complexity classes of evolving networks is obtained. This hierarchy also lies between $\\mathbf{P}$ and $\\mathbf{P/poly}$.

An infinite hierarchy of stochastic networks based on the Kolmogorov complexity of their probabilities is therefore achieved.

The remarkable performance of this system optimizes the process of extracting textual and tabular data from document images. Its prospective applications are not limited to document analysis but can encompass unstructured data from diverse sources, such as audio data.

    "abstract": "The reliability of a learning model is key to the successful deployment of machine learning in various applications. Creating a robust model, particularly one unaffected by adversarial attacks, requires a comprehensive understanding of the adversarial examples phenomenon. However, it is difficult to describe the phenomenon due to the complicated nature of the problems in machine learning. It has been shown that adversarial training can improve the robustness of the hypothesis. However, this improvement comes at the cost of decreased performance on natural samples. Hence, it has been suggested that robustness and accuracy of a hypothesis are at odds with each other. In this paper, we put forth the alternative proposal that it is the continuity of a hypothesis that is incompatible with its robustness and accuracy. In other words, a continuous function cannot effectively learn the optimal robust hypothesis. To this end, we will introduce a framework for a rigorous study of harmonic and holomorphic hypothesis in learning theory terms and provide empirical evidence that continuous hypotheses does not perform as well as discontinuous hypotheses in some common machine learning tasks. From a practical point of view, our results suggests that a robust and accurate learning rule would train different continuous hypotheses for different regions of the domain. From a theoretical perspective, our analysis explains the adversarial examples phenomenon as a conflict between the continuity of a sequence of functions and its uniform convergence to a discontinuous function.

This connection has reignited interest in comprehending the specific graph properties effectively distinguishable by the $k$WL test. A central focus of research in this field revolves around determining the least dimensionality $k$, for which $k$WL can discern graphs with different number of occurrences of a pattern graph $P$. We refer to such a least $k$ as the WL-dimension of this pattern counting problem. This inquiry traditionally delves into two distinct counting problems related to patterns: subgraph counting and induced subgraph counting. Intriguingly, despite their initial appearance as separate challenges with seemingly divergent approaches, both of these problems are interconnected components of a more comprehensive problem: \"graph motif parameters\". In this paper, we provide a precise characterization of the WL-dimension of labeled graph motif parameters. As specific instances of this result, we obtain characterizations of the WL-dimension of the subgraph counting and induced subgraph counting problem for every labeled pattern $P$. We additionally demonstrate that in cases where the $k$WL test distinguishes between graphs with varying occurrences of a pattern $P$, the exact number of occurrences of $P$ can be computed uniformly using only local information of the last layer of a corresponding GNN. We finally delve into the challenge of recognizing the WL-dimension of various graph parameters.

The resulting landscape of choices regarding numerical schemes for a given system of PDEs can thus easily appear daunting for an application expert that is familiar with the relevant physics, but not necessarily with the numerics. Bespoke high performance schemes in particular pose a substantial hurdle for domain scientists regarding their theory and implementation. Here, we propose a unifying scheme for grid based approximation methods to address this issue.

We introduce a fixed set of input parameters, amongst them for example the governing equations and the hardware configuration. This method not only helps to identify and assemble suitable schemes, but enables the unique combination of multiple methods on a per field basis.

    "abstract": "In recent years new deep learning approaches to solve combinatorial optimization problems, in particular NP-hard Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), have been proposed. The most impactful of these methods are sequential neural construction approaches which are usually trained via reinforcement learning. Due to the high training costs of these models, they usually are trained on limited instance sizes (e.g. serving 100 customers) and later applied to vastly larger instance size (e.g. 2000 customers). By means of a systematic scale-up study we show that even state-of-the-art neural construction methods are outperformed by simple heuristics, failing to generalize to larger problem instances. We propose to use the ruin recreate principle that alternates between completely destroying a localized part of the solution and then recreating an improved variant. In this way, neural construction methods like POMO are never applied to the global problem but just in the reconstruction step, which only involves partial problems much closer in size to their original training instances. In thorough experiments on four datasets of varying distributions and modalities we show that our neural ruin recreate approach outperforms alternative forms of improving construction methods such as sampling and beam search and in several experiments also advanced local search approaches.

    "abstract": "Event logs are invaluable for conducting process mining projects, offering insights into process improvement and data-driven decision-making. However, data quality issues affect the correctness and trustworthiness of these insights, making preprocessing tasks a necessity. Despite the recognized importance, the execution of preprocessing tasks remains ad-hoc, lacking support. This paper presents a systematic literature review that establishes a comprehensive repository of preprocessing tasks and their usage in case studies. We identify six high-level and 20 low-level preprocessing tasks in case studies. Log filtering, transformation, and abstraction are commonly used, while log enriching, integration, and reduction are less frequent. These results can be considered a first step in contributing to more structured, transparent event log preprocessing, enhancing process mining reliability. ",

    "abstract": "Existing multi-relational graph neural networks use one of two strategies for identifying informative relations: either they reduce this problem to low-level weight learning, or they rely on handcrafted chains of relational dependencies, called meta-paths. However, the former approach faces challenges in the presence of many relations (e.g., knowledge graphs), while the latter requires substantial domain expertise to identify relevant meta-paths. In this work we propose a novel approach to learn meta-paths and meta-path GNNs that are highly accurate based on a small number of informative meta-paths. Key element of our approach is a scoring function for measuring the potential informativeness of a relation in the incremental construction of the meta-path. Our experimental evaluation shows that the approach manages to correctly identify relevant meta-paths even with a large number of relations, and substantially outperforms existing multi-relational GNNs on synthetic and real-world experiments.

However, mobile app recommender systems have emerged as a helpful tool in simplifying this process. But there is a drawback to employing app recommender systems. These systems need access to user data, which is a serious security violation. While users seek accurate opinions, they do not want to compromise their privacy in the process. We address this issue by developing SAppKG, an end-to-end user privacy-preserving knowledge graph architecture for mobile app recommendation based on knowledge graph models such as SAppKG-S and SAppKG-D, that utilized the interaction data and side information of app attributes. We tested the proposed model on real-world data from the Google Play app store, using precision, recall, mean absolute precision, and mean reciprocal rank. We found that the proposed model improved results on all four metrics. We also compared the proposed model to baseline models and found that it outperformed them on all four metrics. ",

As a result, advancements in higher-order processing can accelerate the growth of various fields requiring structured data. Current approaches typically represent these interactions using hypergraphs. We enhance this representation by introducing cellular sheaves for hypergraphs, a mathematical construction that adds extra structure to the conventional hypergraph while maintaining their local, higherorder connectivity. Drawing inspiration from existing Laplacians in the literature, we develop two unique formulations of sheaf hypergraph Laplacians: linear and non-linear. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that incorporating sheaves into the hypergraph Laplacian provides a more expressive inductive bias than standard hypergraph diffusion, creating a powerful instrument for effectively modelling complex data structures. We employ these sheaf hypergraph Laplacians to design two categories of models: Sheaf Hypergraph Neural Networks and Sheaf Hypergraph Convolutional Networks. These models generalize classical Hypergraph Networks often found in the literature. Through extensive experimentation, we show that this generalization significantly improves performance, achieving top results on multiple benchmark datasets for hypergraph node classification. ",

Yet, their ability to work with formal languages representing data, specifically within the realm of knowledge graph engineering, remains under-investigated. To evaluate the proficiency of various LLMs, we created a set of five tasks that probe their ability to parse, understand, analyze, and create knowledge graphs serialized in Turtle syntax. These tasks, each embodying distinct degrees of complexity and being able to scale with the size of the problem, have been integrated into our automated evaluation system, the LLM-KG-Bench.

This analysis offers an in-depth understanding of the strengths and shortcomings of LLMs in relation to their application within RDF knowledge graph engineering workflows utilizing Turtle representation. While our findings show that the latest commercial models outperform their forerunners in terms of proficiency with the Turtle language, they also reveal an apparent weakness.

To address the problem, we introduce a novel hybrid explicit-implicit 3D representation, Facial Model Conditioned Neural Radiance Field, which integrates the expressiveness of NeRF and the prior information from the parametric template. At the core of our representation, a synthetic-renderings-based condition method is proposed to fuse the prior information from the parametric model into the implicit field without constraining its topological flexibility. Besides, based on the hybrid representation, we properly overcome the inconsistent shape issue presented in existing methods and improve the animation stability. Moreover, by adopting an overall GAN-based architecture using an image-to-image translation network, we achieve high-resolution, realistic and view-consistent synthesis of dynamic head appearance. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance for 3D head avatar animation compared with previous methods. ",

In the context of landmark detection, particularly in cephalometrics, it has been observed that existing methods often lack standardized pipelines and well-designed bias reduction processes, which significantly impact their performance. In this paper, we revisit a related task, human pose estimation (HPE), which shares numerous similarities with cephalometric landmark detection (CLD), and emphasize the potential for transferring techniques from the former field to benefit the latter. Motivated by this insight, we have developed a robust and adaptable benchmark based on the well-established HPE codebase known as MMPose. This benchmark can serve as a dependable baseline for achieving exceptional CLD performance. Furthermore, we introduce an upscaling design within the framework to further enhance performance. This enhancement involves the incorporation of a lightweight and efficient super-resolution module, which generates heatmap predictions on high-resolution features and leads to further performance refinement, benefiting from its ability to reduce quantization bias.

Our proposed method, Robust and Enhanced COMBINER (RECOMBINER), addresses these issues by 1) enriching the variational approximation while maintaining its computational cost via a linear reparameterization of the INR weights, 2) augmenting our INRs with learnable positional encodings that enable them to adapt to local details and 3) splitting high-resolution data into patches to increase robustness and utilizing expressive hierarchical priors to capture dependency across patches. We conduct extensive experiments across several data modalities, showcasing that RECOMBINER achieves competitive results with the best INR-based methods and even outperforms autoencoder-based codecs on low-resolution images at low bitrates.

In order to improve the spectrum efficiency of the whole system, the spectrum of vehicle-to-infrastructure links is reused by vehicle-to-vehicle links. To this end, we model it as a problem of deep reinforcement learning and tackle it with proximal policy optimization. A considerable number of interactions are often required for training an agent with good performance, so simulation-based training is commonly used in communication networks. Nevertheless, severe performance degradation may occur when the agent is directly deployed in the real world, even though it can perform well on the simulator, due to the reality gap between the simulation and the real environments. To address this issue, we make preliminary efforts by proposing an algorithm based on meta reinforcement learning. This algorithm enables the agent to rapidly adapt to a new task with the knowledge extracted from similar tasks, leading to fewer interactions and less training time. Numerical results show that our method achieves near-optimal performance and exhibits rapid convergence. ",

We validate the accuracy of these simulations for predicting the performance of BFT systems by comparing simulation results with measurements of real systems deployed on cloud infrastructures.

The secondary control of local inverter includes consensus-based voltage and current regulators utilizing relative information from neighboring inverters. This distributed control approach relies on localized control and a sparse communication network, making it susceptible to malicious cyber-physical attacks that can impair consensus performance and potentially destabilize the overall microgrid. In contrast to existing solutions that are limited to addressing either bounded faults, noises or unbounded attacks with bounded first-order time derivatives, we aim to surpass these constraints and enhance the defense capabilities of counteracting cyber-physical attacks by enabling the AC microgrids adopting the proposed strategies to withstand a much wider range of unbounded cyber-attack signals. Fully distributed attack-resilient secondary defense strategies are developed for AC microgrids to counteract the detrimental effects of generally unbounded attacks on control input channels. Rigorous proofs using Lyapunov techniques demonstrate that the proposed defense strategies accomplish the uniformly ultimately bounded convergence on frequency regulation and achieve voltage containment and active power sharing simultaneously for multi-inverter-based AC microgrids in the face of generally unbounded attacks. The proposed defense strategies are validated on a modified IEEE 34-bus test feeder benchmark system incorporating four inverter-based DERs. ",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been shown to be vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where malicious data is injected into the dataset to cause the recommender system to provide biased recommendations. To defend against such attacks, various robust learning methods have been proposed. However, most methods are model-specific or attack-specific, making them lack generality, while other methods, such as adversarial training, are oriented towards evasion attacks and thus have a weak defense strength in poisoning attacks. In this paper, we propose a general method, Real-time Vicinal Defense (RVD), which leverages neighboring training data to fine-tune the model before making a recommendation for each user. RVD works in the inference phase to ensure the robustness of the specific sample in real-time, so there is no need to change the model structure and training process, making it more practical. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RVD effectively mitigates targeted poisoning attacks across various models without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, the defensive effect can be further amplified when our method is combined with other strategies. ",

This paper proposes a novel few-shot domain adaptation (FSDA) method named Disentangled Legal Content for Charge Prediction (DLCCP). Compared with existing FSDA works, which solely perform instance-level alignment without considering the negative impact of text style information existing in latent features, DLCCP (1) disentangles the content and style representations for better domain-invariant legal content learning with carefully designed optimization goals for content and style spaces and, (2) employs the constitutive elements knowledge of charges to extract and align element-level and instance-level content representations simultaneously. We contribute the first publicly available non-PLLS dataset named NCCP for developing layperson-friendly charge prediction models.

    "abstract": "Pulmonary diseases rank prominently among the principal causes of death worldwide. Curing them will require, among other things, a better understanding of the many complex 3D tree-shaped structures within the pulmonary system, such as airways, arteries, and veins. In theory, they can be modeled using high-resolution image stacks. Unfortunately, standard CNN approaches operating on dense voxel grids are prohibitively expensive. To remedy this, we introduce a point-based approach that preserves graph connectivity of tree skeleton and incorporates an implicit surface representation. It delivers SOTA accuracy at a low computational cost and the resulting models have usable surfaces. Due to the scarcity of publicly accessible data, we have also curated an extensive dataset to evaluate our approach and will make it public. ",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first $\\epsilon$-differentially private algorithm with a non-trivial additive error for approximating the spectrum of the graph. One of the subroutines of our algorithm also precisely simulates the exponential mechanism over a non-convex set, which could be of independent interest given the recent interest in sampling from a {\\em log-concave distribution} defined over a convex set. Spectral approximation also allows us to approximate all possible $(S,T)$-cuts, but it incurs an error that depends on the maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$. We further show that using our sampler, we can also output a synthetic graph that approximates the sizes of all $(S,T)$-cuts on $n$ vertices weighted graph $G$ with $m$ edges while preserving $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy and an additive error of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{mn}/\\epsilon)$.

Our proposed approach is agnostic to either hallucination direction between LiDAR and 4D radar. We introduce multiple alignments on both spatial and feature levels to achieve simultaneous backbone refinement and hallucination generation. Specifically, spatial alignment is proposed to deal with the geometry discrepancy for better instance matching between LiDAR and radar. The feature alignment step further bridges the intrinsic attribute gap between the sensing modalities and stabilizes the training. The trained object detection models can deal with difficult detection cases better, even though only single-modal data is used as the input during the inference stage.

    "abstract": "The inherently diverse and uncertain nature of trajectories presents a formidable challenge in accurately modeling them. Motion prediction systems must effectively learn spatial and temporal information from the past to forecast the future trajectories of the agent. Many existing methods learn temporal motion via separate components within stacked models to capture temporal features. This paper introduces a novel framework, called Temporal Waypoint Dropping (TWD), that promotes explicit temporal learning through the waypoint dropping technique. Learning through waypoint dropping can compel the model to improve its understanding of temporal correlations among agents, thus leading to a significant enhancement in trajectory prediction. Trajectory prediction methods often operate under the assumption that observed trajectory waypoint sequences are complete, disregarding real-world scenarios where missing values may occur, which can influence their performance. Moreover, these models frequently exhibit a bias towards particular waypoint sequences when making predictions. Our TWD is capable of effectively addressing these issues. It incorporates stochastic and fixed processes that regularize projected past trajectories by strategically dropping waypoints based on temporal sequences. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TWD in forcing the model to learn complex temporal correlations among agents. Our approach can complement existing trajectory prediction methods to enhance prediction accuracy. We also evaluate our proposed method across three datasets: NBA Sports VU, ETH-UCY, and TrajNet++.

In order to retain customers and prevent revenue loss, it is important to provide high reliability guarantees for these services. One way to do this is by predicting outages in advance, which can help in reducing the severity as well as time to recovery. It is difficult to forecast critical failures due to the rarity of these events. Moreover, critical failures are ill-defined in terms of observable data. Our proposed method, Outage-Watch, defines critical service outages as deteriorations in the Quality of Service (QoS) captured by a set of metrics. Outage-Watch detects such outages in advance by using current system state to predict whether the QoS metrics will cross a threshold and initiate an extreme event. A mixture of Gaussian is used to model the distribution of the QoS metrics for flexibility and an extreme event regularizer helps in improving learning in tail of the distribution. An outage is predicted if the probability of any one of the QoS metrics crossing threshold changes significantly. Our evaluation on a real-world SaaS company dataset shows that Outage-Watch significantly outperforms traditional methods with an average AUC of 0.98. Additionally, Outage-Watch detects all the outages exhibiting a change in service metrics and reduces the Mean Time To Detection (MTTD) of outages by up to 88% when deployed in an enterprise cloud-service system, demonstrating efficacy of our proposed method.

The most effective method to make ANNs robust against these attacks is adversarial training, in which the training dataset is augmented with exemplary adversarial samples. Unfortunately, this approach has the drawback of increased training complexity since generating adversarial samples is very computationally demanding. In contrast to ANNs, humans are not susceptible to adversarial attacks. Therefore, in this work, we investigate whether biologically-plausible learning algorithms are more robust against adversarial attacks than BP. In particular, we present an extensive comparative analysis of the adversarial robustness of BP and \\textit{Present the Error to Perturb the Input To modulate Activity} (PEPITA), a recently proposed biologically-plausible learning algorithm, on various computer vision tasks. We observe that PEPITA has higher intrinsic adversarial robustness and, with adversarial training, has a more favourable natural-vs-adversarial performance trade-off as, for the same natural accuracies, PEPITA's adversarial accuracies decrease in average by 0.26% and BP's by 8.05%.

In recent years, AAC has quickly attracted research interest, with state-of-the-art systems now relying on a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) backbone powered by strong models such as Transformers. Following the macro-trend of applied machine learning research, in this work, we strive to improve the performance of seq2seq AAC models by extensively leveraging pretrained models and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we utilize BEATs to extract fine-grained audio features. Then, we employ Instructor LLM to fetch text embeddings of captions, and infuse their language-modality knowledge into BEATs audio features via an auxiliary InfoNCE loss function. Moreover, we propose a novel data augmentation method that uses ChatGPT to produce caption mix-ups (i.e., grammatical and compact combinations of two captions) which, together with the corresponding audio mixtures, increase not only the amount but also the complexity and diversity of training data. During inference, we propose to employ nucleus sampling and a hybrid reranking algorithm, which has not been explored in AAC research. Combining our efforts, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art 32.6 SPIDEr-FL score on the Clotho evaluation split, and wins the 2023 DCASE AAC challenge. ",

    "abstract": "The massive interest in deep neural networks (DNNs) for both computer vision and natural language processing has been sparked by the growth in computational power. However, this led to an increase in the memory footprint, to a point where it can be challenging to simply load a model on commodity devices such as mobile phones. To address this limitation, quantization is a favored solution as it maps high precision tensors to a low precision, memory efficient format. In terms of memory footprint reduction, its most effective variants are based on codebooks. These methods, however, suffer from two limitations. First, they either define a single codebook for each tensor, or use a memory-expensive mapping to multiple codebooks. Second, gradient descent optimization of the mapping favors jumps toward extreme values, hence not defining a proximal search. In this work, we propose to address these two limitations. First, we initially group similarly distributed neurons and leverage the re-ordered structure to either apply different scale factors to the different groups, or map weights that fall in these groups to several codebooks, without any mapping overhead. Second, stemming from this initialization, we propose a joint learning of the codebook and weight mappings that bears similarities with recent gradient-based post-training quantization techniques. Third, drawing estimation from straight-through estimation techniques, we introduce a novel gradient update definition to enable a proximal search of the codebooks and their mappings. The proposed jointly learnable codebooks and mappings (JLCM) method allows a very efficient approximation of any DNN: as such, a Llama 7B can be compressed down to 2Go and loaded on 5-year-old smartphones.

To tackle this problem, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of imitation learning in partially observable environments. We establish upper bounds on the suboptimality of the learning agent with respect to the divergence between the expert and the agent latent state-transition distributions. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce an algorithm called Latent Adversarial Imitation from Observations, which combines off-policy adversarial imitation techniques with a learned latent representation of the agent's state from sequences of observations. In experiments on high-dimensional continuous robotic tasks, we show that our algorithm matches state-of-the-art performance while providing significant computational advantages.

Our theoretical findings indicate that (i) assuming the same level of information distortion, latent features are always more robust than input representations; (ii) the adversarial robustness is jointly determined by the feature dimension and the generalization capability of the DNN. To test our theoretical findings, we perform extensive experimental analysis by considering 6 different DNN architectures, 6 different approaches for distributed DNN and 10 different adversarial attacks to the ImageNet-1K dataset.

    "abstract": "Pretrained language models sometimes possess knowledge that we do not wish them to, including memorized personal information and knowledge that could be used to harm people. They can also output toxic or harmful text. To mitigate these safety and informational issues, we propose an attack-and-defense framework for studying the task of deleting sensitive information directly from model weights. We study direct edits to model weights because (1) this approach should guarantee that particular deleted information is never extracted by future prompt attacks, and (2) it should protect against whitebox attacks, which is necessary for making claims about safety/privacy in a setting where publicly available model weights could be used to elicit sensitive information. Our threat model assumes that an attack succeeds if the answer to a sensitive question is located among a set of B generated candidates, based on scenarios where the information would be insecure if the answer is among B candidates. Experimentally, we show that even state-of-the-art model editing methods such as ROME struggle to truly delete factual information from models like GPT-J, as our whitebox and blackbox attacks can recover \"deleted\" information from an edited model 38% of the time. These attacks leverage two key observations: (1) that traces of deleted information can be found in intermediate model hidden states, and (2) that applying an editing method for one question may not delete information across rephrased versions of the question. Finally, we provide new defense methods that protect against some extraction attacks, but we do not find a single universally effective defense method. Our results suggest that truly deleting sensitive information is a tractable but difficult problem, since even relatively low attack success rates have potentially severe societal implications for real-world deployment of language models.

Our findings, derived from extensive experiments on seven open-source and closed-source LLMs, reveal that these models are highly susceptible to misleading prompts, especially for instructing commonsense knowledge.

However, these aspects have significant consequences for degree and power imbalances in networks. In this paper, we shed light on how degree bias in networks affects Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) link prediction. In particular, we theoretically uncover that GCNs with a symmetric normalized graph filter have a within-group preferential attachment bias. We validate our theoretical analysis on real-world citation, collaboration, and online social networks. We further bridge GCN's preferential attachment bias with unfairness in link prediction and propose a new within-group fairness metric. This metric quantifies disparities in link prediction scores between social groups, towards combating the amplification of degree and power disparities. Finally, we propose a simple training-time strategy to alleviate within-group unfairness, and we show that it is effective on citation, online social, and credit networks. ",

    "title": "Enumerating minimal solution sets for metric graph problems",
    "abstract": "Problems from metric graph theory such as Metric Dimension, Geodetic Set, and Strong Metric Dimension have recently had a strong impact on the field of parameterized complexity by being the first problems in NP to admit double-exponential lower bounds in the treewidth, and even in the vertex cover number for the latter. We initiate the study of enumerating minimal solution sets for these problems and show that they are also of great interest in enumeration. More specifically, we show that enumerating minimal resolving sets in graphs and minimal geodetic sets in split graphs are equivalent to hypergraph dualization, arguably one of the most important open problems in algorithmic enumeration. This provides two new natural examples to a question that emerged in different works this last decade: for which vertex (or edge) set graph property $\\Pi$ is the enumeration of minimal (or maximal) subsets satisfying $\\Pi$ equivalent to hypergraph dualization? As only very few properties are known to fit within this context -- namely, properties related to minimal domination -- our results make significant progress in characterizing such properties, and provide new angles of approach for tackling hypergraph dualization. In a second step, we consider cases where our reductions do not apply, namely graphs with no long induced paths, and show these cases to be mainly tractable. ",

    "abstract": "Large training sets have become a cornerstone of machine learning and are the foundation for recent advances in language modeling and multimodal learning. While data curation for pre-training is often still ad-hoc, one common paradigm is to first collect a massive pool of data from the Web and then filter this candidate pool down to an actual training set via various heuristics. In this work, we study the problem of learning a data filtering network (DFN) for this second step of filtering a large uncurated dataset. Our key finding is that the quality of a network for filtering is distinct from its performance on downstream tasks: for instance, a model that performs well on ImageNet can yield worse training sets than a model with low ImageNet accuracy that is trained on a small amount of high-quality data. Based on our insights, we construct new data filtering networks that induce state-of-the-art image-text datasets. Specifically, our best performing dataset DFN-5B enables us to train state-of-the-art models for their compute budgets: among other improvements on a variety of tasks, a ViT-H trained on our dataset achieves 83.0% zero-shot transfer accuracy on ImageNet, out-performing models trained on other datasets such as LAION-2B, DataComp-1B, or OpenAI's WIT. In order to facilitate further research in dataset design, we also release a new 2 billion example dataset DFN-2B and show that high performance data filtering networks can be trained from scratch using only publicly available data.

    "abstract": "Recently a line of researches has delved the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for decentralized control in swarm robotics. However, it has been observed that relying solely on the states of immediate neighbors is insufficient to imitate a centralized control policy. To address this limitation, prior studies proposed incorporating $L$-hop delayed states into the computation. While this approach shows promise, it can lead to a lack of consensus among distant flock members and the formation of small clusters, consequently resulting in the failure of cohesive flocking behaviors. Instead, our approach leverages spatiotemporal GNN, named STGNN that encompasses both spatial and temporal expansions. The spatial expansion collects delayed states from distant neighbors, while the temporal expansion incorporates previous states from immediate neighbors. The broader and more comprehensive information gathered from both expansions results in more effective and accurate predictions. We develop an expert algorithm for controlling a swarm of robots and employ imitation learning to train our decentralized STGNN model based on the expert algorithm. We simulate the proposed STGNN approach in various settings, demonstrating its decentralized capacity to emulate the global expert algorithm. Further, we implemented our approach to achieve cohesive flocking, leader following and obstacle avoidance by a group of Crazyflie drones. The performance of STGNN underscores its potential as an effective and reliable approach for achieving cohesive flocking, leader following and obstacle avoidance tasks. ",

Current research, however, predominantly concentrates on the multi-task dense prediction setting, which overlooks the intrinsic 3D world and its multi-view consistent structures, and lacks the capability for versatile imagination. In response to these limitations, we present a novel problem setting -- multi-task view synthesis (MTVS), which reinterprets multi-task prediction as a set of novel-view synthesis tasks for multiple scene properties, including RGB. To tackle the MTVS problem, we propose MuvieNeRF, a framework that incorporates both multi-task and cross-view knowledge to simultaneously synthesize multiple scene properties. MuvieNeRF integrates two key modules, the Cross-Task Attention (CTA) and Cross-View Attention (CVA) modules, enabling the efficient use of information across multiple views and tasks. Extensive evaluation on both synthetic and realistic benchmarks demonstrates that MuvieNeRF is capable of simultaneously synthesizing different scene properties with promising visual quality, even outperforming conventional discriminative models in various settings. Notably, we show that MuvieNeRF exhibits universal applicability across a range of NeRF backbones. Our code is available at https://github.com/zsh2000/MuvieNeRF. ",

This is the first effort to unify different representations of proteins (e.g., sequence of amino-acids, 3D structure) into a single model that we name as Protein Multimodal Network (PMN). Our multimodal architecture learns from the entire protein structures and is able to capture their sequential, topological and geometrical information. We showcase the superiority of our approach by conducting extensive experiments and evaluations, including the assessment of generative model quality, ligand generation for unseen targets, docking score computation, and binding affinity prediction.

However, UAVs face the challenges of limited battery capacity and computing resources, which could shorten the expected flight endurance of UAVs and increase the rescue response delay during performing mission-critical tasks. To address this challenge, we first present a three-layer post-disaster rescue computing architecture by leveraging the aerial-terrestrial edge capabilities of mobile edge computing (MEC) and vehicle fog computing (VFC), which consists of a vehicle fog layer, a UAV client layer, and a UAV edge layer. Moreover, we formulate a joint task offloading and resource allocation optimization problem (JTRAOP) with the aim of maximizing the time-average system utility. Since the formulated JTRAOP is proved to be NP-hard, we propose an MEC-VFC-aided task offloading and resource allocation (MVTORA) approach, which consists of a game theoretic algorithm for task offloading decision, a convex optimization-based algorithm for MEC resource allocation, and an evolutionary computation-based hybrid algorithm for VFC resource allocation. Simulation results validate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the other benchmark schemes, especially under heavy system workloads. ",

A possible reason is that these methods do not analyze the deficiencies of synthetic speech. In this paper, the flaws of the speaker features inherent in the text-to-speech (TTS) process are analyzed. Differences in the temporal consistency of intra-utterance speaker features arise due to the lack of fine-grained control over speaker features in TTS. Since the speaker representations in TTS are based on speaker embeddings extracted by encoders, the distribution of inter-utterance speaker features differs between synthetic and bonafide speech. Based on these analyzes, an SSD method based on temporal consistency and distribution of speaker features is proposed. On one hand, modeling the temporal consistency of intra-utterance speaker features can aid speech anti-spoofing. On the other hand, distribution differences in inter-utterance speaker features can be utilized for SSD. The proposed method offers low computational complexity and performs well in both cross-dataset and silence trimming scenarios. ",

Interest from the Machine Learning community has led to the release of a variety of benchmark datasets and proposed methods.

Our large-scale empirical study links together numerous earlier works on different datasets and methods; thus offering a comprehensive overview of the existing property classes, datasets, and their interactions with different methods. We emphasise the importance of uncertainty quantification and the time and therefore cost of applying these methods in the drug development decision-making cycle. We discover that the best method depends on the dataset, and that engineered features with classical ML methods often outperform deep learning. Specifically, QSAR datasets are typically best analysed with classical methods such as Gaussian Processes while ADMET datasets are sometimes better described by Trees or Deep Learning methods such as Graph Neural Networks or language models. Our work highlights that practitioners do not yet have a straightforward, black-box procedure to rely on, and sets the precedent for creating practitioner-relevant benchmarks.

For higher-order localized wave solutions, we employ the extended PINNs (XPINNs) with domain decomposition to capture the complete pictures of dynamic behaviors such as soliton collisions, breather oscillations and rogue-wave superposition. In particular, we modify the interface line in domain decomposition of XPINNs into a small interface zone and introduce the pseudo initial, residual and gradient conditions as interface conditions linked adjacently with individual neural networks. Then this modified approach is applied successfully to various solutions ranging from bright-bright soliton, dark-dark soliton, dark-antidark soliton, general breather, Kuznetsov-Ma breather and second-order rogue wave. Experimental results show that this improved version of XPINNs reduce the complexity of computation with faster convergence rate and keep the quality of learned solutions with smoother stitching performance as well.

The original Hopfield networks store memories by encoding patterns of binary associations, which result in a synaptic learning mechanism known as Hebbian learning rule. Modern Hopfield networks can achieve exponential capacity scaling by using highly non-linear energy functions. However, the energy function of these newer models cannot be straightforwardly compressed into binary synaptic couplings and it does not directly provide new synaptic learning rules. In this work we show that generative diffusion models can be interpreted as energy-based models and that, when trained on discrete patterns, their energy function is equivalent to that of modern Hopfield networks. This equivalence allows us to interpret the supervised training of diffusion models as a synaptic learning process that encodes the associative dynamics of a modern Hopfield network in the weight structure of a deep neural network. Accordingly, in our experiments we show that the storage capacity of a continuous modern Hopfield network is identical to the capacity of a diffusion model. Our results establish a strong link between generative modeling and the theoretical neuroscience of memory, which provide a powerful computational foundation for the reconstructive theory of memory, where creative generation and memory recall can be seen as parts of a unified continuum.

Our mathematical analysis leverages the connection between constant step size SGD and Markov chains and handles the bias introduced by clipping in an original way. For strongly convex objectives, we prove that the iteration converges to a concentrated distribution and derive high probability bounds on the final estimation error. In the non-convex case, we prove that the limit distribution is localized on a neighborhood with low gradient.

Transformer-based SR methods, while incorporating global structural details, frequently come with an abundance of parameters, leading to high computational overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a Multi-Depth Branches Network (MDBN). This framework extends the ResNet architecture by integrating an additional branch that captures vital structural characteristics of images. Our proposed multi-depth branches module (MDBM) involves the stacking of convolutional kernels of identical size at varying depths within distinct branches. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of the feature maps, we observe that branches with differing depths can extract contour and detail information respectively. By integrating these branches, the overall architecture can preserve essential low-frequency semantic structural information during the restoration of high-frequency visual elements, which is more closely with human visual cognition. Compared to GoogLeNet-like models, our basic multi-depth branches structure has fewer parameters, higher computational efficiency, and improved performance.

Although deep learning based methods have made notable progress, most existing works still do not fully utilize 3D spatial information. This can lead to a single molecular representation representing multiple actual molecules. To address these issues, we propose a novel 3D structure-based molecular modeling method named 3D-Mol. In order to accurately represent complete spatial structure, we design a novel encoder to extract 3D features by deconstructing the molecules into three geometric graphs. In addition, we use 20M unlabeled data to pretrain our model by contrastive learning. We consider conformations with the same topological structure as positive pairs and the opposites as negative pairs, while the weight is determined by the dissimilarity between the conformations. We compare 3D-Mol with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on 7 benchmarks and demonstrate our outstanding performance in 5 benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "The dichromatic number of a digraph is the minimum integer $k$ such that it admits a $k$-dicolouring, i.e. a partition of its vertices into $k$ acyclic subdigraphs. We say that a digraph $D$ is a super-orientation of an undirected graph $G$ if $G$ is the underlying graph of $D$. If $D$ does not contain any pair of symmetric arcs, we just say that $D$ is an orientation of $G$. In this work, we give both lower and upper bounds on the dichromatic number of super-orientations of chordal graphs. We also show a family of orientations of cographs for which the dichromatic number is equal to the clique number of the underlying graph. ",
