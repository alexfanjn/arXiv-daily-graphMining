    "abstract": "Embedding plays a critical role in modern recommender systems because they are virtual representations of real-world entities and the foundation for subsequent decision models. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding update mechanism, Structure-aware Embedding Evolution (SEvo for short), to encourage related nodes to evolve similarly at each step. Unlike GNN (Graph Neural Network) that typically serves as an intermediate part, SEvo is able to directly inject the graph structure information into embedding with negligible computational overhead in training. The convergence properties of SEvo as well as its possible variants are theoretically analyzed to justify the validity of the designs. Moreover, SEvo can be seamlessly integrated into existing optimizers for state-of-the-art performance. In particular, SEvo-enhanced AdamW with moment estimate correction demonstrates consistent improvements across a spectrum of models and datasets, suggesting a novel technical route to effectively utilize graph structure information beyond explicit GNN modules.

    "abstract": "Traffic signs play a critical role in road safety and traffic management for autonomous driving systems. Accurate traffic sign classification is essential but challenging due to real-world complexities like adversarial examples and occlusions. To address these issues, binary neural networks offer promise in constructing classifiers suitable for resource-constrained devices. In our previous work, we proposed high-accuracy BNN models for traffic sign recognition, focusing on compact size for limited computation and energy resources. To evaluate their local robustness, this paper introduces a set of benchmark problems featuring layers that challenge state-of-the-art verification tools. These layers include binarized convolutions, max pooling, batch normalization, fully connected. The difficulty of the verification problem is given by the high number of network parameters (905k - 1.7 M), of the input dimension (2.7k-12k), and of the number of regions (43) as well by the fact that the neural networks are not sparse. The proposed BNN models and local robustness properties can be checked at https://github.com/ChristopherBrix/vnncomp2023_benchmarks/tree/main/benchmarks/traffic_signs_recognition. The results of the 4th International Verification of Neural Networks Competition (VNN-COMP'23) revealed the fact that 4, out of 7, solvers can handle many of our benchmarks randomly selected (minimum is 6, maximum is 36, out of 45). Surprisingly, tools output also wrong results or missing counterexample (ranging from 1 to 4). Currently, our focus lies in exploring the possibility of achieving a greater count of solved instances by extending the allotted time (previously set at 8 minutes). Furthermore, we are intrigued by the reasons behind the erroneous outcomes provided by the tools for certain benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum Sobel edge detection (QSED) is a kind of algorithm for image edge detection using quantum mechanism, which can solve the real-time problem encountered by classical algorithms. However, the existing QSED algorithms only consider two- or four-direction Sobel operator, which leads to a certain loss of edge detail information in some high-definition images. In this paper, a novel QSED algorithm based on eight-direction Sobel operator is proposed, which not only reduces the loss of edge information, but also simultaneously calculates eight directions' gradient values of all pixel in a quantum image. In addition, the concrete quantum circuits, which consist of gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, double threshold detection and edge tracking units, are designed in details. For a 2^n x 2^n image with q gray scale, the complexity of our algorithm can be reduced to O(n^2 + q^2), which is lower than other existing classical or quantum algorithms. And the simulation experiment demonstrates that our algorithm can detect more edge information, especially diagonal edges, than the two- and four-direction QSED algorithms. ",

By incorporating physical laws as prior knowledge, the proposed method significantly reduces the computational complexity associated with state estimation while maintaining high accuracy.

    "abstract": "Characterizing the relationship between neural population activity and behavioral data is a central goal of neuroscience. While latent variable models (LVMs) are successful in describing high-dimensional time-series data, they are typically only designed for a single type of data, making it difficult to identify structure shared across different experimental data modalities. Here, we address this shortcoming by proposing an unsupervised LVM which extracts temporally evolving shared and independent latents for distinct, simultaneously recorded experimental modalities. We do this by combining Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), an interpretable LVM for neural spiking data with temporally smooth latent space, with Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders (GP-VAEs), which similarly use a GP prior to characterize correlations in a latent space, but admit rich expressivity due to a deep neural network mapping to observations. We achieve interpretability in our model by partitioning latent variability into components that are either shared between or independent to each modality. We parameterize the latents of our model in the Fourier domain, and show improved latent identification using this approach over standard GP-VAE methods. We validate our model on simulated multi-modal data consisting of Poisson spike counts and MNIST images that scale and rotate smoothly over time. We show that the multi-modal GP-VAE (MM-GPVAE) is able to not only identify the shared and independent latent structure across modalities accurately, but provides good reconstructions of both images and neural rates on held-out trials. Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two real world multi-modal experimental settings: Drosophila whole-brain calcium imaging alongside tracked limb positions, and Manduca sexta spike train measurements from ten wing muscles as the animal tracks a visual stimulus.

Our novel poisoning attack method induces changes to observed views that are imperceptible to the human eye, yet potent enough to disrupt NeRF's ability to accurately reconstruct a 3D scene. To achieve this, we devise a bi-level optimization algorithm incorporating a Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based spatial deformation. We extensively test our approach on two common NeRF benchmark datasets consisting of 29 real-world scenes with high-quality images. Our results compellingly demonstrate that our privacy-preserving method significantly impairs NeRF's performance across these benchmark datasets. Additionally, we show that our method is adaptable and versatile, functioning across various perturbation strengths and NeRF architectures. This work offers valuable insights into NeRF's vulnerabilities and emphasizes the need to account for such potential privacy risks when developing robust 3D scene reconstruction algorithms. Our study contributes to the larger conversation surrounding responsible AI and generative machine learning, aiming to protect user privacy and respect creative ownership in the digital age. ",

    "abstract": "This paper studies MapReduce-based heterogeneous coded distributed computing (CDC) where, besides different computing capabilities at workers, input files to be accessed by computing jobs have nonuniform popularity. We propose a file placement strategy that can handle an arbitrary number of input files. Furthermore, we design a nested coded shuffling strategy that can efficiently manage the nonuniformity of file popularity to maximize the coded multicasting opportunity. We then formulate the joint optimization of the proposed file placement and nested shuffling design variables to optimize the proposed CDC scheme. To reduce the high computational complexity in solving the resulting mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, we propose a simple two-file-group-based file placement approach to obtain an approximate solution. Numerical results show that the optimized CDC scheme outperforms other alternatives. Also, the proposed two-file-group-based approach achieves nearly the same performance as the conventional branch-and-cut method in solving the MILP problem but with substantially lower computational complexity that is scalable over the number of files and workers. For computing jobs with aggregate target functions that commonly appear in machine learning applications, we propose a heterogeneous compressed CDC (C-CDC) scheme to further improve the shuffling efficiency. The C-CDC scheme uses a local data aggregation technique to compress the data to be shuffled for the shuffling load reduction. We again optimize the proposed C-CDC scheme and explore the two-file-group-based low-complexity approach for an approximate solution. Numerical results show the proposed C-CDC scheme provides a considerable shuffling load reduction over the CDC scheme, and also, the two-file-group-based file placement approach maintains good performance.

    "abstract": "Twitter is currently one of the biggest social media platforms. Its users may share, read, and engage with short posts called tweets. For the ACM Recommender Systems Conference 2020, Twitter published a dataset around 70 GB in size for the annual RecSys Challenge. In 2020, the RecSys Challenge invited participating teams to create models that would predict engagement likelihoods for given user-tweet combinations. The submitted models predicting like, reply, retweet, and quote engagements were evaluated based on two metrics: area under the precision-recall curve (PRAUC) and relative cross-entropy (RCE). In this diploma thesis, we used the RecSys 2020 Challenge dataset and evaluation procedure to investigate how well context alone may be used to predict tweet engagement likelihood. In doing so, we employed the Spark engine on TU Wien's Little Big Data Cluster to create scalable data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, and machine learning pipelines. We manually created just under 200 additional features to describe tweet context. The results indicate that features describing users' prior engagement history and the popularity of hashtags and links in the tweet were the most informative. We also found that factors such as the prediction algorithm, training dataset size, training dataset sampling method, and feature selection significantly affect the results. After comparing the best results of our context-only prediction models with content-only models and with models developed by the Challenge winners, we identified that the context-based models underperformed in terms of the RCE score. This work thus concludes by situating this discrepancy and proposing potential improvements to our implementation, which is shared in a public git repository. ",

As having the right (or wrong) concepts is critical to trustworthy machine learning systems, it is natural to ask which inputs from the model's original training set were most important for learning a concept at a given layer. To answer this, we combine data attribution methods with methods for probing the concepts learned by a model. Training network and probe ensembles for two concept datasets on a range of network layers, we use the recently developed TRAK method for large-scale data attribution. We find some evidence for convergence, where removing the 10,000 top attributing images for a concept and retraining the model does not change the location of the concept in the network nor the probing sparsity of the concept. This suggests that rather than being highly dependent on a few specific examples, the features that inform the development of a concept are spread in a more diffuse manner across its exemplars, implying robustness in concept formation.

Amongst the diverse adjustments in hyperparameters, the adaptation of the learning rate emerges as a crucial component, holding the promise of significantly enhancing the efficacy of FL systems. In response to this critical need, this paper presents FedHyper, a novel hypergradient-based learning rate adaptation algorithm specifically designed for FL. FedHyper serves as a universal learning rate scheduler that can adapt both global and local rates as the training progresses. In addition, FedHyper not only showcases unparalleled robustness to a spectrum of initial learning rate configurations but also significantly alleviates the necessity for laborious empirical learning rate adjustments. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of FedHyper's convergence rate and conduct extensive experiments on vision and language benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that FEDHYPER consistently converges 1.1-3x faster than FedAvg and the competing baselines while achieving superior final accuracy. Moreover, FedHyper catalyzes a remarkable surge in accuracy, augmenting it by up to 15% compared to FedAvg under suboptimal initial learning rate settings. ",

Since manually maintaining software test suites is tedious, timely, and costly, automating the process of generation and maintenance of test units will significantly impact the effectiveness and efficiency of software testing processes. To this end, we propose an automated approach which exploits both structural and semantic properties of source code methods and test cases to recommend the most relevant and useful unit tests to the developers. The proposed approach initially trains a neural network to transform method-level source code, as well as unit tests, into distributed representations (embedded vectors) while preserving the importance of the structure in the code. Retrieving the semantic and structural properties of a given method, the approach computes cosine similarity between the method's embedding and the previously-embedded training instances. Further, according to the similarity scores between the embedding vectors, the model identifies the closest methods of embedding and the associated unit tests as the most similar recommendations. The results on the Methods2Test dataset showed that, while there is no guarantee to have similar relevant test cases for the group of similar methods, the proposed approach extracts the most similar existing test cases for a given method in the dataset, and evaluations show that recommended test cases decrease the developers' effort to generating expected test cases.

One such vulnerability is impedance, an inherent property of a device that can be exploited to leak information through an unintended side channel, thereby posing significant security and privacy risks. Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, impedance is often overlooked or narrowly explored, as it is typically treated as a fixed value at a specific frequency in research and design endeavors. Moreover, impedance has never been explored as a source of information leakage. This paper demonstrates that the impedance of an embedded device is not constant and directly relates to the programs executed on the device. We define this phenomenon as impedance leakage and use this as a side channel to extract software instructions from protected memory. Our experiment on the ATmega328P microcontroller and the Artix 7 FPGA indicates that the impedance side channel can detect software instructions with 96.1% and 92.6% accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, we explore the dual nature of the impedance side channel, highlighting the potential for beneficial purposes and the associated risk of intellectual property theft. Finally, potential countermeasures that specifically address impedance leakage are discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Medical image classification is a critical problem for healthcare, with the potential to alleviate the workload of doctors and facilitate diagnoses of patients. However, two challenges arise when deploying deep learning models to real-world healthcare applications. First, neural models tend to learn spurious correlations instead of desired features, which could fall short when generalizing to new domains (e.g., patients with different ages). Second, these black-box models lack interpretability. When making diagnostic predictions, it is important to understand why a model makes a decision for trustworthy and safety considerations. In this paper, to address these two limitations, we propose a new paradigm to build robust and interpretable medical image classifiers with natural language concepts. Specifically, we first query clinical concepts from GPT-4, then transform latent image features into explicit concepts with a vision-language model. We systematically evaluate our method on eight medical image classification datasets to verify its effectiveness. On challenging datasets with strong confounding factors, our method can mitigate spurious correlations thus substantially outperform standard visual encoders and other baselines. Finally, we show how classification with a small number of concepts brings a level of interpretability for understanding model decisions through case studies in real medical data. ",

We find that our adversarial images can manipulate the LLM to invoke tools following real-world syntax almost always (~98%) while maintaining high similarity to clean images (~0.9 SSIM).

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the model-free synthesis of state observers for nonlinear autonomous systems without knowing the governing equations. Specifically, the Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger (KKL) observer structure is leveraged, where the outputs are fed into a linear time-invariant (LTI) system to obtain the observer states, which can be viewed as the states nonlinearly transformed by an immersion mapping, and a neural network is used to approximate the inverse of the nonlinear immersion and estimate the states. In view of the possible existence of noises in output measurements, this work proposes to impose an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of the neural network for robust and safe observation. A relation that bounds the generalization loss of state observation according to the Lipschitz constant, as well as the $H_2$-norm of the LTI part in the KKL observer, is established, thus reducing the model-free observer synthesis problem to that of Lipschitz-bounded neural network training, for which a direct parameterization technique is used. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a chaotic Lorenz system. ",

To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Parallel Dynamic Routing CapsNet (PDR-CapsNet), a deeper and more energy-efficient alternative to CapsNet that offers superior performance, less energy consumption, and lower overfitting rates. By leveraging a parallelization strategy, PDR-CapsNet mitigates the computational complexity of CapsNet and increases throughput, efficiently using hardware resources. As a result, we achieve 83.55\\% accuracy while requiring 87.26\\% fewer parameters, 32.27\\% and 47.40\\% fewer MACs, and Flops, achieving 3x faster inference and 7.29J less energy consumption on a 2080Ti GPU with 11GB VRAM compared to CapsNet and for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

In this work, we perform a detailed study of the factuality of LLM-generated text in the context of answering questions that test current world knowledge. Specifically, we introduce FreshQA, a novel dynamic QA benchmark encompassing a diverse range of question and answer types, including questions that require fast-changing world knowledge as well as questions with false premises that need to be debunked. We benchmark a diverse array of both closed and open-source LLMs under a two-mode evaluation procedure that allows us to measure both correctness and hallucination. Through human evaluations involving more than 50K judgments, we shed light on limitations of these models and demonstrate significant room for improvement: for instance, all models (regardless of model size) struggle on questions that involve fast-changing knowledge and false premises. Motivated by these results, we present FreshPrompt, a simple few-shot prompting method that substantially boosts the performance of an LLM on FreshQA by incorporating relevant and up-to-date information retrieved from a search engine into the prompt. Our experiments show that FreshPrompt outperforms both competing search engine-augmented prompting methods such as Self-Ask (Press et al., 2022) as well as commercial systems such as Perplexity.AI. Further analysis of FreshPrompt reveals that both the number of retrieved evidences and their order play a key role in influencing the correctness of LLM-generated answers. Additionally, instructing the LLM to generate concise and direct answers helps reduce hallucination compared to encouraging more verbose answers. To facilitate future work, we release FreshQA at github.com/freshllms/freshqa and commit to updating it at regular intervals. ",

These findings were generated by counting frequencies of first-person singular pronouns in text data. However, counting doesn't capture how these pronouns are used. Recent advances in neural language modeling have leveraged methods generating contextual embeddings. In this study, we sought to utilize the embeddings of first-person pronouns obtained from contextualized language representation models to capture ways these pronouns are used, to analyze mental status. De-identified text messages sent during online psychotherapy with weekly assessment of depression severity were used for evaluation. Results indicate the advantage of contextualized first-person pronoun embeddings over standard classification token embeddings and frequency-based pronoun analysis results in predicting depression symptom severity. This suggests contextual representations of first-person pronouns can enhance the predictive utility of language used by people with depression symptoms. ",

A \"relational convolution\" layer then transforms the relation tensor into a sequence of new objects, each describing the relations within some group of objects at the previous layer. Graphlet filters, analogous to filters in convolutional neural networks, represent a template of relations against which the relation tensor is compared at each grouping. Repeating this yields representations of higher-order, hierarchical relations. We present the motivation and details of the architecture, together with a set of experiments to demonstrate how relational convolutional networks can provide an effective framework for modeling relational tasks that have hierarchical structure.

This article proposes an integrated communication, sensing, and computation (ICSAC) framework for 6G to achieve the reciprocity among CSC functions to enhance the reliability and latency of communication, accuracy and timeliness of sensing information acquisition, and privacy and security of computing to realize the IMN applications. Specifically, the sensing and communication functions can merge into unified platforms using the same transmit signals, and the acquired real-time sensing information can be exploited as prior information for intelligent algorithms to enhance the performance of communication networks. This is called the computing-empowered integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) reciprocity. Such reciprocity can further improve the performance of distributed computation with the assistance of networked sensing capability, which is named the sensing-empowered integrated communications and computation (ICAC) reciprocity. The above ISAC and ICAC reciprocities can enhance each other iteratively and finally lead to the ICSAC reciprocity. To achieve these reciprocities, we explore the potential enabling technologies for the ICSAC framework. Finally, we present the evaluation results of crucial enabling technologies to show the feasibility of the ICSAC framework. ",

To tackle both challenges we propose a novel generalized graph autoencoder architecture, designed to extract powerful and robust node embeddings, that are tailored to the alignment task. We prove that the generated embeddings are associated with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graphs and can achieve more accurate alignment compared to classical spectral methods. Our proposed framework also leverages transfer learning and data augmentation to achieve efficient network alignment at a very large scale without retraining.

    "abstract": "Multi-object representation learning aims to represent complex real-world visual input using the composition of multiple objects. Representation learning methods have often used unsupervised learning to segment an input image into individual objects and encode these objects into each latent vector. However, it is not clear how previous methods have achieved the appropriate segmentation of individual objects. Additionally, most of the previous methods regularize the latent vectors using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Therefore, it is not clear whether VAE regularization contributes to appropriate object segmentation. To elucidate the mechanism of object segmentation in multi-object representation learning, we conducted an ablation study on MONet, which is a typical method. MONet represents multiple objects using pairs that consist of an attention mask and the latent vector corresponding to the attention mask. Each latent vector is encoded from the input image and attention mask. Then, the component image and attention mask are decoded from each latent vector. The loss function of MONet consists of 1) the sum of reconstruction losses between the input image and decoded component image, 2) the VAE regularization loss of the latent vector, and 3) the reconstruction loss of the attention mask to explicitly encode shape information. We conducted an ablation study on these three loss functions to investigate the effect on segmentation performance. Our results showed that the VAE regularization loss did not affect segmentation performance and the others losses did affect it. Based on this result, we hypothesize that it is important to maximize the attention mask of the image region best represented by a single latent vector corresponding to the attention mask. We confirmed this hypothesis by evaluating a new loss function with the same mechanism as the hypothesis. ",

In this work, we propose pretraining GNNs at the fragment level, which serves as a promising middle ground to overcome the limitations of node-level and graph-level pretraining. Borrowing techniques from recent work on principle subgraph mining, we obtain a compact vocabulary of prevalent fragments that span a large pretraining dataset. From the extracted vocabulary, we introduce several fragment-based contrastive and predictive pretraining tasks. The contrastive learning task jointly pretrains two different GNNs: one based on molecular graphs and one based on fragment graphs, which represents high-order connectivity within molecules. By enforcing the consistency between the fragment embedding and the aggregated embedding of the corresponding atoms from the molecular graphs, we ensure that both embeddings capture structural information at multiple resolutions. The structural information of the fragment graphs is further exploited to extract auxiliary labels for the graph-level predictive pretraining. We employ both the pretrained molecular-based and fragment-based GNNs for downstream prediction, thus utilizing the fragment information during finetuning.

Despite their impressive performance, the models are known to pose important risks. As these models are deployed in real-world applications, a systematic understanding of different risks posed by these models on tasks such as natural language inference (NLI), is much needed. In this paper, we define and formalize two distinct types of risk: decision risk and composite risk. We also propose a risk-centric evaluation framework, and four novel metrics, for assessing LLMs on these risks in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Finally, we propose a risk-adjusted calibration method called DwD for helping LLMs minimize these risks in an overall NLI architecture. Detailed experiments, using four NLI benchmarks, three baselines and two LLMs, including ChatGPT, show both the practical utility of the evaluation framework, and the efficacy of DwD in reducing decision and composite risk. For instance, when using DwD, an underlying LLM is able to address an extra 20.1% of low-risk inference tasks (but which the LLM erroneously deems high-risk without risk adjustment) and skip a further 19.8% of high-risk tasks, which would have been answered incorrectly.

Further, to counter the emerging section injection attacks, we propose a graph-based section-dependent information extraction scheme for software representation. The proposed scheme leverages aggregated information within various sections in the software to enable robust malware detection and mitigate adversarial settings. Our experimental results show that traditional malware detection models are ineffective against adversarial threats. However, the attack surface can be largely reduced by eliminating the volatile information. Therefore, we propose simple-yet-effective methods to mitigate the impacts of binary manipulation attacks.

In this paper, we aim to tackle the mentioned problem by enabling the agents to understand other agents' SVOs. To accomplish this, we propose a two-stage system framework. Firstly, we train a policy by allowing the agents to share their ground truth SVOs to establish a coordinated traffic flow. Secondly, we develop a recognition network that estimates agents' SVOs and integrates it with the policy trained in the first stage. Experiments demonstrate that our developed method significantly improves the performance of the driving policy in MADS compared to two state-of-the-art MARL algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Human motion prediction is an essential step for efficient and safe human-robot collaboration. Current methods either purely rely on representing the human joints in some form of neural network-based architecture or use regression models offline to fit hyper-parameters in the hope of capturing a model encompassing human motion. While these methods provide good initial results, they are missing out on leveraging well-studied human body kinematic models as well as body and scene constraints which can help boost the efficacy of these prediction frameworks while also explicitly avoiding implausible human joint configurations. We propose a novel human motion prediction framework that incorporates human joint constraints and scene constraints in a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model to predict human motion over a set time horizon. This formulation is combined with an online context-aware constraints model to leverage task-dependent motions. It is tested on a human arm kinematic model and implemented on a human-robot collaborative setup with a UR5 robot arm to demonstrate the real-time capability of our approach. Simulations were also performed on datasets like HA4M and ANDY. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate considerable improvements in a Gaussian Process framework when these constraints are explicitly considered. ",

However, FMs developed for biomedical domains have largely remained unimodal, i.e., independently trained and used for tasks on protein sequences alone, small molecule structures alone, or clinical data alone. To overcome this limitation of biomedical FMs, we present BioBridge, a novel parameter-efficient learning framework, to bridge independently trained unimodal FMs to establish multimodal behavior. BioBridge achieves it by utilizing Knowledge Graphs (KG) to learn transformations between one unimodal FM and another without fine-tuning any underlying unimodal FMs. Our empirical results demonstrate that BioBridge can beat the best baseline KG embedding methods (on average by around 76.3%) in cross-modal retrieval tasks. We also identify BioBridge demonstrates out-of-domain generalization ability by extrapolating to unseen modalities or relations. Additionally, we also show that BioBridge presents itself as a general purpose retriever that can aid biomedical multimodal question answering as well as enhance the guided generation of novel drugs.

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we collect a large-scale visual planning dataset based on AI2-THOR, dubbed as CCTP. Extensive experiments on this challenging dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method in visual task planning.

These adversarial perturbed examples have become the biggest vulnerability of ML and DL based systems and are major obstacles to their adoption in real-time and mission-critical applications such as NIDS. AML is an emerging research domain, and it has become a necessity for the in-depth study of adversarial attacks and their defence strategies to safeguard the computer network from various cyber security threads. In this research work, we aim to cover important aspects related to NIDS, adversarial attacks and its defence mechanism to increase the robustness of the ML and DL based NIDS. We implemented four powerful adversarial attack techniques, namely, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and Carlini & Wagner (C&W) in NIDS. We analyzed its performance in terms of various performance metrics in detail. Furthermore, the three heuristics defence strategies, i.e., Adversarial Training (AT), Gaussian Data Augmentation (GDA) and High Confidence (HC), are implemented to improve the NIDS robustness under adversarial attack situations. The complete workflow is demonstrated in real-time network with data packet flow.

In this work, we present an integrated algorithm that uses psychoacoustic models and room impulse responses (RIR) in the generation step. The RIRs are dynamically created by a neural network during the generation process to simulate a physical environment to harden our examples against transformations experienced in over-the-air attacks. We compare the different approaches in three experiments: in a simulated environment and in a realistic over-the-air scenario to evaluate the robustness, and in a human study to evaluate the perceptibility. Our algorithms considering psychoacoustics only or in addition to the robustness show an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as in the human perception study, at the cost of an increased word error rate (WER).

Adversarial training (AT) has been demonstrated to be the most effective defense strategy to protect neural networks from being fooled. However, we find AT omits to learning robust features, resulting in poor performance of adversarial robustness. To address this issue, we highlight two characteristics of robust representation: (1) $\\bf{exclusion}$: the feature of natural examples keeps away from that of other classes; (2) $\\bf{alignment}$: the feature of natural and corresponding adversarial examples is close to each other. These motivate us to propose a generic framework of AT to gain robust representation, by the asymmetric negative contrast and reverse attention. Specifically, we design an asymmetric negative contrast based on predicted probabilities, to push away examples of different classes in the feature space. Moreover, we propose to weight feature by parameters of the linear classifier as the reverse attention, to obtain class-aware feature and pull close the feature of the same class. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets show our methods greatly advance the robustness of AT and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Current models often fall short in generalizing to unforeseen distribution shifts. In this study, we harness the inherent set property of point cloud data to introduce a novel critical subset identification (CSI) method, aiming to bolster recognition robustness in the face of data corruption. Our CSI framework integrates two pivotal components: density-aware sampling (DAS) and self-entropy minimization (SEM), which cater to static and dynamic CSI, respectively. DAS ensures efficient robust anchor point sampling by factoring in local density, while SEM is employed during training to accentuate the most salient point-to-point attention. Evaluations reveal that our CSI approach yields error rates of 18.4\\% and 16.3\\% on ModelNet40-C and PointCloud-C, respectively, marking a notable improvement over state-of-the-art methods by margins of 5.2\\% and 4.2\\% on the respective benchmarks.

However, most existing detection algorithms fail to provide high-accuracy action classes even having their locations, as they do not consider the surgery procedure's regularity in the whole video. This limitation hinders their application. Moreover, implementing the predictions in clinical applications seriously needs to convey model confidence to earn entrustment, which is unexplored in surgical action prediction. In this paper, to accurately detect fine-grained actions that happen at every moment, we propose an anchor-context action detection network (ACTNet), including an anchor-context detection (ACD) module and a class conditional diffusion (CCD) module, to answer the following questions: 1) where the actions happen; 2) what actions are; 3) how confidence predictions are. Specifically, the proposed ACD module spatially and temporally highlights the regions interacting with the extracted anchor in surgery video, which outputs action location and its class distribution based on anchor-context interactions. Considering the full distribution of action classes in videos, the CCD module adopts a denoising diffusion-based generative model conditioned on our ACD estimator to further reconstruct accurately the action predictions. Moreover, we utilize the stochastic nature of the diffusion model outputs to access model confidence for each prediction. Our method reports the state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of 4.0% mAP against baseline on the surgical video dataset. ",

A critical perspective in StegGuard is that the unique characteristic of the transformation from an image to an embedding, conducted by the pre-trained encoder, can be equivalently exposed how an embeder embeds secrets into images and how an extractor extracts the secrets from encoder's embeddings with a tolerable error after the secrets are subjected to the encoder's transformation. While each independent encoder has a distinct transformation, the piracy encoder has a similar transformation to the victim. Based on these, we learn a pair of secrets embeder and extractor as the fingerprint for the victim encoder. We introduce a frequency-domain channel attention embedding block into the embeder to adaptively embed secrets into suitable frequency bands. During verification, if the secrets embedded into the query images can be extracted with an acceptable error from the suspect encoder's embeddings, the suspect encoder is determined as piracy, otherwise independent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that depending on a very limited number of query images, StegGuard can reliably identify across varied independent encoders, and is robust against model stealing related attacks including model extraction, fine-tuning, pruning, embedding noising and shuffle.

This paper proposes a novel method to simplify the spatial-temporal graph representation for gait-based gender estimation, improving interpretability without losing performance. Our approach employs two models, an upstream and a downstream model, that can adjust the adjacency matrix for each walking instance, thereby removing the fixed nature of the graph.

The resulting graphs are interpretable and differ qualitatively from fixed graphs used in existing models.

Initially, the proposed architecture employs the L-CSwinTransformer as encoder to capture global information, incorporating CNN as decoder to fuse local features. We expand the resolution of the feature at different stages to extract more global information compared to the original CSwinTransformer. Subsequently, we integrate Fine-grained Refinement Block (FRB) within the skip-connection stage to further augment features. We validate our model on two public datasets, HC18 and BUSI.

They can generate diverse sets of high-reward objects, which is an important consideration in scientific discovery tasks. However, as they are typically trained from a given extrinsic reward function, it remains an important open challenge about how to leverage the power of pre-training and train GFlowNets in an unsupervised fashion for efficient adaptation to downstream tasks. Inspired by recent successes of unsupervised pre-training in various domains, we introduce a novel approach for reward-free pre-training of GFlowNets. By framing the training as a self-supervised problem, we propose an outcome-conditioned GFlowNet (OC-GFN) that learns to explore the candidate space. Specifically, OC-GFN learns to reach any targeted outcomes, akin to goal-conditioned policies in reinforcement learning. We show that the pre-trained OC-GFN model can allow for a direct extraction of a policy capable of sampling from any new reward functions in downstream tasks. Nonetheless, adapting OC-GFN on a downstream task-specific reward involves an intractable marginalization over possible outcomes. We propose a novel way to approximate this marginalization by learning an amortized predictor enabling efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training the OC-GFN, and its ability to swiftly adapt to downstream tasks and discover modes more efficiently.

DoubleCoverUDF takes a learned UDF and a user-specified parameter $r$ (a small positive real number) as input and extracts an iso-surface with an iso-value $r$ using the conventional marching cubes algorithm. We show that the computed iso-surface is the boundary of the $r$-offset volume of the target zero level-set $S$, which is an orientable manifold, regardless of the topology of $S$. Next, the algorithm computes a covering map to project the boundary mesh onto $S$, preserving the mesh's topology and avoiding folding. If $S$ is an orientable manifold surface, our algorithm separates the double-layered mesh into a single layer using a robust minimum-cut post-processing step. Otherwise, it keeps the double-layered mesh as the output. We validate our algorithm by reconstructing 3D surfaces of open models and demonstrate its efficacy and effectiveness on synthetic models and benchmark datasets. Our experimental results confirm that our method is robust and produces meshes with better quality in terms of both visual evaluation and quantitative measures than existing UDF-based methods.

However, such visual explanatory maps based on visual inspection alone are insufficient unless we intuitively demonstrate their medical or neuroscientific validity via quantitative features. In this study, we synthesize the counterfactual-labeled structural MRIs using our proposed framework and transform it into a gray matter density map to measure its volumetric changes over the parcellated region of interest (ROI). We also devised a lightweight linear classifier to boost the effectiveness of constructed ROIs, promoted quantitative interpretation, and achieved comparable predictive performance to DL methods. Throughout this, our framework produces an ``AD-relatedness index'' for each ROI and offers an intuitive understanding of brain status for an individual patient and across patient groups with respect to AD progression.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the exact location of a camera in a cyber-physical system using the exact geographic coordinates of four feature points stored in QR codes(Quick response codes) and the pixel coordinates of four feature points analyzed from the QR code images taken by the camera. Firstly, the P4P(Perspective 4 Points) algorithm is designed to uniquely determine the initial pose estimation value of the QR coordinate system relative to the camera coordinate system by using the four feature points of the selected QR code. In the second step, the manifold gradient optimization algorithm is designed. The rotation matrix and displacement vector are taken as the initial values of iteration, and the iterative optimization is carried out to improve the positioning accuracy and obtain the rotation matrix and displacement vector with higher accuracy. The third step is to convert the pose of the QR coordinate system with respect to the camera coordinate system to the pose of the AGV(Automated Guided Vehicle) with respect to the world coordinate system. Finally, the performance of manifold gradient optimization algorithm and P4P analytical algorithm are simulated and compared under the same conditions.One can see that the performance of the manifold gradient optimization algorithm proposed in this paper is much better than that of the P4P analytic algorithm when the signal-to-noise ratio is small.With the increase of the signal-to-noise ratio,the performance of the P4P analytic algorithm approaches that of the manifold gradient optimization algorithm.when the noise is same,the performance of manifold gradient optimization algorithm is better when there are more feature points.

In this study, we propose a novel model conversion strategy to address this issue, adapting high-resources monolingual language models to a new target language. By generalizing over a word translation dictionary encompassing both the source and target languages, we map tokens from the target tokenizer to semantically similar tokens from the source language tokenizer. This one-to-many token mapping improves tremendously the initialization of the embedding table for the target language. We conduct experiments to convert high-resource models to mid- and low-resource languages, namely Dutch and Frisian. These converted models achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on these languages across all sorts of downstream tasks. By reducing significantly the amount of data and time required for training state-of-the-art models, our novel model conversion strategy has the potential to benefit many languages worldwide. ",

To address this, we propose a framework with end-to-end training of a sampling importance network, a latent space encoder network, and a denoiser network. Our approach uses reinforcement learning to optimize the sampling importance network, thus avoiding explicit numerically approximated gradients. Our method does not aggregate the sampled values per pixel by averaging but keeps all sampled values which are then fed into the latent space encoder. The encoder replaces handcrafted spatiotemporal heuristics by learned representations in a latent space. Finally, a neural denoiser is trained to refine the output image. Our approach increases visual quality on several challenging datasets and reduces rendering times for equal quality by a factor of 1.6x compared to the previous state-of-the-art, making it a promising solution for real-time applications.

In this paper, we introduce a noise robustness evaluation dataset named Noise-SF for slot filling task. The proposed dataset contains five types of human-annotated noise, and all those noises are exactly existed in real extensive robust-training methods of slot filling into the proposed framework. By conducting exhaustive empirical evaluation experiments on Noise-SF, we find that baseline models have poor performance in robustness evaluation, and the proposed framework can effectively improve the robustness of models.

To accomplish this, we train two neural networks to work in concert. The first network learns the residual function on a small set of high-fidelity and low-fidelity data. Once trained, this network is used to generate additional synthetic high-fidelity data, which is used in the training of a second network. This second network, once trained, acts as our surrogate for the high-fidelity quantity of interest. We present three numerical examples to demonstrate the power of the proposed framework.

Cross-Architecture Binary Code Similarity Search has been explored in numerous studies and has used a wide range of different data sources to achieve its goals. The data sources typically used draw on common structures derived from binaries such as function control flow graphs or binary level call graphs, the output of the disassembly process or the outputs of a dynamic analysis approach. One data source which has received less attention is binary intermediate representations. Binary Intermediate representations possess two interesting properties: they are cross architecture by their very nature and encode the semantics of a function explicitly to support downstream usage. Within this paper we propose Function as a String Encoded Representation (FASER) which combines long document transformers with the use of intermediate representations to create a model capable of cross architecture function search without the need for manual feature engineering, pre-training or a dynamic analysis step. We compare our approach against a series of baseline approaches for two tasks; A general function search task and a targeted vulnerability search task.

Despite the recent advances in this area, existing methods focus primarily on learning sequential patterns, neglecting the inherent spatial structure in road networks that can affect human routing decisions. To fill the gap, this paper introduces RouteKG, a novel Knowledge Graph-based framework for route prediction. Specifically, we construct a Knowledge Graph on the road network, thereby learning and leveraging spatial relations, especially moving directions, which are crucial for human navigation. Moreover, an n-ary tree-based algorithm is introduced to efficiently generate top-K routes in a batch mode, enhancing scalability and computational efficiency. To further optimize the prediction performance, a rank refinement module is incorporated to fine-tune the candidate route rankings. The model performance is evaluated using two real-world vehicle trajectory datasets from two Chinese cities, Chengdu and Shanghai, under various practical scenarios. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy over baseline methods, with an average increase of 6.2%, 7.8%, and 6.1% in top-1, 5, and 10 routes predictions, respectively. We further validate our model through a case study that utilizes the pretrained model as a simulator for real-time traffic flow estimation at the link level. The proposed RouteKG promises wide-ranging applications in vehicle navigation, traffic management, and other intelligent transportation tasks. ",

In this work, we leverage neural fields to allow a robot to self-model its kinematics as a neural-implicit query model learned only from 2D images annotated with camera poses and configurations. This enables significantly greater applicability than existing approaches which have been dependent on depth images or geometry knowledge. To this end, alongside a curricular data sampling strategy, we propose a new encoder-based neural density field architecture for dynamic object-centric scenes conditioned on high numbers of degrees of freedom (DOFs). In a 7-DOF robot test setup, the learned self-model achieves a Chamfer-L2 distance of 2% of the robot's workspace dimension.

As with classic streaming algorithms, which must only be correct for the worst-case fixed stream, adversarially robust algorithms with access to randomness can use significantly less space than deterministic algorithms. We prove that for the Missing Item Finding problem in streaming, the space complexity also significantly depends on how adversarially robust algorithms are permitted to use randomness. (In contrast, the space complexity of classic streaming algorithms does not depend as strongly on the way randomness is used.) For Missing Item Finding on streams of length $r$ with elements in $\\{1,...n\\}$, and $\\le 1/\\text{poly}(n)$ error, we show that when $r = O(2^{\\sqrt{\\log n}})$, \"random seed\" adversarially robust algorithms, which only use randomness at initialization, require $r^{\\Omega(1)}$ bits of space, while \"random tape\" adversarially robust algorithms, which may make random decisions at any time, may use $O(\\text{polylog}(r))$ random bits. When $r = \\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$, \"random tape\" adversarially robust algorithms need $r^{\\Omega(1)}$ space, while \"random oracle\" adversarially robust algorithms, which can read from a long random string for free, may use $O(\\text{polylog}(r))$ space. The space lower bound for the \"random seed\" case follows, by a reduction given in prior work, from a lower bound for pseudo-deterministic streaming algorithms given in this paper. ",

    "abstract": "Building machines that can reason about physical events and their causal relationships is crucial for flexible interaction with the physical world. However, most existing physical and causal reasoning benchmarks are exclusively based on synthetically generated events and synthetic natural language descriptions of causal relationships. This design brings up two issues. First, there is a lack of diversity in both event types and natural language descriptions; second, causal relationships based on manually-defined heuristics are different from human judgments. To address both shortcomings, we present the CLEVRER-Humans benchmark, a video reasoning dataset for causal judgment of physical events with human labels. We employ two techniques to improve data collection efficiency: first, a novel iterative event cloze task to elicit a new representation of events in videos, which we term Causal Event Graphs (CEGs); second, a data augmentation technique based on neural language generative models. We convert the collected CEGs into questions and answers to be consistent with prior work. Finally, we study a collection of baseline approaches for CLEVRER-Humans question-answering, highlighting the great challenges set forth by our benchmark. ",

    "abstract": "Data-driven constitutive modeling with neural networks has received increased interest in recent years due to its ability to easily incorporate physical and mechanistic constraints and to overcome the challenging and time-consuming task of formulating phenomenological constitutive laws that can accurately capture the observed material response. However, even though neural network-based constitutive laws have been shown to generalize proficiently, the generated representations are not easily interpretable due to their high number of trainable parameters. Sparse regression approaches exist that allow to obtaining interpretable expressions, but the user is tasked with creating a library of model forms which by construction limits their expressiveness to the functional forms provided in the libraries. In this work, we propose to train regularized physics-augmented neural network-based constitutive models utilizing a smoothed version of $L^{0}$-regularization. This aims to maintain the trustworthiness inherited by the physical constraints, but also enables interpretability which has not been possible thus far on any type of machine learning-based constitutive model where model forms were not assumed a-priory but were actually discovered. During the training process, the network simultaneously fits the training data and penalizes the number of active parameters, while also ensuring constitutive constraints such as thermodynamic consistency. We show that the method can reliably obtain interpretable and trustworthy constitutive models for compressible and incompressible hyperelasticity, yield functions, and hardening models for elastoplasticity, for synthetic and experimental data.

    "abstract": "Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have demonstrated promising performance in self-supervised learning for both 2D and 3D computer vision. Nevertheless, existing MAE-based methods still have certain drawbacks. Firstly, the functional decoupling between the encoder and decoder is incomplete, which limits the encoder's representation learning ability. Secondly, downstream tasks solely utilize the encoder, failing to fully leverage the knowledge acquired through the encoder-decoder architecture in the pre-text task. In this paper, we propose Point Regress AutoEncoder (Point-RAE), a new scheme for regressive autoencoders for point cloud self-supervised learning. The proposed method decouples functions between the decoder and the encoder by introducing a mask regressor, which predicts the masked patch representation from the visible patch representation encoded by the encoder and the decoder reconstructs the target from the predicted masked patch representation. By doing so, we minimize the impact of decoder updates on the representation space of the encoder. Moreover, we introduce an alignment constraint to ensure that the representations for masked patches, predicted from the encoded representations of visible patches, are aligned with the masked patch presentations computed from the encoder. To make full use of the knowledge learned in the pre-training stage, we design a new finetune mode for the proposed Point-RAE. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is efficient during pre-training and generalizes well on various downstream tasks. Specifically, our pre-trained models achieve a high accuracy of \\textbf{90.28\\%} on the ScanObjectNN hardest split and \\textbf{94.1\\%} accuracy on ModelNet40, surpassing all the other self-supervised learning methods.

To address this vulnerability, we propose SmoothLLM, the first algorithm designed to mitigate jailbreaking attacks on LLMs. Based on our finding that adversarially-generated prompts are brittle to character-level changes, our defense first randomly perturbs multiple copies of a given input prompt, and then aggregates the corresponding predictions to detect adversarial inputs. SmoothLLM reduces the attack success rate on numerous popular LLMs to below one percentage point, avoids unnecessary conservatism, and admits provable guarantees on attack mitigation. Moreover, our defense uses exponentially fewer queries than existing attacks and is compatible with any LLM. ",

It identifies a non-equilibrium property of auctions that governs whether or not their worst-case equilibria are good for welfare and revenue. This property is easy to analyze, can be refined from data, and composes across markets where multiple auctions are run simultaneously. ",

Within this formalization, we define the robust novelty detection as the task of finding semantic changes while being robust to style distributional shifts. Leveraging pretrained, large-scale model representations, we introduce Stylist, a novel method that focuses on dropping environment-biased features. First, we compute a per-feature score based on the feature distribution distances between environments. Next, we show that our selection manages to remove features responsible for spurious correlations and improve novelty detection performance. For evaluation, we adapt domain generalization datasets to our task and analyze the methods behaviors. We additionally built a large synthetic dataset where we have control over the spurious correlations degree. We prove that our selection mechanism improves novelty detection algorithms across multiple datasets, containing both stylistic and content shifts. ",

While recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers have shown to be effective and promising, they face the following limitations: Transformer self-attention does not explicitly consider the underlying molecule structure while GNN feature representation alone is not sufficient to capture granular and hidden interactions and characteristics that distinguish similar molecules. To address these limitations, we propose SYN- FUSION, a novel approach that synergistically combines pre-trained features from GNNs and Transformers. This approach provides a comprehensive molecular representation, capturing both the global molecule structure and the individual atom characteristics. Experimental results on MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate superior performance, surpassing previous models in 5 out of 7 classification datasets and 4 out of 6 regression datasets. The performance of SYN-FUSION has been compared with other Graph-Transformer models that have been jointly trained using a combination of transformer and graph features, and it is found that our approach is on par with those models in terms of performance. Extensive analysis of the learned fusion model across aspects such as loss, latent space, and weight distribution further validates the effectiveness of SYN-FUSION. Finally, an ablation study unequivocally demonstrates that the synergy achieved by SYN-FUSION surpasses the performance of its individual model components and their ensemble, offering a substantial improvement in predicting molecular properties.

Common aggregation operators, such as averaging, result in loss of information at the atom level. In this work, we propose a novel aggregating approach where each atom is weighted non-linearly using the Boltzmann distribution with a hyperparameter analogous to temperature. We show that using this weighted aggregation improves the ability of the gold standard message-passing neural network to predict antibiotic activity. Moreover, by changing the temperature hyperparameter, our approach can reveal the atoms that are important for activity prediction in a smooth and consistent way, thus providing a novel, regulated attention mechanism for graph neural networks. We further validate our method by showing that it recapitulates the functional group in beta-Lactam antibiotics. The ability of our approach to rank the atoms' importance for a desired function can be used within any graph neural network to provide interpretability of the results and predictions at the node level.

Some methods have been proposed to select a subset of patches as WSI representation for downstream tasks. While most of the computational pathology tasks are designed to classify or detect the presence of pathological lesions in each WSI, the confounding role and redundant nature of normal histology in tissue samples are generally overlooked in WSI representations. In this paper, we propose and validate the concept of an \"atlas of normal tissue\" solely using samples of WSIs obtained from normal tissue biopsies. Such atlases can be employed to eliminate normal fragments of tissue samples and hence increase the representativeness collection of patches. We tested our proposed method by establishing a normal atlas using 107 normal skin WSIs and demonstrated how established indexes and search engines like Yottixel can be improved. We used 553 WSIs of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) to show the advantage. We also validated our method applied to an external dataset of 451 breast WSIs. The number of selected WSI patches was reduced by 30% to 50% after utilizing the proposed normal atlas while maintaining the same indexing and search performance in leave-one-patinet-out validation for both datasets.

There exists a global network cost that is characterized by a time-varying convex function, which evolves in an adversarial manner and is sequentially and partially observed by local agents. The goal of each agent is to generate a control sequence that can compete with the best centralized control policy in hindsight, which has access to the global cost. This problem is formulated as a regret minimization. For the case of known dynamics, we propose a fully distributed disturbance feedback controller that guarantees a regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{T}\\log T)$, where $T$ is the time horizon. For the unknown dynamics case, we design a distributed explore-then-commit approach, where in the exploration phase all agents jointly learn the system dynamics, and in the learning phase our proposed control algorithm is applied using each agent system estimate.

To address this issue, computer-aided diagnosis systems based on machine learning techniques have emerged to assist doctors in identifying lung nodules from computed tomography (CT) scans. Unfortunately, existing networks in this domain often suffer from computational complexity, leading to high rates of false negatives and false positives, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we present an innovative model that harnesses the strengths of both convolutional neural networks and vision transformers.

The primary objective of our work is to overcome hardware limitations during model training, allowing for efficient processing of 2D data while utilizing inter-slice information for accurate identification based on 3D image context. We validated the proposed network by applying a 10-fold cross-validation technique to the publicly available Lung Nodule Analysis 2016 dataset.

In this work, we employ a self-supervised neural network model to achieve two outcomes: to recover the interaction network and to predict the dynamics of individual agents. Both these information are inferred solely from the observed trajectory data. This work presents an application of the Neural Relational Inference model to two dynamical systems: coupled particles mediated by Hooke's law interaction and coupled phase (Kuramoto) oscillators. ",

    "title": "Complex-valued universal linear transformations and image encryption  using spatially incoherent diffractive networks",
    "abstract": "As an optical processor, a Diffractive Deep Neural Network (D2NN) utilizes engineered diffractive surfaces designed through machine learning to perform all-optical information processing, completing its tasks at the speed of light propagation through thin optical layers. With sufficient degrees-of-freedom, D2NNs can perform arbitrary complex-valued linear transformations using spatially coherent light. Similarly, D2NNs can also perform arbitrary linear intensity transformations with spatially incoherent illumination; however, under spatially incoherent light, these transformations are non-negative, acting on diffraction-limited optical intensity patterns at the input field-of-view (FOV). Here, we expand the use of spatially incoherent D2NNs to complex-valued information processing for executing arbitrary complex-valued linear transformations using spatially incoherent light. Through simulations, we show that as the number of optimized diffractive features increases beyond a threshold dictated by the multiplication of the input and output space-bandwidth products, a spatially incoherent diffractive visual processor can approximate any complex-valued linear transformation and be used for all-optical image encryption using incoherent illumination. The findings are important for the all-optical processing of information under natural light using various forms of diffractive surface-based optical processors. ",

As researchers in this domain and organizers of one of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events challenges tasks, we recognize the importance of addressing the environmental impact of data-driven SED systems. In this paper, we propose an analysis focused on SED systems based on the challenge submissions. This includes a comparison across the past two years and a detailed analysis of this year's SED systems. Through this research, we aim to explore how the SED systems are evolving every year in relation to their energy efficiency implications. ",

In this work, we create a new observational constraint of regime-dependent ice microphysical properties at the spatio-temporal coverage of geostationary satellite instruments and the quality of active satellite retrievals. We achieve this by training a convolutional neural network on three years of SEVIRI and DARDAR data sets. This work will enable novel research to improve ice cloud process understanding and hence, reduce uncertainties in a changing climate and help assess geoengineering methods for cirrus clouds. ",

To that end, we construct a new family of Banach spaces defined via a regularization operator and the $k$-plane transform. We prove a representer theorem that states that the solution sets to learning problems posed over these Banach spaces are completely characterized by neural architectures with multivariate nonlinearities. These optimal architectures have skip connections and are tightly connected to orthogonal weight normalization and multi-index models, both of which have received considerable interest in the neural network community. Our framework is compatible with a number of classical nonlinearities including the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, the norm activation function, and the radial basis functions found in the theory of thin-plate/polyharmonic splines. We also show that the underlying spaces are special instances of reproducing kernel Banach spaces and variation spaces. Our results shed light on the regularity of functions learned by neural networks trained on data, particularly with multivariate nonlinearities, and provide new theoretical motivation for several architectural choices found in practice.
