    "title": "Divorce Prediction with Machine Learning: Insights and LIME  Interpretability",
    "abstract": "Divorce is one of the most common social issues in developed countries like in the United States. Almost 50% of the recent marriages turn into an involuntary divorce or separation. While it is evident that people vary to a different extent, and even over time, an incident like Divorce does not interrupt the individual's daily activities; still, Divorce has a severe effect on the individual's mental health, and personal life. Within the scope of this research, the divorce prediction was carried out by evaluating a dataset named by the 'divorce predictor dataset' to correctly classify between married and Divorce people using six different machine learning algorithms- Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Gaussian Na\\\"ive Bayes (NB), and, Support Vector Machines (SVM). Preliminary computational results show that algorithms such as SVM, KNN, and LDA, can perform that task with an accuracy of 98.57%. This work's additional novel contribution is the detailed and comprehensive explanation of prediction probabilities using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). Utilizing LIME to analyze test results illustrates the possibility of differentiating between divorced and married couples. Finally, we have developed a divorce predictor app considering ten most important features that potentially affect couples in making decisions in their divorce, such tools can be used by any one in order to identify their relationship condition.

    "abstract": "In color spaces where the chromatic term is given in polar coordinates, the shortest distance between colors of the same value is circular. By converting such a space into a complex polar form with a real-valued value axis, a color algebra for combining colors is immediately available. In this work, we introduce two complex space operations utilizing this observation: circular average filtering and circular linear interpolation. These operations produce Archimedean Spirals, thus guaranteeing that they operate along the shortest paths. We demonstrate that these operations provide an intuitive way to work in certain color spaces and that they are particularly useful for obtaining better filtering and interpolation results. We present a set of examples based on the perceptually uniform color space CIELAB or L*a*b* with its polar form CIEHLC. We conclude that representing colors in a complex space with circular operations can provide better visual results by exploitation of the strong algebraic properties of complex space C. ",

    "abstract": "Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems often serve as the nervous system for substations within power grids. These systems facilitate real-time monitoring, data acquisition, control of equipment, and ensure smooth and efficient operation of the substation and its connected devices. Previous work has shown that dimensionality reduction-based approaches, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can be used for accurate identification of anomalies in SCADA systems. While not specifically applied to SCADA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has shown strong results at detecting anomalies in wireless sensor networks. These unsupervised approaches model the normal or expected behavior and detect the unseen types of attacks or anomalies by identifying the events that deviate from the expected behavior. These approaches; however, do not model the complex and multi-dimensional interactions that are naturally present in SCADA systems. Differently, non-negative tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning (ML) method that can model the complex and multi-faceted activity details of SCADA events. In this work, we novelly apply the tensor decomposition method Canonical Polyadic Alternating Poisson Regression (CP-APR) with a probabilistic framework, which has previously shown state-of-the-art anomaly detection results on cyber network data, to identify anomalies in SCADA systems. We showcase that the use of statistical behavior analysis of SCADA communication with tensor decomposition improves the specificity and accuracy of identifying anomalies in electrical grid systems. In our experiments, we model real-world SCADA system data collected from the electrical grid operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) which provides transmission and distribution service through a partnership with Los Alamos County, and detect synthetically generated anomalies.

The histogram-based method is designed to accurately detect homogeneous anomalies in the toy examples of the challenge, such as blobs with constant intensity values. The diffusion-based method is based on one of the latest methods for unsupervised anomaly detection, called DDPM-OOD. We explore this method and propose extensive post-processing steps for pixel-level and sample-level anomaly detection on brain MRI and abdominal CT data provided by the challenge. Our results show that the proposed DDPM method is sensitive to blur and bias field samples, but faces challenges with anatomical deformation, black slice, and swapped patches. These findings suggest that further research is needed to improve the performance of DDPM for OOD detection in medical images. ",

    "abstract": "Modern IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) networks extensively rely on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to significantly improve throughput. To correctly beamform MIMO transmissions, the access point needs to frequently acquire a beamforming matrix (BM) from each connected station. However, the size of the matrix grows with the number of antennas and subcarriers, resulting in an increasing amount of airtime overhead and computational load at the station. Conventional approaches come with either excessive computational load or loss of beamforming precision. For this reason, we propose SplitBeam, a new framework where we train a split deep neural network (DNN) to directly output the BM given the channel state information (CSI) matrix as input. We formulate and solve a bottleneck optimization problem (BOP) to keep computation, airtime overhead, and bit error rate (BER) below application requirements. We perform extensive experimental CSI collection with off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices in two distinct environments and compare the performance of SplitBeam with the standard IEEE 802.11 algorithm for BM feedback and the state-of-the-art DNN-based approach LB-SciFi. Our experimental results show that SplitBeam reduces the beamforming feedback size and computational complexity by respectively up to 81% and 84% while maintaining BER within about 10^-3 of existing approaches. We also implement the SplitBeam DNNs on FPGA hardware to estimate the end-to-end BM reporting delay, and show that the latter is less than 10 milliseconds in the most complex scenario, which is the target channel sounding frequency in realistic multi-user MIMO scenarios.

Recent research efforts have focused on model-heterogeneous FL, by extracting reduced-size models from the global model and applying them to local clients accordingly. Despite the empirical success, general theoretical guarantees of convergence on this method remain an open question. In this paper, we present a unifying framework for heterogeneous FL algorithms with online model extraction and provide a general convergence analysis. In particular, we prove that under certain sufficient conditions and for both IID and non-IID data, these algorithms converge to a stationary point of standard FL for general smooth cost functions. Moreover, we illuminate two key factors impacting its convergence: model-extraction noise and minimum coverage index, advocating a joint design of local model extraction for efficient heterogeneous FL.

Current robustness-oriented methods like adversarial training, secure aggregation, and homomorphic encryption often risk privacy compromises. The central aim is to defend the network against potential privacy breaches while maintaining model robustness against adversarial manipulations. We show that incorporating distributed noise, grounded in the privacy guarantees in federated settings, enables the development of a adversarially robust model that also meets federated privacy standards. We conducted comprehensive evaluations across diverse attack scenarios, parameters, and use cases in cancer imaging, concentrating on pathology, meningioma, and glioma. The results reveal that the incorporation of distributed noise allows for the attainment of security levels comparable to those of conventional adversarial training while requiring fewer retraining samples to establish a robust model.

We conducted an in-depth qualitative study with 21 US BLV participants to understand their data privacy risk perception and mitigation, as well as their information behaviors related to data privacy. We also explored BLV users' attitudes towards potential privacy question answering (Q&A) assistants that enable them to better navigate data privacy information. We found that BLV users face heightened security and privacy risks, but their risk mitigation is often insufficient. They do not necessarily seek data privacy information but clearly recognize the benefits of a potential privacy Q&A assistant. They also expect privacy Q&A assistants to possess cross-platform compatibility, support multi-modality, and demonstrate robust functionality. Our study sheds light on BLV users' expectations when it comes to usability, accessibility, trust and equity issues regarding digital data privacy. ",

To address these challenges, we employed an iterative design process to understand programmers' strategies when programming with LLMs. Based on our findings, we developed CoLadder, a system that assists programmers by enabling hierarchical task decomposition, incremental code generation, and verification of results during prompt authoring. A user study with 12 experienced programmers showed that CoLadder is effective in helping programmers externalize their mental models flexibly, improving their ability to navigate and edit code across various abstraction levels, from initial intent to final code implementation.

These biases in news consumption play a significant role in the creation of echo chambers and the reinforcement of beliefs. This phenomenon, in turn, influences the voting intentions of the population during critical electoral periods. In this study, we use a metric called \"Sentiment Bias\", a tool designed to classify news outlets according to their biases. We explore the impact of this metric on various levels, ranging from news outlets to individual user biases. Our metric, while simple, unveils a well-known trend: users prefer news aligning with their political beliefs. Its power lies in extending this insight to specific topics. Users consistently share articles related to subjects that echo their favored candidates, illuminating a deeper layer of political alignment in online discourse. ",

Thus, it is essential to determine the difficulty of extracting all the parameters of such neural networks when given access to their black-box implementations. Many versions of this problem have been studied over the last 30 years, and the best current attack on ReLU-based deep neural networks was presented at Crypto 2020 by Carlini, Jagielski, and Mironov. It resembles a differential chosen plaintext attack on a cryptosystem, which has a secret key embedded in its black-box implementation and requires a polynomial number of queries but an exponential amount of time (as a function of the number of neurons). In this paper, we improve this attack by developing several new techniques that enable us to extract with arbitrarily high precision all the real-valued parameters of a ReLU-based DNN using a polynomial number of queries and a polynomial amount of time. We demonstrate its practical efficiency by applying it to a full-sized neural network for classifying the CIFAR10 dataset, which has 3072 inputs, 8 hidden layers with 256 neurons each, and over million neuronal parameters. An attack following the approach by Carlini et al. requires an exhaustive search over 2 to the power 256 possibilities.

However, extending such models to situations where the customer chooses more than one item (such as in e-commerce shopping) has proven problematic. While one can construct reasonable models of the customer's behavior, estimating such models becomes very challenging because of the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible subsets of items. In this paper we develop a transformer neural network architecture, the Transformer Choice Net, that is suitable for predicting multiple choices. Transformer networks turn out to be especially suitable for this task as they take into account not only the features of the customer and the items but also the context, which in this case could be the assortment as well as the customer's past choices. On a range of benchmark datasets, our architecture shows uniformly superior out-of-sample prediction performance compared to the leading models in the literature, without requiring any custom modeling or tuning for each instance.

This leads to suboptimal performance of standard GNNs on imbalanced graphs. In this paper, we introduce a unique approach that tackles imbalanced classification on graphs by considering graph heterophily. We investigate the intricate relationship between class imbalance and graph heterophily, revealing that minority classes not only exhibit a scarcity of samples but also manifest lower levels of homophily, facilitating the propagation of erroneous information among neighboring nodes. Drawing upon this insight, we propose an efficient method, called Fast Im-GBK, which integrates an imbalance classification strategy with heterophily-aware GNNs to effectively address the class imbalance problem while significantly reducing training time. Our experiments on real-world graphs demonstrate our model's superiority in classification performance and efficiency for node classification tasks compared to existing baselines. ",

In contrast to the centralized approach, decentralized FL (DFL) has the advantage of utilizing network topology and local dataset, enabling the exploration of moving target defense (MTD) based approaches. This work presents a theoretical analysis of the influence of network topology on the rubostness of DFL models. Drawing inspiration from these findings, a three-stage MTD-based aggregation protocol, called as Voyager, is proposed to improve the resilience of DFL against poisoning attacks through the manipulation of network topology connectivity. Voyager has three main components: an anomaly detector, a network topology explorer, and a connection deployer. When an abnormal model is detected in the network, the topology explorer responds strategically by forming connections with more trustworthy participants to secure the model. Experimental evaluations show that Voyager effectively mitigates various poisoning attacks without imposing significant resource and computational burdens on participants. These findings highlight the proposed reactive MTD as a potent defense mechanism in the context of DFL. ",

This is because a multi-agent system itself is highly complex and unstationary. However, in real-world situation uncertainty can occur in multiple environment variables simultaneously. This work is the first to formulate the generalised problem of robustness to multi-modal environment uncertainty in MARL.

To overcome these limitations, researchers have integrated learning algorithms with evolutionary techniques. This integration harnesses the valuable data generated by EC algorithms during iterative searches, providing insights into the search space and population dynamics. Similarly, the relationship between evolutionary algorithms and Machine Learning (ML) is reciprocal, as EC methods offer exceptional opportunities for optimizing complex ML tasks characterized by noisy, inaccurate, and dynamic objective functions. These hybrid techniques, known as Evolutionary Machine Learning (EML), have been applied at various stages of the ML process. EC techniques play a vital role in tasks such as data balancing, feature selection, and model training optimization. Moreover, ML tasks often require dynamic optimization, for which Evolutionary Dynamic Optimization (EDO) is valuable. This paper presents the first comprehensive exploration of reciprocal integration between EDO and ML. The study aims to stimulate interest in the evolutionary learning community and inspire innovative contributions in this domain. ",

Beyond the zero-shot setup in which they are being conventionally used, being able to take advantage of the information from the relevant query-corpus paired data has the power to further boost the LLM capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Search-Adaptor, for customizing LLMs for information retrieval in an efficient and robust way. Search-Adaptor modifies the original text embedding generated by pre-trained LLMs, and can be integrated with any LLM, including those only available via APIs. On multiple real-world English and multilingual retrieval datasets, we show consistent and significant performance benefits for Search-Adaptor -- e.g., more than 5.2% improvements over the Google Embedding APIs in nDCG@10 averaged over 13 BEIR datasets.

By drawing analogies between natural language and structured EHR, we introduce various machine learning algorithms used in natural language processing (NLP) applications to build models for treatment failure detection and prediction. In this regard, we generated a cohort of patients with clopidogrel prescriptions from UK Biobank and annotated if the patients had treatment failure events within one year of the first clopidogrel prescription; out of 502,527 patients, 1,824 patients were identified as treatment failure cases, and 6,859 patients were considered as control cases. From the dataset, we gathered diagnoses, prescriptions, and procedure records together per patient and organized them into visits with the same date to build models. The models were built for two different tasks, i.e., detection and prediction, and the experimental results showed that time series models outperform bag-of-words approaches in both tasks. In particular, a Transformer-based model, namely BERT, could reach 0.928 AUC in detection tasks and 0.729 AUC in prediction tasks. BERT also showed competence over other time series models when there is not enough training data, because it leverages the pre-training procedure using large unlabeled data. ",

This detector is based on a self-attention mechanism along with the transformer encoder-decoder architecture to capture the global context in the image. The critical issue to be addressed is how this model architecture can handle different image nuisances, such as occlusion and adversarial perturbations. We studied this issue by measuring the performance of DETR with different experiments and benchmarking the network with convolutional neural network (CNN) based detectors like YOLO and Faster-RCNN. We found that DETR performs well when it comes to resistance to interference from information loss in occlusion images. Despite that, we found that the adversarial stickers put on the image require the network to produce a new unnecessary set of keys, queries, and values, which in most cases, results in a misdirection of the network. DETR also performed poorer than YOLOv5 in the image corruption benchmark. Furthermore, we found that DETR depends heavily on the main query when making a prediction, which leads to imbalanced contributions between queries since the main query receives most of the gradient flow.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in multivariate time series has emerged as a crucial challenge in time series research, with significant research implications in various fields such as fraud detection, fault diagnosis, and system state estimation. Reconstruction-based models have shown promising potential in recent years for detecting anomalies in time series data. However, due to the rapid increase in data scale and dimensionality, the issues of noise and Weak Identity Mapping (WIM) during time series reconstruction have become increasingly pronounced. To address this, we introduce a novel Adaptive Dynamic Neighbor Mask (ADNM) mechanism and integrate it with the Transformer and Denoising Diffusion Model, creating a new framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection, named Denoising Diffusion Mask Transformer (DDMT). The ADNM module is introduced to mitigate information leakage between input and output features during data reconstruction, thereby alleviating the problem of WIM during reconstruction. The Denoising Diffusion Transformer (DDT) employs the Transformer as an internal neural network structure for Denoising Diffusion Model. It learns the stepwise generation process of time series data to model the probability distribution of the data, capturing normal data patterns and progressively restoring time series data by removing noise, resulting in a clear recovery of anomalies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that combines Denoising Diffusion Model and the Transformer for multivariate time series anomaly detection. Experimental evaluations were conducted on five publicly available multivariate time series anomaly detection datasets. The results demonstrate that the model effectively identifies anomalies in time series data, achieving state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection. ",

This phenomenon often impairs the model's ability to learn new classes. However, the forward compatibility of the model is less considered in existing work, which hinders the model's suitability for incremental learning. To overcome this obstacle, we propose to use a language-visual model such as CLIP to generate text feature embeddings for different class sets, which enhances the feature space globally. We then employ the broad classes to replace the unavailable novel classes in the early learning stage to simulate the actual incremental scenario. Finally, we use the CLIP image encoder to identify potential objects in the proposals, which are classified into the background by the model. We modify the background labels of those proposals to known classes and add the boxes to the training set to alleviate the problem of data ambiguity. We evaluate our approach on various incremental learning settings on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, and our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly for the new classes. ",

Traditional techniques, while cornerstone for software quality assurance, exhibit limitations in handling intricate business logic and extensive codebases. To address these challenges, we introduce the Intelligent Code Analysis Agent (ICAA), a novel concept combining AI models, engineering process designs, and traditional non-AI components. The ICAA employs the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 or GPT-4 to automatically detect and diagnose code errors and business logic inconsistencies. In our exploration of this concept, we observed a substantial improvement in bug detection accuracy, reducing the false-positive rate to 66\\% from the baseline's 85\\%, and a promising recall rate of 60.8\\%. However, the token consumption cost associated with LLMs, particularly the average cost for analyzing each line of code, remains a significant consideration for widespread adoption. Despite this challenge, our findings suggest that the ICAA holds considerable potential to revolutionize software quality assurance, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of bug detection in the software development process. We hope this pioneering work will inspire further research and innovation in this field, focusing on refining the ICAA concept and exploring ways to mitigate the associated costs. ",

    "abstract": "Overfitting negatively impacts the generalization ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in both natural and adversarial training. Existing methods struggle to consistently address different types of overfitting, typically designing strategies that focus separately on either natural or adversarial patterns. In this work, we adopt a unified perspective by solely focusing on natural patterns to explore different types of overfitting. Specifically, we examine the memorization effect in DNNs and reveal a shared behaviour termed over-memorization, which impairs their generalization capacity. This behaviour manifests as DNNs suddenly becoming high-confidence in predicting certain training patterns and retaining a persistent memory for them. Furthermore, when DNNs over-memorize an adversarial pattern, they tend to simultaneously exhibit high-confidence prediction for the corresponding natural pattern. These findings motivate us to holistically mitigate different types of overfitting by hindering the DNNs from over-memorization natural patterns. To this end, we propose a general framework, Distraction Over-Memorization (DOM), which explicitly prevents over-memorization by either removing or augmenting the high-confidence natural patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in mitigating overfitting across various training paradigms. ",

A highly performant object detector requires accurate ranking for the bounding box predictions. For DETR-based detectors, the top-ranked bounding boxes suffer from less accurate localization quality due to the misalignment between classification scores and localization accuracy, thus impeding the construction of high-quality detectors. In this work, we introduce a simple and highly performant DETR-based object detector by proposing a series of rank-oriented designs, combinedly called Rank-DETR. Our key contributions include: (i) a rank-oriented architecture design that can prompt positive predictions and suppress the negative ones to ensure lower false positive rates, as well as (ii) a rank-oriented loss function and matching cost design that prioritizes predictions of more accurate localization accuracy during ranking to boost the AP under high IoU thresholds. We apply our method to improve the recent SOTA methods (e.g., H-DETR and DINO-DETR) and report strong COCO object detection results when using different backbones such as ResNet-$50$, Swin-T, and Swin-L, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing aims to extract an abstract semantic graph from a given sentence. The sequence-to-sequence approaches, which linearize the semantic graph into a sequence of nodes and edges and generate the linearized graph directly, have achieved good performance. However, we observed that these approaches suffer from structure loss accumulation during the decoding process, leading to a much lower F1-score for nodes and edges decoded later compared to those decoded earlier. To address this issue, we propose a novel Reverse Graph Linearization (RGL) enhanced framework. RGL defines both default and reverse linearization orders of an AMR graph, where most structures at the back part of the default order appear at the front part of the reversed order and vice versa. RGL incorporates the reversed linearization to the original AMR parser through a two-pass self-distillation mechanism, which guides the model when generating the default linearizations. Our analysis shows that our proposed method significantly mitigates the problem of structure loss accumulation, outperforming the previously best AMR parsing model by 0.8 and 0.5 Smatch scores on the AMR 2.0 and AMR 3.0 dataset, respectively.

However, in actual situations, there is usually noise interference, which will cause significant performance degradation in FAD systems. To improve the noise robustness, we propose a dual-branch knowledge distillation fake audio detection (DKDFAD) method. Specifically, a parallel data flow of the clean teacher branch and the noisy student branch is designed, and interactive fusion and response-based teacher-student paradigms are proposed to guide the training of noisy data from the data distribution and decision-making perspectives. In the noise branch, speech enhancement is first introduced for denoising, which reduces the interference of strong noise. The proposed interactive fusion combines denoising features and noise features to reduce the impact of speech distortion and seek consistency with the data distribution of clean branch. The teacher-student paradigm maps the student's decision space to the teacher's decision space, making noisy speech behave as clean. In addition, a joint training method is used to optimize the two branches to achieve global optimality. Experimental results based on multiple datasets show that the proposed method performs well in noisy environments and maintains performance in cross-dataset experiments. ",

    "abstract": "We study the allocation of shared resources over multiple rounds among competing agents, via a dynamic max-min fair (DMMF) mechanism: the good in each round is allocated to the requesting agent with the least number of allocations received to date. Previous work has shown that when an agent has i.i.d. values across rounds, then in the worst case, she can never get more than a constant strictly less than $1$ fraction of her ideal utility -- her highest achievable utility given her nominal share of resources. Moreover, an agent can achieve at least half her utility under carefully designed `pseudo-market' mechanisms, even though other agents may act in an arbitrary (possibly adversarial and collusive) manner. We show that this robustness guarantee also holds under the much simpler DMMF mechanism. More significantly, under mild assumptions on the value distribution, we show that DMMF in fact allows each agent to realize a $1 - o(1)$ fraction of her ideal utility, despite arbitrary behavior by other agents. We achieve this by characterizing the utility achieved under a richer space of strategies, wherein an agent can tune how aggressive to be in requesting the item. Our new strategies also allow us to handle settings where an agent's values are correlated across rounds, thereby allowing an adversary to predict and block her future values. We prove that again by tuning one's aggressiveness, an agent can guarantee $\\Omega(\\gamma)$ fraction of her ideal utility, where $\\gamma\\in [0, 1]$ is a parameter that quantifies dependence across rounds (with $\\gamma = 1$ indicating full independence and lower values indicating more correlation). Finally, we extend our efficiency results to the case of reusable resources, where an agent might need to hold the item over multiple rounds to receive utility. ",

There are $L$ antennas at the server, and each cache has a normalized size of $M/N \\leq 1$. The cyclic wrap-around MACC network with a single antenna at the server has been a well-investigated topic, and several coded caching schemes and improved lower bounds on the performance are known for the same. However, this MACC network has not yet been studied under multi-antenna settings in the coded caching literature. We study the multi-antenna MACC problem and propose a solution for the same by constructing a pair of arrays called caching and delivery arrays. We present three constructions of caching and delivery arrays for different scenarios and obtain corresponding multi-antenna MACC schemes for the same. Two schemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance under uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by matching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal multi-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number of users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$. Further, as a special case, one of the proposed schemes subsumes an existing optimal MACC scheme for the single-antenna setting. ",

As the number of migrants (e.g., refugees) increases rapidly in recent years, a key challenge faced by each country is the problem of migrant resettlement. This problem has attracted scientific research attention, from the perspective of maximizing the employment rate. Previous works mainly formulated migrant resettlement as an approximately submodular optimization problem subject to multiple matroid constraints and employed the greedy algorithm, whose performance, however, may be limited due to its greedy nature. In this paper, we propose a new framework MR-EMO based on Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization, which reformulates Migrant Resettlement as a bi-objective optimization problem that maximizes the expected number of employed migrants and minimizes the number of dispatched migrants simultaneously, and employs a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) to solve the bi-objective problem. We implement MR-EMO using three MOEAs, the popular NSGA-II, MOEA/D as well as the theoretically grounded GSEMO. To further improve the performance of MR-EMO, we propose a specific MOEA, called GSEMO-SR, using matrix-swap mutation and repair mechanism, which has a better ability to search for feasible solutions. We prove that MR-EMO using either GSEMO or GSEMO-SR can achieve better theoretical guarantees than the previous greedy algorithm. Experimental results under the interview and coordination migration models clearly show the superiority of MR-EMO (with either NSGA-II, MOEA/D, GSEMO or GSEMO-SR) over previous algorithms, and that using GSEMO-SR leads to the best performance of MR-EMO.

Current works only consider document-level AIGT detection, therefore, in this paper, we first introduce a sentence-level detection challenge by synthesizing a dataset that contains documents that are polished with LLMs, that is, the documents contain sentences written by humans and sentences modified by LLMs. Then we propose \\textbf{Seq}uence \\textbf{X} (Check) \\textbf{GPT}, a novel method that utilizes log probability lists from white-box LLMs as features for sentence-level AIGT detection. These features are composed like \\textit{waves} in speech processing and cannot be studied by LLMs. Therefore, we build SeqXGPT based on convolution and self-attention networks. We test it in both sentence and document-level detection challenges. Experimental results show that previous methods struggle in solving sentence-level AIGT detection, while our method not only significantly surpasses baseline methods in both sentence and document-level detection challenges but also exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

    "abstract": "Community detection techniques are useful tools for social media platforms to discover tightly connected groups of users who share common interests. However, this functionality often comes at the expense of potentially exposing individuals to privacy breaches by inadvertently revealing their tastes or preferences. Therefore, some users may wish to safeguard their anonymity and opt out of community detection for various reasons, such as affiliation with political or religious organizations. In this study, we address the challenge of community membership hiding, which involves strategically altering the structural properties of a network graph to prevent one or more nodes from being identified by a given community detection algorithm. We tackle this problem by formulating it as a constrained counterfactual graph objective, and we solve it via deep reinforcement learning. We validate the effectiveness of our method through two distinct tasks: node and community deception. Extensive experiments show that our approach overall outperforms existing baselines in both tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation aims to alleviate the domain shift when transferring the knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain. Due to privacy issues, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA), where source data is unavailable during adaptation, has recently become very demanding yet challenging. Existing SFDA methods focus on either self-supervised learning of target samples or reconstruction of virtual source data. The former overlooks the transferable knowledge in the source model, whilst the latter introduces even more uncertainty. To address the above issues, this paper proposes self-supervised intermediate domain exploration (SIDE) that effectively bridges the domain gap with an intermediate domain, where samples are cyclically filtered out in a self-supervised fashion. First, we propose cycle intermediate domain filtering (CIDF) to cyclically select intermediate samples with similar distributions over source and target domains. Second, with the aid of those intermediate samples, an inter-domain gap transition (IDGT) module is developed to mitigate possible distribution mismatches between the source and target data. Finally, we introduce cross-view consistency learning (CVCL) to maintain the intrinsic class discriminability whilst adapting the model to the target domain. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks, i.e. Office-31, Office-Home and VisDA-C, show that our proposed SIDE achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Approximation of high-dimensional functions is a problem in many scientific fields that is only feasible if advantageous structural properties, such as sparsity in a given basis, can be exploited. A relevant tool for analysing sparse approximations is Stechkin's lemma. In its standard form, however, this lemma does not allow to explain convergence rates for a wide range of relevant function classes. This work presents a new weighted version of Stechkin's lemma that improves the best $n$-term rates for weighted $\\ell^p$-spaces and associated function classes such as Sobolev or Besov spaces. For the class of holomorphic functions, which occur as solutions of common high-dimensional parameter-dependent PDEs, we recover exponential rates that are not directly obtainable with Stechkin's lemma. Since weighted $\\ell^p$-summability induces weighted sparsity, compressed sensing algorithms can be used to approximate the associated functions. To break the curse of dimensionality, which these algorithms suffer, we recall that sparse approximations can be encoded efficiently using tensor networks with sparse component tensors. We also demonstrate that weighted $\\ell^p$-summability induces low ranks, which motivates a second tensor train format with low ranks and a single weighted sparse core. We present new alternating algorithms for best $n$-term approximation in both formats. To analyse the sample complexity for the new model classes, we derive a novel result of independent interest that allows the transfer of the restricted isometry property from one set to another sufficiently close set. Although they lead up to the analysis of our final model class, our contributions on weighted Stechkin and the restricted isometry property are of independent interest and can be read independently.

To address these challenges, we present \\textbf{CAMELL} (Confidence-based Acquisition Model for Efficient self-supervised active Learning with Label validation), a pool-based active learning framework tailored for sequential multi-output problems. CAMELL possesses three core features: (1) it requires expert annotators to label only a fraction of a chosen sequence, (2) it facilitates self-supervision for the remainder of the sequence, and (3) it employs a label validation mechanism to prevent erroneous labels from contaminating the dataset and harming model performance. We evaluate CAMELL on sequential tasks, with a special emphasis on dialogue belief tracking, a task plagued by the constraints of limited and noisy datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that CAMELL outperforms the baselines in terms of efficiency. Furthermore, the data corrections suggested by our method contribute to an overall improvement in the quality of the resulting datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomalous sound detection (ASD) aims to detect unknown anomalous sounds of devices when only normal sound data is available. The autoencoder (AE) and self-supervised learning based methods are two mainstream methods. However, the AE-based methods could be limited as the feature learned from normal sounds can also fit with anomalous sounds, reducing the ability of the model in detecting anomalies from sound. The self-supervised methods are not always stable and perform differently, even for machines of the same type. In addition, the anomalous sound may be short-lived, making it even harder to distinguish from normal sound. This paper proposes an ID constrained Transformer-based autoencoder (IDC-TransAE) architecture with weighted anomaly score computation for unsupervised ASD. Machine ID is employed to constrain the latent space of the Transformer-based autoencoder (TransAE) by introducing a simple ID classifier to learn the difference in the distribution for the same machine type and enhance the ability of the model in distinguishing anomalous sound. Moreover, weighted anomaly score computation is introduced to highlight the anomaly scores of anomalous events that only appear for a short time. Experiments performed on DCASE 2020 Challenge Task2 development dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. ",

The primary aim of this proposed method is to provide operators a comprehensive understanding of the availability, status, and problems specific to each node. This information is vital for ensuring the smooth operation. The sequential nature of logs and the absence of a rich text corpus that is specific to our nodes poses significant limitations for traditional and learning-based approaches for anomaly detection. To overcome this limitation, we propose a method that uses word embedding and models individual nodes as a sequence of these vectors that commonly co-occur, using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We score individual log entries by computing a probability ratio between the probability of the full log sequence including the new entry and the probability of just the previous log entries, without the new entry. This ratio indicates how probable the sequence becomes when the new entry is added. The proposed approach can detect anomalies by scoring and ranking log entries from EuXFEL nodes where entries that receive high scores are potential anomalies that do not fit the routine of the node. This method provides a warning system to alert operators about these irregular log events that may indicate issues. ",

    "abstract": "Existing deep learning-based depth completion methods generally employ massive stacked layers to predict the dense depth map from sparse input data. Although such approaches greatly advance this task, their accompanied huge computational complexity hinders their practical applications. To accomplish depth completion more efficiently, we propose a novel lightweight deep network framework, the Long-short Range Recurrent Updating (LRRU) network. Without learning complex feature representations, LRRU first roughly fills the sparse input to obtain an initial dense depth map, and then iteratively updates it through learned spatially-variant kernels. Our iterative update process is content-adaptive and highly flexible, where the kernel weights are learned by jointly considering the guidance RGB images and the depth map to be updated, and large-to-small kernel scopes are dynamically adjusted to capture long-to-short range dependencies. Our initial depth map has coarse but complete scene depth information, which helps relieve the burden of directly regressing the dense depth from sparse ones, while our proposed method can effectively refine it to an accurate depth map with less learnable parameters and inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed LRRU variants achieve state-of-the-art performance across different parameter regimes. In particular, the LRRU-Base model outperforms competing approaches on the NYUv2 dataset, and ranks 1st on the KITTI depth completion benchmark at the time of submission.

An accurate measurement and prediction of airspace density is crucial for a better managed airspace, both strategically and tactically, yielding a higher level of automation and thereby reducing the air traffic controller's workload. Although the prior approaches have been able to address the problem to some extent, data management and query processing of ever-increasing vast volume of air traffic data at high rates, for various analytics purposes such as predicting aircraft counts, still remains a challenge especially when only linear prediction models are used. In this paper, we present a novel data management and prediction system that accurately predicts aircraft counts for a particular airspace sector within the National Airspace System (NAS). The incoming Traffic Flow Management (TFM) data is streaming, big, uncorrelated and noisy. In the preprocessing step, the system continuously processes the incoming raw data, reduces it to a compact size, and stores it in a NoSQL database, where it makes the data available for efficient query processing. In the prediction step, the system learns from historical trajectories and uses their segments to collect key features such as sector boundary crossings, weather parameters, and other air traffic data. The features are fed into various regression models, including linear, non-linear and ensemble models, and the best performing model is used for prediction. Evaluation on an extensive set of real track, weather, and air traffic data including boundary crossings in the U.S. verify that our system efficiently and accurately predicts aircraft counts in each airspace sector.

Aiming to address this huge inefficiency, we designed and developed a novel Data Analytics and Machine Learning system, which aims at reducing delays by proactively supporting re-routing decisions. Given a time interval up to a few days in the future, the system predicts if a reroute advisory for a certain Air Route Traffic Control Center or for a certain advisory identifier will be issued, which may impact the pertinent routes. To deliver such predictions, the system uses historical reroute data, collected from the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) data services provided by the FAA, and weather data, provided by the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The data is huge in volume, and has many items streamed at high velocity, uncorrelated and noisy. The system continuously processes the incoming raw data and makes it available for the next step where an interim data store is created and adaptively maintained for efficient query processing. The resulting data is fed into an array of ML algorithms, which compete for higher accuracy. The best performing algorithm is used in the final prediction, generating the final results. Mean accuracy values higher than 90% were obtained in our experiments with this system. Our algorithm divides the area of interest in units of aggregation and uses temporal series of the aggregate measures of weather forecast parameters in each geographical unit, in order to detect correlations with reroutes and where they will most likely occur.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have already become quite proficient at solving simpler programming tasks like those in HumanEval or MBPP benchmarks. However, solving more complex and competitive programming tasks is still quite challenging for these models - possibly due to their tendency to generate solutions as monolithic code blocks instead of decomposing them into logical sub-tasks and sub-modules. On the other hand, experienced programmers instinctively write modularized code with abstraction for solving complex tasks, often reusing previously developed modules. To address this gap, we propose CodeChain, a novel framework for inference that elicits modularized code generation through a chain of self-revisions, each being guided by some representative sub-modules generated in previous iterations. Concretely, CodeChain first instructs the LLM to generate modularized codes through chain-of-thought prompting. Then it applies a chain of self-revisions by iterating the two steps: 1) extracting and clustering the generated sub-modules and selecting the cluster representatives as the more generic and re-usable implementations, and 2) augmenting the original chain-of-thought prompt with these selected module-implementations and instructing the LLM to re-generate new modularized solutions. We find that by naturally encouraging the LLM to reuse the previously developed and verified sub-modules, CodeChain can significantly boost both modularity as well as correctness of the generated solutions, achieving relative pass@1 improvements of 35% on APPS and 76% on CodeContests. It is shown to be effective on both OpenAI LLMs as well as open-sourced LLMs like WizardCoder. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies with different methods of prompting, number of clusters, model sizes, program qualities, etc., to provide useful insights that underpin CodeChain's success.

It harnesses the inherent heterogeneity among training clients, effectively transforming it into an advantage for out-of-distribution generalization on unseen working conditions or equipment types. Additionally, an adaptive interpolation method that calculates the optimal combination of local and global models as the initialization of local training is proposed. This helps to further utilize local information to mitigate the negative effects of domain discrepancy. As a result, high diagnostic accuracy can be achieved on unseen working conditions or equipment types with limited training data. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, such as FedProx, the proposed REFML framework achieves an increase in accuracy by 2.17%-6.50% when tested on unseen working conditions of the same equipment type and 13.44%-18.33% when tested on totally unseen equipment types, respectively.

    "abstract": "Salient object detection (SOD) in panoramic video is still in the initial exploration stage. The indirect application of 2D video SOD method to the detection of salient objects in panoramic video has many unmet challenges, such as low detection accuracy, high model complexity, and poor generalization performance. To overcome these hurdles, we design an Inter-Layer Attention (ILA) module, an Inter-Layer weight (ILW) module, and a Bi-Modal Attention (BMA) module. Based on these modules, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Dual-Mode Mixed Flow Network (STDMMF-Net) that exploits the spatial flow of panoramic video and the corresponding optical flow for SOD. First, the ILA module calculates the attention between adjacent level features of consecutive frames of panoramic video to improve the accuracy of extracting salient object features from the spatial flow. Then, the ILW module quantifies the salient object information contained in the features of each level to improve the fusion efficiency of the features of each level in the mixed flow. Finally, the BMA module improves the detection accuracy of STDMMF-Net. A large number of subjective and objective experimental results testify that the proposed method demonstrates better detection accuracy than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Moreover, the comprehensive performance of the proposed method is better in terms of memory required for model inference, testing time, complexity, and generalization performance. ",

    "abstract": "This work designs a novel semantic communication (SemCom) framework for the next-generation wireless network to tackle the challenges of unnecessary transmission of vast amounts that cause high bandwidth consumption, more latency, and experience with bad quality of services (QoS). In particular, these challenges hinder applications like intelligent transportation systems (ITS), metaverse, mixed reality, and the Internet of Everything, where real-time and efficient data transmission is paramount. Therefore, to reduce communication overhead and maintain the QoS of emerging applications such as metaverse, ITS, and digital twin creation, this work proposes a novel semantic communication framework. First, an intelligent semantic transmitter is designed to capture the meaningful information (e.g., the rode-side image in ITS) by designing a domain-specific Mobile Segment Anything Model (MSAM)-based mechanism to reduce the potential communication traffic while QoS remains intact. Second, the concept of generative AI is introduced for building the SemCom to reconstruct and denoise the received semantic data frame at the receiver end. In particular, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) mechanism is designed to maintain a superior quality reconstruction under different signal-to-noise (SNR) channel conditions. Finally, we have tested and evaluated the proposed semantic communication (SemCom) framework with the real-world 6G scenario of ITS; in particular, the base station equipped with an RGB camera and a mmWave phased array. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SemCom framework by achieving high-quality reconstruction across various SNR channel conditions, resulting in 93.45% data reduction in communication.

As a by-product, our method also enables the estimation of the entropy of random variables. Armed with such building blocks, we present a general recipe to measure MI, which unfolds in two directions: one uses conditional diffusion process, whereas the other uses joint diffusion processes that allow simultaneous modelling of two random variables. Our results, which derive from a thorough experimental protocol over all the variants of our approach, indicate that our method is more accurate than the main alternatives from the literature, especially for challenging distributions. Furthermore, our methods pass MI self-consistency tests, including data processing and additivity under independence, which instead are a pain-point of existing methods. ",

A common approach to address this issue is to retrieve relevant knowledge and fine-tune the LLM with the knowledge in its input. Unfortunately, this method incurs high training costs and may cause catastrophic forgetting for multi-tasking models. To overcome these limitations, we propose a knowledge-constrained decoding method called KCTS (Knowledge-Constrained Tree Search), which guides a frozen LM to generate text aligned with the reference knowledge at each decoding step using a knowledge classifier score and MCTS (Monte-Carlo Tree Search). To adapt the sequence-level knowledge classifier to token-level guidance, we also propose a novel token-level hallucination detection method called RIPA (Reward Inflection Point Approximation). Our empirical results on knowledge-grounded dialogue and abstractive summarization demonstrate the strength of KCTS as a plug-and-play, model-agnostic decoding method that can effectively reduce hallucinations in natural language generation.

However, in the existing works, the black-box nature of deep neural networks (DNNs) limits the analysis, development, and improvement of systems. In recent times, interpretable deep learning (DL) represented by deep neuro-fuzzy systems (DNFS) combined with fuzzy inference has shown promising interpretability to further exploit the hidden value in the data. Motivated by this, we propose a DNFS-based VNE algorithm that aims to provide an interpretable NV scheme. Specifically, data-driven convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used as fuzzy implication operators to compute the embedding probabilities of candidate substrate nodes through entailment operations. And, the identified fuzzy rule patterns are cached into the weights by forward computation and gradient back-propagation (BP). In addition, the fuzzy rule base is constructed based on Mamdani-type linguistic rules using linguistic labels.

To mitigate this issue, we introduce Split-N-Denoise (SnD), an innovative framework that split the model to execute the token embedding layer on the client side at minimal computational cost. This allows the client to introduce noise prior to transmitting the embeddings to the server, and subsequently receive and denoise the perturbed output embeddings for downstream tasks. Our approach is designed for the inference stage of LLMs and requires no modifications to the model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate SnD's effectiveness in optimizing the privacy-utility tradeoff across various LLM architectures and diverse downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Text-based visual question answering (TextVQA) faces the significant challenge of avoiding redundant relational inference. To be specific, a large number of detected objects and optical character recognition (OCR) tokens result in rich visual relationships. Existing works take all visual relationships into account for answer prediction. However, there are three observations: (1) a single subject in the images can be easily detected as multiple objects with distinct bounding boxes (considered repetitive objects). The associations between these repetitive objects are superfluous for answer reasoning; (2) two spatially distant OCR tokens detected in the image frequently have weak semantic dependencies for answer reasoning; and (3) the co-existence of nearby objects and tokens may be indicative of important visual cues for predicting answers. Rather than utilizing all of them for answer prediction, we make an effort to identify the most important connections or eliminate redundant ones. We propose a sparse spatial graph network (SSGN) that introduces a spatially aware relation pruning technique to this task. As spatial factors for relation measurement, we employ spatial distance, geometric dimension, overlap area, and DIoU for spatially aware pruning. We consider three visual relationships for graph learning: object-object, OCR-OCR tokens, and object-OCR token relationships. SSGN is a progressive graph learning architecture that verifies the pivotal relations in the correlated object-token sparse graph, and then in the respective object-based sparse graph and token-based sparse graph. Experiment results on TextVQA and ST-VQA datasets demonstrate that SSGN achieves promising performances. And some visualization results further demonstrate the interpretability of our method. ",

Even though these models offer impressive performance, their practical application is often limited by the prohibitive amount of resources required for every inference. Early-exiting dynamic neural networks (EDNN) circumvent this issue by allowing a model to make some of its predictions from intermediate layers (i.e., early-exit). Training an EDNN architecture is challenging as it consists of two intertwined components: the gating mechanism (GM) that controls early-exiting decisions and the intermediate inference modules (IMs) that perform inference from intermediate representations. As a result, most existing approaches rely on thresholding confidence metrics for the gating mechanism and strive to improve the underlying backbone network and the inference modules. Although successful, this approach has two fundamental shortcomings: 1) the GMs and the IMs are decoupled during training, leading to a train-test mismatch; and 2) the thresholding gating mechanism introduces a positive bias into the predictive probabilities, making it difficult to readily extract uncertainty information. We propose a novel architecture that connects these two modules. This leads to significant performance improvements on classification datasets and enables better uncertainty characterization capabilities. ",

    "abstract": "Training on large-scale graphs has achieved remarkable results in graph representation learning, but its cost and storage have attracted increasing concerns. Existing graph condensation methods primarily focus on optimizing the feature matrices of condensed graphs while overlooking the impact of the structure information from the original graphs. To investigate the impact of the structure information, we conduct analysis from the spectral domain and empirically identify substantial Laplacian Energy Distribution (LED) shifts in previous works. Such shifts lead to poor performance in cross-architecture generalization and specific tasks, including anomaly detection and link prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel Structure-broadcasting Graph Dataset Distillation (SGDD) scheme for broadcasting the original structure information to the generation of the synthetic one, which explicitly prevents overlooking the original structure information. Theoretically, the synthetic graphs by SGDD are expected to have smaller LED shifts than previous works, leading to superior performance in both cross-architecture settings and specific tasks. We validate the proposed SGDD across 9 datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results on all of them: for example, on the YelpChi dataset, our approach maintains 98.6% test accuracy of training on the original graph dataset with 1,000 times saving on the scale of the graph. Moreover, we empirically evaluate there exist 17.6% ~ 31.4% reductions in LED shift crossing 9 datasets.

    "abstract": "Quadrotor motion planning in complex environments leverage the concept of safe flight corridor (SFC) to facilitate static obstacle avoidance. Typically, SFCs are constructed through convex decomposition of the environment's free space into cuboids, convex polyhedra, or spheres. However, when dealing with a quadrotor swarm, such SFCs can be overly conservative, substantially limiting the available free space for quadrotors to coordinate. This paper presents an Alternating Minimization-based approach that does not require building a conservative free-space approximation. Instead, both static and dynamic collision constraints are treated in a unified manner. Dynamic collisions are handled based on shared position trajectories of the quadrotors. Static obstacle avoidance is coupled with distance queries from the Octomap, providing an implicit non-convex decomposition of free space. As a result, our approach is scalable to arbitrary complex environments. Through extensive comparisons in simulation, we demonstrate a $60\\%$ improvement in success rate, an average $1.8\\times$ reduction in mission completion time, and an average $23\\times$ reduction in per-agent computation time compared to SFC-based approaches. We also experimentally validated our approach using a Crazyflie quadrotor swarm of up to 12 quadrotors in obstacle-rich environments.

Recently, the emerging graph condensation (GC) sheds light on reducing the computational cost of GNNs from a data perspective. It aims to replace the real large graph with a significantly smaller synthetic graph so that GNNs trained on both graphs exhibit comparable performance. However, our empirical investigation reveals that existing GC methods suffer from poor generalization, i.e., different GNNs trained on the same synthetic graph have obvious performance gaps. What factors hinder the generalization of GC and how can we mitigate it? To answer this question, we commence with a detailed analysis and observe that GNNs will inject spectrum bias into the synthetic graph, resulting in a distribution shift. To tackle this issue, we propose eigenbasis matching for spectrum-free graph condensation, named GCEM, which has two key steps: First, GCEM matches the eigenbasis of the real and synthetic graphs, rather than the graph structure, which eliminates the spectrum bias of GNNs. Subsequently, GCEM leverages the spectrum of the real graph and the synthetic eigenbasis to construct the synthetic graph, thereby preserving the essential structural information. We theoretically demonstrate that the synthetic graph generated by GCEM maintains the spectral similarity, i.e., total variation, of the real graph. Extensive experiments conducted on five graph datasets verify that GCEM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance over baselines but also significantly narrows the performance gaps between different GNNs.

It is associated with an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications, but can be clinically silent. Passive AF monitoring with wearables may help reduce adverse clinical outcomes related to AF. Detecting AF in noisy wearable data poses a significant challenge, leading to the emergence of various deep learning techniques. Previous deep learning models learn from a single modality, either electrocardiogram (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. However, deep learning models often struggle to learn generalizable features and rely on features that are more susceptible to corruption from noise, leading to sub-optimal performances in certain scenarios, especially with low-quality signals. Given the increasing availability of ECG and PPG signal pairs from wearables and bedside monitors, we propose a new approach, SiamAF, leveraging a novel Siamese network architecture and joint learning loss function to learn shared information from both ECG and PPG signals. At inference time, the proposed model is able to predict AF from either PPG or ECG and outperforms baseline methods on three external test sets. It learns medically relevant features as a result of our novel architecture design. The proposed model also achieves comparable performance to traditional learning regimes while requiring much fewer training labels, providing a potential approach to reduce future reliance on manual labeling.

    "abstract": "Structure learning is essential for Bayesian networks (BNs) as it uncovers causal relationships, and enables knowledge discovery, predictions, inferences, and decision-making under uncertainty. Two novel algorithms, FSBN and SSBN, based on the PC algorithm, employ local search strategy and conditional independence tests to learn the causal network structure from data. They incorporate d-separation to infer additional topology information, prioritize conditioning sets, and terminate the search immediately and efficiently. FSBN achieves up to 52% computation cost reduction, while SSBN surpasses it with a remarkable 72% reduction for a 200-node network. SSBN demonstrates further efficiency gains due to its intelligent strategy. Experimental studies show that both algorithms match the induction quality of the PC algorithm while significantly reducing computation costs. This enables them to offer interpretability and adaptability while reducing the computational burden, making them valuable for various applications in big data analytics. ",

    "title": "ClickPrompt: CTR Models are Strong Prompt Generators for Adapting  Language Models to CTR Prediction",
    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction has become increasingly indispensable for various Internet applications. Traditional CTR models convert the multi-field categorical data into ID features via one-hot encoding, and extract the collaborative signals among features. Such a paradigm suffers from the problem of semantic information loss. Another line of research explores the potential of pretrained language models (PLMs) for CTR prediction by converting input data into textual sentences through hard prompt templates. Although semantic signals are preserved, they generally fail to capture the collaborative information (e.g., feature interactions, pure ID features), not to mention the unacceptable inference overhead brought by the huge model size. In this paper, we aim to model both the semantic knowledge and collaborative knowledge for accurate CTR estimation, and meanwhile address the inference inefficiency issue. To benefit from both worlds and close their gaps, we propose a novel model-agnostic framework (i.e., ClickPrompt), where we incorporate CTR models to generate interaction-aware soft prompts for PLMs. We design a prompt-augmented masked language modeling (PA-MLM) pretraining task, where PLM has to recover the masked tokens based on the language context, as well as the soft prompts generated by CTR model. The collaborative and semantic knowledge from ID and textual features would be explicitly aligned and interacted via the prompt interface. Then, we can either tune the CTR model with PLM for superior performance, or solely tune the CTR model without PLM for inference efficiency. Experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of ClickPrompt compared with existing baselines. ",

This morphologically rich language boasts a rich literary tradition, encompassing diverse dialects and language-specific challenges.

This paper presents our submission to Task 2 (Sentiment Analysis of Bangla Social Media Posts) of the BLP Workshop. We experiment with various Transformer-based architectures to solve this task. Our quantitative results show that transfer learning really helps in better learning of the models in this low-resource language scenario. This becomes evident when we further finetune a model which has already been finetuned on twitter data for sentiment analysis task and that finetuned model performs the best among all other models. We also perform a detailed error analysis where we find some instances where ground truth labels need to be relooked at.

    "abstract": "Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has become an increasingly crucial task in Legal AI, i.e., predicting the judgment of the case in terms of case fact description. Precedents are the previous legal cases with similar facts, which are the basis for the judgment of the subsequent case in national legal systems. Thus, it is worthwhile to explore the utilization of precedents in the LJP. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled a variety of techniques to be used to solve the LJP task. These can be broken down into two categories: large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific models. LLMs are capable of interpreting and generating complex natural language, while domain models are efficient in learning task-specific information. In this paper, we propose the precedent-enhanced LJP framework (PLJP), a system that leverages the strength of both LLM and domain models in the context of precedents. Specifically, the domain models are designed to provide candidate labels and find the proper precedents efficiently, and the large models will make the final prediction with an in-context precedents comprehension. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our PLJP. Moreover, our work shows a promising direction for LLM and domain-model collaboration that can be generalized to other vertical domains. ",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning is a common and effective method for tailoring large language models (LLMs) to specialized tasks and applications. In this paper, we study the privacy implications of fine-tuning LLMs on user data. To this end, we define a realistic threat model, called user inference, wherein an attacker infers whether or not a user's data was used for fine-tuning. We implement attacks for this threat model that require only a small set of samples from a user (possibly different from the samples used for training) and black-box access to the fine-tuned LLM. We find that LLMs are susceptible to user inference attacks across a variety of fine-tuning datasets, at times with near perfect attack success rates. Further, we investigate which properties make users vulnerable to user inference, finding that outlier users (i.e. those with data distributions sufficiently different from other users) and users who contribute large quantities of data are most susceptible to attack. Finally, we explore several heuristics for mitigating privacy attacks. We find that interventions in the training algorithm, such as batch or per-example gradient clipping and early stopping fail to prevent user inference. However, limiting the number of fine-tuning samples from a single user can reduce attack effectiveness, albeit at the cost of reducing the total amount of fine-tuning data. ",

However, recent studies have largely neglected the utilization of multimodal data that presents significant practical and technical advantages compared to single-modal approaches. This research focuses on leveraging digital surface model (DSM) data and aerial images captured at different times for detecting change beyond 2D. We observe that the current change detection methods struggle with the multitask conflicts between semantic and height change detection tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient Transformer-based network that learns shared representation between cross-dimensional inputs through cross-attention. It adopts a consistency constraint to establish the multimodal relationship, which involves obtaining pseudo change through height change thresholding and minimizing the difference between semantic and pseudo change within their overlapping regions. A DSM-to-image multimodal dataset encompassing three cities in the Netherlands was constructed. It lays a new foundation for beyond-2D change detection from cross-dimensional inputs. Compared to five state-of-the-art change detection methods, our model demonstrates consistent multitask superiority in terms of semantic and height change detection. Furthermore, the consistency strategy can be seamlessly adapted to the other methods, yielding promising improvements. ",

Nevertheless, existing implicit representation approaches only focus on building continuous appearance mapping, ignoring the continuities of the semantic information across pixels. As a result, they can hardly achieve desired reconstruction results when the semantic information within input images is corrupted, for example, a large region misses. To address the issue, we propose to learn semantic-aware implicit representation (SAIR), that is, we make the implicit representation of each pixel rely on both its appearance and semantic information (\\eg, which object does the pixel belong to). To this end, we propose a framework with two modules: (1) building a semantic implicit representation (SIR) for a corrupted image whose large regions miss. Given an arbitrary coordinate in the continuous domain, we can obtain its respective text-aligned embedding indicating the object the pixel belongs. (2) building an appearance implicit representation (AIR) based on the SIR. Given an arbitrary coordinate in the continuous domain, we can reconstruct its color whether or not the pixel is missed in the input. We validate the novel semantic-aware implicit representation method on the image inpainting task, and the extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin.

We analyze the value of targeting in the context of a large-scale field experiment with over 53,000 college students, where the goal was to use \"nudges\" to encourage students to renew their financial-aid applications before a non-binding deadline. We begin with baseline approaches to targeting. First, we target based on a causal forest that estimates heterogeneous treatment effects and then assigns students to treatment according to those estimated to have the highest treatment effects. Next, we evaluate two alternative targeting policies, one targeting students with low predicted probability of renewing financial aid in the absence of the treatment, the other targeting those with high probability. The predicted baseline outcome is not the ideal criterion for targeting, nor is it a priori clear whether to prioritize low, high, or intermediate predicted probability. Nonetheless, targeting on low baseline outcomes is common in practice, for example because the relationship between individual characteristics and treatment effects is often difficult or impossible to estimate with historical data. We propose hybrid approaches that incorporate the strengths of both predictive approaches (accurate estimation) and causal approaches (correct criterion); we show that targeting intermediate baseline outcomes is most effective, while targeting based on low baseline outcomes is detrimental. In one year of the experiment, nudging all students improved early filing by an average of 6.4 percentage points over a baseline average of 37% filing, and we estimate that targeting half of the students using our preferred policy attains around 75% of this benefit.

Because GFlowNets are well-suited for sampling complex combinatorial structures, they are a natural choice for exploring and sampling from the multimodal posterior distribution over tree topologies and evolutionary distances. We demonstrate that our amortized posterior sampler, PhyloGFN, produces diverse and high-quality evolutionary hypotheses on real benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "The problem of quickest change detection (QCD) in autoregressive (AR) models is investigated. A system is being monitored with sequentially observed samples. At some unknown time, a disturbance signal occurs and changes the distribution of the observations. The disturbance signal follows an AR model, which is dependent over time. Before the change, observations only consist of measurement noise, and are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). After the change, observations consist of the disturbance signal and the measurement noise, are dependent over time, which essentially follow a continuous-state hidden Markov model (HMM). The goal is to design a stopping time to detect the disturbance signal as quickly as possible subject to false alarm constraints. Existing approaches for general non-i.i.d. settings and discrete-state HMMs cannot be applied due to their high computational complexity and memory consumption, and they usually assume some asymptotic stability condition. In this paper, the asymptotic stability condition is firstly theoretically proved for the AR model by a novel design of forward variable and auxiliary Markov chain. A computationally efficient Ergodic CuSum algorithm that can be updated recursively is then constructed and is further shown to be asymptotically optimal. The data-driven setting where the disturbance signal parameters are unknown is further investigated, and an online and computationally efficient gradient ascent CuSum algorithm is designed. The algorithm is constructed by iteratively updating the estimate of the unknown parameters based on the maximum likelihood principle and the gradient ascent approach. The lower bound on its average running length to false alarm is also derived for practical false alarm control. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms. ",

Training the learning-based methods with synthetic data emerges as an efficient and practical alternative to paired real data. However, the quality of synthetic data is inherently limited by the low accuracy of the noise model, which decreases the performance of low-light raw image denoising. In this paper, we develop a novel framework for accurate noise modeling that learns a physics-guided noise neural proxy (PNNP) from dark frames. PNNP integrates three efficient techniques: physics-guided noise decoupling (PND), physics-guided proxy model (PPM), and differentiable distribution-oriented loss (DDL). The PND decouples the dark frame into different components and handles different levels of noise in a flexible manner, which reduces the complexity of the noise neural proxy. The PPM incorporates physical priors to effectively constrain the generated noise, which promotes the accuracy of the noise neural proxy. The DDL provides explicit and reliable supervision for noise modeling, which promotes the precision of the noise neural proxy. Extensive experiments on public low-light raw image denoising datasets and real low-light imaging scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of our PNNP framework. ",

    "abstract": "Learning measure-to-measure mappings is a crucial task in machine learning, featured prominently in generative modeling. Recent years have witnessed a surge of techniques that draw inspiration from optimal transport (OT) theory. Combined with neural network models, these methods collectively known as \\textit{Neural OT} use optimal transport as an inductive bias: such mappings should be optimal w.r.t. a given cost function, in the sense that they are able to move points in a thrifty way, within (by minimizing displacements) or across spaces (by being isometric). This principle, while intuitive, is often confronted with several practical challenges that require adapting the OT toolbox: cost functions other than the squared-Euclidean cost can be challenging to handle, the deterministic formulation of Monge maps leaves little flexibility, mapping across incomparable spaces raises multiple challenges, while the mass conservation constraint inherent to OT can provide too much credit to outliers. While each of these mismatches between practice and theory has been addressed independently in various works, we propose in this work an elegant framework to unify them, called \\textit{generative entropic neural optimal transport} (GENOT). GENOT can accommodate any cost function; handles randomness using conditional generative models; can map points across incomparable spaces, and can be used as an \\textit{unbalanced} solver. We evaluate our approach through experiments conducted on various synthetic datasets and demonstrate its practicality in single-cell biology. In this domain, GENOT proves to be valuable for tasks such as modeling cell development, predicting cellular responses to drugs, and translating between different data modalities of cells. ",
