    "abstract": "We have developed a comprehensive computer system to assist farmers who practice traditional farming methods and have limited access to agricultural experts for addressing crop diseases. Our system utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and provide remedies for vegetable diseases. To ensure ease of use, we have created a mobile application that offers a user-friendly interface, allowing farmers to inquire about vegetable diseases and receive suitable solutions in their local language. The developed system can be utilized by any farmer with a basic understanding of a smartphone. Specifically, we have designed an AI-enabled mobile application for identifying and suggesting remedies for vegetable diseases, focusing on tomato diseases to benefit the local farming community in Nepal. Our system employs state-of-the-art object detection methodology, namely You Only Look Once (YOLO), to detect tomato diseases. The detected information is then relayed to the mobile application, which provides remedy suggestions guided by domain experts. In order to train our system effectively, we curated a dataset consisting of ten classes of tomato diseases. We utilized various data augmentation methods to address overfitting and trained a YOLOv5 object detector. The proposed method achieved a mean average precision of 0.76 and offers an efficient mobile interface for interacting with the AI system. While our system is currently in the development phase, we are actively working towards enhancing its robustness and real-time usability by accumulating more training samples. ",

    "abstract": "Cyber-security vulnerabilities are usually published in form of short natural language descriptions (e.g., in form of MITRE's CVE list) that over time are further manually enriched with labels such as those defined by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In the Vulnerability AI (Analytics and Intelligence) project, we investigated different types of semantic vulnerability embeddings based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques to obtain a concise representation of the vulnerability space. We also evaluated their use as a foundation for machine learning applications that can support cyber-security researchers and analysts in risk assessment and other related activities. The particular applications we explored and briefly summarize in this report are clustering, classification, and visualization, as well as a new logic-based approach to evaluate theories about the vulnerability space.

They are central to a new regulatory model of collaborative governance, as embodied by the GDPR.

In this paper we conduct a close analysis of US NIST's Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology, highlighting multiple sites of discretion that create countless opportunities for adversarial organizations to engage in performative compliance. Our analysis shows that the premises on which the success of privacy risk assessments depends do not hold, particularly in regard to organizations' incentives and regulators auditing capabilities.

    "abstract": "Dance improvisation is an active research topic in the arts. Motion analysis of improvised dance can be challenging due to its unique dynamics. Data-driven dance motion analysis, including recognition and generation, is often limited to skeletal data. However, data of other modalities, such as audio, can be recorded and benefit downstream tasks. This paper explores the application and performance of multimodal fusion methods for human motion recognition in the context of dance improvisation. We propose an attention-based model, component attention network (CANet), for multimodal fusion on three levels: 1) feature fusion with CANet, 2) model fusion with CANet and graph convolutional network (GCN), and 3) late fusion with a voting strategy. We conduct thorough experiments to analyze the impact of each modality in different fusion methods and distinguish critical temporal or component features. We show that our proposed model outperforms the two baseline methods, demonstrating its potential for analyzing improvisation in dance. ",

The reputation of every individual is reflected on the team, as the fraud attempted by any member will be reflected on the team. Earlier studies pointed out the impact of citation penalty on the prior work of coauthors, the effect of retraction on a co-author's research career, and stigmatization through mere association. This paper explores the formation and dynamics of the networks of authors who faced retractions and their \"innocent coauthors\" who never faced retractions in their careers. Leveraging a dataset of 5972 retracted papers involving 24209 authors, we investigate whether scientific misconduct reduces collaborative ties of misconducting authors as opposed to those who never faced allegations of academic misconduct. We observe that the network structure of authors involved in retractions does not change significantly over the years compared to that of the \"innocent coauthors\". Our results suggest that stigmatization rarely affects the collaboration network of stigmatized authors. Our findings have implications for institutions adopting stringent measures and fostering ethical practices research. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presented insights into the implementation of transactive multi-agent systems over flow networks where local resources are decentralized. Agents have local resource demand and supply, and are interconnected through a flow network to support the sharing of local resources while respecting restricted sharing/flow capacity. We first establish a competitive market with a pricing mechanism that internalizes flow capacity constraints into agents' private decisions. We then demonstrate through duality theory that competitive equilibrium and social welfare equilibrium exist and agree under convexity assumptions, indicating the efficiency of the pricing mechanism. Additionally, a new social acceptance sharing problem is defined to investigate homogeneous pricing when the optimal sharing prices at all agents under competitive equilibrium are always equal for social acceptance. A conceptual computation method is proposed, prescribing a class of socially admissible utility functions to solve the social acceptance problem. A special case of linear-quadratic multi-agent systems over undirected star graphs is provided as a pedagogical example of how to explicitly prescribe socially admissible utility functions. Finally, extensive experiments are provided to validate the results. ",

The average classification accuracies of these classifiers are approximately 95% while evaluated on the test set corresponding to their training dataset. These classifiers also performed equivalently, with an average score of 84% on a dataset not seen during the training phase. ",

In this paper, we construct an interference neural network by applying additional background images and corresponding labels, and use pre-trained ResNet-152 to efficiently complete the training.

Sensor nodes in these networks are susceptible to a variety of assaults due to their special qualities and method of deployment. In WSNs, denial of service attacks are common attacks in sensor networks. It is difficult to design a detection and prevention system that would effectively reduce the impact of these attacks on WSNs. In order to identify assaults on WSNs, this study suggests using two machine learning models: decision trees and XGBoost. The WSNs dataset was the subject of extensive tests to identify denial of service attacks. The experimental findings demonstrate that the XGBoost model, when applied to the entire dataset, has a higher true positive rate (98.3%) than the Decision tree approach (97.3%) and a lower false positive rate (1.7%) than the Decision tree technique (2.7%). Like this, with selected dataset assaults, the XGBoost approach has a higher true positive rate (99.01%) than the Decision tree technique (97.50%) and a lower false positive rate (0.99%) than the Decision tree technique (2.50%).

In this work, we propose a novel network representation as a graph of flows that aims to provide relevant topological information for the intrusion detection task, such as malicious behavior patterns, the relation between phases of multi-step attacks, and the relation between spoofed and pre-spoofed attackers activities. In addition, we present a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based framework responsible for exploiting the proposed graph structure to classify communication flows by assigning them a maliciousness score. The framework comprises three main steps that aim to embed nodes features and learn relevant attack patterns from the network representation. Finally, we highlight a potential data leakage issue with classical evaluation procedures and suggest a solution to ensure a reliable validation of intrusion detection systems performance. We implement the proposed framework and prove that exploiting the flow-based graph structure outperforms the classical machine learning-based and the previous GNN-based solutions. ",

    "abstract": "With changing climatic conditions, we are already seeing an increase in extreme weather events and their secondary consequences, including landslides. Landslides threaten infrastructure, including roads, railways, buildings, and human life. Hazard-based spatial planning and early warning systems are cost-effective strategies to reduce the risk to society from landslides. However, these both rely on data from previous landslide events, which is often scarce. Many deep learning (DL) models have recently been applied for landside mapping using medium- to high-resolution satellite images as input. However, they often suffer from sensitivity problems, overfitting, and low mapping accuracy. This study addresses some of these limitations by using a diverse global landslide dataset, using different segmentation models, such as Unet, Linknet, PSP-Net, PAN, and DeepLab and based on their performances, building an ensemble model. The ensemble model achieved the highest F1-score (0.69) when combining both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 bands, with the highest average improvement of 6.87 % when the ensemble size was 20. On the other hand, Sentinel-2 bands only performed very well, with an F1 score of 0.61 when the ensemble size is 20 with an improvement of 14.59 % when the ensemble size is 20. This result shows considerable potential in building a robust and reliable monitoring system based on changes in vegetation index dNDVI only. ",

The behavior of volunteers in volunteer-based networks has been studied extensively in recent years. Here, we explore the development of volunteer-based social networks, primarily focusing on their key users' behaviors and activities. We developed two novel algorithms: the first reveals key user behavior patterns over time; the second utilizes machine learning methods to generate a forecasting model that can predict the future behavior of key users, including whether they will remain active donors or change their behavior to become mainly recipients, and vice-versa. These algorithms allowed us to analyze the factors that significantly influence behavior predictions. To evaluate our algorithms, we utilized data from over 2.4 million users on a peer-to-peer food-sharing online platform. Using our algorithm, we identified four main types of key user behavior patterns that occur over time. Moreover, we succeeded in forecasting future active donor key users and predicting the key users that would change their behavior to donors, with an accuracy of up to 89.6%. These findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of key users in volunteer-based social networks and pave the way for more effective communities-building in the future, while using the potential of machine learning for this goal.

    "abstract": "Social media is often criticized for amplifying toxic discourse and discouraging constructive conversations. But designing social media platforms to promote better conversations is inherently challenging. This paper asks whether simulating social media through a combination of Large Language Models (LLM) and Agent-Based Modeling can help researchers study how different news feed algorithms shape the quality of online conversations. We create realistic personas using data from the American National Election Study to populate simulated social media platforms. Next, we prompt the agents to read and share news articles - and like or comment upon each other's messages - within three platforms that use different news feed algorithms. In the first platform, users see the most liked and commented posts from users whom they follow. In the second, they see posts from all users - even those outside their own network. The third platform employs a novel \"bridging\" algorithm that highlights posts that are liked by people with opposing political views. We find this bridging algorithm promotes more constructive, non-toxic, conversation across political divides than the other two models. Though further research is needed to evaluate these findings, we argue that LLMs hold considerable potential to improve simulation research on social media and many other complex social settings. ",

Our perceptual embeddings are solutions to a weighted least squares (WLS) problem, defined at the pixel-level, and solved at inference-time, that can capture global and local image characteristics. The distance in embedding space is used to define a perceptual similarity metric which we call LASI: Linear Autoregressive Similarity Index. Experiments on full-reference image quality assessment datasets show LASI performs competitively with learned deep feature based methods like LPIPS (Zhang et al., 2018) and PIM (Bhardwaj et al., 2020), at a similar computational cost to hand-crafted methods such as MS-SSIM (Wang et al., 2003). We found that increasing the dimensionality of the embedding space consistently reduces the WLS loss while increasing performance on perceptual tasks, at the cost of increasing the computational complexity. LASI is fully differentiable, scales cubically with the number of embedding dimensions, and can be parallelized at the pixel-level. A Maximum Differentiation (MAD) competition (Wang & Simoncelli, 2008) between LASI and LPIPS shows that both methods are capable of finding failure points for the other, suggesting these metrics can be combined.

    "abstract": "Individual objects, whether users or services, within a specific region often exhibit similar network states due to their shared origin from the same city or autonomous system (AS). Despite this regional network similarity, many existing techniques overlook its potential, resulting in subpar performance arising from challenges such as data sparsity and label imbalance. In this paper, we introduce the regional-based dual latent state learning network(R2SL), a novel deep learning framework designed to overcome the pitfalls of traditional individual object-based prediction techniques in Quality of Service (QoS) prediction. Unlike its predecessors, R2SL captures the nuances of regional network behavior by deriving two distinct regional network latent states: the city-network latent state and the AS-network latent state. These states are constructed utilizing aggregated data from common regions rather than individual object data. Furthermore, R2SL adopts an enhanced Huber loss function that adjusts its linear loss component, providing a remedy for prevalent label imbalance issues. To cap off the prediction process, a multi-scale perception network is leveraged to interpret the integrated feature map, a fusion of regional network latent features and other pertinent information, ultimately accomplishing the QoS prediction. Through rigorous testing on real-world QoS datasets, R2SL demonstrates superior performance compared to prevailing state-of-the-art methods. Our R2SL approach ushers in an innovative avenue for precise QoS predictions by fully harnessing the regional network similarities inherent in objects. ",

While query-based 3D object detection for BEV (Bird's Eye View) images has seen significant advancements, most existing methods follows the paradigm of static query.

To solve this problem, we introduce a new paradigm in DynamicBEV, a novel approach that employs dynamic queries for BEV-based 3D object detection. In contrast to static queries, the proposed dynamic queries exploit K-means clustering and Top-K Attention in a creative way to aggregate information more effectively from both local and distant feature, which enable DynamicBEV to adapt iteratively to complex scenes. To further boost efficiency, DynamicBEV incorporates a Lightweight Temporal Fusion Module (LTFM), designed for efficient temporal context integration with a significant computation reduction. Additionally, a custom-designed Diversity Loss ensures a balanced feature representation across scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset validate the effectiveness of DynamicBEV, establishing a new state-of-the-art and heralding a paradigm-level breakthrough in query-based BEV object detection.

Traditional triage methods heavily rely on human judgment, which can be subjective and prone to errors. Recently, a growing interest has been in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to develop algorithms for triaging patients. This paper presents the development of a novel algorithm for triaging patients. It is based on the analysis of patient data to produce decisions regarding their prioritization. The algorithm was trained on a comprehensive data set containing relevant patient information, such as vital signs, symptoms, and medical history. The algorithm was designed to accurately classify patients into triage categories through rigorous preprocessing and feature engineering. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieved high accuracy and performance, outperforming traditional triage methods. By incorporating computer science into the triage process, healthcare professionals can benefit from improved efficiency, accuracy, and consistency, prioritizing patients effectively and optimizing resource allocation. Although further research is needed to address challenges such as biases in training data and model interpretability, the development of AI-based algorithms for triaging patients shows great promise in enhancing healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.

Our Dynamic Scene Transformer (DyST) model leverages recent work in neural scene representation to learn a latent decomposition of monocular real-world videos into scene content, per-view scene dynamics, and camera pose. This separation is achieved through a novel co-training scheme on monocular videos and our new synthetic dataset DySO.

    "abstract": "An ensemble post-processing method is developed for the probabilistic prediction of severe weather (tornadoes, hail, and wind gusts) over the conterminous United States (CONUS). The method combines conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs), a type of deep generative model, with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to post-process convection-allowing model (CAM) forecasts. The CGANs are designed to create synthetic ensemble members from deterministic CAM forecasts, and their outputs are processed by the CNN to estimate the probability of severe weather. The method is tested using High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) 1--24 hr forecasts as inputs and Storm Prediction Center (SPC) severe weather reports as targets. The method produced skillful predictions with up to 20% Brier Skill Score (BSS) increases compared to other neural-network-based reference methods using a testing dataset of HRRR forecasts in 2021. For the evaluation of uncertainty quantification, the method is overconfident but produces meaningful ensemble spreads that can distinguish good and bad forecasts. The quality of CGAN outputs is also evaluated. Results show that the CGAN outputs behave similarly to a numerical ensemble; they preserved the inter-variable correlations and the contribution of influential predictors as in the original HRRR forecasts. This work provides a novel approach to post-process CAM output using neural networks that can be applied to severe weather prediction. ",

The WHO suggests that alongside each completed suicide, there are many individuals who make attempts. Today, social media is a place where people share their feelings, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and love. This helps us understand how they are thinking or what they might do. This study takes advantage of this opportunity and focuses on developing an automated tool to find if someone may be thinking about harming themselves. It is developed based on the Suicidal-Electra model. We collected datasets of social media posts, processed them, and used them to train and fine-tune the model. Upon evaluating the refined model with a testing dataset, we consistently observed outstanding results. The model demonstrated an impressive accuracy rate of 93% and a commendable F1 score of 0.93. Additionally, we developed an API enabling seamless integration with third-party platforms, enhancing its potential for implementation to address the growing concern of rising suicide rates. ",

    "abstract": "Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a chronic genetic disorder characterized by recurrent acute painful episodes. Opioids are often used to manage these painful episodes; the extent of their use in managing pain in this disorder is an issue of debate. The risk of addiction and side effects of these opioid treatments can often lead to more pain episodes in the future. Hence, it is crucial to forecast future patient pain trajectories to help patients manage their SCD to improve their quality of life without compromising their treatment. It is challenging to obtain many pain records to design forecasting models since it is mainly recorded by patients' self-report. Therefore, it is expensive and painful (due to the need for patient compliance) to solve pain forecasting problems in a purely supervised manner. In light of this challenge, we propose to solve the pain forecasting problem using self-supervised learning methods. Also, clustering such time-series data is crucial for patient phenotyping, anticipating patients' prognoses by identifying \"similar\" patients, and designing treatment guidelines tailored to homogeneous patient subgroups. Hence, we propose a self-supervised learning approach for clustering time-series data, where each cluster comprises patients who share similar future pain profiles. Experiments on five years of real-world datasets show that our models achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks and identify meaningful clusters that can be translated into actionable information for clinical decision-making.

Furthermore, unsupervised generative modeling of inliers in pixel space has shown limited success for outlier detection. In this work, we introduce a quantile-based maximum likelihood objective for learning the inlier distribution to improve the outlier separation during inference. Our approach fits a normalizing flow to pre-trained discriminative features and detects the outliers according to the evaluated log-likelihood. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method as it surpasses the performance of the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods for outlier detection. The results are also competitive compared with a recent self-supervised approach for outlier detection.

However, recent studies empirically demonstrated that it suffers from robust overfitting, i.e., a long time AT can be detrimental to the robustness of DNNs. This paper presents a theoretical explanation of robust overfitting for DNNs. Specifically, we non-trivially extend the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory to AT and prove that an adversarially trained wide DNN can be well approximated by a linearized DNN. Moreover, for squared loss, closed-form AT dynamics for the linearized DNN can be derived, which reveals a new AT degeneration phenomenon: a long-term AT will result in a wide DNN degenerates to that obtained without AT and thus cause robust overfitting. Based on our theoretical results, we further design a method namely Adv-NTK, the first AT algorithm for infinite-width DNNs. Experiments on real-world datasets show that Adv-NTK can help infinite-width DNNs enhance comparable robustness to that of their finite-width counterparts, which in turn justifies our theoretical findings.

In this paper, we propose a factorized tensor network (FTN) that can achieve accuracy comparable to independent single-task/domain networks with a small number of additional parameters. FTN uses a frozen backbone network from a source model and incrementally adds task/domain-specific low-rank tensor factors to the shared frozen network. This approach can adapt to a large number of target domains and tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, FTN requires a significantly smaller number of task-specific parameters compared to existing methods. We performed experiments on widely used multi-domain and multi-task datasets. We show the experiments on convolutional-based architecture with different backbones and on transformer-based architecture. We observed that FTN achieves similar accuracy as single-task/domain methods while using only a fraction of additional parameters per task. ",

Current trajectory prediction models depend on long, complete, and accurately observed sequences from visual modalities. Nevertheless, real-world situations often involve obstructed cameras, missed objects, or objects out of sight due to environmental factors, leading to incomplete or noisy trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we propose LTrajDiff, a novel approach that treats objects obstructed or out of sight as equally important as those with fully visible trajectories. LTrajDiff utilizes sensor data from mobile phones to surmount out-of-sight constraints, albeit introducing new challenges such as modality fusion, noisy data, and the absence of spatial layout and object size information. We employ a denoising diffusion model to predict precise layout sequences from noisy mobile data using a coarse-to-fine diffusion strategy, incorporating the RMS, Siamese Masked Encoding Module, and MFM. Our model predicts layout sequences by implicitly inferring object size and projection status from a single reference timestamp or significantly obstructed sequences. Achieving SOTA results in randomly obstructed experiments and extremely short input experiments, our model illustrates the effectiveness of leveraging noisy mobile data. In summary, our approach offers a promising solution to the challenges faced by layout sequence and trajectory prediction models in real-world settings, paving the way for utilizing sensor data from mobile phones to accurately predict pedestrian bounding box trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses severely obstructed and extremely short layout sequences by combining vision with noisy mobile modality, making it the pioneering work in the field of layout sequence trajectory prediction.

To address this, we propose a framework that encourages the model to use a more diverse set of features to make predictions. We first train a simple model, and then regularize the conditional mutual information with respect to it to obtain the final model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in various problem settings and real-world applications, showing that it effectively addresses simplicity bias and leads to more features being used, enhances OOD generalization, and improves subgroup robustness and fairness.

Rather than using time-averaged forecasts to determine voltage magnitude constraints, we leverage worst-case minimum and maximum forecasts of loads and distributed energy resource generation. Sensitivities of the power flow equations are used to predict how these deviations in load and renewable generation will impact system voltages, and the voltage constraints in the OPF are dynamically adjusted to mitigate voltage violations due to this uncertainty.

For such imitation policies, errors away from the training samples are particularly critical. Even rare slip-ups in the policy action outputs can compound quickly over time, since they lead to unfamiliar future states where the policy is still more likely to err, eventually causing task failures. We revisit simple supervised ``behavior cloning'' for conveniently training the policy from nothing more than pre-recorded demonstrations, but carefully design the model class to counter the compounding error phenomenon. Our ``memory-consistent neural network'' (MCNN) outputs are hard-constrained to stay within clearly specified permissible regions anchored to prototypical ``memory'' training samples.

Using MCNNs on 9 imitation learning tasks, with MLP, Transformer, and Diffusion backbones, spanning dexterous robotic manipulation and driving, proprioceptive inputs and visual inputs, and varying sizes and types of demonstration data, we find large and consistent gains in performance, validating that MCNNs are better-suited than vanilla deep neural networks for imitation learning applications.

Recent work by Omi et al. [2019] proposes a dual network or AutoInt approach for efficient integration of flexible intensity function. However, the method only focuses on the 1D temporal point process. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm: AutoSTPP (Automatic Integration for Spatiotemporal Neural Point Processes) that extends the AutoInt approach to 3D STPP. We show that direct extension of the previous work overly constrains the intensity function, leading to poor performance. We prove consistency of AutoSTPP and validate it on synthetic data and benchmark real world datasets, showcasing its significant advantage in recovering complex intensity functions from irregular spatiotemporal events, particularly when the intensity is sharply localized.

It is found empirically that adversarially robust generalization is crucial in establishing defense algorithms against adversarial attacks. Therefore, it is interesting to study the theoretical guarantee of robust generalization. This paper focuses on norm-based complexity, based on a PAC-Bayes approach (Neyshabur et al., 2017). The main challenge lies in extending the key ingredient, which is a weight perturbation bound in standard settings, to the robust settings. Existing attempts heavily rely on additional strong assumptions, leading to loose bounds. In this paper, we address this issue and provide a spectrally-normalized robust generalization bound for DNNs. Compared to existing bounds, our bound offers two significant advantages: Firstly, it does not depend on additional assumptions. Secondly, it is considerably tighter, aligning with the bounds of standard generalization. Therefore, our result provides a different perspective on understanding robust generalization: The mismatch terms between standard and robust generalization bounds shown in previous studies do not contribute to the poor robust generalization. Instead, these disparities solely due to mathematical issues. Finally, we extend the main result to adversarial robustness against general non-$\\ell_p$ attacks and other neural network architectures. ",

    "title": "DiPS: Discriminative Pseudo-Label Sampling with Self-Supervised  Transformers for Weakly Supervised Object Localization",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised vision transformers (SSTs) have shown great potential to yield rich localization maps that highlight different objects in an image. However, these maps remain class-agnostic since the model is unsupervised. They often tend to decompose the image into multiple maps containing different objects while being unable to distinguish the object of interest from background noise objects. In this paper, Discriminative Pseudo-label Sampling (DiPS) is introduced to leverage these class-agnostic maps for weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL), where only image-class labels are available. Given multiple attention maps, DiPS relies on a pre-trained classifier to identify the most discriminative regions of each attention map. This ensures that the selected ROIs cover the correct image object while discarding the background ones, and, as such, provides a rich pool of diverse and discriminative proposals to cover different parts of the object. Subsequently, these proposals are used as pseudo-labels to train our new transformer-based WSOL model designed to perform classification and localization tasks. Unlike standard WSOL methods, DiPS optimizes performance in both tasks by using a transformer encoder and a dedicated output head for each task, each trained using dedicated loss functions. To avoid overfitting a single proposal and promote better object coverage, a single proposal is randomly selected among the top ones for a training image at each training step. Experimental results on the challenging CUB, ILSVRC, OpenImages, and TelDrone datasets indicate that our architecture, in combination with our transformer-based proposals, can yield better localization performance than state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Current motion planning approaches rely on binary collision checking to evaluate the validity of a state and thereby dictate where the robot is allowed to move. This approach leaves little room for robots to engage in contact with an object, as is often necessary when operating in densely cluttered spaces. In this work, we propose an alternative method that considers contact states as high-cost states that the robot should avoid but can traverse if necessary to complete a task. More specifically, we introduce Contact Admissible Transition-based Rapidly exploring Random Trees (CAT-RRT), a planner that uses a novel per-link cost heuristic to find a path by traversing high-cost obstacle regions. Through extensive testing, we find that state-of-the-art optimization planners tend to over-explore low-cost states, which leads to slow and inefficient convergence to contact regions. Conversely, CAT-RRT searches both low and high-cost regions simultaneously with an adaptive thresholding mechanism carried out at each robot link. This leads to paths with a balance between efficiency, path length, and contact cost. ",

In this paper, we study the problem of distributed multi-level optimization over a network, where agents can only communicate with their immediate neighbors. This setting is motivated by the need for distributed optimization in large-scale systems, where centralized optimization may not be practical or feasible. To address this problem, we propose a novel gossip-based distributed multi-level optimization algorithm that enables networked agents to solve optimization problems at different levels in a single timescale and share information through network propagation. Our algorithm achieves optimal sample complexity, scaling linearly with the network size, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various applications, including hyper-parameter tuning, decentralized reinforcement learning, and risk-averse optimization.

    "abstract": "Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), enjoying extreme energy efficiency, have drawn much research attention on 2D visual recognition and shown gradually increasing application potential. However, it still remains underexplored whether SNNs can be generalized to 3D recognition. To this end, we present Spiking PointNet in the paper, the first spiking neural model for efficient deep learning on point clouds. We discover that the two huge obstacles limiting the application of SNNs in point clouds are: the intrinsic optimization obstacle of SNNs that impedes the training of a big spiking model with large time steps, and the expensive memory and computation cost of PointNet that makes training a big spiking point model unrealistic. To solve the problems simultaneously, we present a trained-less but learning-more paradigm for Spiking PointNet with theoretical justifications and in-depth experimental analysis. In specific, our Spiking PointNet is trained with only a single time step but can obtain better performance with multiple time steps inference, compared to the one trained directly with multiple time steps. We conduct various experiments on ModelNet10, ModelNet40 to demonstrate the effectiveness of Spiking PointNet. Notably, our Spiking PointNet even can outperform its ANN counterpart, which is rare in the SNN field thus providing a potential research direction for the following work. Moreover, Spiking PointNet shows impressive speedup and storage saving in the training phase. ",

We present a self-discriminative modeling framework for anomalous graph detection. The key idea, mathematically and numerically illustrated, is to learn a discriminator (classifier) from the given normal graphs together with pseudo-anomalous graphs generated by a model jointly trained, where we never use any true anomalous graphs and we hope that the generated pseudo-anomalous graphs interpolate between normal ones and (real) anomalous ones. Under the framework, we provide three algorithms with different computational efficiencies and stabilities for anomalous graph detection. The three algorithms are compared with several state-of-the-art graph-level anomaly detection baselines on nine popular graph datasets (four with small size and five with moderate size) and show significant improvement in terms of AUC. The success of our algorithms stems from the integration of the discriminative classifier and the well-posed pseudo-anomalous graphs, which provide new insights for anomaly detection. Moreover, we investigate our algorithms for large-scale imbalanced graph datasets. Surprisingly, our algorithms, though fully unsupervised, are able to significantly outperform supervised learning algorithms of anomalous graph detection. The corresponding reason is also analyzed.

Although recent NeRF-based photo-realistic 3D head avatar methods achieve high-quality avatar rendering, they still encounter challenges retaining intricate facial expression details because they overlook the potential of specific expression variations at different spatial positions when conditioning the radiance field. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a novel Spatially-Varying Expression (SVE) conditioning. The SVE can be obtained by a simple MLP-based generation network, encompassing both spatial positional features and global expression information. Benefiting from rich and diverse information of the SVE at different positions, the proposed SVE-conditioned neural radiance field can deal with intricate facial expressions and achieve realistic rendering and geometry details of high-fidelity 3D head avatars. Additionally, to further elevate the geometric and rendering quality, we introduce a new coarse-to-fine training strategy, including a geometry initialization strategy at the coarse stage and an adaptive importance sampling strategy at the fine stage. Extensive experiments indicate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in rendering and geometry quality on mobile phone-collected and public datasets. ",

Improving the speed of ND has always been the goal of ND algorithms. The classical ND algorithms lose packets due to the collision of multiple packets, which greatly affects the speed of the ND algorithms. Traditional methods detect packet collision and implement retransmission when encountering packet loss. However, they does not solve the packet collision problem and the performance improvement of ND algorithms is limited. In this paper, the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technology is introduced into the ND algorithms to unpack multiple collision packets by distinguishing multiple packets in the power domain. Besides, the multi-packet reception (MPR) is further applied to reduce the probability of packet collision by distinguishing multiple received packets, thus further improving the speed of ND algorithms. Six ND algorithms, namely completely random algorithm (CRA), CRA based on SIC (CRA-SIC), CRA based on SIC and MPR (CRA-SIC-MPR), scan-based algorithm (SBA), SBA based on SIC (SBA-SIC), and SBA based on SIC and MPR (SBA-SIC-MPR), are theoretically analyzed and verified by simulation. The simulation results show that SIC and MPR reduce the ND time of SBA by 69.02% and CRA by 66.03% averagely. ",

    "abstract": "We report our experience of using failure symptoms, such as error messages or stack traces, to identify flaky test failures in a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for a large industrial software system, SAP HANA. Although failure symptoms are commonly used to identify similar failures, they have not previously been employed to detect flaky test failures. Our hypothesis is that flaky failures will exhibit symptoms distinct from those of non-flaky failures. Consequently, we can identify recurring flaky failures, without rerunning the tests, by matching the failure symptoms to those of historical flaky runs. This can significantly reduce the need for test reruns, ultimately resulting in faster delivery of test results to developers. To facilitate the process of matching flaky failures across different execution instances, we abstract newer test failure symptoms before matching them to the known patterns of flaky failures, inspired by previous research in the fields of failure deduplication and log analysis. We evaluate our symptom-based flakiness detection method using actual failure symptoms gathered from CI data of SAP HANA during a six-month period. Our method shows the potential of using failure symptoms to identify recurring flaky failures, achieving a precision of at least 96%, while saving approximately 58% of the machine time compared to the traditional rerun strategy. Analysis of the false positives and the feedback from developers underscore the importance of having descriptive and informative failure symptoms for both the effective deployment of this symptom-based approach and the debugging of flaky tests.

While contemporary techniques can handle nonlinear relationships between variables and flexible noise distributions, they rely on the simplifying assumption that data originates from the same underlying causal model. In this work, we relax this assumption and perform causal discovery from time series data originating from mixtures of different causal models. We infer both the underlying structural causal models and the posterior probability for each sample belonging to a specific mixture component. Our approach employs an end-to-end training process that maximizes an evidence-lower bound for data likelihood. Through extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks in causal discovery tasks, particularly when the data emanates from diverse underlying causal graphs.

While most of PICNNs in existing literatures worked on parameter-to-state mapping, our proposed network parameterizes the solution with time-varying controls to establish a control-to-state regression. Firstly, finite volume scheme is adopted to discretize flow equations and formulate loss function that respects mass conservation laws. Neumann boundary conditions are seamlessly incorporated into the semi-discretized equations so no additional loss term is needed. The network architecture comprises two parallel U-Net structures, with network inputs being well controls and outputs being the system states. To capture the time-dependent relationship between inputs and outputs, the network is well designed to mimic discretized state space equations. We train the network progressively for every timestep, enabling it to simultaneously predict oil pressure and water saturation at each timestep. After training the network for one timestep, we leverage transfer learning techniques to expedite the training process for subsequent timestep. The proposed model is used to simulate oil-water porous flow scenarios with varying reservoir gridblocks and aspects including computation efficiency and accuracy are compared against corresponding numerical approaches. The results underscore the potential of PICNN in effectively simulating systems with numerous grid blocks, as computation time does not scale with model dimensionality. We assess the temporal error using 10 different testing controls with variation in magnitude and another 10 with higher alternation frequency with proposed control-to-state architecture. Our observations suggest the need for a more robust and reliable model when dealing with controls that exhibit significant variations in magnitude or frequency. ",

    "title": "Filter Pruning For CNN With Enhanced Linear Representation Redundancy",
    "abstract": "Structured network pruning excels non-structured methods because they can take advantage of the thriving developed parallel computing techniques. In this paper, we propose a new structured pruning method. Firstly, to create more structured redundancy, we present a data-driven loss function term calculated from the correlation coefficient matrix of different feature maps in the same layer, named CCM-loss. This loss term can encourage the neural network to learn stronger linear representation relations between feature maps during the training from the scratch so that more homogenous parts can be removed later in pruning. CCM-loss provides us with another universal transcendental mathematical tool besides L*-norm regularization, which concentrates on generating zeros, to generate more redundancy but for the different genres. Furthermore, we design a matching channel selection strategy based on principal components analysis to exploit the maximum potential ability of CCM-loss. In our new strategy, we mainly focus on the consistency and integrality of the information flow in the network. Instead of empirically hard-code the retain ratio for each layer, our channel selection strategy can dynamically adjust each layer's retain ratio according to the specific circumstance of a per-trained model to push the prune ratio to the limit. Notably, on the Cifar-10 dataset, our method brings 93.64% accuracy for pruned VGG-16 with only 1.40M parameters and 49.60M FLOPs, the pruned ratios for parameters and FLOPs are 90.6% and 84.2%, respectively. For ResNet-50 trained on the ImageNet dataset, our approach achieves 42.8% and 47.3% storage and computation reductions, respectively, with an accuracy of 76.23%.

The YOLOv5 detection model expands the feature extraction network from three dimensions, which enhances feature propagation of fire small targets identification, improves network performance, and reduces model parameters. Furthermore, through the promotion of the feature pyramid, the top-performing prediction box is obtained. Fire-YOLOv5 attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art object detection networks, notably in the detection of small targets of fire and smoke with mAP 90.5% and f1 score 88%. Overall, the Fire-YOLOv5 detection model can effectively deal with the inspection of small fire targets, as well as fire-like and smoke-like objects with F1 score 0.88. When the input image size is 416 x 416 resolution, the average detection time is 0.12 s per frame, which can provide real-time forest fire detection. Moreover, the algorithm proposed in this paper can also be applied to small target detection under other complicated situations. The proposed system shows an improved approach in all fire detection metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision. ",

    "abstract": "Watermark algorithms for large language models (LLMs) have achieved extremely high accuracy in detecting text generated by LLMs. Such algorithms typically involve adding extra watermark logits to the LLM's logits at each generation step. However, prior algorithms face a trade-off between attack robustness and security robustness. This is because the watermark logits for a token are determined by a certain number of preceding tokens; a small number leads to low security robustness, while a large number results in insufficient attack robustness. In this work, we propose a semantic invariant watermarking method for LLMs that provides both attack robustness and security robustness. The watermark logits in our work are determined by the semantics of all preceding tokens. Specifically, we utilize another embedding LLM to generate semantic embeddings for all preceding tokens, and then these semantic embeddings are transformed into the watermark logits through our trained watermark model. Subsequent analyses and experiments demonstrated the attack robustness of our method in semantically invariant settings: synonym substitution and text paraphrasing settings. Finally, we also show that our watermark possesses adequate security robustness. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THU-BPM/Robust_Watermark. ",

However, we show that conventional approaches often fail to ensure sufficient intra-class compactness and exhibit angular disparity between samples and their corresponding centers. In this paper, we propose a training technique aimed at ensuring intra-class compactness and increasing the angle gap between normal and abnormal samples.

Directly incorporating the above information (e.g., concatenation or attention) can lead to an unaligned information space. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MMEA transformer, called MoAlign, that hierarchically introduces neighbor features, multi-modal attributes, and entity types to enhance the alignment task. Taking advantage of the transformer's ability to better integrate multiple information, we design a hierarchical modifiable self-attention block in a transformer encoder to preserve the unique semantics of different information. Furthermore, we design two entity-type prefix injection methods to integrate entity-type information using type prefixes, which help to restrict the global information of entities not present in the MMKGs. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong competitors and achieves excellent entity alignment performance. ",

The whole study proposes a combination of spiked and normal convolution layers as an energy-efficient and reliable object detector model. The proposed model is split into two sections.

We drew a pre-trained model for classifying detected objects. With state of the art Python libraries, spike layers can be trained efficiently. The proposed spike convolutional object detector (SCOD) has been evaluated on VOC and Ex-Dark datasets. SCOD reached 66.01% and 41.25% mAP for detecting 20 different objects in the VOC-12 and 12 objects in the Ex-Dark dataset. SCOD uses 14 Giga FLOPS for its forward path calculations.

Such backdoors remain silent during inference on clean inputs, evading detection due to inconspicuous behavior. However, once a specific trigger pattern appears in the input data, the backdoor activates, causing the model to execute its concealed function. Detecting such poisoned samples within vast datasets is virtually impossible through manual inspection. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that enables model training on potentially poisoned datasets by utilizing the power of recent diffusion models. Specifically, we create synthetic variations of all training samples, leveraging the inherent resilience of diffusion models to potential trigger patterns in the data. By combining this generative approach with knowledge distillation, we produce student models that maintain their general performance on the task while exhibiting robust resistance to backdoor triggers.

    "abstract": "With the growing success of multi-modal learning, research on the robustness of multi-modal models, especially when facing situations with missing modalities, is receiving increased attention. Nevertheless, previous studies in this domain exhibit certain limitations, as they often lack theoretical insights or their methodologies are tied to specific network architectures or modalities. We model the scenarios of multi-modal models encountering missing modalities from an information-theoretic perspective and illustrate that the performance ceiling in such scenarios can be approached by efficiently utilizing the information inherent in non-missing modalities. In practice, there are two key aspects: (1) The encoder should be able to extract sufficiently good features from the non-missing modality; (2) The extracted features should be robust enough not to be influenced by noise during the fusion process across modalities. To this end, we introduce Uni-Modal Ensemble with Missing Modality Adaptation (UME-MMA). UME-MMA employs uni-modal pre-trained weights for the multi-modal model to enhance feature extraction and utilizes missing modality data augmentation techniques to better adapt to situations with missing modalities. Apart from that, UME-MMA, built on a late-fusion learning framework, allows for the plug-and-play use of various encoders, making it suitable for a wide range of modalities and enabling seamless integration of large-scale pre-trained encoders to further enhance performance. And we demonstrate UME-MMA's effectiveness in audio-visual datasets~(e.g., AV-MNIST, Kinetics-Sound, AVE) and vision-language datasets~(e.g., MM-IMDB, UPMC Food101). ",

The 3DS-SLAM is a tightly-coupled algorithm resolving both semantic and geometric constraints sequentially. We designed a 3D part-aware hybrid transformer for point cloud-based object detection to identify dynamic objects. Subsequently, we propose a dynamic feature filter based on HDBSCAN clustering to extract objects with significant absolute depth differences.

The CP methods can improve the posi-tioning availability and accuracy by inter-vehicle ranging and data exchange between vehicles. However, the inter-vehicle rang-ing can be easily interrupted due to many factors such as obsta-cles in-between two cars. Without inter-vehicle ranging, the other cooperative data such as vehicle positions will be wasted, leading to performance degradation of range-based CP methods. To fully utilize the cooperative data and mitigate the impact of inter-vehicle ranging loss, a novel cooperative positioning method aided by plane constraints is proposed in this paper. The positioning results received from cooperative vehicles are used to construct the road plane for each vehicle. The plane parameters are then introduced into CP scheme to impose constraints on positioning solutions. The state-of-art factor graph optimization (FGO) algo-rithm is employed to integrate the plane constraints with raw data of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) as well as inter-vehicle ranging measurements. The proposed CP method has the ability to resist the interruptions of inter-vehicle ranging since the plane constraints are computed by just using position-related data. A vehicle can still benefit from the position data of cooperative vehicles even if the inter-vehicle ranging is unavaila-ble.

One key open questions in graph learning is the generalization capabilities of GNNs. A major limitation of current approaches hinges on the assumption that the graph topologies in the training and test sets come from the same distribution. In this paper, we make steps towards understanding the generalization of GNNs by exploring how graph diffusion equations extrapolate and generalize in the presence of varying graph topologies. We first show deficiencies in the generalization capability of existing models built upon local diffusion on graphs, stemming from the exponential sensitivity to topology variation. Our subsequent analysis reveals the promise of non-local diffusion, which advocates for feature propagation over fully-connected latent graphs, under the assumption of a specific data-generating condition. In addition to these findings, we propose a novel graph encoder backbone, Advective Diffusion Transformer (ADiT), inspired by advective graph diffusion equations that have a closed-form solution backed up with theoretical guarantees of desired generalization under topological distribution shifts.

In the realm of clinical screening and diagnosis, detecting abnormalities in medical images holds great importance. Typically, clinical practice provides access to a vast collection of normal images, while abnormal images are relatively scarce. We hypothesize that abnormal images and their associated features tend to manifest in low-density regions of the data distribution. Following this assumption, we turn to diffusion ODEs for unsupervised anomaly detection, given their tractability and superior performance in density estimation tasks. More precisely, we propose a new anomaly detection method based on diffusion ODEs by estimating the density of features extracted from multi-scale medical images. Our anomaly scoring mechanism depends on computing the negative log-likelihood of features extracted from medical images at different scales, quantified in bits per dimension. Furthermore, we propose a reconstruction-based anomaly localization suitable for our method. Our proposed method not only identifie anomalies but also provides interpretability at both the image and pixel levels.

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction is a statistical framework that generates prediction sets containing ground-truth labels with a desired coverage guarantee. The predicted probabilities produced by machine learning models are generally miscalibrated, leading to large prediction sets in conformal prediction. In this paper, we empirically and theoretically show that disregarding the probabilities' value will mitigate the undesirable effect of miscalibrated probability values. Then, we propose a novel algorithm named $\\textit{Sorted Adaptive prediction sets}$ (SAPS), which discards all the probability values except for the maximum softmax probability. The key idea behind SAPS is to minimize the dependence of the non-conformity score on the probability values while retaining the uncertainty information. In this manner, SAPS can produce sets of small size and communicate instance-wise uncertainty. Theoretically, we provide a finite-sample coverage guarantee of SAPS and show that the expected value of set size from SAPS is always smaller than APS. Extensive experiments validate that SAPS not only lessens the prediction sets but also broadly enhances the conditional coverage rate and adaptation of prediction sets. ",

    "abstract": "Historical behaviors have shown great effect and potential in various prediction tasks, including recommendation and information retrieval. The overall historical behaviors are various but noisy while search behaviors are always sparse. Most existing approaches in personalized search ranking adopt the sparse search behaviors to learn representation with bottleneck, which do not sufficiently exploit the crucial long-term interest. In fact, there is no doubt that user long-term interest is various but noisy for instant search, and how to exploit it well still remains an open problem. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose a novel model named Query-dominant user Interest Network (QIN), including two cascade units to filter the raw user behaviors and reweigh the behavior subsequences. Specifically, we propose a relevance search unit (RSU), which aims to search a subsequence relevant to the query first and then search the sub-subsequences relevant to the target item. These items are then fed into an attention unit called Fused Attention Unit (FAU). It should be able to calculate attention scores from the ID field and attribute field separately, and then adaptively fuse the item embedding and content embedding based on the user engagement of past period. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods. The QIN now has been successfully deployed on Kuaishou search, an online video search platform, and obtained 7.6% improvement on CTR. ",

To achieve this, the developers need to understand which subpopulations of the inputs get inaccurate predictions by the model. Therefore, we propose correction rule mining to acquire a comprehensive list of rules that describe inaccurate subpopulations and how to correct them. We also develop an efficient correction rule mining algorithm that is a combination of frequent itemset mining and a unique pruning technique for correction rules.

Addressing this, our study delves into the intersection of cultural features and transfer learning effectiveness. The findings reveal that cultural value surveys indeed possess a predictive power for cross-cultural transfer learning success in OLD tasks and that it can be further improved using offensive word distance.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for computer vision tasks. However, it has been shown that deep models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., their performances drop when imperceptible perturbations are made to the original inputs, which may further degrade the following visual tasks or introduce new problems such as data and privacy security. Hence, metrics for evaluating the robustness of deep models against adversarial attacks are desired. However, previous metrics are mainly proposed for evaluating the adversarial robustness of shallow networks on the small-scale datasets. Although the Cross Lipschitz Extreme Value for nEtwork Robustness (CLEVER) metric has been proposed for large-scale datasets (e.g., the ImageNet dataset), it is computationally expensive and its performance relies on a tractable number of samples. In this paper, we propose the Adversarial Converging Time Score (ACTS), an attack-dependent metric that quantifies the adversarial robustness of a DNN on a specific input. Our key observation is that local neighborhoods on a DNN's output surface would have different shapes given different inputs. Hence, given different inputs, it requires different time for converging to an adversarial sample. Based on this geometry meaning, ACTS measures the converging time as an adversarial robustness metric. We validate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed ACTS metric against different adversarial attacks on the large-scale ImageNet dataset using state-of-the-art deep networks. Extensive experiments show that our ACTS metric is an efficient and effective adversarial metric over the previous CLEVER metric. ",

To address these issues, we propose FoLR, a transformer-like architecture with only decoders. We enhance the self-attention mechanism by isolating connections between irrelevant objects that makes it focus on local regions but not global regions. We also design the adaptive sampling method to extract effective features based on queries' local regions from feature maps.

In response, we introduce a Proximity-aware based region representation for Sequential Recommendation (PASR for short), built upon the Self-Attention Network architecture. We tackle the sparsity issue through a novel loss function employing importance sampling, which emphasizes informative negative samples during optimization. Moreover, PASR enhances the integration of geographic information by employing a self-attention-based geography encoder to the hierarchical grid and proximity grid at each GPS point. To further leverage geographic information, we utilize the proximity-aware negative samplers to enhance the quality of negative samples.

However, traditional identification methods often involve invasive physical tags and can prove both disruptive for animals and time-intensive for researchers. In recent years, the integration of deep learning in research offered new methodological perspectives through automatization of complex tasks. Harnessing object detection and recognition technologies is increasingly used by researchers to achieve identification on video footage. This study represents a preliminary exploration into the development of a non-invasive tool for face detection and individual identification of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) through deep learning. The ultimate goal of this research is, using identifications done on the dataset, to automatically generate a social network representation of the studied population. The current main results are promising: (i) the creation of a Japanese macaques' face detector (Faster-RCNN model), reaching a 82.2% accuracy and (ii) the creation of an individual recognizer for K{\\=o}jima island macaques population (YOLOv8n model), reaching a 83% accuracy. We also created a K{\\=o}jima population social network by traditional methods, based on co-occurrences on videos. Thus, we provide a benchmark against which the automatically generated network will be assessed for reliability. These preliminary results are a testament to the potential of this innovative approach to provide the scientific community with a tool for tracking individuals and social network studies in Japanese macaques.

To facilitate future studies and assess different methods, we construct a hallucination detection benchmark, which is generated by ChatGPT and annotated by human annotators.

We empirically evaluate our method and existing zero-resource detection methods on different domains of benchmark to explore the implicit relation between hallucination and training data. Furthermore, we manually analyze some hallucination cases that LLM failed to capture, revealing the shared limitation of zero-resource methods. ",

To address these challenges, we propose a unified robustness evaluation framework based on the slot-filling task to systematically evaluate the dialogue understanding capability of LLMs in diverse input perturbation scenarios. Specifically, we construct a input perturbation evaluation dataset, Noise-LLM, which contains five types of single perturbation and four types of mixed perturbation data. Furthermore, we utilize a multi-level data augmentation method (character, word, and sentence levels) to construct a candidate data pool, and carefully design two ways of automatic task demonstration construction strategies (instance-level and entity-level) with various prompt templates. Our aim is to assess how well various robustness methods of LLMs perform in real-world noisy scenarios. The experiments have demonstrated that the current open-source LLMs generally achieve limited perturbation robustness performance. Based on these experimental observations, we make some forward-looking suggestions to fuel the research in this direction. ",

    "abstract": "Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has been successfully used for various tasks in signal/image processing, from visualization to supervised/unsupervised classification. Often, topological characteristics are obtained from persistent homology theory. The standard TDA pipeline starts from the raw signal data or a representation of it. Then, it consists in building a multiscale topological structure on the top of the data using a pre-specified filtration, and finally to compute the topological signature to be further exploited. The commonly used topological signature is a persistent diagram (or transformations of it). Current research discusses the consequences of the many ways to exploit topological signatures, much less often the choice of the filtration, but to the best of our knowledge, the choice of the representation of a signal has not been the subject of any study yet. This paper attempts to provide some answers on the latter problem. To this end, we collected real audio data and built a comparative study to assess the quality of the discriminant information of the topological signatures extracted from three different representation spaces. Each audio signal is represented as i) an embedding of observed data in a higher dimensional space using Taken's representation, ii) a spectrogram viewed as a surface in a 3D ambient space, iii) the set of spectrogram's zeroes. From vowel audio recordings, we use topological signature for three prediction problems: speaker gender, vowel type, and individual. We show that topologically-augmented random forest improves the Out-of-Bag Error (OOB) over solely based Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for the last two problems. Our results also suggest that the topological information extracted from different signal representations is complementary, and that spectrogram's zeros offers the best improvement for gender prediction.

However, they are not designed to produce a distilled dataset that can be effectively used for facilitating self-supervised pre-training. To this end, we propose a novel problem of distilling an unlabeled dataset into a set of small synthetic samples for efficient self-supervised learning (SSL). We first prove that a gradient of synthetic samples with respect to a SSL objective in naive bilevel optimization is \\textit{biased} due to the randomness originating from data augmentations or masking. To address this issue, we propose to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between a model's representations of the synthetic examples and their corresponding learnable target feature representations for the inner objective, which does not introduce any randomness. Our primary motivation is that the model obtained by the proposed inner optimization can mimic the \\textit{self-supervised target model}. To achieve this, we also introduce the MSE between representations of the inner model and the self-supervised target model on the original full dataset for outer optimization. Lastly, assuming that a feature extractor is fixed, we only optimize a linear head on top of the feature extractor, which allows us to reduce the computational cost and obtain a closed-form solution of the head with kernel ridge regression. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our method on various applications involving transfer learning. ",

    "abstract": "A C decompiler converts an executable into source code. The recovered C source code, once re-compiled, is expected to produce an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. With over twenty years of development, C decompilers have been widely used in production to support reverse engineering applications. Despite the prosperous development of C decompilers, it is widely acknowledged that decompiler outputs are mainly used for human consumption, and are not suitable for automatic recompilation. Often, a substantial amount of manual effort is required to fix the decompiler outputs before they can be recompiled and executed properly. This paper is motived by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in comprehending dense corpus of natural language. To alleviate the tedious, costly and often error-prone manual effort in fixing decompiler outputs, we investigate the feasibility of using LLMs to augment decompiler outputs, thus delivering recompilable decompilation. Note that different from previous efforts that focus on augmenting decompiler outputs with higher readability (e.g., recovering type/variable names), we focus on augmenting decompiler outputs with recompilability, meaning to generate code that can be recompiled into an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. We conduct a pilot study to characterize the obstacles in recompiling the outputs of the de facto commercial C decompiler -- IDA-Pro. We then propose a two-step, hybrid approach to augmenting decompiler outputs with LLMs. We evaluate our approach on a set of popular C test cases, and show that our approach can deliver a high recompilation success rate to over 75% with moderate effort, whereas none of the IDA-Pro's original outputs can be recompiled. We conclude with a discussion on the limitations of our approach and promising future research directions. ",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a surge in research on machine learning for combinatorial optimization since learning-based approaches can outperform traditional heuristics and approximate exact solvers at a lower computation cost. However, most existing work on supervised neural combinatorial optimization focuses on TSP instances with a fixed number of cities and requires large amounts of training samples to achieve a good performance, making them less practical to be applied to realistic optimization scenarios. This work aims to develop a data-driven graph representation learning method for solving travelling salesman problems (TSPs) with various numbers of cities. To this end, we propose an edge-aware graph autoencoder (EdgeGAE) model that can learn to solve TSPs after being trained on solution data of various sizes with an imbalanced distribution. We formulate the TSP as a link prediction task on sparse connected graphs. A residual gated encoder is trained to learn latent edge embeddings, followed by an edge-centered decoder to output link predictions in an end-to-end manner. To improve the model's generalization capability of solving large-scale problems, we introduce an active sampling strategy into the training process. In addition, we generate a benchmark dataset containing 50,000 TSP instances with a size from 50 to 500 cities, following an extremely scale-imbalanced distribution, making it ideal for investigating the model's performance for practical applications. We conduct experiments using different amounts of training data with various scales, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data-driven approach achieves a highly competitive performance among state-of-the-art learning-based methods for solving TSPs.

    "abstract": "Label smoothing -- using softened labels instead of hard ones -- is a widely adopted regularization method for deep learning, showing diverse benefits such as enhanced generalization and calibration. Its implications for preserving model privacy, however, have remained unexplored. To fill this gap, we investigate the impact of label smoothing on model inversion attacks (MIAs), which aim to generate class-representative samples by exploiting the knowledge encoded in a classifier, thereby inferring sensitive information about its training data. Through extensive analyses, we uncover that traditional label smoothing fosters MIAs, thereby increasing a model's privacy leakage. Even more, we reveal that smoothing with negative factors counters this trend, impeding the extraction of class-related information and leading to privacy preservation, beating state-of-the-art defenses. This establishes a practical and powerful novel way for enhancing model resilience against MIAs. ",

    "abstract": "For brain tumour segmentation, deep learning models can achieve human expert-level performance given a large amount of data and pixel-level annotations. However, the expensive exercise of obtaining pixel-level annotations for large amounts of data is not always feasible, and performance is often heavily reduced in a low-annotated data regime. To tackle this challenge, we adapt a mixed supervision framework, vMFNet, to learn robust compositional representations using unsupervised learning and weak supervision alongside non-exhaustive pixel-level pathology labels. In particular, we use the BraTS dataset to simulate a collection of 2-point expert pathology annotations indicating the top and bottom slice of the tumour (or tumour sub-regions: peritumoural edema, GD-enhancing tumour, and the necrotic / non-enhancing tumour) in each MRI volume, from which weak image-level labels that indicate the presence or absence of the tumour (or the tumour sub-regions) in the image are constructed. Then, vMFNet models the encoded image features with von-Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions, via learnable and compositional vMF kernels which capture information about structures in the images. We show that good tumour segmentation performance can be achieved with a large amount of weakly labelled data but only a small amount of fully-annotated data. Interestingly, emergent learning of anatomical structures occurs in the compositional representation even given only supervision relating to pathology (tumour). ",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D human shapes from 2D images has received increasing attention recently due to its fundamental support for many high-level 3D applications. Compared with natural images, freehand sketches are much more flexible to depict various shapes, providing a high potential and valuable way for 3D human reconstruction. However, such a task is highly challenging. The sparse abstract characteristics of sketches add severe difficulties, such as arbitrariness, inaccuracy, and lacking image details, to the already badly ill-posed problem of 2D-to-3D reconstruction. Although current methods have achieved great success in reconstructing 3D human bodies from a single-view image, they do not work well on freehand sketches. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch-driven multi-faceted decoder network termed SketchBodyNet to address this task. Specifically, the network consists of a backbone and three separate attention decoder branches, where a multi-head self-attention module is exploited in each decoder to obtain enhanced features, followed by a multi-layer perceptron. The multi-faceted decoders aim to predict the camera, shape, and pose parameters, respectively, which are then associated with the SMPL model to reconstruct the corresponding 3D human mesh. In learning, existing 3D meshes are projected via the camera parameters into 2D synthetic sketches with joints, which are combined with the freehand sketches to optimize the model. To verify our method, we collect a large-scale dataset of about 26k freehand sketches and their corresponding 3D meshes containing various poses of human bodies from 14 different angles. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our SketchBodyNet achieves superior performance in reconstructing 3D human meshes from freehand sketches. ",

Here, we carry out experiments to examine human visual search behaviors and establish the first SNN-based visual search model. The model combines an artificial retina with spiking feature extraction, memory, and saccade decision modules, and it employs population coding for fast and efficient saccade decisions. The model can learn either a human-like or a near-optimal fixation strategy, outperform humans in search speed and accuracy, and achieve high energy efficiency through short saccade decision latency and sparse activation. It also suggests that the human search strategy is suboptimal in terms of search speed. Our work connects modeling of vision in neuroscience and machine learning and sheds light on developing more energy-efficient computer vision algorithms. ",

Data map (DM) is a simple yet effective dual-model approach that enhances the robustness of fine-tuned PLMs, which involves fine-tuning a model on the original training set (i.e. reference model), selecting a specified fraction of important training examples according to the training dynamics of the reference model, and fine-tuning the same model on these selected examples (i.e. main model). However, it suffers from the drawback of requiring fine-tuning the same model twice, which is computationally expensive for large models. In this paper, we first show that 1) training dynamics are highly transferable across different model sizes and different pre-training methods, and that 2) main models fine-tuned using DM learn faster than when using conventional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Building on these observations, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach based on the DM method: Fine-Tuning by transFerring Training dynamics (FTFT). Compared with DM, FTFT uses more efficient reference models and then fine-tunes more capable main models for fewer steps. Our experiments show that FTFT achieves better generalization robustness than ERM while spending less than half of the training cost. ",

Compared with single-vehicle perception, multi-view vehicle-road cooperation perception has fundamental advantages, such as the elimination of blind spots and a broader range of perception, and has become a research hotspot. However, the current perception of cooperation focuses on improving the complexity of fusion while ignoring the fundamental problems caused by the absence of single-view outlines. We propose a multi-view vehicle-road cooperation perception system, vehicle-to-everything cooperative perception (V2X-AHD), in order to enhance the identification capability, particularly for predicting the vehicle's shape. At first, we propose an asymmetric heterogeneous distillation network fed with different training data to improve the accuracy of contour recognition, with multi-view teacher features transferring to single-view student features. While the point cloud data are sparse, we propose Spara Pillar, a spare convolutional-based plug-in feature extraction backbone, to reduce the number of parameters and improve and enhance feature extraction capabilities. Moreover, we leverage the multi-head self-attention (MSA) to fuse the single-view feature, and the lightweight design makes the fusion feature a smooth expression. The results of applying our algorithm to the massive open dataset V2Xset demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art result. The V2X-AHD can effectively improve the accuracy of 3D object detection and reduce the number of network parameters, according to this study, which serves as a benchmark for cooperative perception.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is a complicated problem due to the idiosyncrasies of possible distribution shifts between training and test domains. Most benchmarks employ diverse datasets to address this issue; however, the degree of the distribution shift between the training domains and the test domains of each dataset remains largely fixed. This may lead to biased conclusions that either underestimate or overestimate the actual OOD performance of a model. Our study delves into a more nuanced evaluation setting that covers a broad range of shift degrees. We show that the robustness of models can be quite brittle and inconsistent under different degrees of distribution shifts, and therefore one should be more cautious when drawing conclusions from evaluations under a limited range of degrees. In addition, we observe that large-scale pre-trained models, such as CLIP, are sensitive to even minute distribution shifts of novel downstream tasks. This indicates that while pre-trained representations may help improve downstream in-distribution performance, they could have minimal or even adverse effects on generalization in certain OOD scenarios of the downstream task if not used properly. In light of these findings, we encourage future research to conduct evaluations across a broader range of shift degrees whenever possible. ",

    "abstract": "Neural shape representation generally refers to representing 3D geometry using neural networks, e.g., to compute a signed distance or occupancy value at a specific spatial position. Previous methods tend to rely on the auto-decoder paradigm, which often requires densely-sampled and accurate signed distances to be known during training and testing, as well as an additional optimization loop during inference. This introduces a lot of computational overhead, in addition to having to compute signed distances analytically, even during testing. In this paper, we present a novel encoder-decoder neural network for embedding 3D shapes in a single forward pass. Our architecture is based on a multi-scale hybrid system incorporating graph-based and voxel-based components, as well as a continuously differentiable decoder. Furthermore, the network is trained to solve the Eikonal equation and only requires knowledge of the zero-level set for training and inference. Additional volumetric samples can be generated on-the-fly, and incorporated in an unsupervised manner. This means that in contrast to most previous work, our network is able to output valid signed distance fields without explicit prior knowledge of non-zero distance values or shape occupancy. In other words, our network computes approximate solutions to the boundary-valued Eikonal equation. It also requires only a single forward pass during inference, instead of the common latent code optimization. We further propose a modification of the loss function in case that surface normals are not well defined, e.g., in the context of non-watertight surface-meshes and non-manifold geometry. We finally demonstrate the efficacy, generalizability and scalability of our method on datasets consisting of deforming 3D shapes, single class encoding and multiclass encoding, showcasing a wide range of possible applications.

In this paper, we discuss how to incorporate the helpful KG structural information into the LLMs, aiming to achieve structrual-aware reasoning in the LLMs. We first transfer the existing LLM paradigms to structural-aware settings and further propose a knowledge prefix adapter (KoPA) to fulfill this stated goal. KoPA employs structural embedding pre-training to capture the structural information of entities and relations in the KG. Then KoPA informs the LLMs of the knowledge prefix adapter which projects the structural embeddings into the textual space and obtains virtual knowledge tokens as a prefix of the input prompt. We conduct comprehensive experiments on these structural-aware LLM-based KGC methods and provide an in-depth analysis comparing how the introduction of structural information would be better for LLM's knowledge reasoning ability.

This has been a particular concern in the era of large language models (LLMs)- based code generation, where LLMs, deemed a complex and powerful black-box model, is instructed by a high-level natural language specification, namely a prompt, to generate code. Nevertheless, effectively evaluating and explaining the code generation capability of LLMs is inherently challenging, given the complexity of LLMs and the lack of transparency. Inspired by the recent progress in causality analysis and its application in software engineering, this paper launches a causality analysis-based approach to systematically analyze the causal relations between the LLM input prompts and the generated code. To handle various technical challenges in this study, we first propose a novel causal graph-based representation of the prompt and the generated code, which is established over the fine-grained, human-understandable concepts in the input prompts. The formed causal graph is then used to identify the causal relations between the prompt and the derived code. We illustrate the insights that our framework can provide by studying over 3 popular LLMs with over 12 prompt adjustment strategies. The results of these studies illustrate the potential of our technique to provide insights into LLM effectiveness, and aid end-users in understanding predictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach provides actionable insights to improve the quality of the LLM-generated code by properly calibrating the prompt. ",

    "abstract": "In real-world scenarios, texts in a network are often linked by multiple semantic relations (e.g., papers in an academic network are referenced by other publications, written by the same author, or published in the same venue), where text documents and their relations form a multiplex text-rich network. Mainstream text representation learning methods use pretrained language models (PLMs) to generate one embedding for each text unit, expecting that all types of relations between texts can be captured by these single-view embeddings. However, this presumption does not hold particularly in multiplex text-rich networks. Along another line of work, multiplex graph neural networks (GNNs) directly initialize node attributes as a feature vector for node representation learning, but they cannot fully capture the semantics of the nodes' associated texts. To bridge these gaps, we propose METERN, a new framework for learning Multiplex Embeddings on TExt-Rich Networks. In contrast to existing methods, METERN uses one text encoder to model the shared knowledge across relations and leverages a small number of parameters per relation to derive relation-specific representations. This allows the encoder to effectively capture the multiplex structures in the network while also preserving parameter efficiency. We conduct experiments on nine downstream tasks in five networks from both academic and e-commerce domains, where METERN outperforms baselines significantly and consistently.

It generally consists in grouping similar reports through clustering techniques. However, with real-time streaming bug collection, systems are needed to quickly answer the question: What are the most similar bugs to a new one?, that is, efficiently find near-duplicates. It is thus natural to consider nearest neighbors search to tackle this problem and especially the well-known locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to deal with large datasets due to its sublinear performance and theoretical guarantees on the similarity search accuracy. Surprisingly, LSH has not been considered in the crash bucketing literature. It is indeed not trivial to derive hash functions that satisfy the so-called locality-sensitive property for the most advanced crash bucketing metrics. Consequently, we study in this paper how to leverage LSH for this task. To be able to consider the most relevant metrics used in the literature, we introduce DeepLSH, a Siamese DNN architecture with an original loss function, that perfectly approximates the locality-sensitivity property even for Jaccard and Cosine metrics for which exact LSH solutions exist. We support this claim with a series of experiments on an original dataset, which we make available. ",

    "abstract": "Although existing machine learning-based methods for traffic accident analysis can provide good quality results to downstream tasks, they lack interpretability which is crucial for this critical problem. This paper proposes an interpretable framework based on Bayesian Networks for traffic accident prediction. To enable the ease of interpretability, we design a dataset construction pipeline to feed the traffic data into the framework while retaining the essential traffic data information. With a concrete case study, our framework can derive a Bayesian Network from a dataset based on the causal relationships between weather and traffic events across the United States. Consequently, our framework enables the prediction of traffic accidents with competitive accuracy while examining how the probability of these events changes under different conditions, thus illustrating transparent relationships between traffic and weather events. Additionally, the visualization of the network simplifies the analysis of relationships between different variables, revealing the primary causes of traffic accidents and ultimately providing a valuable reference for reducing traffic accidents.

    "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of viscous fluids described by the Navier-Stokes equations are considered. Depending on the Reynolds number of the flow, the Navier-Stokes equations may exhibit a highly nonlinear behavior. The system of nonlinear equations resulting from the discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations can be solved using nonlinear iteration methods, such as Newton's method. However, fast quadratic convergence is typically only obtained in a local neighborhood of the solution, and for many configurations, the classical Newton iteration does not converge at all. In such cases, so-called globalization techniques may help to improve convergence. In this paper, pseudo-transient continuation is employed in order to improve nonlinear convergence. The classical algorithm is enhanced by a neural network model that is trained to predict a local pseudo-time step. Generalization of the novel approach is facilitated by predicting the local pseudo-time step separately on each element using only local information on a patch of adjacent elements as input. Numerical results for standard benchmark problems, including flow through a backward facing step geometry and Couette flow, show the performance of the machine learning-enhanced globalization approach; as the software for the simulations, the CFD module of COMSOL Multiphysics is employed.

    "abstract": "Learning feature representations of geographical space is vital for any machine learning model that integrates geolocated data, spanning application domains such as remote sensing, ecology, or epidemiology. Recent work mostly embeds coordinates using sine and cosine projections based on Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) features -- these embeddings assume a rectangular data domain even on global data, which can lead to artifacts, especially at the poles. At the same time, relatively little attention has been paid to the exact design of the neural network architectures these functional embeddings are combined with. This work proposes a novel location encoder for globally distributed geographic data that combines spherical harmonic basis functions, natively defined on spherical surfaces, with sinusoidal representation networks (SirenNets) that can be interpreted as learned Double Fourier Sphere embedding. We systematically evaluate the cross-product of positional embeddings and neural network architectures across various classification and regression benchmarks and synthetic evaluation datasets. In contrast to previous approaches that require the combination of both positional encoding and neural networks to learn meaningful representations, we show that both spherical harmonics and sinusoidal representation networks are competitive on their own but set state-of-the-art performances across tasks when combined.

    "abstract": "Interpretability is a key concern in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using machine learning methods, especially for healthcare applications where high-stake decisions are often made. Inspired by the Predictive, Descriptive, Relevant framework of interpretability, we propose causal rule learning which finds a refined set of causal rules characterizing potential subgroups to estimate and enhance our understanding of heterogeneous treatment effects. Causal rule learning involves three phases: rule discovery, rule selection, and rule analysis. In the rule discovery phase, we utilize a causal forest to generate a pool of causal rules with corresponding subgroup average treatment effects. The selection phase then employs a D-learning method to select a subset of these rules to deconstruct individual-level treatment effects as a linear combination of the subgroup-level effects. This helps to answer an ignored question by previous literature: what if an individual simultaneously belongs to multiple groups with different average treatment effects? The rule analysis phase outlines a detailed procedure to further analyze each rule in the subset from multiple perspectives, revealing the most promising rules for further validation. The rules themselves, their corresponding subgroup treatment effects, and their weights in the linear combination give us more insights into heterogeneous treatment effects. Simulation and real-world data analysis demonstrate the superior performance of causal rule learning on the interpretable estimation of heterogeneous treatment effect when the ground truth is complex and the sample size is sufficient.

In this work, we provide a system-level performance assessment of RIS-assisted multi-input multi-output (MIMO) cellular networks in the downlink in terms of both the coverage probability and the ergodic rate. To accurately capture the random layouts of the spatial deployments of both Base Stations (BSs) and RISs, we propose a new stochastic geometry model for the RIS-assisted radio cellular system based on the Matern Cluster Process (MCP). This MCP model consists in adding randomly distributed RISs around BSs, whose placement is modeled as a Poisson Point Process (PPP). Two types of diversity are available in this model, namely, the multipath diversity provided by the multiple RISs and the antenna diversity provided by the multiple antenna receiver. The system employs the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique to modulate the former and employ the maximal ratio combining (MRC) technique at the receiver to exploit the latter. The coverage probability is then evaluated when considering RISs operating as batched powerless beamformers. Based on the analysis of the coverage probability, we further derive expressions for the ergodic rate. These analytical expressions provide a new methodology to evaluate the impact of randomly located RISs around the BSs, given the RIS-related parameters, such as the density, size, and cluster radius. Numerical evaluations of the analytical expressions and Monte-Carlo simulations jointly validate the proposed analytical approach and provide valuable insights into deploying RIS-assisted radio cellular networks.

    "abstract": "The behavior of neural networks still remains opaque, and a recently widely noted phenomenon is that networks often achieve similar performance when initialized with different random parameters. This phenomenon has attracted significant attention in measuring the similarity between features learned by distinct networks. However, feature similarity could be vague in describing the same feature since equivalent features hardly exist. In this paper, we expand the concept of equivalent feature and provide the definition of what we call functionally equivalent features. These features produce equivalent output under certain transformations. Using this definition, we aim to derive a more intrinsic metric for the so-called feature complexity regarding the redundancy of features learned by a neural network at each layer. We offer a formal interpretation of our approach through the lens of category theory, a well-developed area in mathematics. To quantify the feature complexity, we further propose an efficient algorithm named Iterative Feature Merging. Our experimental results validate our ideas and theories from various perspectives. We empirically demonstrate that the functionally equivalence widely exists among different features learned by the same neural network and we could reduce the number of parameters of the network without affecting the performance.The IFM shows great potential as a data-agnostic model prune method. We have also drawn several interesting empirical findings regarding the defined feature complexity. ",

Uni3D uses a 2D initialized ViT end-to-end pretrained to align the 3D point cloud features with the image-text aligned features. Via the simple architecture and pretext task, Uni3D can leverage abundant 2D pretrained models as initialization and image-text aligned models as the target, unlocking the great potential of 2D models and scaling-up strategies to the 3D world. We efficiently scale up Uni3D to one billion parameters, and set new records on a broad range of 3D tasks, such as zero-shot classification, few-shot classification, open-world understanding and part segmentation. We show that the strong Uni3D representation also enables applications such as 3D painting and retrieval in the wild. We believe that Uni3D provides a new direction for exploring both scaling up and efficiency of the representation in 3D domain. ",

    "abstract": "The paper introduces Supervised Embedding and Clustering Anomaly Detection (SEMC-AD), a method designed to efficiently identify faulty alarm logs in a mobile network and alleviate the challenges of manual monitoring caused by the growing volume of alarm logs. SEMC-AD employs a supervised embedding approach based on deep neural networks, utilizing historical alarm logs and their labels to extract numerical representations for each log, effectively addressing the issue of imbalanced classification due to a small proportion of anomalies in the dataset without employing one-hot encoding. The robustness of the embedding is evaluated by plotting the two most significant principle components of the embedded alarm logs, revealing that anomalies form distinct clusters with similar embeddings. Multivariate normal Gaussian clustering is then applied to these components, identifying clusters with a high ratio of anomalies to normal alarms (above 90%) and labeling them as the anomaly group. To classify new alarm logs, we check if their embedded vectors' two most significant principle components fall within the anomaly-labeled clusters. If so, the log is classified as an anomaly. Performance evaluation demonstrates that SEMC-AD outperforms conventional random forest and gradient boosting methods without embedding. SEMC-AD achieves 99% anomaly detection, whereas random forest and XGBoost only detect 86% and 81% of anomalies, respectively. While supervised classification methods may excel in labeled datasets, the results demonstrate that SEMC-AD is more efficient in classifying anomalies in datasets with numerous categorical features, significantly enhancing anomaly detection, reducing operator burden, and improving network maintenance.

Among these methods, the approach known as extended dynamic mode decomposition with dictionary learning (EDMD-DL) has garnered significant attention. Here we present a modification of EDMD-DL that concurrently determines both the dictionary of observables and the corresponding approximation of the Koopman operator. This innovation leverages automatic differentiation to facilitate gradient descent computations through the pseudoinverse. We also address the performance of several alternative methodologies. We assess a 'pure' Koopman approach, which involves the direct time-integration of a linear, high-dimensional system governing the dynamics within the space of observables. Additionally, we explore a modified approach where the system alternates between spaces of states and observables at each time step -- this approach no longer satisfies the linearity of the true Koopman operator representation. For further comparisons, we also apply a state space approach (neural ODEs). We consider systems encompassing two and three-dimensional ordinary differential equation systems featuring steady, oscillatory, and chaotic attractors, as well as partial differential equations exhibiting increasingly complex and intricate behaviors. Our framework significantly outperforms EDMD-DL. Furthermore, the state space approach offers superior performance compared to the 'pure' Koopman approach where the entire time evolution occurs in the space of observables. When the temporal evolution of the Koopman approach alternates between states and observables at each time step, however, its predictions become comparable to those of the state space approach. ",

In this work, we study the use of neural networks as bounding volumes.

This learning-based approach is particularly advantageous in high-dimensional spaces, such as animated scenes with complex queries, where neural networks are known to excel. However, unlocking neural bounding requires a twist: allowing -- but also limiting -- false positives, while ensuring that the number of false negatives is strictly zero. We enable such tight and conservative results using a dynamically-weighted asymmetric loss function. Our results show that our neural bounding produces up to an order of magnitude fewer false positives than traditional methods. ",

We construct an agent model in which linguistic descriptions of personality traits related to cooperative behavior are used as genes. The deterministic strategies extracted from Large Language Model (LLM) that make behavioral decisions based on these personality traits are used as behavioral traits. The population is evolved according to selection based on average payoff and mutation of genes by asking LLM to slightly modify the parent gene toward cooperative or selfish. Through preliminary experiments and analyses, we clarify that such a model can indeed exhibit the evolution of cooperative behavior based on the diverse and higher-order representation of personality traits. We also observed the repeated intrusion of cooperative and selfish personality traits through changes in the expression of personality traits, and found that the emerging words in the evolved gene well reflected the behavioral tendency of its personality in terms of their semantics.

    "abstract": "We introduce the Projected Push-Pull algorithm that enables multiple agents to solve a distributed constrained optimization problem with private cost functions and global constraints, in a collaborative manner. Our algorithm employs projected gradient descent to deal with constraints and a lazy update rule to control the trade-off between the consensus and optimization steps in the protocol. We prove that our algorithm achieves geometric convergence over time-varying directed graphs while ensuring that the decision variable always stays within the constraint set. We derive explicit bounds for step sizes that guarantee geometric convergence based on the strong-convexity and smoothness of cost functions, and graph properties. Moreover, we provide additional theoretical results on the usefulness of lazy updates, revealing the challenges in the analysis of any gradient tracking method that uses projection operators in a distributed constrained optimization setting. We validate our theoretical results with numerical studies over different graph types, showing that our algorithm achieves geometric convergence empirically. ",

    "title": "Adversarial Masked Image Inpainting for Robust Detection of Mpox and  Non-Mpox",
    "abstract": "Due to the lack of efficient mpox diagnostic technology, mpox cases continue to increase. Recently, the great potential of deep learning models in detecting mpox and non-mpox has been proven. However, existing models learn image representations via image classification, which results in they may be easily susceptible to interference from real-world noise, require diverse non-mpox images, and fail to detect abnormal input. These drawbacks make classification models inapplicable in real-world settings. To address these challenges, we propose \"Mask, Inpainting, and Measure\" (MIM). In MIM's pipeline, a generative adversarial network only learns mpox image representations by inpainting the masked mpox images. Then, MIM determines whether the input belongs to mpox by measuring the similarity between the inpainted image and the original image. The underlying intuition is that since MIM solely models mpox images, it struggles to accurately inpaint non-mpox images in real-world settings. Without utilizing any non-mpox images, MIM cleverly detects mpox and non-mpox and can handle abnormal inputs. We used the recognized mpox dataset (MSLD) and images of eighteen non-mpox skin diseases to verify the effectiveness and robustness of MIM. Experimental results show that the average AUROC of MIM achieves 0.8237. In addition, we demonstrated the drawbacks of classification models and buttressed the potential of MIM through clinical validation. Finally, we developed an online smartphone app to provide free testing to the public in affected areas. This work first employs generative models to improve mpox detection and provides new insights into binary decision-making tasks in medical images. ",

    "abstract": "Large scale data storage is susceptible to failure. As disks are damaged and replaced, traditional machine learning models, which rely on historical data to make predictions, struggle to accurately predict disk failures. This paper presents a novel method for predicting disk failures by leveraging multi-layer domain adaptive learning techniques. First, disk data with numerous faults is selected as the source domain, and disk data with fewer faults is selected as the target domain. A training of the feature extraction network is performed with the selected origin and destination domains. The contrast between the two domains facilitates the transfer of diagnostic knowledge from the domain of source and target. According to the experimental findings, it has been demonstrated that the proposed technique can generate a reliable prediction model and improve the ability to predict failures on disk data with few failure samples.

Therefore, it is very important to solve the data class imbalance classification problem. The SMART dataset exhibits an evident class imbalance, comprising a substantial quantity of healthy samples and a comparatively limited number of defective samples. This dataset serves as a reliable indicator of the disc's health status. In this paper, we obtain the best balanced disk SMART dataset for a specific classification model by mixing and integrating the data synthesised by multivariate generative adversarial networks (GAN) to balance the disk SMART dataset at the data level; and combine it with genetic algorithms to obtain higher disk fault classification prediction accuracy on a specific classification model.

    "title": "Statistical properties and privacy guarantees of an original  distance-based fully synthetic data generation method",
    "abstract": "Introduction: The amount of data generated by original research is growing exponentially. Publicly releasing them is recommended to comply with the Open Science principles. However, data collected from human participants cannot be released as-is without raising privacy concerns. Fully synthetic data represent a promising answer to this challenge. This approach is explored by the French Centre de Recherche en {\\'E}pid{\\'e}miologie et Sant{\\'e} des Populations in the form of a synthetic data generation framework based on Classification and Regression Trees and an original distance-based filtering. The goal of this work was to develop a refined version of this framework and to assess its risk-utility profile with empirical and formal tools, including novel ones developed for the purpose of this evaluation.Materials and Methods: Our synthesis framework consists of four successive steps, each of which is designed to prevent specific risks of disclosure. We assessed its performance by applying two or more of these steps to a rich epidemiological dataset. Privacy and utility metrics were computed for each of the resulting synthetic datasets, which were further assessed using machine learning approaches.Results: Computed metrics showed a satisfactory level of protection against attribute disclosure attacks for each synthetic dataset, especially when the full framework was used. Membership disclosure attacks were formally prevented without significantly altering the data. Machine learning approaches showed a low risk of success for simulated singling out and linkability attacks. Distributional and inferential similarity with the original data were high with all datasets.Discussion: This work showed the technical feasibility of generating publicly releasable synthetic data using a multi-step framework. Formal and empirical tools specifically developed for this demonstration are a valuable contribution to this field. Further research should focus on the extension and validation of these tools, in an effort to specify the intrinsic qualities of alternative data synthesis methods.Conclusion: By successfully assessing the quality of data produced using a novel multi-step synthetic data generation framework, we showed the technical and conceptual soundness of the Open-CESP initiative, which seems ripe for full-scale implementation.

    "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is a critical challenge in machine learning due to model overconfidence, often without awareness of their epistemological limits. We hypothesize that ``neural collapse'', a phenomenon affecting in-distribution data for models trained beyond loss convergence, also influences OOD data. To benefit from this interplay, we introduce NECO, a novel post-hoc method for OOD detection, which leverages the geometric properties of ``neural collapse'' and of principal component spaces to identify OOD data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NECO achieves state-of-the-art results on both small and large-scale OOD detection tasks while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across different network architectures. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of our method in OOD detection. We plan to release the code after the anonymity period. ",
