    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a biologically plausible neural network model with significant advantages in both event-driven processing and spatio-temporal information processing, rendering SNNs an appealing choice for energyefficient object detection. However, the non-differentiability of the biological neuronal dynamics model presents a challenge during the training of SNNs. Furthermore, a suitable decoding strategy for object detection in SNNs is currently lacking. In this study, we introduce the Current Mean Decoding (CMD) method, which solves the regression problem to facilitate the training of deep SNNs for object detection tasks. Based on the gradient surrogate and CMD, we propose the SNN-YOLOv3 model for object detection. Our experiments demonstrate that SNN-YOLOv3 achieves a remarkable performance with an mAP of 61.87% on the PASCAL VOC dataset, requiring only 6 time steps. Compared to SpikingYOLO, we have managed to increase mAP by nearly 10% while reducing energy consumption by two orders of magnitude. ",

    "abstract": "We propose an approach for imaging in scattering media when large and diverse data sets are available. It has two steps. Using a dictionary learning algorithm the first step estimates the true Green's function vectors as columns in an unordered sensing matrix. The array data comes from many sparse sets of sources whose location and strength are not known to us. In the second step, the columns of the estimated sensing matrix are ordered for imaging using Multi-Dimensional Scaling with connectivity information derived from cross-correlations of its columns, as in time reversal. For these two steps to work together we need data from large arrays of receivers so the columns of the sensing matrix are incoherent for the first step, as well as from sub-arrays so that they are coherent enough to obtain the connectivity needed in the second step. Through simulation experiments, we show that the proposed approach is able to provide images in complex media whose resolution is that of a homogeneous medium. ",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting the future would be an important milestone in the capabilities of artificial intelligence. However, research on the ability of large language models to provide probabilistic predictions about future events remains nascent. To empirically test this ability, we enrolled OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model, GPT-4, in a three-month forecasting tournament hosted on the Metaculus platform. The tournament, running from July to October 2023, attracted 843 participants and covered diverse topics including Big Tech, U.S. politics, viral outbreaks, and the Ukraine conflict. Focusing on binary forecasts, we show that GPT-4's probabilistic forecasts are significantly less accurate than the median human-crowd forecasts. We find that GPT-4's forecasts did not significantly differ from the no-information forecasting strategy of assigning a 50% probability to every question. We explore a potential explanation, that GPT-4 might be predisposed to predict probabilities close to the midpoint of the scale, but our data do not support this hypothesis. Overall, we find that GPT-4 significantly underperforms in real-world predictive tasks compared to median human-crowd forecasts. A potential explanation for this underperformance is that in real-world forecasting tournaments, the true answers are genuinely unknown at the time of prediction; unlike in other benchmark tasks like professional exams or time series forecasting, where strong performance may at least partly be due to the answers being memorized from the training data. This makes real-world forecasting tournaments an ideal environment for testing the generalized reasoning and prediction capabilities of artificial intelligence going forward. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced various domains, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses serious concerns. Understanding these vulnerabilities and developing effective defense mechanisms is crucial. DeepFool, an algorithm proposed by Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. (2016), finds minimal perturbations to misclassify input images. However, DeepFool lacks a targeted approach, making it less effective in specific attack scenarios. Also, in previous related works, researchers primarily focus on success, not considering how much an image is getting distorted; the integrity of the image quality, and the confidence level to misclassifying. So, in this paper, we propose Targeted DeepFool, an augmented version of DeepFool that allows targeting specific classes for misclassification. We also introduce a minimum confidence score requirement hyperparameter to enhance flexibility. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method across different deep neural network architectures while preserving image integrity as much as possible. Results show that one of the deep convolutional neural network architectures, AlexNet, and one of the state-of-the-art model Vision Transformer exhibit high robustness to getting fooled.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have advanced graph structure understanding via recursive information exchange and aggregation among graph nodes. To improve model robustness, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising approach for data augmentation. However, existing methods for generating pre-trained graph embeddings often rely on fine-tuning with specific downstream task labels, which limits their usability in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or unavailable. To address this, our research focuses on advancing the generalization capabilities of graph models in challenging zero-shot learning scenarios. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we aim to develop a graph-oriented LLM that can achieve high generalization across diverse downstream datasets and tasks, even without any information available from the downstream graph data. In this work, we present the GraphGPT framework that aligns LLMs with graph structural knowledge with a graph instruction tuning paradigm. Our framework incorporates a text-graph grounding component to establish a connection between textual information and graph structures. Additionally, we propose a dual-stage instruction tuning paradigm, accompanied by a lightweight graph-text alignment projector. This paradigm explores self-supervised graph structural signals and task-specific graph instructions, to guide LLMs in understanding complex graph structures and improving their adaptability across different downstream tasks. Our framework is evaluated on supervised and zero-shot graph learning tasks, demonstrating superior generalization and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. ",

Despite EEND showing great promise, a few recent works took a step back and studied the possible combination of (local) supervised EEND diarization with (global) unsupervised clustering. Yet, these hybrid contributions did not question the original multi-label formulation. We propose to switch from multi-label (where any two speakers can be active at the same time) to powerset multi-class classification (where dedicated classes are assigned to pairs of overlapping speakers). Through extensive experiments on 9 different benchmarks, we show that this formulation leads to significantly better performance (mostly on overlapping speech) and robustness to domain mismatch, while eliminating the detection threshold hyperparameter, critical for the multi-label formulation.

This paper introduces $\\textit{Agri-GNN}$, a novel Genotypic-Topological Graph Neural Network Framework tailored to capture the intricate spatial and genotypic interactions of crops, paving the way for optimized predictions of harvest yields. $\\textit{Agri-GNN}$ constructs a Graph $\\mathcal{G}$ that considers farming plots as nodes, and then methodically constructs edges between nodes based on spatial and genotypic similarity, allowing for the aggregation of node information through a genotypic-topological filter.

    "abstract": "What distinguishes robust models from non-robust ones? This question has gained traction with the appearance of large-scale multimodal models, such as CLIP. These models have demonstrated unprecedented robustness with respect to natural distribution shifts. While it has been shown that such differences in robustness can be traced back to differences in training data, so far it is not known what that translates to in terms of what the model has learned. In this work, we bridge this gap by probing the representation spaces of 12 robust multimodal models with various backbones (ResNets and ViTs) and pretraining sets (OpenAI, LAION-400M, LAION-2B, YFCC15M, CC12M and DataComp). We find two signatures of robustness in the representation spaces of these models: (1) Robust models exhibit outlier features characterized by their activations, with some being several orders of magnitude above average. These outlier features induce privileged directions in the model's representation space. We demonstrate that these privileged directions explain most of the predictive power of the model by pruning up to $80 \\%$ of the least important representation space directions without negative impacts on model accuracy and robustness; (2) Robust models encode substantially more concepts in their representation space. While this superposition of concepts allows robust models to store much information, it also results in highly polysemantic features, which makes their interpretation challenging. We discuss how these insights pave the way for future research in various fields, such as model pruning and mechanistic interpretability. ",

    "abstract": "Within the realm of deep learning, the interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly in the context of image classification tasks, remains a formidable challenge. To this end we present a neurosymbolic framework, NeSyFOLD-G that generates a symbolic rule-set using the last layer kernels of the CNN to make its underlying knowledge interpretable. What makes NeSyFOLD-G different from other similar frameworks is that we first find groups of similar kernels in the CNN (kernel-grouping) using the cosine-similarity between the feature maps generated by various kernels. Once such kernel groups are found, we binarize each kernel group's output in the CNN and use it to generate a binarization table which serves as input data to FOLD-SE-M which is a Rule Based Machine Learning (RBML) algorithm. FOLD-SE-M then generates a rule-set that can be used to make predictions. We present a novel kernel grouping algorithm and show that grouping similar kernels leads to a significant reduction in the size of the rule-set generated by FOLD-SE-M, consequently, improving the interpretability. This rule-set symbolically encapsulates the connectionist knowledge of the trained CNN. The rule-set can be viewed as a normal logic program wherein each predicate's truth value depends on a kernel group in the CNN. Each predicate in the rule-set is mapped to a concept using a few semantic segmentation masks of the images used for training, to make it human-understandable. The last layers of the CNN can then be replaced by this rule-set to obtain the NeSy-G model which can then be used for the image classification task. The goal directed ASP system s(CASP) can be used to obtain the justification of any prediction made using the NeSy-G model. We also propose a novel algorithm for labeling each predicate in the rule-set with the semantic concept(s) that its corresponding kernel group represents. ",

Therefore, this paper presents both the quantitative and asymptotic computational complexities of CVNNs. This is a crucial tool in deciding which algorithm to implement. The mathematical operations are described in terms of the number of real-valued multiplications, as these are the most demanding operations. To determine which CVNN can be implemented in a low-power system, quantitative computational complexities can be used to accurately estimate the number of floating-point operations.

However, this impressive performance typically comes at the cost of 10-100x more inference-time computation compared to undefended models -- the research community has witnessed an intense three-way trade-off between certifiable robustness, model utility, and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a defense framework named PatchCURE to approach this trade-off problem. PatchCURE provides sufficient \"knobs\" for tuning defense performance and allows us to build a family of defenses: the most robust PatchCURE instance can match the performance of any existing state-of-the-art defense (without efficiency considerations); the most efficient PatchCURE instance has similar inference efficiency as undefended models. Notably, PatchCURE achieves state-of-the-art robustness and utility performance across all different efficiency levels, e.g., 16-23% absolute clean accuracy and certified robust accuracy advantages over prior defenses when requiring computation efficiency to be close to undefended models. The family of PatchCURE defenses enables us to flexibly choose appropriate defenses to satisfy given computation and/or utility constraints in practice. ",

Generating control samples around the network-predicted optimal mean retains the advantage of sample diversity while enabling real time rollout of trajectories that avoids multiple dynamic obstacles in an on-road navigation setting. Further the 3D CNN architecture implicitly learns the future trajectories of the dynamic agents in the scene resulting in successful collision free navigation despite no explicit future trajectory prediction.

    "abstract": "Monitoring the number of jumps for volleyball players during training or a match can be crucial to prevent injuries, yet the measurement requires considerable workload and cost using traditional methods such as video analysis. Also, existing methods do not provide accurate differentiation between different types of jumps. In this study, an unobtrusive system with a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) on the waist was proposed to recognize the types of volleyball jumps. A Multi-Layer Temporal Convolutional Network (MS-TCN) was applied for sample-wise classification. The model was evaluated on ten volleyball players and twenty-six volleyball players, during a lab session with a fixed protocol of jumping and landing tasks, and during four volleyball training sessions, respectively. The MS-TCN model achieved better performance than a state-of-the-art deep learning model but with lower computational cost. In the lab sessions, most jump counts showed small differences between the predicted jumps and video-annotated jumps, with an overall count showing a Limit of Agreement (LoA) of 0.1+-3.40 (r=0.884). For comparison, the proposed algorithm showed slightly worse results than VERT (a commercial jumping assessment device) with a LoA of 0.1+-2.08 (r=0.955) but the differences were still within a comparable range. In the training sessions, the recognition of three types of jumps exhibited a mean difference from observation of less than 10 jumps: block, smash, and overhead serve. These results showed the potential of using a single IMU to recognize the types of volleyball jumps. The sample-wise architecture provided high resolution of recognition and the MS-TCN required fewer parameters to train compared with state-of-the-art models. ",

    "abstract": "Forged content shared widely on social media platforms is a major social problem that requires increased regulation and poses new challenges to the research community. The recent proliferation of hyper-realistic deepfake videos has drawn attention to the threat of audio and visual forgeries. Most previous work on detecting AI-generated fake videos only utilizes visual modality or audio modality. While there are some methods in the literature that exploit audio and visual modalities to detect forged videos, they have not been comprehensively evaluated on multi-modal datasets of deepfake videos involving acoustic and visual manipulations. Moreover, these existing methods are mostly based on CNN and suffer from low detection accuracy. Inspired by the recent success of Transformer in various fields, to address the challenges posed by deepfake technology, in this paper, we propose an Audio-Visual Transformer-based Ensemble Network (AVTENet) framework that considers both acoustic manipulation and visual manipulation to achieve effective video forgery detection. Specifically, the proposed model integrates several purely transformer-based variants that capture video, audio, and audio-visual salient cues to reach a consensus in prediction. For evaluation, we use the recently released benchmark multi-modal audio-video FakeAVCeleb dataset. For a detailed analysis, we evaluate AVTENet, its variants, and several existing methods on multiple test sets of the FakeAVCeleb dataset. Experimental results show that our best model outperforms all existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Testset-I and Testset-II of the FakeAVCeleb dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) enables private data analysis but is hard to use in practice. For data controllers who decide what output to release, choosing the amount of noise to add to the output is a non-trivial task because of the difficulty of interpreting the privacy parameter $\\epsilon$. For data analysts who submit queries, it is hard to understand the impact of the noise introduced by DP on their tasks. To address these two challenges: 1) we define a privacy risk indicator that indicates the impact of choosing $\\epsilon$ on individuals' privacy and use that to design an algorithm that chooses $\\epsilon$ automatically; 2) we introduce a utility signaling protocol that helps analysts interpret the impact of DP on their downstream tasks. We implement the algorithm and the protocol inside a new platform built on top of a data escrow, which allows the controller to control the data flow and achieve trustworthiness while maintaining high performance. We demonstrate our contributions through an IRB-approved user study, extensive experimental evaluations, and comparison with other DP platforms. All in all, our work contributes to making DP easier to use by lowering adoption barriers. ",

Recently, data-driven approaches such as Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE) have shown promising results by leveraging the expressive power of neural networks to model unknown dynamics. However, these approaches often suffer from limited labeled training data, leading to poor generalization and suboptimal predictions. On the other hand, semi-supervised algorithms can utilize abundant unlabeled data and have demonstrated good performance in classification and regression tasks. We propose TS-NODE, the first semi-supervised approach to modeling dynamical systems with NODE. TS-NODE explores cheaply generated synthetic pseudo rollouts to broaden exploration in the state space and to tackle the challenges brought by lack of ground-truth system data under a teacher-student model. TS-NODE employs an unified optimization framework that corrects the teacher model based on the student's feedback while mitigating the potential false system dynamics present in pseudo rollouts. TS-NODE demonstrates significant performance improvements over a baseline Neural ODE model on multiple dynamical system modeling tasks. ",

Methods for status monitoring with consideration to the weather condition and forecasting with the use of in-service data from ships requires accurate and complete models for predicting the energy efficiency of a ship.

When special situation happens and new associations occur, a very small amount of computation is sufficient to update the system status and compute the control statistics by using this approach.

Traditional formulations impose a uniform privacy requirement for all users, which is often inconsistent with real-world scenarios in which users dictate their privacy preferences individually. This work considers the problem of mean estimation, where each user can impose their own distinct privacy level. The algorithm we propose is shown to be minimax optimal and has a near-linear run-time. Our results elicit an interesting saturation phenomenon that occurs. Namely, the privacy requirements of the most stringent users dictate the overall error rates. As a consequence, users with less but differing privacy requirements are all given more privacy than they require, in equal amounts. In other words, these privacy-indifferent users are given a nontrivial degree of privacy for free, without any sacrifice in the performance of the estimator. ",

In this article, we show that such hierarchy indeed exists by proving that GC2 queries cannot be expressed by GNNs with polynomial activation functions.

    "abstract": "With data-outsourcing becoming commonplace, there grows a need for secure outsourcing of data and machine learning models. Namely, data and model owners (client) often have a need for their information to remain private and secure against the potentially untrusted computing resource (server) to whom they want to outsource said data and models to. Various approaches to privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) have been devised with different techniques and solutions introduced in the past. These solutions often involved one of two compromises: (1) client-server interactions to allow intermediary rounds of decryption and re-encryption of data or (2) complex architectures for multi-party computation. This paper devises a paradigm using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) that minimizes architectural complexity and removes client-side involvement during the training and prediction lifecycle of machine learning models. In addition, the paradigm proposed in this work achieves both model security as well as data security. To remove client-side involvement, the devised paradigm proposes a no decryption approach that allows the server to handle PPML in its entirety without rounds of decryption and re-encryption. To the best of our knowledge, this paradigm is the first to achieve privacy-preserving decision tree training with no decryption while maintaining a simple client-server architecture. ",

This involves utilizing machine learning models to analyze large, multidimensional weather datasets for patterns and trends. These datasets may include variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, contributing to meteorological conditions. Furthermore, it's imperative that classification algorithms proficiently navigate challenges such as data imbalances, where certain weather events (e.g., storms or extreme temperatures) might be underrepresented. This empirical study explores data augmentation methods to address imbalanced classes in tabular weather data in centralized and federated settings. Employing data augmentation techniques such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique or Generative Adversarial Networks can improve the model's accuracy in classifying rare but critical weather events. Moreover, with advancements in federated learning, machine learning models can be trained across decentralized databases, ensuring privacy and data integrity while mitigating the need for centralized data storage and processing. Thus, the classification of weather data stands as a critical bridge, linking raw meteorological data to actionable insights, enhancing our capacity to anticipate and prepare for diverse weather conditions.

The results show that the user understands and performs best when all the level of causality is shown to the user.

Despite this, existing methods struggle to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks when continually increasing model sparsity and require a retraining process. As humans step into the era of large language models, these issues become increasingly prominent. This paper proposes that the robustness of language models is proportional to the extent of pre-trained knowledge they encompass. Accordingly, we introduce a post-training pruning strategy designed to faithfully replicate the embedding space and feature space of dense language models, aiming to conserve more pre-trained knowledge during the pruning process. In this setup, each layer's reconstruction error not only originates from itself but also includes cumulative error from preceding layers, followed by an adaptive rectification. Compared to other state-of-art baselines, our approach demonstrates a superior balance between accuracy, sparsity, robustness, and pruning cost with BERT on datasets SST2, IMDB, and AGNews, marking a significant stride towards robust pruning in language models.

For a long time, there has been a lack of effective ways to measure and identify spatial bias, and little is known about where it comes from and what degree it is. To this end, we present a new zone evaluation protocol, extending from the traditional evaluation to a more generalized one, which measures the detection performance over zones, yielding a series of Zone Precisions (ZPs). For the first time, we provide numerical results, showing that the object detectors perform quite unevenly across the zones. Surprisingly, the detector's performance in the 96\\% border zone of the image does not reach the AP value (Average Precision, commonly regarded as the average detection performance in the entire image zone). To better understand spatial bias, a series of heuristic experiments are conducted. Our investigation excludes two intuitive conjectures about spatial bias that the object scale and the absolute positions of objects barely influence the spatial bias. We find that the key lies in the human-imperceptible divergence in data patterns between objects in different zones, thus eventually forming a visible performance gap between the zones. With these findings, we finally discuss a future direction for object detection, namely, spatial disequilibrium problem, aiming at pursuing a balanced detection ability over the entire image zone. By broadly evaluating 10 popular object detectors and 5 detection datasets, we shed light on the spatial bias of object detectors. We hope this work could raise a focus on detection robustness.

Traditional feature-based methods heavily rely on handcrafted features, which are domain-specific and lack generalizability to new domains. To address this problem, researchers have turned to neural network-based approaches. However, existing methods follow a sampling-based modeling approach, potentially losing continuous dynamic information and structural-temporal dependencies that emerge during the information diffusion process. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Hierarchical Temporal Graph Attention Networks for cascade popularity prediction (HierCas). Unlike existing methods, HierCas operates on the entire cascade graph by a dynamic graph modeling approach, enabling it to capture the full range of continuous dynamic information and explicitly model the interplay between structural and temporal factors. By leveraging time-aware node embedding, graph attention mechanisms and hierarchical pooling structures, HierCas effectively captures the popularity trend implicit in the complex cascade. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets in different scenarios demonstrate that our HierCas significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. ",

SNNKs effectively disentangle the inputs from the parameters of the neural network in the FFL, only to connect them in the final computation via the dot-product kernel. They are also strictly more expressive, as allowing to model complicated relationships beyond the functions of the dot-products of parameter-input vectors. We also introduce the neural network bundling process that applies SNNKs to compactify deep neural network architectures, resulting in additional compression gains. In its extreme version, it leads to the fully bundled network whose optimal parameters can be expressed via explicit formulae for several loss functions (e.g. mean squared error), opening a possibility to bypass backpropagation. As a by-product of our analysis, we introduce the mechanism of the universal random features (or URFs), applied to instantiate several SNNK variants, and interesting on its own in the context of scalable kernel methods. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis of all these concepts as well as an extensive empirical evaluation, ranging from point-wise kernel estimation to Transformers' fine-tuning with novel adapter layers inspired by SNNKs.

Then, for included languages, we look at models' learned representations based on language family and dialect and try to understand how models' learned representations for~(1) seen and~(2) unseen languages vary across different language groups. In addition, we test and analyze performance on downstream tasks such as text generation and Named Entity Recognition.

    "title": "Transparency challenges in policy evaluation with causal machine  learning -- improving usability and accountability",
    "abstract": "Causal machine learning tools are beginning to see use in real-world policy evaluation tasks to flexibly estimate treatment effects. One issue with these methods is that the machine learning models used are generally black boxes, i.e., there is no globally interpretable way to understand how a model makes estimates. This is a clear problem in policy evaluation applications, particularly in government, because it is difficult to understand whether such models are functioning in ways that are fair, based on the correct interpretation of evidence and transparent enough to allow for accountability if things go wrong. However, there has been little discussion of transparency problems in the causal machine learning literature and how these might be overcome. This paper explores why transparency issues are a problem for causal machine learning in public policy evaluation applications and considers ways these problems might be addressed through explainable AI tools and by simplifying models in line with interpretable AI principles. It then applies these ideas to a case-study using a causal forest model to estimate conditional average treatment effects for a hypothetical change in the school leaving age in Australia. It shows that existing tools for understanding black-box predictive models are poorly suited to causal machine learning and that simplifying the model to make it interpretable leads to an unacceptable increase in error (in this application). It concludes that new tools are needed to properly understand causal machine learning models and the algorithms that fit them. ",

Additionally, we introduce the Diversified Embedding Learning (DEL) module, meticulously designed to formulate user representations that possess an innate awareness of diversity. In tandem with this, we introduce a novel technique named Conditional Alignment and Uniformity (CAU). It adeptly encodes KG item embeddings while preserving contextual integrity. Collectively, our contributions signify a substantial stride towards augmenting the panorama of recommendation diversity within the realm of KG-informed RecSys paradigms. ",

However, a recent study shows that multi-modal data representations tend to cluster within a limited convex cone (as representation degeneration problem), which hinders retrieval performance due to the inseparability of these representations. In our study, we first empirically validate the presence of the representation degeneration problem across multiple cross-modal benchmarks and methods. Next, to address it, we introduce a novel method, called InvGC, a post-processing technique inspired by graph convolution and average pooling. Specifically, InvGC defines the graph topology within the datasets and then applies graph convolution in a subtractive manner. This method effectively separates representations by increasing the distances between data points. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of InvGC, we propose an advanced graph topology, LocalAdj, which only aims to increase the distances between each data point and its nearest neighbors. To understand why InvGC works, we present a detailed theoretical analysis, proving that the lower bound of recall will be improved after deploying InvGC. Extensive empirical results show that InvGC and InvGC w/LocalAdj significantly mitigate the representation degeneration problem, thereby enhancing retrieval performance.

    "abstract": "Automatic response forecasting for news media plays a crucial role in enabling content producers to efficiently predict the impact of news releases and prevent unexpected negative outcomes such as social conflict and moral injury. To effectively forecast responses, it is essential to develop measures that leverage the social dynamics and contextual information surrounding individuals, especially in cases where explicit profiles or historical actions of the users are limited (referred to as lurkers). As shown in a previous study, 97% of all tweets are produced by only the most active 25% of users. However, existing approaches have limited exploration of how to best process and utilize these important features. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, named SocialSense, that leverages a large language model to induce a belief-centered graph on top of an existent social network, along with graph-based propagation to capture social dynamics. We hypothesize that the induced graph that bridges the gap between distant users who share similar beliefs allows the model to effectively capture the response patterns. Our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art in experimental evaluations for both zero-shot and supervised settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in response forecasting. Moreover, the analysis reveals the framework's capability to effectively handle unseen user and lurker scenarios, further highlighting its robustness and practical applicability. ",

However, the use of CC is challenging in various practical applications due to dynamic user behavior. The existing solutions, based on shared caching, cannot directly handle all scenarios where users freely enter and depart the network at any time as they are constrained by specific conditions on network parameters. This paper proposes a universally applicable shared-caching scheme for dynamic setups without any restriction on network parameters. The closed-form expressions for the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) are computed for the resulting generalized scheme, and are shown to achieve the existing optimal bounds of the shared-cache model. Furthermore, a successive-interference-cancellation-free extension based on a fast iterative optimized beamformer design is devised to optimize the use of excess spatial dimensions freed by cache-aided interference cancellation. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed scheme. In particular, the results demonstrate that while a dynamic setup may achieve a DoF substantially lower than the optimal DoF of shared caching, our proposed scheme significantly improves the performance at the finite signal-to-noise ratio compared to unicasting, which only benefits from the local caching gain.

Home confinement, one of the social isolation restrictions, has proven to be an effective way to prevent a pandemic and significantly reduce the spread of the virus. However, these measures have also led to negative psychological effects, which can be more severe than the physical discomfort caused by the pandemic itself. To address this issue, it is crucial to understand how being confined at home affects people's psychological states and their use of digital devices. To this end, we conducted an in-situ study with 32 participants living in states affected by COVID-19 lockdowns for three weeks. We examined human emotions, social roles, well-being, and mobile usage behaviors and explored the predictability of affective states using digital traces. Extensive experimental results show that COVID-19 home confinement is associated with decreased valence and increased work time and that human well-being could be accurately inferred from mobile usage behaviors. We also present a set of interesting findings on how different factors of mobile usage affect human emotions. Overall, the findings of this research have great potential to inform the development of interventions and remote programs to support individuals in similar situations, such as those who are ill or undergoing post-operative home rehabilitation and home work.

In this paper, we further conduct a thorough robustness evaluation of cutting-edge GEC methods for four different types of adversarial attacks and propose a simple yet very effective Cycle Self-Augmenting (CSA) method accordingly. By leveraging the augmenting data from the GEC models themselves in the post-training process and introducing regularization data for cycle training, our proposed method can effectively improve the model robustness of well-trained GEC models with only a few more training epochs as an extra cost. More concretely, further training on the regularization data can prevent the GEC models from over-fitting on easy-to-learn samples and thus can improve the generalization capability and robustness towards unseen data (adversarial noise/samples). Meanwhile, the self-augmented data can provide more high-quality pseudo pairs to improve model performance on the original testing data. Experiments on four benchmark datasets and seven strong models indicate that our proposed training method can significantly enhance the robustness of four types of attacks without using purposely built adversarial examples in training. Evaluation results on clean data further confirm that our proposed CSA method significantly improves the performance of four baselines and yields nearly comparable results with other state-of-the-art models.

This paper proposes an efficient tool to audit the LLM's adversarial robustness via a prompt-based adversarial attack (PromptAttack). PromptAttack converts adversarial textual attacks into an attack prompt that can cause the victim LLM to output the adversarial sample to fool itself. The attack prompt is composed of three important components: (1) original input (OI) including the original sample and its ground-truth label, (2) attack objective (AO) illustrating a task description of generating a new sample that can fool itself without changing the semantic meaning, and (3) attack guidance (AG) containing the perturbation instructions to guide the LLM on how to complete the task by perturbing the original sample at character, word, and sentence levels, respectively. Besides, we use a fidelity filter to ensure that PromptAttack maintains the original semantic meanings of the adversarial examples. Further, we enhance the attack power of PromptAttack by ensembling adversarial examples at different perturbation levels. Comprehensive empirical results using Llama2 and GPT-3.5 validate that PromptAttack consistently yields a much higher attack success rate compared to AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++. Interesting findings include that a simple emoji can easily mislead GPT-3.5 to make wrong predictions. ",

    "abstract": "Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has gained increasing attention as a novel training paradigm that integrates sample alignment and feature union. However, existing VFL methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous local models among participants, which affects optimization convergence and generalization. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel approach called Vertical Federated learning for training Multi-parties Heterogeneous models (VFedMH). VFedMH focuses on aggregating the embeddings of each participant's knowledge instead of intermediate results during forward propagation. The active party, who possesses labels and features of the sample, in VFedMH securely aggregates local embeddings to obtain global knowledge embeddings, and sends them to passive parties. The passive parties, who own only features of the sample, then utilize the global embeddings to propagate forward on their local heterogeneous networks. However, the passive party does not own the labels, so the local model gradient cannot be calculated locally. To overcome this limitation, the active party assists the passive party in computing its local heterogeneous model gradients. Then, each participant trains their local model using the heterogeneous model gradients. The objective is to minimize the loss value of their respective local heterogeneous models. Additionally, the paper provides a theoretical analysis of VFedMH's convergence performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that VFedMH can simultaneously train multiple heterogeneous models with heterogeneous optimization and outperform some recent methods in model performance.

Still, an open question in split inference is output privacy, given that the output of a DNN is visible to the cloud. While encrypted computing can protect output privacy, it mandates extensive computation and communication resources. In this paper, we introduce \"Salted DNNs\": a novel method that lets clients control the semantic interpretation of DNN output at inference time while maintaining accuracy and efficiency very close to that of a standard DNN. Experimental evaluations conducted on both image and sensor data show that Salted DNNs achieve classification accuracy very close to standard DNNs, particularly when the salted layer is positioned within the early part to meet the requirements of split inference. Our method is general and can be applied to various DNNs. We open-source our code and results, as a benchmark for future studies. ",

Popular methods rely on the extraction of sparse representations, generally spectral peaks, and have proven to be accurate, fast, and scalable to large collections.

In this work, we tackle this problem by introducing and releasing a new audio augmentation pipeline that adds noise to music snippets in a realistic way, by stochastically mimicking real-world scenarios. We then propose and release a deep learning model that removes noisy components from spectrograms in order to improve peak-based fingerprinting systems' accuracy. We show that the addition of our model improves the identification performance of commonly used audio fingerprinting systems, even under noisy conditions. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance for knowledge graph reasoning. A recent variant of GNN called progressive relational graph neural network (PRGNN), utilizes relational rules to infer missing knowledge in relational digraphs and achieves notable results. However, during reasoning with PRGNN, two important properties are often overlooked: (1) the sequentiality of relation composition, where the order of combining different relations affects the semantics of the relational rules, and (2) the lagged entity information propagation, where the transmission speed of required information lags behind the appearance speed of new entities. Ignoring these properties leads to incorrect relational rule learning and decreased reasoning accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel knowledge graph reasoning approach, the Relational rUle eNhanced Graph Neural Network (RUN-GNN). Specifically, RUN-GNN employs a query related fusion gate unit to model the sequentiality of relation composition and utilizes a buffering update mechanism to alleviate the negative effect of lagged entity information propagation, resulting in higher-quality relational rule learning. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of RUN-GNN is superior on both transductive and inductive link prediction tasks. ",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of achieving secure consensus in a vehicular platoon using event-triggered control. The platoon consists of a leader and multiple follower vehicles exchanging their position and velocity information discretely to maintain stability. The paper focuses on the issue of gain modification attacks, where a malicious actor attempts to alter the controller gains to destabilize the platoon. To tackle this problem, the paper proposes a resilient event-triggered control scheme that ensures secure consensus while considering constraints on the duration and frequency of attacks. The paper also introduces an attack mitigation strategy through a topology-switching procedure, which is employed when the attack frequency and duration constraints are not met. First, sufficient consensus conditions for distributed static and dynamic event-triggered control schemes are derived under sequential gain modification attacks. The impact of the system matrices and triggering parameters on the attack constraints is also discussed. Second, the paper derives conditions to broaden the range of controller gain stability using the Schur stability criterion to mitigate attacks and maintain platoon stability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through simulation scenarios in various case studies. ",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed learning approach that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared global model. However, recent studies show that FL is vulnerable to various poisoning attacks, which can degrade the performance of global models or introduce backdoors into them. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive study on prior FL attacks and detection methods. The results show that all existing detection methods are only effective against limited and specific attacks. Most detection methods suffer from high false positives, which lead to significant performance degradation, especially in not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings. To address these issues, we propose FLTracer, the first FL attack provenance framework to accurately detect various attacks and trace the attack time, objective, type, and poisoned location of updates. Different from existing methodologies that rely solely on cross-client anomaly detection, we propose a Kalman filter-based cross-round detection to identify adversaries by seeking the behavior changes before and after the attack. Thus, this makes it resilient to data heterogeneity and is effective even in non-IID settings. To further improve the accuracy of our detection method, we employ four novel features and capture their anomalies with the joint decisions. Extensive evaluations show that FLTracer achieves an average true positive rate of over $96.88\\%$ at an average false positive rate of less than $2.67\\%$, significantly outperforming SOTA detection methods. \\footnote{Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/Eyr3/FLTracer}.} ",

    "abstract": "Within the multimodal field, the key to integrating vision and language lies in establishing a good alignment strategy. Recently, benefiting from the success of self-supervised learning, significant progress has been made in multimodal semantic representation based on pre-trained models for vision and language. However, there is still room for improvement in visual semantic representation. The lack of spatial semantic coherence and vulnerability to noise makes it challenging for current pixel or patch-based methods to accurately extract complex scene boundaries. To this end, this paper develops superpixel as a comprehensive compact representation of learnable image data, which effectively reduces the number of visual primitives for subsequent processing by clustering perceptually similar pixels. To mine more precise topological relations, we propose a Multiscale Difference Graph Convolutional Network (MDGCN). It parses the entire image as a fine-to-coarse hierarchical structure of constituent visual patterns, and captures multiscale features by progressively merging adjacent superpixels as graph nodes. Moreover, we predict the differences between adjacent nodes through the graph structure, facilitating key information aggregation of graph nodes to reason actual semantic relations. Afterward, we design a multi-level fusion rule in a bottom-up manner to avoid understanding deviation by learning complementary spatial information at different regional scales. Our proposed method can be well applied to multiple downstream task learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods in visual reasoning. Our code will be released upon publication. ",

    "abstract": "The cross-modal retrieval model leverages the potential of triple loss optimization to learn robust embedding spaces. However, existing methods often train these models in a singular pass, overlooking the distinction between semi-hard and hard triples in the optimization process. The oversight of not distinguishing between semi-hard and hard triples leads to suboptimal model performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach rooted in curriculum learning to address this problem. We propose a two-stage training paradigm that guides the model's learning process from semi-hard to hard triplets. In the first stage, the model is trained with a set of semi-hard triplets, starting from a low-loss base. Subsequently, in the second stage, we augment the embeddings using an interpolation technique. This process identifies potential hard negatives, alleviating issues arising from high-loss functions due to a scarcity of hard triples. Our approach then applies hard triplet mining in the augmented embedding space to further optimize the model. Extensive experimental results conducted on two audio-visual datasets show a significant improvement of approximately 9.8% in terms of average Mean Average Precision (MAP) over the current state-of-the-art method, MSNSCA, for the Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Retrieval (AV-CMR) task on the AVE dataset, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method.

With the deep learning-oriented approaches contributing a majority of the papers, we further discuss the deep learning-based methods as semantic segmentation and object detection methods. In addition, we discuss four ITCD-related issues to further comprehend the ITCD domain using optical remote sensing data, such as comparisons between multi-sensor based data and optical data in ITCD domain, comparisons among different algorithms and different ITCD tasks, etc. Finally, this review proposes some ITCD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and potential hot topics in future ITCD research.

    "abstract": "Quality classification of wood boards is an essential task in the sawmill industry, which is still usually performed by human operators in small to median companies in developing countries. Machine learning algorithms have been successfully employed to investigate the problem, offering a more affordable alternative compared to other solutions. However, such approaches usually present some drawbacks regarding the proper selection of their hyperparameters. Moreover, the models are susceptible to the features extracted from wood board images, which influence the induction of the model and, consequently, its generalization power. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the problem of simultaneously tuning the hyperparameters of an artificial neural network (ANN) as well as selecting a subset of characteristics that better describes the wood board quality. Experiments were conducted over a private dataset composed of images obtained from a sawmill industry and described using different feature descriptors. The predictive performance of the model was compared against five baseline methods as well as a random search, performing either ANN hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. Experimental results suggest that hyperparameters should be adjusted according to the feature set, or the features should be selected considering the hyperparameter values. In summary, the best predictive performance, i.e., a balanced accuracy of $0.80$, was achieved in two distinct scenarios: (i) performing only feature selection, and (ii) performing both tasks concomitantly. Thus, we suggest that at least one of the two approaches should be considered in the context of industrial applications. ",

First, we systematically generate reformulations of training questions to increase robustness of models to surface form variations. This is a particularly challenging problem, given the incomplete nature of such questions. Second, we guide ConvQA models towards higher performance by feeding it only those reformulations that help improve their answering quality, using deep reinforcement learning. Third, we demonstrate the viability of training major model components on one benchmark and applying them zero-shot to another. Finally, for a rigorous evaluation of robustness for trained models, we use and release large numbers of diverse reformulations generated by prompting GPT for benchmark test sets (resulting in 20x increase in sizes). Our findings show that ConvQA models with robust training via reformulations, significantly outperform those with standard training from gold QA pairs only. ",

Through an extensive measurement campaign run by spoofing the user's location all over the world, we reverse-engineer the algorithm adopted by People Nearby to compute distances between users. Although the service protects against precise user localization, we demonstrate that location privacy is always lower than the one declared by Telegram of 500 meters. Specifically, we discover that location privacy is a function of the geographical position of the user. Indeed, the radius of the location privacy area (localization error) spans between 400 meters (close to the equator) and 128 meters (close to the poles), with a difference of up to 75% (worst case) compared to what Telegram declares. After our responsible disclosure, Telegram updated the FAQ associated with the service. Finally, we provide some solutions and countermeasures that Telegram can implement to improve location privacy.

In this paper, we propose to better utilize graph structure for PU node classification. We first propose a distance-aware PU loss that uses homophily in graphs to introduce more accurate supervision. We also propose a regularizer to align the model with graph structure. Theoretical analysis shows that minimizing the proposed loss also leads to minimizing the expected loss with both positive and negative labels.

    "abstract": "In diffusion models, UNet is the most popular network backbone, since its long skip connects (LSCs) to connect distant network blocks can aggregate long-distant information and alleviate vanishing gradient. Unfortunately, UNet often suffers from unstable training in diffusion models which can be alleviated by scaling its LSC coefficients smaller. However, theoretical understandings of the instability of UNet in diffusion models and also the performance improvement of LSC scaling remain absent yet. To solve this issue, we theoretically show that the coefficients of LSCs in UNet have big effects on the stableness of the forward and backward propagation and robustness of UNet. Specifically, the hidden feature and gradient of UNet at any layer can oscillate and their oscillation ranges are actually large which explains the instability of UNet training. Moreover, UNet is also provably sensitive to perturbed input, and predicts an output distant from the desired output, yielding oscillatory loss and thus oscillatory gradient. Besides, we also observe the theoretical benefits of the LSC coefficient scaling of UNet in the stableness of hidden features and gradient and also robustness. Finally, inspired by our theory, we propose an effective coefficient scaling framework ScaleLong that scales the coefficients of LSC in UNet and better improves the training stability of UNet. Experimental results on four famous datasets show that our methods are superior to stabilize training and yield about 1.5x training acceleration on different diffusion models with UNet or UViT backbones.

Leveraging the exponential concentration, we prove a tight upper bound for the overall error of VM-CI. This, in turn, allows us to characterize the sample complexity of any constraint-based causal discovery algorithm that uses VM-CI for CI tests. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sample complexity guarantee for causal discovery for continuous variables. Furthermore, we empirically show that VM-CI outperforms other popular CI tests in terms of either time or sample complexity (or both), which translates to a better performance in structure learning as well.

The knowledge graph is first enriched with logically derived facts inferred using probabilistic logical programming. A neural model is then employed at each turn to score the conversational relevance of each node and edge of this extended graph. Finally, the elements with highest relevance scores are converted to a natural language form, and are integrated into the prompt for the neural conversational model employed to generate the system response. We investigate the benefits of the proposed approach on two datasets (KVRET and GraphWOZ) along with a human evaluation.

    "abstract": "While there has been extensive work on deep neural networks for images and text, deep learning for relational databases (RDBs) is still a rather unexplored field. One direction that recently gained traction is to apply Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to RBDs. However, training GNNs on large relational databases (i.e., data stored in multiple database tables) is rather inefficient due to multiple rounds of training and potentially large and inefficient representations. Hence, in this paper we propose SPARE (Single-Pass Relational models), a new class of neural models that can be trained efficiently on RDBs while providing similar accuracies as GNNs. For enabling efficient training, different from GNNs, SPARE makes use of the fact that data in RDBs has a regular structure, which allows one to train these models in a single pass while exploiting symmetries at the same time. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that SPARE can significantly speedup both training and inference while offering competitive predictive performance over numerous baselines. ",

Conventional techniques, notably those employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are often limited by insufficient training data and their inability to utilize textual information, undermining their applicability in real-world applications. In this work, we propose ReLM, a novel framework that leverages the chemical knowledge encoded in language models (LMs) to assist GNNs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of real-world chemical reaction predictions. To further enhance the model's robustness and interpretability, we incorporate the confidence score strategy, enabling the LMs to self-assess the reliability of their predictions. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReLM improves the performance of state-of-the-art GNN-based methods across various chemical reaction datasets, especially in out-of-distribution settings.

To fill this gap, we introduce MULTITuDE, a novel benchmarking dataset for multilingual machine-generated text detection comprising of 74,081 authentic and machine-generated texts in 11 languages (ar, ca, cs, de, en, es, nl, pt, ru, uk, and zh) generated by 8 multilingual LLMs. Using this benchmark, we compare the performance of zero-shot (statistical and black-box) and fine-tuned detectors.

Solutions to this problem should be divorced from performance appraisal against ground truth - as this is not available at run-time - and should ideally be based on generalisable environmental observations. For this, we propose applying the recently developed Visual DNA as a highly scalable tool for comparing datasets of images - in this work, sequences of map and live experiences. In the case of localisation, important dataset differences impacting performance are modes of appearance change, including weather, lighting, and season. Specifically, for any deep architecture which is used for place recognition by matching feature volumes at a particular layer, we use distribution measures to compare neuron-wise activation statistics between live images and multiple previously recorded past experiences, with a potentially large seasonal (winter/summer) or time of day (day/night) shift. We find that differences in these statistics correlate to performance when localising using a past experience with the same appearance gap. We validate our approach over the Nordland cross-season dataset as well as data from Oxford's University Parks with lighting and mild seasonal change, showing excellent ability of our system to rank actual localisation performance across candidate experiences.

Those conversations contain important traces about individuals' health risks. Recently, researchers have exploited this online information to construct mental health detection models, which aim to identify users at risk on platforms like Twitter, Reddit or Facebook. Most of these models are centred on achieving good classification results, ignoring the explainability and interpretability of the decisions. Recent research has pointed out the importance of using clinical markers, such as the use of symptoms, to improve trust in the computational models by health professionals. In this paper, we propose using transformer-based architectures to detect and explain the appearance of depressive symptom markers in the users' writings. We present two approaches: $i)$ train a model to classify, and another one to explain the classifier's decision separately and $ii)$ unify the two tasks simultaneously using a single model. Additionally, for this latter manner, we also investigated the performance of recent conversational LLMs when using in-context learning. Our natural language explanations enable clinicians to interpret the models' decisions based on validated symptoms, enhancing trust in the automated process. We evaluate our approach using recent symptom-based datasets, employing both offline and expert-in-the-loop metrics to assess the quality of the explanations generated by our models. The experimental results show that it is possible to achieve good classification results while generating interpretable symptom-based explanations. ",

In addition, the property of programming language code being precisely evaluable with respect to its semantics -- through the use of Unit Tests to check its functional correctness -- lends itself to using Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a further training paradigm. Previous work has shown that RL can be applied as such to improve models' coding capabilities; however, such RL-based methods rely on a reward signal based on defined Unit Tests, which are much harder to obtain compared to the huge crawled code datasets used in LM objectives. In this work, we present a novel approach to automatically obtain data consisting of function signatures and associated Unit Tests, suitable for RL training of Code Synthesis models. We also introduce a straightforward, simple yet effective Actor-Critic RL training scheme and show that it, in conjunction with automatically generated training data, leads to improvement of a pre-trained code language model's performance by up to 9.9% improvement over the original underlying code synthesis LM, and up to 4.3% over RL-based models trained with standard PPO or CodeRL.

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis has recently made significant progress with the advent of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). DietNeRF is an extension of NeRF that aims to achieve this task from only a few images by introducing a new loss function for unknown viewpoints with no input images. The loss function assumes that a pre-trained feature extractor should output the same feature even if input images are captured at different viewpoints since the images contain the same object. However, while that assumption is ideal, in reality, it is known that as viewpoints continuously change, also feature vectors continuously change. Thus, the assumption can harm training. To avoid this harmful training, we propose ManifoldNeRF, a method for supervising feature vectors at unknown viewpoints using interpolated features from neighboring known viewpoints. Since the method provides appropriate supervision for each unknown viewpoint by the interpolated features, the volume representation is learned better than DietNeRF. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than others in a complex scene. We also experimented with several subsets of viewpoints from a set of viewpoints and identified an effective set of viewpoints for real environments. This provided a basic policy of viewpoint patterns for real-world application. The code is available at https://github.com/haganelego/ManifoldNeRF_BMVC2023 ",

This entails dependence on labeled response data from drugs for model training. However, practical applications in the preclinical drug screening phase demand that DRP models predict responses for novel compounds, often with unknown drug responses. This presents a challenge, rendering supervised deep learning methods unsuitable for such scenarios. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot learning solution for the DRP task in preclinical drug screening. Specifically, we propose a Multi-branch Multi-Source Domain Adaptation Test Enhancement Plug-in, called MSDA. MSDA can be seamlessly integrated with conventional DRP methods, learning invariant features from the prior response data of similar drugs to enhance real-time predictions of unlabeled compounds. We conducted experiments using the GDSCv2 and CellMiner datasets. The results demonstrate that MSDA efficiently predicts drug responses for novel compounds, leading to a general performance improvement of 5-10\\% in the preclinical drug screening phase. The significance of this solution resides in its potential to accelerate the drug discovery process, improve drug candidate assessment, and facilitate the success of drug discovery. ",

We found that standard SSL methods thoughtfully applied to histopathology images are performant across our benchmark tasks and that domain-specific methodological improvements can further increase performance. Our findings reinforce the value of using domain-specific SSL methods in pathology, and establish a set of high quality foundation models to enable further research across diverse applications. ",

Because causal discovery without further assumptions is an ill-posed problem, each algorithm comes with its own set of usually untestable assumptions, some of which are hard to meet in real datasets. Motivated by these considerations, this paper extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of recent causal discovery methods on observational i.i.d. data generated under different background conditions, allowing for violations of the critical assumptions required by each selected approach. Our experimental findings show that score matching-based methods demonstrate surprising performance in the false positive and false negative rate of the inferred graph in these challenging scenarios, and we provide theoretical insights into their performance. This work is also the first effort to benchmark the stability of causal discovery algorithms with respect to the values of their hyperparameters. Finally, we hope this paper will set a new standard for the evaluation of causal discovery methods and can serve as an accessible entry point for practitioners interested in the field, highlighting the empirical implications of different algorithm choices.

We propose to include a calibration term directly into the training objective of the neural model in selected amortized SBI techniques. By introducing a relaxation of the classical formulation of calibration error we enable end-to-end backpropagation. The proposed method is not tied to any particular neural model and brings moderate computational overhead compared to the profits it introduces.

There exists a need for adaptively correcting the estimation error committed by such methods using a few data point samples from the subject's HRTF, acquired using acoustic measurements or perceptual feedback. To this end, we introduce a Convolutional Conditional Neural Process meta-learner specialized in HRTF error interpolation. In particular, the model includes a Spherical Convolutional Neural Network component to accommodate the spherical geometry of HRTF data. It also exploits potential symmetries between the HRTF's left and right channels about the median axis. In this work, we evaluate the proposed model's performance purely on time-aligned spectrum interpolation grounds under a simplified setup where a generic population-mean HRTF forms the initial estimates prior to corrections instead of individualized ones. The trained model achieves up to 3 dB relative error reduction compared to state-of-the-art interpolation methods despite being trained using only 85 subjects. This improvement translates up to nearly a halving of the data point count required to achieve comparable accuracy, in particular from 50 to 28 points to reach an average of -20 dB relative error per interpolated feature. Moreover, we show that the trained model provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Accordingly, such estimates can inform the sequential decision problem of acquiring as few correcting HRTF data points as needed to meet a desired level of HRTF individualization accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Domain shift poses a significant challenge in cross-domain spoken language recognition (SLR) by reducing its effectiveness. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) algorithms have been explored to address domain shifts in SLR without relying on class labels in the target domain. One successful UDA approach focuses on learning domain-invariant representations to align feature distributions between domains. However, disregarding the class structure during the learning process of domain-invariant representations can result in over-alignment, negatively impacting the classification task. To overcome this limitation, we propose an optimal transport (OT)-based UDA algorithm for a cross-domain SLR, leveraging the distribution geometry structure-aware property of OT. An OT-based discrepancy measure on a joint distribution over feature and label information is considered during domain alignment in OT-based UDA. Our previous study discovered that completely aligning the distributions between the source and target domains can introduce a negative transfer, where classes or irrelevant classes from the source domain map to a different class in the target domain during distribution alignment. This negative transfer degrades the performance of the adaptive model. To mitigate this issue, we introduce coupling-weighted partial optimal transport (POT) within our UDA framework for SLR, where soft weighting on the OT coupling based on transport cost is adaptively set during domain alignment. A cross-domain SLR task was used in the experiments to evaluate the proposed UDA. The results demonstrated that our proposed UDA algorithm significantly improved the performance over existing UDA algorithms in a cross-channel SLR task. ",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations are considered to be brain-specific signatures of information processing and communication in the brain. They also reflect pathological brain activity in neurological disorders, thus offering a basis for diagnoses and forecasting. Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, characterized by abnormal synchronization and desynchronization of the oscillations in the brain. About one third of epilepsy cases are pharmacoresistant, and as such emphasize the need for novel therapy approaches, where brain stimulation appears to be a promising therapeutic option. The development of brain stimulation paradigms, however, is often based on generalized assumptions about brain dynamics, although it is known that significant differences occur between patients and brain states. We developed a framework to extract individualized predictive models of epileptic network dynamics directly from EEG data. The models are based on the dominant coherent oscillations and their dynamical coupling, thus combining an established interpretation of dynamics through neural oscillations, with accurate patient-specific features. We show that it is possible to build a direct correspondence between the models of brain-network dynamics under periodic driving, and the mechanism of neural entrainment via periodic stimulation. When our framework is applied to EEG recordings of patients in status epilepticus (a brain state of perpetual seizure activity), it yields a model-driven predictive analysis of the therapeutic performance of periodic brain stimulation. This suggests that periodic brain stimulation can drive pathological states of epileptic network dynamics towards a healthy functional brain state. ",

    "abstract": "To promote the generalization ability of breast tumor segmentation models, as well as to improve the segmentation performance for breast tumors with smaller size, low-contrast amd irregular shape, we propose a progressive dual priori network (PDPNet) to segment breast tumors from dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRI) acquired at different sites. The PDPNet first cropped tumor regions with a coarse-segmentation based localization module, then the breast tumor mask was progressively refined by using the weak semantic priori and cross-scale correlation prior knowledge. To validate the effectiveness of PDPNet, we compared it with several state-of-the-art methods on multi-center datasets. The results showed that, comparing against the suboptimal method, the DSC, SEN, KAPPA and HD95 of PDPNet were improved 3.63\\%, 8.19\\%, 5.52\\%, and 3.66\\% respectively. In addition, through ablations, we demonstrated that the proposed localization module can decrease the influence of normal tissues and therefore improve the generalization ability of the model. The weak semantic priors allow focusing on tumor regions to avoid missing small tumors and low-contrast tumors. The cross-scale correlation priors are beneficial for promoting the shape-aware ability for irregual tumors. Thus integrating them in a unified framework improved the multi-center breast tumor segmentation performance. ",

    "title": "Skin Lesion Segmentation Improved by Transformer-based Networks with  Inter-scale Dependency Modeling",
    "abstract": "Melanoma, a dangerous type of skin cancer resulting from abnormal skin cell growth, can be treated if detected early. Various approaches using Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) have been proposed, with the U-Net architecture being prominent To aid in its diagnosis through automatic skin lesion segmentation. However, the symmetrical U-Net model's reliance on convolutional operations hinders its ability to capture long-range dependencies crucial for accurate medical image segmentation. Several Transformer-based U-Net topologies have recently been created to overcome this limitation by replacing CNN blocks with different Transformer modules to capture local and global representations. Furthermore, the U-shaped structure is hampered by semantic gaps between the encoder and decoder. This study intends to increase the network's feature re-usability by carefully building the skip connection path. Integrating an already calculated attention affinity within the skip connection path improves the typical concatenation process utilized in the conventional skip connection path. As a result, we propose a U-shaped hierarchical Transformer-based structure for skin lesion segmentation and an Inter-scale Context Fusion (ISCF) method that uses attention correlations in each stage of the encoder to adaptively combine the contexts from each stage to mitigate semantic gaps. The findings from two skin lesion segmentation benchmarks support the ISCF module's applicability and effectiveness.

Recently, the arena where the Cops and Robber game is played has been extended from a graph to a periodic graph; in this case, the copnumber is also the minimum number of cops sufficient for capturing the robber. We study the connections and distinctions between the copnumber $c(\\mathcal{G})$ of a periodic graph $\\mathcal{G}$ and the copnumber $c(G)$ of its footprint $G$ and establish several facts. For instance, we show that the smallest periodic graph with $c(\\mathcal{G}) = 3$ has at most $8$ nodes; in contrast, the smallest graph $G$ with $c(G) = 3$ has $10$ nodes. We push this investigation by generating multiple examples showing how the copnumbers of a periodic graph $\\mathcal{G}$, the subgraphs $G_i$ and its footprint $G$ can be loosely tied. Based on these results, we derive upper bounds on the copnumber of a periodic graph from properties of its footprint such as its treewidth. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum networks serve as the means to transmit information, encoded in quantum bits or qubits, between quantum processors that are physically separated. Given the instability of qubits, the design of such networks is challenging, necessitating a careful balance between reliability and efficiency. Typically, quantum networks fall into two categories: those utilize quantum entanglements for quantum teleportation, and those directly transfer quantum message. In this paper, we present SurfaceNet, a quantum network in the second category that employs surface codes as logical qubits for preserving and transferring message. Our approach of using surface codes can fault-tolerantly correct both operational and photon loss errors within the network. We propose a novel one-way quantum communication procedure, designed to better integrate surface codes into our network architecture. We also propose an efficient routing protocol that optimizes resource utilization for our communication procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that SurfaceNet significantly enhances the overall communication fidelity. ",

    "abstract": "To succeed in their objectives, groups of individuals must be able to make quick and accurate collective decisions on the best among alternatives with different qualities. Group-living animals aim to do that all the time. Plants and fungi are thought to do so too. Swarms of autonomous robots can also be programmed to make best-of-n decisions for solving tasks collaboratively. Ultimately, humans critically need it and so many times they should be better at it! Despite their simplicity, mathematical tractability made models like the voter model (VM) and the local majority rule model (MR) useful to describe in simple terms such collective decision-making processes. To reach a consensus, individuals change their opinion by interacting with neighbours in their social network. At least among animals and robots, options with a better quality are exchanged more often and therefore spread faster than lower-quality options, leading to the collective selection of the best option. With our work, we study the impact of individuals making errors in pooling others' opinions caused, for example, to reduce the cognitive load. Our analysis in grounded on the introduction of a model that generalises the two existing VM and MR models, showing a speed-accuracy trade-off regulated by the cognitive effort of individuals. We also investigate the impact of the interaction network topology on the collective dynamics. To do so, we extend our model and, by using the heterogeneous mean-field approach, we show that another speed-accuracy trade-off is regulated by network connectivity. An interesting result is that reduced network connectivity corresponds to an increase in collective decision accuracy ",
