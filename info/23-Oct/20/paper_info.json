    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable merit in performing various learning-based tasks in complex networks. The superior performance of GNNs often correlates with the availability and quality of node-level features in the input networks. However, for many network applications, such node-level information may be missing or unreliable, thereby limiting the applicability and efficacy of GNNs. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach denoted as Ego-centric Spectral subGraph Embedding Augmentation (ESGEA), which aims to enhance and design node features, particularly in scenarios where information is lacking. Our method leverages the topological structure of the local subgraph to create topology-aware node features. The subgraph features are generated using an efficient spectral graph embedding technique, and they serve as node features that capture the local topological organization of the network. The explicit node features, if present, are then enhanced with the subgraph embeddings in order to improve the overall performance. ESGEA is compatible with any GNN-based architecture and is effective even in the absence of node features. We evaluate the proposed method in a social network graph classification task where node attributes are unavailable, as well as in a node classification task where node features are corrupted or even absent. The evaluation results on seven datasets and eight baseline models indicate up to a 10% improvement in AUC and a 7% improvement in accuracy for graph and node classification tasks, respectively. ",

The shared task comprises two classification subtasks - (1) Subtask-A: Argument Stance Classification; (2) Subtask-B: Image Persuasiveness Classification. The former determines the stance of a tweet containing an image and a piece of text toward a controversial topic (e.g., gun control and abortion). The latter determines whether the image makes the tweet text more persuasive. The shared task received 31 submissions for Subtask-A and 21 submissions for Subtask-B from 9 different teams across 6 countries.

    "abstract": "Evaluating node influence is fundamental for identifying key nodes in complex networks. Existing methods typically rely on generic indicators to rank node influence across diverse networks, thereby ignoring the individualized features of each network itself. Actually, node influence stems not only from general features but the multi-scale individualized information encompassing specific network structure and task. Here we design an active learning architecture to predict node influence quantitively and precisely, which samples representative nodes based on graph entropy correlation matrix integrating multi-scale individualized information. This brings two intuitive advantages: (1) discovering potential high-influence but weak-connected nodes that are usually ignored in existing methods, (2) improving the influence maximization strategy by deducing influence interference. Significantly, our architecture demonstrates exceptional transfer learning capabilities across multiple types of networks, which can identify those key nodes with large disputation across different existing methods. Additionally, our approach, combined with a simple greedy algorithm, exhibits dominant performance in solving the influence maximization problem. This architecture holds great potential for applications in graph mining and prediction tasks. ",

Task-level Mixture of expert models (Task-level MoE), an inference-efficient variation of Transformer-based models, has shown promising NMT performance for a large number of language pairs. In Task-level MoE, different language groups can use different routing strategies to optimize cross-lingual learning and inference speed. In this work, we examine Task-level MoE's applicability in direct NMT and propose a series of high-performing training and evaluation configurations, through which Task-level MoE-based direct NMT systems outperform bilingual and pivot-based models for a large number of low and high-resource direct pairs, and translation directions. Our Task-level MoE with 16 experts outperforms bilingual NMT, Pivot NMT models for 7 language pairs, while pivot-based models still performed better in 9 pairs and directions. ",

This is challenging because the large variety of objects within a class makes it difficult to infer the task-relevant relationship between the new objects and the objects in the demonstrations. We address this by formulating imitation learning as a conditional alignment problem between graph representations of objects. Consequently, we show that this conditioning allows for in-context learning, where a robot can perform a task on a set of new objects immediately after the demonstrations, without any prior knowledge about the object class or any further training. In our experiments, we explore and validate our design choices, and we show that our method is highly effective for few-shot learning of several real-world, everyday tasks, whilst outperforming baselines.

Generating these adversarial objects in the digital space has been extensively studied, however successfully transferring these attacks from the digital realm to the physical realm has proven challenging when controlling for real-world environmental factors. In response to these limitations, we introduce REVAMP, an easy-to-use Python library that is the first-of-its-kind tool for creating attack scenarios with arbitrary objects and simulating realistic environmental factors, lighting, reflection, and refraction. REVAMP enables researchers and practitioners to swiftly explore various scenarios within the digital realm by offering a wide range of configurable options for designing experiments and using differentiable rendering to reproduce physically plausible adversarial objects. We will demonstrate and invite the audience to try REVAMP to produce an adversarial texture on a chosen object while having control over various scene parameters. The audience will choose a scene, an object to attack, the desired attack class, and the number of camera positions to use. Then, in real time, we show how this altered texture causes the chosen object to be mis-classified, showcasing the potential of REVAMP in real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "The link transmission model (LTM) is an efficient and widely used macro-level approach for simulating traffic flow. However, the state-of-the-art LTMs usually focused on segment-level modelling, in which the traffic operation differences among multiple turning directions are neglected. Such models are incapable of differentiating the turn-level queue transmission, resulting in underrepresented queue spillbacks and misidentification of bottlenecks. Moreover, a constant free-flow speed is usually assumed to formulate LTMs, restricting their applications to model dynamic traffic management strategies involving variable speed limits (VSL) and connected and automated vehicles. This study proposed an extended LTM with VSL and turn-level queue transmission to capture the traffic flow propagation at signalized intersections. First, each road segment (RS) with multiple turning directions is divided into many free-flow and queueing parts characterized by the triangular fundamental diagrams. Then, the vehicle propagation within the link is described by the turn-level link inflow, queue inflow, and outflow, which depends on the free-flow speed changes. A node model involving an iterative procedure is further defined to capture the potential queue spillback, which estimates the actual flow propagation between the adjacent RSs. Simulated and field data were used to verify the proposed model performance. Results reveal that the proposed LTM predict traffic operations of complex intersections with multiple turning movements, VSL and signal control schemes, and enables an accurate yet computationally tractable representation of flow propagation.

    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of \"smart\" electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) will be a key step toward achieving green transportation. The connectivity features of smart EVCSs can be utilized to schedule EV charging operations while respecting user preferences, thus avoiding synchronous charging from a large number of customers and relieving grid congestion. However, the communication and connectivity requirements involved in smart charging raise cybersecurity concerns. In this work, we investigate charge manipulation attacks (CMAs) against EV charging, in which an attacker manipulates the information exchanged during smart charging operations. The objective of CMAs is to shift the EV aggregator's demand across different times of the day. The proposed CMAs can bypass existing protection mechanisms in EV communication protocols. We quantify the impact of CMAs on the EV aggregator's economic profit by modeling their participation in the day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) electricity markets. Finally, we propose an unsupervised deep learning-based mechanism to detect CMAs by monitoring the parameters involved in EV charging. We extensively analyze the attack impact and the efficiency of the proposed detection on real-world EV charging datasets. The results highlight the vulnerabilities of smart charging operations and the need for a monitoring mechanism to detect malicious CMAs. ",

We consider both the classical setting with elementary operations of arity $2$ and the generalized setting with operations of arity $k$, where $k$ is a parameter. For both problems and both settings, there are various constructions known, the minimal known depth being logarithmic. However, there is currently no known construction that simultaneously achieves sub-log-squared depth, effective constructability, simplicity, and has a potential to be used in practice. In this paper we make progress towards resolution of this problem. For computing majority by standard monotone circuits (gates of arity 2) we provide an explicit monotone circuit of depth $O(\\log_2^{5/3} n)$. The construction is a combination of several known and not too complicated ideas. For arbitrary arity of gates $k$ we provide a new sorting network architecture inspired by representation of inputs as a high-dimensional cube. As a result we provide a simple construction that improves previous upper bound of $4 \\log_k^2 n$ to $2 \\log_k^2 n$. We prove the similar bound for the depth of the circuit computing majority of $n$ bits consisting of gates computing majority of $k$ bits. Note, that for both problems there is an explicit construction of depth $O(\\log_k n)$ known, but the construction is complicated and the constant hidden in $O$-notation is huge. ",

Automated assessment tasks like grade and early dropout predictions are necessary due to the high enrollment and limited direct interaction between teachers and learners. However, current automated assessment approaches overlook the structural links between different entities involved in the downstream tasks, such as the students and courses. Our hypothesis suggests that these structural relationships, manifested through an interaction graph, contain valuable information that can enhance the performance of the task at hand. To validate this, we construct a unique knowledge graph for a large MOOC dataset, which will be publicly available to the research community. Furthermore, we utilize graph embedding techniques to extract latent structural information encoded in the interactions between entities in the dataset. These techniques do not require ground truth labels and can be utilized for various tasks. Finally, by combining entity-specific features, behavioral features, and extracted structural features, we enhance the performance of predictive machine learning models in student assignment grade prediction.

Second, prior JIT-SDP studies do not consider that class balancing processing may change the underlying characteristics of software changeset data. Third, only a single source of concept drift, the class imbalance evolution is addressed in prior JIT-SDP incremental learning models. We propose an incremental learning framework called CPI-JIT for JIT-SDP. First, in addition to a classification modeling component, the framework includes a time-series forecast modeling component in order to learn temporal interdependent relationship in the changesets. Second, the framework features a purposefully designed over-sampling balancing technique based on SMOTE and Principal Curves called SMOTE-PC. SMOTE-PC preserves the underlying distribution of software changeset data. In this framework, we propose an incremental deep neural network model called DeepICP. Via an evaluation using \\numprojs software projects, we show that: 1) SMOTE-PC improves the model's predictive performance; 2) to some software projects it can be beneficial for defect prediction to harness temporal interdependent relationship of software changesets; and 3) principal curves summarize the underlying distribution of changeset data and reveals a new source of concept drift that the DeepICP model is proposed to adapt to.

This paper is the first attempt in providing a novel approach for the open-set TSAD problem, in which a small number of labeled anomalies from a limited class of anomalies are visible in the training phase, with the objective of detecting both seen and unseen anomaly classes in the test phase.

Fortunately, blockchain-based games offer a solution to the transparency and fairness issue regarding randomness. Furthermore, emerging blockchain technology like Sui Network enhances the efficiency of smart contracts by eliminating traditional web3 barriers, such as inefficiencies and expensive transaction fees. This unlocks the potential for extensive decentralized gaming applications. This paper aims to provide insights into designing a fair, verifiable, and efficient smart contract game on blockchain by the example of building raffles on the Sui Network. We explore efficient methods for implementing randomness on smart contracts, including DRAND committee-based decentralized random beacons and single private-key-based verifiable random functions (VRF). Then, progress from basic to comprehensive smart contract design. We addressed limitations in developing blockchain games in general, such as data input and storage space constraints. We propose corresponding solutions, encompassing the utilization of Object Tables, Delegate Object Creation, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to optimize storage and input efficiency. After testing our designs, we found that the transaction fees for DRAND beacons and private-key-based VRFs are similar. Moreover, Object Tables incur higher overall transaction fees, while the ZKP setup fee is cheap but becomes very expensive during the verification process. Moreover, we identified suitable designs for different application scenarios by comparing the pros and cons of different smart contract implementations.

The societal integration of UAS is a pivotal challenge, as these systems must operate harmoniously within the constraints imposed by regulations and societal concerns. In complex urban environments, UAS safety has been a perennial obstacle to their large-scale deployment. To mitigate UAS safety risk and facilitate risk-aware UAS operations planning, we propose a novel concept called \\textit{3D virtual risk terrain}. This concept converts public risk constraints in an urban environment into 3D exclusion zones that UAS operations should avoid to adequately reduce risk to Entities of Value (EoV). To implement the 3D virtual risk terrain, we develop a conditional probability framework that comprehensively integrates most existing basic models for UAS ground risk. To demonstrate the concept, we build risk terrains on a Chicago downtown model and observe their characteristics under different conditions. We believe that the 3D virtual risk terrain has the potential to become a new routine tool for risk-aware UAS operations planning, urban airspace management, and policy development. The same idea can also be extended to other forms of societal impacts, such as noise, privacy, and perceived risk. ",

    "title": "Equipping Federated Graph Neural Networks with Structure-aware Group  Fairness",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various types of graph data processing and analytical tasks in different domains. Training GNNs over centralized graph data can be infeasible due to privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions. Thus, federated learning (FL) becomes a trending solution to address this challenge in a distributed learning paradigm. However, as GNNs may inherit historical bias from training data and lead to discriminatory predictions, the bias of local models can be easily propagated to the global model in distributed settings. This poses a new challenge in mitigating bias in federated GNNs. To address this challenge, we propose $\\text{F}^2$GNN, a Fair Federated Graph Neural Network, that enhances group fairness of federated GNNs. As bias can be sourced from both data and learning algorithms, $\\text{F}^2$GNN aims to mitigate both types of bias under federated settings. First, we provide theoretical insights on the connection between data bias in a training graph and statistical fairness metrics of the trained GNN models. Based on the theoretical analysis, we design $\\text{F}^2$GNN which contains two key components: a fairness-aware local model update scheme that enhances group fairness of the local models on the client side, and a fairness-weighted global model update scheme that takes both data bias and fairness metrics of local models into consideration in the aggregation process. We evaluate $\\text{F}^2$GNN empirically versus a number of baseline methods, and demonstrate that $\\text{F}^2$GNN outperforms these baselines in terms of both fairness and model accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Traffic state forecasting is crucial for traffic management and control strategies, as well as user- and system-level decision making in the transportation network. While traffic forecasting has been approached with a variety of techniques over the last couple of decades, most approaches simply rely on endogenous traffic variables for state prediction, despite the evidence that exogenous factors can significantly impact traffic conditions. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional spatio-temporal graph attention-based traffic prediction approach (M-STGAT), which predicts traffic based on past observations of speed, along with lane closure events, temperature, and visibility across the transportation network. The approach is based on a graph attention network architecture, which also learns based on the structure of the transportation network on which these variables are observed. Numerical experiments are performed using traffic speed and lane closure data from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Performance Measurement System (PeMS). The corresponding weather data were downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOOA) Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS). For comparison, the numerical experiments implement three alternative models which do not allow for the multi-dimensional input. The M-STGAT is shown to outperform the three alternative models, when performing tests using our primary data set for prediction with a 30-, 45-, and 60-minute prediction horizon, in terms of three error measures: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). However, the model's transferability can vary for different transfer data sets and this aspect may require further investigation. ",

Their capacity to comprehend and generate human-like code has spurred research into harnessing LLMs for code analysis purposes.

Synthesizing human-like content using LLMs necessitates vast computational resources and extensive datasets, encapsulating critical intellectual property (IP).

To address the challenges, REMARK-LLM proposes three new components: (i) a learning-based message encoding module to infuse binary signatures into LLM-generated texts; (ii) a reparameterization module to transform the dense distributions from the message encoding to the sparse distribution of the watermarked textual tokens; (iii) a decoding module dedicated for signature extraction; Furthermore, we introduce an optimized beam search algorithm to guarantee the coherence and consistency of the generated content. REMARK-LLM is rigorously trained to encourage the preservation of semantic integrity in watermarked content, while ensuring effective watermark retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple unseen datasets highlight REMARK-LLM proficiency and transferability in inserting 2 times more signature bits into the same texts when compared to prior art, all while maintaining semantic integrity.

A common strategy is to rely on knowledge graphs (KGs) such as ConceptNet, and to model the relation between two concepts as a set of paths. However, KGs are limited to a fixed set of relation types, and they are incomplete and often noisy. Another strategy is to distill relation embeddings from a fine-tuned language model. However, this is less suitable for words that are only indirectly related and it does not readily allow us to incorporate structured domain knowledge. In this paper, we aim to combine the best of both worlds. We model relations as paths but associate their edges with relation embeddings. The paths are obtained by first identifying suitable intermediate words and then selecting those words for which informative relation embeddings can be obtained. We empirically show that our proposed representations are useful for solving hard analogy questions. ",

    "abstract": "Significant computational resources are required to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) at a large scale, and the process is highly data-intensive. One of the most effective ways to reduce resource requirements is minibatch training coupled with graph sampling. GNNs have the unique property that items in a minibatch have overlapping data. However, the commonly implemented Independent Minibatching approach assigns each Processing Element (PE) its own minibatch to process, leading to duplicated computations and input data access across PEs. This amplifies the Neighborhood Explosion Phenomenon (NEP), which is the main bottleneck limiting scaling. To reduce the effects of NEP in the multi-PE setting, we propose a new approach called Cooperative Minibatching. Our approach capitalizes on the fact that the size of the sampled subgraph is a concave function of the batch size, leading to significant reductions in the amount of work per seed vertex as batch sizes increase. Hence, it is favorable for processors equipped with a fast interconnect to work on a large minibatch together as a single larger processor, instead of working on separate smaller minibatches, even though global batch size is identical. We also show how to take advantage of the same phenomenon in serial execution by generating dependent consecutive minibatches. Our experimental evaluations show up to 4x bandwidth savings for fetching vertex embeddings, by simply increasing this dependency without harming model convergence. Combining our proposed approaches, we achieve up to 64% speedup over Independent Minibatching on single-node multi-GPU systems. ",

Leveraging the range-Doppler spectra information, we identify the measurement classes, which serve as additional information to enhance clutter rejection and data association, thus bolstering the robustness of target tracking. We first introduce a novel neural enhanced message passing approach, where the beliefs obtained by the unified message passing are fed into the neural network as additional information. The output beliefs are then utilized to refine the original beliefs. Then, we propose a classification-aided robust multiple target tracking algorithm, employing the neural enhanced message passing technique. This algorithm is comprised of three modules: a message-passing module, a neural network module, and a Dempster-Shafer module. The message-passing module is used to represent the statistical model by the factor graph and infers target kinematic states, visibility states, and data associations based on the spatial measurement information. The neural network module is employed to extract features from range-Doppler spectra and derive beliefs on whether a measurement is target-generated or clutter-generated. The Dempster-Shafer module is used to fuse the beliefs obtained from both the factor graph and the neural network. As a result, our proposed algorithm adopts a model-and-data-driven framework, effectively enhancing clutter suppression and data association, leading to significant improvements in multiple target tracking performance. We validate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and real data scenarios, demonstrating its capability to handle challenging tracking scenarios in practical radar applications. ",

CAT aims to continuously improve the safety of driving agents by training the agent on safety-critical scenarios that are dynamically generated over time. A novel resampling technique is developed to turn log-replay real-world driving scenarios into safety-critical ones via probabilistic factorization, where the adversarial traffic generation is modeled as the multiplication of standard motion prediction sub-problems. Consequently, CAT can launch more efficient physical attacks compared to existing safety-critical scenario generation methods and yields a significantly less computational cost in the iterative learning pipeline. We incorporate CAT into the MetaDrive simulator and validate our approach on hundreds of driving scenarios imported from real-world driving datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CAT can effectively generate adversarial scenarios countering the agent being trained. After training, the agent can achieve superior driving safety in both log-replay and safety-critical traffic scenarios on the held-out test set.

    "abstract": "Medical time series data are indispensable in healthcare, providing critical insights for disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management. The exponential growth in data complexity, driven by advanced sensor technologies, has presented challenges related to data labeling. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a transformative approach to address these challenges, eliminating the need for extensive human annotation. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for Medical Time Series Representation Learning, known as MTS-LOF. MTS-LOF leverages the strengths of contrastive learning and Masked Autoencoder (MAE) methods, offering a unique approach to representation learning for medical time series data. By combining these techniques, MTS-LOF enhances the potential of healthcare applications by providing more sophisticated, context-rich representations. Additionally, MTS-LOF employs a multi-masking strategy to facilitate occlusion-invariant feature learning. This approach allows the model to create multiple views of the data by masking portions of it. By minimizing the discrepancy between the representations of these masked patches and the fully visible patches, MTS-LOF learns to capture rich contextual information within medical time series datasets. The results of experiments conducted on diverse medical time series datasets demonstrate the superiority of MTS-LOF over other methods. These findings hold promise for significantly enhancing healthcare applications by improving representation learning. Furthermore, our work delves into the integration of joint-embedding SSL and MAE techniques, shedding light on the intricate interplay between temporal and structural dependencies in healthcare data.

Specifically, this paper presents AutoDebug, an LLM-based framework to use prompting chaining to generate transferable adversarial attacks in the form of question-answering examples. We seek to understand the extent to which these examples trigger the hallucination behaviors of LLMs. We implement AutoDebug using ChatGPT and evaluate the resulting two variants of a popular open-domain question-answering dataset, Natural Questions (NQ), on a collection of open-source and proprietary LLMs under various prompting settings. Our generated evaluation data is human-readable and, as we show, humans can answer these modified questions well. Nevertheless, we observe pronounced accuracy drops across multiple LLMs including GPT-4. Our experimental results show that LLMs are likely to hallucinate in two categories of question-answering scenarios where (1) there are conflicts between knowledge given in the prompt and their parametric knowledge, or (2) the knowledge expressed in the prompt is complex. Finally, we find that the adversarial examples generated by our method are transferable across all considered LLMs. The examples generated by a small model can be used to debug a much larger model, making our approach cost-effective.

    "abstract": "The generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools based on Large Language Models (LLMs) use billions of parameters to extensively analyse large datasets and extract critical private information such as, context, specific details, identifying information etc. This have raised serious threats to user privacy and reluctance to use such tools. This article proposes the conceptual model called PrivChatGPT, a privacy-preserving model for LLMs that consists of two main components i.e., preserving user privacy during the data curation/pre-processing together with preserving private context and the private training process for large-scale data. To demonstrate its applicability, we show how a private mechanism could be integrated into the existing model for training LLMs to protect user privacy; specifically, we employed differential privacy and private training using Reinforcement Learning (RL). We measure the privacy loss and evaluate the measure of uncertainty or randomness once differential privacy is applied. It further recursively evaluates the level of privacy guarantees and the measure of uncertainty of public database and resources, during each update when new information is added for training purposes. To critically evaluate the use of differential privacy for private LLMs, we hypothetically compared other mechanisms e..g, Blockchain, private information retrieval, randomisation, for various performance measures such as the model performance and accuracy, computational complexity, privacy vs. utility etc. We conclude that differential privacy, randomisation, and obfuscation can impact utility and performance of trained models, conversely, the use of ToR, Blockchain, and PIR may introduce additional computational complexity and high training latency. We believe that the proposed model could be used as a benchmark for proposing privacy preserving LLMs for generative AI tools. ",

    "abstract": "Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are major methods for solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). Many MOEAs have been proposed in the past decades, of which the operators need carefully handcrafted design with domain knowledge. Recently, some attempts have been made to replace the manually designed operators in MOEAs with learning-based operators (e.g., neural network models). However, much effort is still required for designing and training such models, and the learned operators might not generalize well to solve new problems. To tackle the above challenges, this work investigates a novel approach that leverages the powerful large language model (LLM) to design MOEA operators. With proper prompt engineering, we successfully let a general LLM serve as a black-box search operator for decomposition-based MOEA (MOEA/D) in a zero-shot manner. In addition, by learning from the LLM behavior, we further design an explicit white-box operator with randomness and propose a new version of decomposition-based MOEA, termed MOEA/D-LO. Experimental studies on different test benchmarks show that our proposed method can achieve competitive performance with widely used MOEAs. It is also promising to see the operator only learned from a few instances can have robust generalization performance on unseen problems with quite different patterns and settings. The results reveal the potential benefits of using pre-trained LLMs in the design of MOEAs. ",

To cope with these challenges, we propose a novel \\textbf{Dep}th-\\textbf{Wi}se \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{N}etwork (\\textbf{DepWiGNN}).

The comparisons with the other three GNNs further demonstrate its superiority in capturing long dependency in the graph. ",

Crucially, we suggest performing new class detection by combining OOD detection methods with information aggregated from the graph neighborhood. Most OOD detection methods avoid determining a crisp threshold for deciding whether a vertex is OOD. To tackle this problem, we propose a Weakly-supervised Relevance Feedback (Open-WRF) method, which decreases the sensitivity to thresholds in OOD detection. We evaluate our approach on six benchmark datasets. Our results show that the proposed neighborhood aggregation method for OOD scores outperforms existing methods independent of the underlying graph neural network. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our Open-WRF method is more robust to threshold selection and analyze the influence of graph neighborhood on OOD detection. The aggregation and threshold methods are compatible with arbitrary graph neural networks and OOD detection methods, making our approach versatile and applicable to many real-world applications. ",

Current pretraining tasks for Language Models (LMs) primarily focus on separately learning the textual information of each entity and overlook the crucial aspect of capturing topological connections among entities in TAHGs. In this paper, we present a new pretraining framework for LMs that explicitly considers the topological and heterogeneous information in TAHGs. Firstly, we define a context graph as neighborhoods of a target node within specific orders and propose a topology-aware pretraining task to predict nodes involved in the context graph by jointly optimizing an LM and an auxiliary heterogeneous graph neural network. Secondly, based on the observation that some nodes are text-rich while others have little text, we devise a text augmentation strategy to enrich textless nodes with their neighbors' texts for handling the imbalance issue. We conduct link prediction and node classification tasks on three datasets from various domains.

A recent research shows that the empirical risk minimization~(ERM) over deep artificial neural networks overcomes the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of linear Kolmogorov PDEs with bounded initial functions.

In this paper, we extend this result to the cases involving unbounded initial functions. We prove that for $d$-dimensional linear Kolmogorov PDEs with unbounded initial functions, under suitable assumptions, the number of training data and the size of the artificial neural network required to achieve an accuracy $\\varepsilon$ for the ERM grow polynomially in both $d$ and $\\varepsilon^{-1}$.

Common approaches for learning supervised models with heterogeneous datasets include learning a global model for the entire dataset, learning local models for each tasks' data, or utilising hierarchical, meta-learning and multi-task learning approaches to learn how to generalise from data pooled across multiple tasks. In this paper we propose causal similarity-based hierarchical Bayesian models to improve generalisation to new tasks by learning how to pool data from training tasks with similar causal mechanisms. We apply this general modelling principle to Bayesian neural networks and compare a variety of methods for estimating causal task similarity (for both known and unknown causal models).

Among byzantine agreement tasks, firing rebels with relay is of particular interest, since it is a basic primitive necessary for solving more complex tasks such as Consistent Broadcast. The epistemic logic approach has yielded both necessary conditions and sufficient knowledge conditions for solving firing rebels with relay. However, these conditions are stated in terms of knowledge and in principle do not explore the conditions on the communication structure which is often assumed to be complete. That is, any process is assumed to be capable of communicating with any other process at any time. In this paper, we characterize byzantine firing rebels solvability with and without relay in terms of the communication structure of the system. We define a relation between asynchronous message schedules and directed graph sequences, which we call network abstractions. This allows us to capture the message relay capabilities of the system into a combinatorial object. Although there are some similarities between network abstractions and causal cones, there is a fundamental difference. Namely, causal cones allow only to look at events in the past, while network abstractions allow us to reason about future possibilities. Thus enabling us to reason about liveness properties, which can not be expressed by looking only at past events. Furthermore, we formalize our characterization by using a temporal epistemic logic for byzantine systems. Such formulation constitutes the necessary and sufficient a-priori knowledge regarding network connectivity for solving firing rebels with relay. ",

This investment raises several key questions: Will multi-cloud always be more beneficial to the cloud users? How will this impact the cloud providers? Is it possible to create a multi-cloud market that is beneficial to all participants? In this work, we begin addressing these questions by using the game theoretic model of trading networks and formally compare between the single and multi-cloud markets. This comparson a) provides a sufficient condition under which the multi-cloud network can be considered more efficient than the single cloud one in the sense that a centralized coordinator having full information can impose an outcome that is strongly Pareto-dominant for all players and b) shows a surprising result that without centralized coordination, settings are possible in which even the cloud buyers' utilities may decrease when moving from a single cloud to a multi-cloud network. As these two results emphasize the need for centralized coordination to ensure a Pareto-dominant outcome and as the aforementioned Pareto-dominant result requires truthful revelation of participant's private information, we provide an automated mechanism design (AMD) approach, which, in the Bayesian setting, finds mechanisms which result in expectation in such Pareto-dominant outcomes, and in which truthful revelation of the parties' private information is the dominant strategy. We also provide empirical analysis to show the validity of our AMD approach. ",

Our CANNs combine a baseline prediction established with a GLM and GBM, respectively, with a neural network correction. We explain the data preprocessing steps with specific focus on the multiple types of input features typically present in tabular insurance data sets, such as postal codes, numeric and categorical covariates. Autoencoders are used to embed the categorical variables into the neural network and we explore their potential advantages in a frequency-severity setting. Finally, we construct global surrogate models for the neural nets' frequency and severity models. These surrogates enable the translation of the essential insights captured by the FFNNs or CANNs to GLMs. As such, a technical tariff table results that can easily be deployed in practice. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic methods for early detection of breast cancer on mammography can significantly decrease mortality. Broad uptake of those methods in hospitals is currently hindered because the methods have too many constraints. They assume annotations available for single images or even regions-of-interest (ROIs), and a fixed number of images per patient. Both assumptions do not hold in a general hospital setting. Relaxing those assumptions results in a weakly supervised learning setting, where labels are available per case, but not for individual images or ROIs. Not all images taken for a patient contain malignant regions and the malignant ROIs cover only a tiny part of an image, whereas most image regions represent benign tissue. In this work, we investigate a two-level multi-instance learning (MIL) approach for case-level breast cancer prediction on two public datasets (1.6k and 5k cases) and an in-house dataset of 21k cases. Observing that breast cancer is usually only present in one side, while images of both breasts are taken as a precaution, we propose a domain-specific MIL pooling variant. We show that two-level MIL can be applied in realistic clinical settings where only case labels, and a variable number of images per patient are available. Data in realistic settings scales with continuous patient intake, while manual annotation efforts do not. Hence, research should focus in particular on unsupervised ROI extraction, in order to improve breast cancer prediction for all patients. ",

Additionally, our method improves training stability and prevents collapsed solutions in joint-embedding training. Through an extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that CARP's representations are suitable for learning downstream tasks. We evaluate CARP's representations capabilities in 17 datasets across many standard protocols, including linear evaluation, few-shot classification, k-NN, k-means, image retrieval, and copy detection. We compare CARP performance to 11 existing self-supervised methods. We extensively ablate our method and demonstrate that our proposed random partition pretext task improves the quality of the learned representations by devising multiple random classification tasks.

We consider the complexity of solving $\\omega$-regular games played on temporal graphs where the edge availability is ultimately periodic and fixed a priori. We show that solving parity games on temporal graphs is decidable in PSPACE, only assuming the edge predicate itself is in PSPACE. A matching lower bound already holds for what we call punctual reachability games on static graphs, where one player wants to reach the target at a given, binary encoded, point in time. We further study syntactic restrictions that imply more efficient procedures. In particular, if the edge predicate is in $P$ and is monotonically increasing for one player and decreasing for the other, then the complexity of solving games is only polynomially increased compared to static graphs.

Current SFOD methods utilize a threshold-based pseudo-label approach in the adaptation phase, which is typically limited to high-confidence pseudo-labels and results in a loss of information. To address this issue, we propose a new approach to take full advantage of pseudo-labels by introducing high and low confidence thresholds. Specifically, the pseudo-labels with confidence scores above the high threshold are used conventionally, while those between the low and high thresholds are exploited using the Low-confidence Pseudo-labels Utilization (LPU) module. The LPU module consists of Proposal Soft Training (PST) and Local Spatial Contrastive Learning (LSCL). PST generates soft labels of proposals for soft training, which can mitigate the label mismatch problem. LSCL exploits the local spatial relationship of proposals to improve the model's ability to differentiate between spatially adjacent proposals, thereby optimizing representational features further. Combining the two components overcomes the challenges faced by traditional methods in utilizing low-confidence pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on five cross-domain object detection benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the previous SFOD methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. ",

In this study, we propose a novel privacypreserving image classification scheme that enables the direct application of classifiers trained in the plaintext domain to classify encrypted images, without the need of retraining a dedicated classifier. Moreover, encrypted images can be decrypted back into their original form with high fidelity (recoverable) using a secret key. Specifically, our proposed scheme involves utilizing a feature extractor and an encoder to mask the plaintext image through a newly designed Noise-like Adversarial Example (NAE). Such an NAE not only introduces a noise-like visual appearance to the encrypted image but also compels the target classifier to predict the ciphertext as the same label as the original plaintext image. At the decoding phase, we adopt a Symmetric Residual Learning (SRL) framework for restoring the plaintext image with minimal degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) the classification accuracy of the classifier trained in the plaintext domain remains the same in both the ciphertext and plaintext domains; 2) the encrypted images can be recovered into their original form with an average PSNR of up to 51+ dB for the SVHN dataset and 48+ dB for the VGGFace2 dataset; 3) our system exhibits satisfactory generalization capability on the encryption, decryption and classification tasks across datasets that are different from the training one; and 4) a high-level of security is achieved against three potential threat models.

Adversarial examples (AEs) deliberately designed to mislead deep neural networks (DNNs) are found to be fragile against the inevitable lossy operations conducted by OSNs. As a result, the AEs would lose their attack capabilities after being transmitted over OSNs. In this work, we aim to design a new framework for generating robust AEs that can survive the OSN transmission; namely, the AEs before and after the OSN transmission both possess strong attack capabilities. To this end, we first propose a differentiable network termed SImulated OSN (SIO) to simulate the various operations conducted by an OSN. Specifically, the SIO network consists of two modules: 1) a differentiable JPEG layer for approximating the ubiquitous JPEG compression and 2) an encoder-decoder subnetwork for mimicking the remaining operations. Based upon the SIO network, we then formulate an optimization framework to generate robust AEs by enforcing model outputs with and without passing through the SIO to be both misled. Extensive experiments conducted over Facebook, WeChat and QQ demonstrate that our attack methods produce more robust AEs than existing approaches, especially under small distortion constraints; the performance gain in terms of Attack Success Rate (ASR) could be more than 60%. Furthermore, we build a public dataset containing more than 10,000 pairs of AEs processed by Facebook, WeChat or QQ, facilitating future research in the robust AEs generation.

Entropy-loading digital subcarrier multiplexing (DSCM) is the core technology to achieve low latency and approach high capacity for flexible PtMP optical networks. However, the high peak-to-average power ratio of the entropy-loading DSCM signal limits the power budget and restricts the capacity, which can be reduced effectively by clipping operation. In this paper, we derive the theoretical capacity limitation of the flexible PtMP optical networks based on the entropy-loading DSCM signal. Meanwhile, an optimal clipping ratio for the clipping operation is acquired to approach the highest capacity limitation. Based on an accurate clipping-noise model under the optimal clipping ratio, we establish a three-dimensional look-up table for bit-error ratio, spectral efficiency, and link loss. Based on the three-dimensional look-up table, an optimization strategy is proposed to acquire optimal spectral efficiencies for achieving a higher capacity of the flexible PtMP optical networks. ",

    "abstract": "In light of the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial samples and the ensuing security issues, a range of methods, including Adversarial Training (AT) as a prominent representative, aimed at enhancing model robustness against various adversarial attacks, have seen rapid development. However, existing methods essentially assist the current state of target model to defend against parameter-oriented adversarial attacks with explicit or implicit computation burdens, which also suffers from unstable convergence behavior due to inconsistency of optimization trajectories. Diverging from previous work, this paper reconsiders the update rule of target model and corresponding deficiency to defend based on its current state. By introducing the historical state of the target model as a proxy, which is endowed with much prior information for defense, we formulate a two-stage update rule, resulting in a general adversarial defense framework, which we refer to as `LAST' ({\\bf L}earn from the P{\\bf ast}). Besides, we devise a Self Distillation (SD) based defense objective to constrain the update process of the proxy model without the introduction of larger teacher models. Experimentally, we demonstrate consistent and significant performance enhancements by refining a series of single-step and multi-step AT methods (e.g., up to $\\bf 9.2\\%$ and $\\bf 20.5\\%$ improvement of Robust Accuracy (RA) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, respectively) across various datasets, backbones and attack modalities, and validate its ability to enhance training stability and ameliorate catastrophic overfitting issues meanwhile.

The Lanczos filtering technique is used in the final stress and displacement solution to reduce the Gibbs phenomena caused by the constrained far-field ground surface for more accurte results. Several numerical cases are conducted to intensively verify the proposed solution by examining boundary conditions and comparing with existing solutions, and all the results are in good agreements.

However, developing and deploying crop phenotyping robots face many challenges such as complex and variable crop shapes that complicate robotic object detection, dynamic and unstructured environments that baffle robotic control, and real-time computing and managing big data that challenge robotic hardware/software. This work specifically tackles the first challenge by proposing a novel Digital-Twin(DT)MARS-CycleGAN model for image augmentation to improve our Modular Agricultural Robotic System (MARS)'s crop object detection from complex and variable backgrounds. Our core idea is that in addition to the cycle consistency losses in the CycleGAN model, we designed and enforced a new DT-MARS loss in the deep learning model to penalize the inconsistency between real crop images captured by MARS and synthesized images sensed by DT MARS. Therefore, the generated synthesized crop images closely mimic real images in terms of realism, and they are employed to fine-tune object detectors such as YOLOv8. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our new DT/MARS-CycleGAN framework significantly boosts our MARS' crop object/row detector's performance, contributing to the field of robotic crop phenotyping.

Benefiting from the prior knowledge illustrated by the seen anomalies, current OSAD methods can often largely reduce false positive errors. However, these methods treat the anomaly examples as from a homogeneous distribution, rendering them less effective in generalizing to unseen anomalies that can be drawn from any distribution. In this paper, we propose to learn heterogeneous anomaly distributions using the limited anomaly examples to address this issue. To this end, we introduce a novel approach, namely Anomaly Heterogeneity Learning (AHL), that simulates a diverse set of heterogeneous (seen and unseen) anomaly distributions and then utilizes them to learn a unified heterogeneous abnormality model. Further, AHL is a generic framework that existing OSAD models can plug and play for enhancing their abnormality modeling. Extensive experiments on nine real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AHL can 1) substantially enhance different state-of-the-art (SOTA) OSAD models in detecting both seen and unseen anomalies, achieving new SOTA performance on a large set of datasets, and 2) effectively generalize to unseen anomalies in new target domains.

    "abstract": "Existing works have made great progress in improving adversarial robustness, but typically test their method only on data from the same distribution as the training data, i.e. in-distribution (ID) testing. As a result, it is unclear how such robustness generalizes under input distribution shifts, i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) testing. This is a concerning omission as such distribution shifts are unavoidable when methods are deployed in the wild. To address this issue we propose a benchmark named OODRobustBench to comprehensively assess OOD adversarial robustness using 23 dataset-wise shifts (i.e. naturalistic shifts in input distribution) and 6 threat-wise shifts (i.e., unforeseen adversarial threat models). OODRobustBench is used to assess 706 robust models using 60.7K adversarial evaluations. This large-scale analysis shows that: 1) adversarial robustness suffers from a severe OOD generalization issue; 2) ID robustness correlates strongly with OOD robustness, in a positive linear way, under many distribution shifts. The latter enables the prediction of OOD robustness from ID robustness. Based on this, we are able to predict the upper limit of OOD robustness for existing robust training schemes. The results suggest that achieving OOD robustness requires designing novel methods beyond the conventional ones. Last, we discover that extra data, data augmentation, advanced model architectures and particular regularization approaches can improve OOD robustness. Noticeably, the discovered training schemes, compared to the baseline, exhibit dramatically higher robustness under threat shift while keeping high ID robustness, demonstrating new promising solutions for robustness against both multi-attack and unforeseen attacks.

This research paper centres on developing a graph neural network-based model to address the Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) problem, recognizing the intrinsic graph structure of judicial cases and making it a binary node classification problem.

    "abstract": "The cause-to-effect analysis can help us decompose all the likely causes of a problem, such as an undesirable business situation or unintended harm to the individual(s). This implies that we can identify how the problems are inherited, rank the causes to help prioritize fixes, simplify a complex problem and visualize them. In the context of machine learning (ML), one can use cause-to-effect analysis to understand the reason for the biased behavior of the system. For example, we can examine the root causes of biases by checking each feature for a potential cause of bias in the model. To approach this, one can apply small changes to a given feature or a pair of features in the data, following some guidelines and observing how it impacts the decision made by the model (i.e., model prediction). Therefore, we can use cause-to-effect analysis to identify the potential bias-inducing features, even when these features are originally are unknown. This is important since most current methods require a pre-identification of sensitive features for bias assessment and can actually miss other relevant bias-inducing features, which is why systematic identification of such features is necessary. Moreover, it often occurs that to achieve an equitable outcome, one has to take into account sensitive features in the model decision. Therefore, it should be up to the domain experts to decide based on their knowledge of the context of a decision whether bias induced by specific features is acceptable or not. In this study, we propose an approach for systematically identifying all bias-inducing features of a model to help support the decision-making of domain experts. We evaluated our technique using four well-known datasets to showcase how our contribution can help spearhead the standard procedure when developing, testing, maintaining, and deploying fair/equitable machine learning systems.

    "title": "Prompt Injection Attacks and Defenses in LLM-Integrated Applications",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as the backend for a variety of real-world applications called LLM-Integrated Applications. Multiple recent works showed that LLM-Integrated Applications are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, in which an attacker injects malicious instruction/data into the input of those applications such that they produce results as the attacker desires. However, existing works are limited to case studies. As a result, the literature lacks a systematic understanding of prompt injection attacks and their defenses. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. In particular, we propose a general framework to formalize prompt injection attacks. Existing attacks, which are discussed in research papers and blog posts, are special cases in our framework. Our framework enables us to design a new attack by combining existing attacks. Moreover, we also propose a framework to systematize defenses against prompt injection attacks. Using our frameworks, we conduct a systematic evaluation on prompt injection attacks and their defenses with 10 LLMs and 7 tasks. We hope our frameworks can inspire future research in this field.

We propose a privacy formalism, per-record zero concentrated differential privacy (PzCDP), where the privacy loss associated with each record is a public function of that record's value. Unlike other formalisms which provide different privacy losses to different records, PzCDP's privacy loss depends explicitly on the confidential data. We define our formalism, derive its properties, and propose mechanisms which satisfy PzCDP that are uniquely suited to publishing skewed or heavy-tailed statistics, where a small number of records contribute substantially to query answers. This targeted relaxation helps overcome the difficulties of applying standard DP to these data products. ",

    "abstract": "As is well known, differential algebraic equations (DAEs), which are able to describe dynamic changes and underlying constraints, have been widely applied in engineering fields such as fluid dynamics, multi-body dynamics, mechanical systems and control theory. In practical physical modeling within these domains, the systems often generate high-index DAEs. Classical implicit numerical methods typically result in varying order reduction of numerical accuracy when solving high-index systems.~Recently, the physics-informed neural network (PINN) has gained attention for solving DAE systems. However, it faces challenges like the inability to directly solve high-index systems, lower predictive accuracy, and weaker generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a PINN computational framework, combined Radau IIA numerical method with a neural network structure via the attention mechanisms, to directly solve high-index DAEs. Furthermore, we employ a domain decomposition strategy to enhance solution accuracy. We conduct numerical experiments with two classical high-index systems as illustrative examples, investigating how different orders of the Radau IIA method affect the accuracy of neural network solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the PINN based on a 5th-order Radau IIA method achieves the highest level of system accuracy. Specifically, the absolute errors for all differential variables remains as low as $10^{-6}$, and the absolute errors for algebraic variables is maintained at $10^{-5}$, surpassing the results found in existing literature. Therefore, our method exhibits excellent computational accuracy and strong generalization capabilities, providing a feasible approach for the high-precision solution of larger-scale DAEs with higher indices or challenging high-dimensional partial differential algebraic equation systems.

In practical applications, however, the degradation is often unknown, and the mismatch between the model and the degradation will result in a severe performance drop. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one image restoration network that tackles multiple degradations. Due to the heterogeneous nature of different types of degradations, it is difficult to process multiple degradations in a single network. To this end, we propose to learn a neural degradation representation (NDR) that captures the underlying characteristics of various degradations. The learned NDR decomposes different types of degradations adaptively, similar to a neural dictionary that represents basic degradation components. Subsequently, we develop a degradation query module and a degradation injection module to effectively recognize and utilize the specific degradation based on NDR, enabling the all-in-one restoration ability for multiple degradations. Moreover, we propose a bidirectional optimization strategy to effectively drive NDR to learn the degradation representation by optimizing the degradation and restoration processes alternately. Comprehensive experiments on representative types of degradations (including noise, haze, rain, and downsampling) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method. ",

We devised the features such as the date and time, activity time, days of the week, time of day, and frequency of visits to POI (Point of Interest). As additional features, we incorporated the movement of other individuals with similar behavior patterns through the employment of clustering. The machine learning model we adopted was the Support Vector Regression (SVR). We performed accuracy through offline assessment and carried out feature selection and parameter tuning. Although overall dataset provided consists of 100,000 users trajectory, our method use only 20,000 target users data, and do not need to use other 80,000 data.

To account for the team structure in cooperative tasks, we propose a novel algorithm that uses a relational network comprising inter-agent relationships to prioritize certain agents over others. Through appropriate design of the team's relational network, we can guide the cooperation strategy, resulting in the emergence of new behaviors that accomplish the specified task. We conducted six experiments in a multi-robot setting with a cooperative task.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent cooperation is an important topic, and is particularly challenging in mixed-motive situations where it does not pay to be nice to others. Consequently, self-interested agents often avoid collective behaviour, resulting in suboptimal outcomes for the group. In response, in this paper we introduce a metric to quantify the disparity between what is rational for individual agents and what is rational for the group, which we call the general self-interest level. This metric represents the maximum proportion of individual rewards that all agents can retain while ensuring that achieving social welfare optimum becomes a dominant strategy. By aligning the individual and group incentives, rational agents acting to maximise their own reward will simultaneously maximise the collective reward. As agents transfer their rewards to motivate others to consider their welfare, we diverge from traditional concepts of altruism or prosocial behaviours. The general self-interest level is a property of a game that is useful for assessing the propensity of players to cooperate and understanding how features of a game impact this. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method on several novel games representations of social dilemmas with arbitrary numbers of players. ",

However, LMs define weightings over strings in addition to just (unweighted) language membership and the analysis of the computational power of RNN LMs (RLMs) should reflect this. We extend the Turing completeness result to the probabilistic case, showing how a rationally weighted RLM with unbounded computation time can simulate any probabilistic Turing machine (PTM). Since, in practice, RLMs work in real-time, processing a symbol at every time step, we treat the above result as an upper bound on the expressivity of RLMs. We also provide a lower bound by showing that under the restriction to real-time computation, such models can simulate deterministic real-time rational PTMs. ",

However, datasets collected by humans in real-world environments are often noisy and may even be maliciously corrupted, which can significantly degrade the performance of offline RL. In this work, we first investigate the performance of current offline RL algorithms under comprehensive data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics. Our extensive experiments reveal that implicit Q-learning (IQL) demonstrates remarkable resilience to data corruption among various offline RL algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct both empirical and theoretical analyses to understand IQL's robust performance, identifying its supervised policy learning scheme as the key factor. Despite its relative robustness, IQL still suffers from heavy-tail targets of Q functions under dynamics corruption. To tackle this challenge, we draw inspiration from robust statistics to employ the Huber loss to handle the heavy-tailedness and utilize quantile estimators to balance penalization for corrupted data and learning stability. By incorporating these simple yet effective modifications into IQL, we propose a more robust offline RL approach named Robust IQL (RIQL). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIQL exhibits highly robust performance when subjected to diverse data corruption scenarios. ",

Existing agent-centric methods have demonstrated outstanding performance on public benchmarks. However, they suffer from high computational overhead and poor scalability as the number of agents to be predicted increases. To address this problem, we introduce the K-nearest neighbor attention with relative pose encoding (KNARPE), a novel attention mechanism allowing the pairwise-relative representation to be used by Transformers. Then, based on KNARPE we present the Heterogeneous Polyline Transformer with Relative pose encoding (HPTR), a hierarchical framework enabling asynchronous token update during the online inference. By sharing contexts among agents and reusing the unchanged contexts, our approach is as efficient as scene-centric methods, while performing on par with state-of-the-art agent-centric methods. Experiments on Waymo and Argoverse-2 datasets show that HPTR achieves superior performance among end-to-end methods that do not apply expensive post-processing or model ensembling.

    "abstract": "We present a new technique to enhance the robustness of imitation learning methods by generating corrective data to account for compounding errors and disturbances. While existing methods rely on interactive expert labeling, additional offline datasets, or domain-specific invariances, our approach requires minimal additional assumptions beyond access to expert data. The key insight is to leverage local continuity in the environment dynamics to generate corrective labels. Our method first constructs a dynamics model from the expert demonstration, encouraging local Lipschitz continuity in the learned model. In locally continuous regions, this model allows us to generate corrective labels within the neighborhood of the demonstrations but beyond the actual set of states and actions in the dataset. Training on this augmented data enhances the agent's ability to recover from perturbations and deal with compounding errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our generated labels through experiments in a variety of robotics domains in simulation that have distinct forms of continuity and discontinuity, including classic control problems, drone flying, navigation with high-dimensional sensor observations, legged locomotion, and tabletop manipulation.

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the challenging task of 3D object recognition without the reliance on real-world 3D labeled data. Our goal is to predict the 3D shape, size, and 6D pose of objects within a single RGB-D image, operating at the category level and eliminating the need for CAD models during inference. While existing self-supervised methods have made strides in this field, they often suffer from inefficiencies arising from non-end-to-end processing, reliance on separate models for different object categories, and slow surface extraction during the training of implicit reconstruction models; thus hindering both the speed and real-world applicability of the 3D recognition process. Our proposed method leverages a multi-stage training pipeline, designed to efficiently transfer synthetic performance to the real-world domain. This approach is achieved through a combination of 2D and 3D supervised losses during the synthetic domain training, followed by the incorporation of 2D supervised and 3D self-supervised losses on real-world data in two additional learning stages. By adopting this comprehensive strategy, our method successfully overcomes the aforementioned limitations and outperforms existing self-supervised 6D pose and size estimation baselines on the NOCS test-set with a 16.4% absolute improvement in mAP for 6D pose estimation while running in near real-time at 5 Hz.

In fact, many DN phenomenon were first introduced in literature with that respect, e.g., double descent, grokking. In this study, we look at the training dynamics of the input space partition or linear regions formed by continuous piecewise affine DNs, e.g., networks with (leaky)ReLU nonlinearities. First, we present a novel statistic that encompasses the local complexity (LC) of the DN based on the concentration of linear regions inside arbitrary dimensional neighborhoods around data points. We observe that during training, the LC around data points undergoes a number of phases, starting with a decreasing trend after initialization, followed by an ascent and ending with a final descending trend. Using exact visualization methods, we come across the perplexing observation that during the final LC descent phase of training, linear regions migrate away from training and test samples towards the decision boundary, making the DN input-output nearly linear everywhere else. We also observe that the different LC phases are closely related to the memorization and generalization performance of the DN, especially during grokking. ",

    "abstract": "We report a flexible language-model based deep learning strategy, applied here to solve complex forward and inverse problems in protein modeling, based on an attention neural network that integrates transformer and graph convolutional architectures in a causal multi-headed graph mechanism, to realize a generative pretrained model. The model is applied to predict secondary structure content (per-residue level and overall content), protein solubility, and sequencing tasks. Further trained on inverse tasks, the model is rendered capable of designing proteins with these properties as target features. The model is formulated as a general framework, completely prompt-based, and can be adapted for a variety of downstream tasks. We find that adding additional tasks yields emergent synergies that the model exploits in improving overall performance, beyond what would be possible by training a model on each dataset alone. Case studies are presented to validate the method, yielding protein designs specifically focused on structural proteins, but also exploring the applicability in the design of soluble, antimicrobial biomaterials. While our model is trained to ultimately perform 8 distinct tasks, with available datasets it can be extended to solve additional problems. In a broader sense, this work illustrates a form of multiscale modeling that relates a set of ultimate building blocks (here, byte-level utf8 characters that define the nature of the physical system at hand) to complex output. This materiomic scheme captures complex emergent relationships between universal building block and resulting properties via a synergizing learning capacity to express a set of potentialities embedded in the knowledge used in training, via the interplay of universality and diversity.

Electricity systems hold particular significance, as they are essential for other infrastructure, and disruptions can trigger widespread consequences. Typically, assessing electricity availability requires ground-level data, a challenge in conflict zones and regions with limited access. This study shows how satellite imagery, social media, and information extraction can monitor blackouts and their perceived causes. Night-time light data (in March 2019 for Caracas, Venezuela) is used to indicate blackout regions. Twitter data is used to determine sentiment and topic trends, while statistical analysis and topic modeling delved into public perceptions regarding blackout causes. The findings show an inverse relationship between nighttime light intensity. Tweets mentioning the Venezuelan President displayed heightened negativity and a greater prevalence of blame-related terms, suggesting a perception of government accountability for the outages. ",

These models are necessary for capturing the dynamics of small systems where the individual nature of the populations cannot be ignored and stochastic effects are important. The inference of the parameters of such models, from time series data, is difficult due to intractability of the likelihood; current methods, based on simulations of the underlying model, can be so computationally expensive as to be prohibitive. In this paper we construct a neural likelihood approximation for integer valued time series data using causal convolutions, which allows us to evaluate the likelihood of the whole time series in parallel. We demonstrate our method by performing inference on a number of ecological and epidemiological models, showing that we can accurately approximate the true posterior while achieving significant computational speed ups in situations where current methods struggle.

Our method achieved state-of-the-art classification performance, with an accuracy of 91.94% for MCI progression classification and 96.30% for Alzheimer's disease classification on the ADNI dataset. Furthermore, the model demonstrated good generalizability, achieving an accuracy of 86.37% on the AIBL dataset and 83.42% on the OASIS1 dataset.

    "abstract": "Indirect reciprocity is a mechanism that explains large-scale cooperation in human societies. In indirect reciprocity, an individual chooses whether or not to cooperate with another based on reputation information, and others evaluate the action as good or bad. Under what evaluation rule (called ``social norm'') cooperation evolves has long been of central interest in the literature. It has been reported that if individuals can share their evaluations (i.e., public reputation), social norms called ``leading eight'' can be evolutionarily stable. On the other hand, when they cannot share their evaluations (i.e., private assessment), the evolutionary stability of cooperation is still in question. To tackle this problem, we create a novel method to analyze the reputation structure in the population under private assessment. Specifically, we characterize each individual by two variables, ``goodness'' (what proportion of the population considers the individual as good) and ``self-reputation'' (whether an individual thinks of him/herself as good or bad), and analyze the stochastic process of how these two variables change over time. We discuss evolutionary stability of each of the leading eight social norms by studying the robustness against invasions of unconditional cooperators and defectors. We identify key pivots in those social norms for establishing a high level of cooperation or stable cooperation against mutants. Our finding gives an insight into how human cooperation is established in a real-world society. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, learned video compression has achieved exciting performance. Following the traditional hybrid prediction coding framework, most learned methods generally adopt the motion estimation motion compensation (MEMC) method to remove inter-frame redundancy. However, inaccurate motion vector (MV) usually lead to the distortion of reconstructed frame. In addition, most approaches ignore the spatial and channel redundancy. To solve above problems, we propose a motion-aware and spatial-temporal-channel contextual coding based video compression network (MASTC-VC), which learns the latent representation and uses variational autoencoders (VAEs) to capture the characteristics of intra-frame pixels and inter-frame motion. Specifically, we design a multiscale motion-aware module (MS-MAM) to estimate spatial-temporal-channel consistent motion vector by utilizing the multiscale motion prediction information in a coarse-to-fine way. On the top of it, we further propose a spatial-temporal-channel contextual module (STCCM), which explores the correlation of latent representation to reduce the bit consumption from spatial, temporal and channel aspects respectively. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed MASTC-VC is surprior to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three public benchmark datasets. More specifically, our method brings average 10.15\\% BD-rate savings against H.265/HEVC (HM-16.20) in PSNR metric and average 23.93\\% BD-rate savings against H.266/VVC (VTM-13.2) in MS-SSIM metric.

The qualitative evidence we uncovered in these interviews combined with a well-known mathematical decomposition of prediction error helps us identify some origins of unpredictability and create a new conceptual framework. Our specific evidence and our more general framework suggest that unpredictability should be expected in many life trajectory prediction tasks, even in the presence of complex algorithms and large datasets.

Conformal inference algorithms construct prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability. These guarantees fail to hold in the face of distribution shift, which is precisely when reliable uncertainty quantification can be most useful. We propose a novel algorithm for constructing prediction sets with PAC guarantees in the label shift setting. This method estimates the predicted probabilities of the classes in a target domain, as well as the confusion matrix, then propagates uncertainty in these estimates through a Gaussian elimination algorithm to compute confidence intervals for importance weights. Finally, it uses these intervals to construct prediction sets. We evaluate our approach on five datasets: the CIFAR-10, ChestX-Ray and Entity-13 image datasets, the tabular CDC Heart dataset, and the AGNews text dataset. Our algorithm satisfies the PAC guarantee while producing smaller, more informative, prediction sets compared to several baselines. ",
