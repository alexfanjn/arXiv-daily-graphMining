Recent advances in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation allow for accurate estimation of local scene appearance and in turn, can benefit the relocalization of the vehicle. However, one downside of BEV methods is the heavy computation required to leverage the geometric constraints. This paper presents U-BEV, a U-Net inspired architecture that extends the current state-of-the-art by allowing the BEV to reason about the scene on multiple height layers before flattening the BEV features. We show that this extension boosts the performance of the U-BEV by up to 4.11 IoU. Additionally, we combine the encoded neural BEV with a differentiable template matcher to perform relocalization on neural SD-map data. The model is fully end-to-end trainable and outperforms transformer-based BEV methods of similar computational complexity by 1.7 to 2.8 mIoU and BEV-based relocalization by over 26% Recall Accuracy on the nuScenes dataset.

Graph AI facilitates model transfer across clinical tasks, enabling models to generalize across patient populations without additional parameters or minimal re-training. However, the importance of human-centered design and model interpretability in clinical decision-making cannot be overstated. Since graph AI models capture information through localized neural transformations defined on graph relationships, they offer both an opportunity and a challenge in elucidating model rationale.

In this paper, we present a multi-view approach that combines latent spaces derived from state-of-the-art chemical models. Our approach relies on two pivotal elements: the embeddings derived from MHG-GNN, which represent molecular structures as graphs, and MoLFormer embeddings rooted in chemical language. The attention mechanism of MoLFormer is able to identify relations between two atoms even when their distance is far apart, while the GNN of MHG-GNN can more precisely capture relations among multiple atoms closely located. In this work, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed multi-view approach compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, including MoLFormer-XL, which was trained on 1.1 billion molecules, particularly in intricate tasks such as predicting clinical trial drug toxicity and inhibiting HIV replication. We assessed our approach using six benchmark datasets from MoleculeNet, where it outperformed competitors in five of them. Our study highlights the potential of latent space fusion and feature integration for advancing molecular property prediction. In this work, we use small versions of MHG-GNN and MoLFormer, which opens up an opportunity for further improvement when our approach uses a larger-scale dataset. ",

In addition, we propose a fast computation technique to reduce the time complexity of G-FairAttack.

For text-to-image generative models with massive training datasets, current understanding of poisoning attacks suggests that a successful attack would require injecting millions of poison samples into their training pipeline. In this paper, we show that poisoning attacks can be successful on generative models. We observe that training data per concept can be quite limited in these models, making them vulnerable to prompt-specific poisoning attacks, which target a model's ability to respond to individual prompts. We introduce Nightshade, an optimized prompt-specific poisoning attack where poison samples look visually identical to benign images with matching text prompts. Nightshade poison samples are also optimized for potency and can corrupt an Stable Diffusion SDXL prompt in <100 poison samples. Nightshade poison effects \"bleed through\" to related concepts, and multiple attacks can composed together in a single prompt. Surprisingly, we show that a moderate number of Nightshade attacks can destabilize general features in a text-to-image generative model, effectively disabling its ability to generate meaningful images. Finally, we propose the use of Nightshade` and similar tools as a last defense for content creators against web scrapers that ignore opt-out/do-not-crawl directives, and discuss possible implications for model trainers and content creators.

Deep Sets, proposed by \\cite{zaheer2017deep}, provides a \\emph{universal representation} for continuous multiset functions on scalars via a sum-decomposable model. Restricting the domain of the functions to finite multisets of $D$-dimensional vectors, Deep Sets also provides a \\emph{universal approximation} that requires a latent space dimension of $O(N^D)$ -- where $N$ is an upper bound on the size of input multisets. In this paper, we strengthen this result by proving that universal representation is guaranteed for continuous and discontinuous multiset functions though a latent space dimension of $O(N^D)$. We then introduce \\emph{identifiable} multisets for which we can uniquely label their elements using an identifier function, namely, finite-precision vectors are identifiable. Using our analysis on identifiable multisets, we prove that a sum-decomposable model for general continuous multiset functions only requires a latent dimension of $2DN$. We further show that both encoder and decoder functions of the model are continuous -- our main contribution to the existing work which lack such a guarantee. Also this provides a significant improvement over the aforementioned $O(N^D)$ bound which was derived for universal representation of continuous and discontinuous multiset functions. We then extend our results and provide special sum-decomposition structures to universally represent permutation-invariant tensor functions on identifiable tensors. These families of sum-decomposition models enables us to design deep network architectures and deploy them on a variety of learning tasks on sequences, images, and graphs. ",

    "abstract": "The Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard has been recently finalized by the Joint Video Exploration Team (JVET). Compared to the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, VVC offers about 50% compression efficiency gain, in terms of Bjontegaard Delta-Rate (BD-rate), at the cost of a 10-fold increase in encoding complexity. In this paper, we propose a method based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to speed up the inter partitioning process in VVC. Firstly, a novel representation for the quadtree with nested multi-type tree (QTMT) partition is introduced, derived from the partition path. Secondly, we develop a U-Net-based CNN taking a multi-scale motion vector field as input at the Coding Tree Unit (CTU) level. The purpose of CNN inference is to predict the optimal partition path during the Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) process. To achieve this, we divide CTU into grids and predict the Quaternary Tree (QT) depth and Multi-type Tree (MT) split decisions for each cell of the grid. Thirdly, an efficient partition pruning algorithm is introduced to employ the CNN predictions at each partitioning level to skip RDO evaluations of unnecessary partition paths. Finally, an adaptive threshold selection scheme is designed, making the trade-off between complexity and efficiency scalable. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve acceleration ranging from 16.5% to 60.2% under the RandomAccess Group Of Picture 32 (RAGOP32) configuration with a reasonable efficiency drop ranging from 0.44% to 4.59% in terms of BD-rate, which surpasses other state-of-the-art solutions. Additionally, our method stands out as one of the lightest approaches in the field, which ensures its applicability to other encoders. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown remarkable effectiveness in learning representations on graphs. As a component of GCL, good augmentation views are supposed to be invariant to the important information while discarding the unimportant part. Existing augmentation views with perturbed graph structures are usually based on random topology corruption in the spatial domain; however, from perspectives of the spectral domain, this approach may be ineffective as it fails to pose tailored impacts on the information of different frequencies, thus weakening the agreement between the augmentation views. By a preliminary experiment, we show that the impacts caused by spatial random perturbation are approximately evenly distributed among frequency bands, which may harm the invariance of augmentations required by contrastive learning frameworks. To address this issue, we argue that the perturbation should be selectively posed on the information concerning different frequencies. In this paper, we propose GASSER which poses tailored perturbation on the specific frequencies of graph structures in spectral domain, and the edge perturbation is selectively guided by the spectral hints. As shown by extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, the augmentation views are adaptive and controllable, as well as heuristically fitting the homophily ratios and spectrum of graph structures.

    "abstract": "The human visual system uses two parallel pathways for spatial processing and object recognition. In contrast, computer vision systems tend to use a single feedforward pathway, rendering them less robust, adaptive, or efficient than human vision. To bridge this gap, we developed a dual-stream vision model inspired by the human eyes and brain. At the input level, the model samples two complementary visual patterns to mimic how the human eyes use magnocellular and parvocellular retinal ganglion cells to separate retinal inputs to the brain. At the backend, the model processes the separate input patterns through two branches of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to mimic how the human brain uses the dorsal and ventral cortical pathways for parallel visual processing. The first branch (WhereCNN) samples a global view to learn spatial attention and control eye movements. The second branch (WhatCNN) samples a local view to represent the object around the fixation. Over time, the two branches interact recurrently to build a scene representation from moving fixations. We compared this model with the human brains processing the same movie and evaluated their functional alignment by linear transformation. The WhereCNN and WhatCNN branches were found to differentially match the dorsal and ventral pathways of the visual cortex, respectively, primarily due to their different learning objectives. These model-based results lead us to speculate that the distinct responses and representations of the ventral and dorsal streams are more influenced by their distinct goals in visual attention and object recognition than by their specific bias or selectivity in retinal inputs. This dual-stream model takes a further step in brain-inspired computer vision, enabling parallel neural networks to actively explore and understand the visual surroundings. ",

In each global training round, each client trains a local model on its own training data and then they exchange local models for aggregation. In this work, we propose SelfishAttack, a new family of attacks to DFL. In SelfishAttack, a set of selfish clients aim to achieve competitive advantages over the remaining non-selfish ones, i.e., the final learnt local models of the selfish clients are more accurate than those of the non-selfish ones. Towards this goal, the selfish clients send carefully crafted local models to each remaining non-selfish one in each global training round. We formulate finding such local models as an optimization problem and propose methods to solve it when DFL uses different aggregation rules. Theoretically, we show that our methods find the optimal solutions to the optimization problem. Empirically, we show that SelfishAttack successfully increases the accuracy gap (i.e., competitive advantage) between the final learnt local models of selfish clients and those of non-selfish ones. Moreover, SelfishAttack achieves larger accuracy gaps than poisoning attacks when extended to increase competitive advantages. ",

Unlike general object detection, object detection in RSI has specific challenges: 1) the scarcity of labeled data in RSI compared to general object detection datasets, and 2) the small objects presented in a high-resolution image with a vast background. To address these challenges, we propose a multimodal transformer exploring multi-source remote sensing data for object detection. Instead of directly combining the multimodal input through a channel-wise concatenation, which ignores the heterogeneity of different modalities, we propose a cross-channel attention module. This module learns the relationship between different channels, enabling the construction of a coherent multimodal input by aligning the different modalities at the early stage. We also introduce a new architecture based on the Swin transformer that incorporates convolution layers in non-shifting blocks while maintaining fixed dimensions, allowing for the generation of fine-to-coarse representations with a favorable accuracy-computation trade-off. The extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal fusion module and architecture, demonstrating their applicability to multimodal aerial imagery. ",

A multi-objective model predictive control (MPC) framework is developed to optimize the fast charging performance while enforcing the constraints in the power and thermal loops. The approach takes into account the coupling of the battery and cabin thermal management. The case study of a commercial EV demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively meet the requirements of fast charging and thermal management when accurate preview information is available. However, failure to predict the charging event can result in performance degradation with longer charging time. A time-varying weighting strategy is proposed to enhance charging performance in the presence of uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Learning representations purely from observations concerns the problem of learning a low-dimensional, compact representation which is beneficial to prediction models. Under the hypothesis that the intrinsic latent factors follow some casual generative models, we argue that by learning a causal representation, which is the minimal sufficient causes of the whole system, we can improve the robustness and generalization performance of machine learning models. In this paper, we develop a learning method to learn such representation from observational data by regularizing the learning procedure with mutual information measures, according to the hypothetical factored causal graph. We theoretically and empirically show that the models trained with the learned causal representations are more robust under adversarial attacks and distribution shifts compared with baselines.

Conventional physics-based docking tools, though widely used, face limitations in precision due to restricted conformational sampling and imprecise scoring functions.

Leveraging the success of extensive and diverse data in other domains, we introduce HelixDock, a novel approach for site-specific molecular docking. Hundreds of millions of binding poses are generated by traditional docking tools, encompassing diverse protein targets and small molecules. Our deep learning-based docking model, a SE(3)-equivariant network, is pre-trained with this large-scale dataset and then fine-tuned with a small number of precise receptor-ligand complex structures. Comparative analyses against physics-based and deep learning-based baseline methods highlight HelixDock's superiority, especially on challenging test sets. Our study elucidates the scaling laws of the pre-trained molecular docking models, showcasing consistent improvements with increased model parameters and pre-train data quantities.

A critical gap in traditional motion prediction methodologies lies in ensuring equivariance under Euclidean geometric transformations and maintaining invariant interaction relationships. This research introduces a groundbreaking solution by employing EqMotion, a theoretically geometric equivariant and interaction invariant motion prediction model for particles and humans, plus integrating agent-equivariant high-definition (HD) map features for context aware motion prediction in autonomous driving. The use of EqMotion as backbone marks a significant departure from existing methods by rigorously ensuring motion equivariance and interaction invariance. Equivariance here implies that an output motion must be equally transformed under the same Euclidean transformation as an input motion, while interaction invariance preserves the manner in which agents interact despite transformations. These properties make the network robust to arbitrary Euclidean transformations and contribute to more accurate prediction. In addition, we introduce an equivariant method to process the HD map to enrich the spatial understanding of the network while preserving the overall network equivariance property. By applying these technologies, our model is able to achieve high prediction accuracy while maintain a lightweight design and efficient data utilization. ",

In this work, we propose a novel framework, namely, Diversified Outlier Exposure (DivOE), for effective OOD detection via informative extrapolation based on the given auxiliary outliers. Specifically, DivOE introduces a new learning objective, which diversifies the auxiliary distribution by explicitly synthesizing more informative outliers for extrapolation during training. It leverages a multi-step optimization method to generate novel outliers beyond the original ones, which is compatible with many variants of outlier exposure. Extensive experiments and analyses have been conducted to characterize and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DivOE. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/DivOE.

A novel methodology is hence proposed, exploiting operational data and available physical knowledge to attain accurate and computationally efficient DHSs dynamic models. The proposed idea consists in leveraging multiple Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and in embedding the physical topology of the DHS network in their interconnections. With respect to standard RNN approaches, the resulting modelling methodology, denoted as Physics-Informed RNN (PI-RNN), enables to achieve faster training procedures and higher modelling accuracy, even when reduced-dimension models are exploited. The developed PI-RNN modelling technique paves the way for the design of a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) regulation strategy, enabling, with limited computational time, to minimize production costs, to increase system efficiency and to respect operative constraints over the whole DHS network. The proposed methods are tested in simulation on a DHS benchmark referenced in the literature, showing promising results from the modelling and control perspective. ",

The amount of these perturbations are generally quantified using $L_p$ metrics, such as $L_0$, $L_2$ and $L_\\infty$. However, even when the measured perturbations are small, they tend to be noticeable by human observers since $L_p$ distance metrics are not representative of human perception. On the other hand, humans are less sensitive to changes in colorspace. In addition, pixel shifts in a constrained neighborhood are hard to notice. Motivated by these observations, we propose a method that creates adversarial examples by applying spatial transformations, which creates adversarial examples by changing the pixel locations independently to chrominance channels of perceptual colorspaces such as $YC_{b}C_{r}$ and $CIELAB$, instead of making an additive perturbation or manipulating pixel values directly. In a targeted white-box attack setting, the proposed method is able to obtain competitive fooling rates with very high confidence. The experimental evaluations show that the proposed method has favorable results in terms of approximate perceptual distance between benign and adversarially generated images.

The proposed Fuzzy-NMS module combines the volume and clustering density of candidate bounding boxes, refining them with a fuzzy classification method and optimizing the appropriate suppression thresholds to reduce uncertainty in the NMS process. Adequate validation experiments are conducted using the mainstream KITTI and large-scale Waymo 3D object detection benchmarks. The results of these tests demonstrate the proposed Fuzzy-NMS module can improve the accuracy of numerous recently NMS-based detectors significantly, including PointPillars, PV-RCNN, and IA-SSD, etc. This effect is particularly evident for small objects such as pedestrians and bicycles. As a plug-and-play module, Fuzzy-NMS does not need to be retrained and produces no obvious increases in inference time. ",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer rich knowledge from the annotated source domain to the unlabeled target domain with the same label space. One prevalent solution is the bi-discriminator domain adversarial network, which strives to identify target domain samples outside the support of the source domain distribution and enforces their classification to be consistent on both discriminators. Despite being effective, agnostic accuracy and overconfident estimation for out-of-distribution samples hinder its further performance improvement. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel bi-discriminator domain adversarial neural network with class-level gradient alignment, i.e. BACG. BACG resorts to gradient signals and second-order probability estimation for better alignment of domain distributions. Specifically, for accuracy-awareness, we first design an optimizable nearest neighbor algorithm to obtain pseudo-labels of samples in the target domain, and then enforce the backward gradient approximation of the two discriminators at the class level. Furthermore, following evidential learning theory, we transform the traditional softmax-based optimization method into a Multinomial Dirichlet hierarchical model to infer the class probability distribution as well as samples uncertainty, thereby alleviating misestimation of out-of-distribution samples and guaranteeing high-quality classes alignment. In addition, inspired by contrastive learning, we develop a memory bank-based variant, i.e. Fast-BACG, which can greatly shorten the training process at the cost of a minor decrease in accuracy. Extensive experiments and detailed theoretical analysis on four benchmark data sets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm. ",

One limitation of these approaches is that they resort to very large language models (around 175B parameters) that are also proprietary and non-public. Here we explore the application of such techniques to language models that are much smaller (around 10B--40B parameters) and have permissive licenses. We find the Self-Instruct approach to be less effective at these sizes and propose new ICL methods that draw on two main ideas: (a) Categorization and simplification of the ICL templates to make prompt learning easier for the LM, and (b) Ensembling over multiple LM outputs to help select high-quality synthetic examples. Our algorithm leverages the 175 Self-Instruct seed tasks and employs separate pipelines for instructions that require an input and instructions that do not. Empirical investigations with different LMs show that: (1) Our proposed method yields higher-quality instruction tuning data than Self-Instruct, (2) It improves performances of both vanilla and instruction-tuned LMs by significant margins, and (3) Smaller instruction-tuned LMs generate more useful outputs than their larger un-tuned counterparts.

Specifically, FIMI can be considered as a resource-aware data augmentation method that effectively mitigates the data heterogeneity while ensuring efficient FL training. We first quantify the relationship between the training data amount and the learning performance. We then study the FIMI optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the device-side overall energy consumption subject to required learning performance constraints. The decomposition-based analysis and the cross-entropy searching method are leveraged to derive the solution, where each device is assigned suitable AI-synthesized data and resource utilization policy. Experiment results demonstrate that FIMI can save up to 50% of the device-side energy to achieve the target global test accuracy in comparison with the existing methods. Meanwhile, FIMI can significantly enhance the converged global accuracy under the non-independently-and-identically distribution (non-IID) data. ",

    "abstract": "Concentration shift keying (CSK) is a widely adopted modulation technique for molecular communication-based nanonetworks, which is a key enabler for the Internet of Bio-NanoThings (IoBNT). However, existing methods provide optimal error performance at the cost of high operational complexity that scales poorly as the number of transmitters, $K$, increases. This paper proposes a novel $M$-ary CSK method termed CSK with Common detection Thresholds (CSK-CT). CSK-CT uses $\\textit{common}$ thresholds that are sufficiently low to ensure the reliable detection of symbols transmitted by every transmitter, regardless of their distance. We derive closed-form expressions to obtain the common thresholds and release concentrations. To enhance the error performance, we optimize the release concentration using a scaling exponent that further optimizes the common thresholds. We evaluate the performance of CSK-CT in comparison to the benchmark CSK for varying values of $K$ and $M$. In terms of the error probability, CSK-CT offers between $10^{-7}$ and $10^{-4}$, which are a substantial improvement from the $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ offered by the benchmark. In terms of complexity, CSK-CT is $\\textit{O}\\big(n\\big)$ and does not scale with $K$ but $M$ ($M\\ll K$), while the benchmark is $\\textit{O}\\big(n^2\\big)$. Furthermore, CSK-CT showcased the ability to mitigate inter-symbol interference, although this facet warrants further investigation. Due to its low error probability, improved scalability, low complexity, and potential ISI mitigation features, CSK-CT demonstrates benefits in applications of IoBNT focused on data-gathering. Specifically, its utility is well-noted in settings where a computationally strained receiver collects sensitive health-related data from multiple transmitters. ",

To tackle the challenge of dealing with incorrect paths or rules generated by the logical model, we propose a semi-supervised method to convert rules into sentences. These sentences are then subjected to assessment and removal of incorrect rules using an NLI (Natural Language Inference) model. Our approach to combining logical and neural models involves first obtaining answers from both the logical and neural models. These answers are subsequently unified using an Inference Engine module, which has been realized through both algorithmic implementation and a novel neural model architecture. To validate the efficacy of our model, we conducted a series of experiments. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our model in both link prediction metrics and the generation of more reliable explanations. ",

Few-shot classification involves training a model to perform a new classification task with a handful of labeled data. This paper presents three contributions. First, we introduce a scenario where the embedding of a pre-trained model is served through a gated API with compute-cost and data-privacy constraints. Second, we propose a transductive inference, a learning paradigm that has been overlooked by the NLP community. Transductive inference, unlike traditional inductive learning, leverages the statistics of unlabeled data. We also introduce a new parameter-free transductive regularizer based on the Fisher-Rao loss, which can be used on top of the gated API embeddings. This method fully utilizes unlabeled data, does not share any label with the third-party API provider and could serve as a baseline for future research. Third, we propose an improved experimental setting and compile a benchmark of eight datasets involving multiclass classification in four different languages, with up to 151 classes. We evaluate our methods using eight backbone models, along with an episodic evaluation over 1,000 episodes, which demonstrate the superiority of transductive inference over the standard inductive setting.

The challenge in extending this to larger subgraphs is the cumulative and exponential growth of noise as the subgraph size increases in any publication under LDP. We address this issue by proposing an algorithm to publish the number of paths that start at every node in the graph, leading to an algorithm that publishes the Katz centrality of all nodes. This algorithm employs multiple rounds of communication and the clipping technique. Both our theoretical and experimental assessments indicate that our algorithm exhibits acceptable bias and variance, considerably less than an algorithm that bypasses clipping.

The latter is nonetheless instrumental in developing robust and trustworthy systems. This paper makes two important contributions in this line of search: (i) we introduce LAROUSSE, a new framework to detect textual adversarial attacks and (ii) we introduce STAKEOUT, a new benchmark composed of nine popular attack methods, three datasets, and two pre-trained models. LAROUSSE is ready-to-use in production as it is unsupervised, hyperparameter-free, and non-differentiable, protecting it against gradient-based methods. Our new benchmark STAKEOUT allows for a robust evaluation framework: we conduct extensive numerical experiments which demonstrate that LAROUSSE outperforms previous methods, and which allows to identify interesting factors of detection rate variations.

However, accurate virtual sound requires an individual head-related transfer function (HRTF), which can be difficult to measure due to the need for a specialized environment. In this study, we proposed a method to generate HRTFs from one direction to the other. To this end, we used temporal convolutional neural networks (TCNs) to generate head-related impulse responses (HRIRs). To train the TCNs, publicly available datasets in the horizontal plane were used. Using the trained networks, we successfully generated HRIRs for directions other than the front direction in the dataset. We found that the proposed method successfully generated HRIRs for publicly available datasets. To test the generalization of the method, we measured the HRIRs of a new dataset and tested whether the trained networks could be used for this new dataset. Although the similarity evaluated by spectral distortion was slightly degraded, behavioral experiments with human participants showed that the generated HRIRs were equivalent to the measured ones. These results suggest that the proposed TCNs can be used to generate personalized HRIRs from one direction to another, which could contribute to the personalization of virtual sound. ",

    "abstract": "In the realm of maritime transportation, autonomous vessel navigation in natural inland waterways faces persistent challenges due to unpredictable natural factors. Existing scheduling algorithms fall short in handling these uncertainties, compromising both safety and efficiency. Moreover, these algorithms are primarily designed for non-autonomous vessels, leading to labor-intensive operations vulnerable to human error. To address these issues, this study proposes a risk-aware motion control approach for vessels that accounts for the dynamic and uncertain nature of tide islands in a distributionally robust manner. Specifically, a model predictive control method is employed to follow the reference trajectory in the time-space map while incorporating a risk constraint to prevent grounding accidents. To address uncertainties in tide islands, a novel modeling technique represents them as stochastic polytopes. Additionally, potential inaccuracies in waterway depth are addressed through a risk constraint that considers the worst-case uncertainty distribution within a Wasserstein ambiguity set around the empirical distribution. Using sensor data collected in the Guadalquivir River, we empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through simulations on a vessel. As a result, the vessel successfully navigates the waterway while avoiding grounding accidents, even with a limited dataset of observations. This stands in contrast to existing non-robust controllers, highlighting the robustness and practical applicability of the proposed approach. ",

In the forward pass, not only the output values are computed, but also their derivatives, and their deviations from the target derivatives are included in the cost function, which is minimized with respect to the weights by a gradient-based algorithm. So far, this method has been implemented for relatively low-dimensional tasks. In this study, we apply the approach to the problem of image analysis. We consider the task of reconstructing the vertices of a cube based on its image. By training the derivatives with respect to the 6 degrees of freedom of the cube, we obtain 25 times more accurate results for noiseless inputs. The derivatives also provide important insights into the robustness problem, which is currently understood in terms of two types of network vulnerabilities. The first type is small perturbations that dramatically change the output, and the second type is substantial image changes that the network erroneously ignores. They are currently considered as conflicting goals, since conventional training methods produce a trade-off. The first type can be analyzed via the gradient of the network, but the second type requires human evaluation of the inputs, which is an oracle substitute. For the task at hand, the nearest neighbor oracle can be defined, and the knowledge of derivatives allows it to be expanded into Taylor series. This allows to perform the first-order robustness analysis that unifies both types of vulnerabilities, and to implement robust training that eliminates any trade-offs, so that accuracy and robustness are limited only by network capacity.

Recent works focus on limited-query budget settings and adopt random sampling or active learning-based sampling strategies on publicly available, unannotated data sources. However, these methods often result in selected queries that lack task relevance and data diversity, leading to limited success in achieving satisfactory results with low query costs. In this paper, we propose MeaeQ (Model extraction attack with efficient Queries), a straightforward yet effective method to address these issues. Specifically, we initially utilize a zero-shot sequence inference classifier, combined with API service information, to filter task-relevant data from a public text corpus instead of a problem domain-specific dataset. Furthermore, we employ a clustering-based data reduction technique to obtain representative data as queries for the attack. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MeaeQ achieves higher functional similarity to the victim model than baselines while requiring fewer queries.

While the general accuracy of Code LLMs on individual tasks has been extensively evaluated, their self-consistency across different tasks is overlooked. Intuitively, a trustworthy model should be self-consistent when generating natural language specifications for its own code and generating code for its own specifications. Failure to preserve self-consistency reveals a lack of understanding of the shared semantics underlying natural language and programming language, and therefore undermines the trustworthiness of a model. In this paper, we first formally define the self-consistency of Code LLMs and then design a framework, IdentityChain, which effectively and efficiently evaluates the self-consistency and general accuracy of a model at the same time. We study eleven Code LLMs and show that they fail to preserve self-consistency, which is indeed a distinct aspect from general accuracy. Furthermore, we show that IdentityChain can be used as a model debugging tool to expose weaknesses of Code LLMs by demonstrating three major weaknesses that we identify in current models using IdentityChain.

While there have been attempts at using vision-based techniques for these tasks, they mostly use planogram compliance for detection of any anomalies, a technique that has been found lacking in robustness and scalability. Moreover, existing systems rely on human intervention to perform corrective actions after detection. In this paper, we present Co-AD, a Concept-based Anomaly Detection approach using a Vision Transformer (ViT) that is able to flag misplaced objects without using a prior knowledge base such as a planogram. It uses an auto-encoder architecture followed by outlier detection in the latent space. Co-AD has a peak success rate of 89.90% on anomaly detection image sets of retail objects drawn from the RP2K dataset, compared to 80.81% on the best-performing baseline of a standard ViT auto-encoder. To demonstrate its utility, we describe a robotic mobile manipulation pipeline to autonomously correct the anomalies flagged by Co-AD. This work is ultimately aimed towards developing autonomous mobile robot solutions that reduce the need for human intervention in retail store management. ",

    "abstract": "This research addresses the challenge of conducting interpretable causal inference between a binary treatment and its resulting outcome when not all confounders are known. Confounders are factors that have an influence on both the treatment and the outcome. We relax the requirement of knowing all confounders under desired treatment, which we refer to as Selective Confounding, to enable causal inference in diverse real-world scenarios. Our proposed scheme is designed to work in situations where multiple decision-makers with different policies are involved and where there is a re-evaluation mechanism after the initial decision to ensure consistency. These assumptions are more practical to fulfill compared to the availability of all confounders under all treatments. To tackle the issue of Selective Confounding, we propose the use of dual-treatment samples. These samples allow us to employ two-step procedures, such as Regression Adjustment or Doubly-Robust, to learn counterfactual predictors. We provide both theoretical error bounds and empirical evidence of the effectiveness of our proposed scheme using synthetic and real-world child placement data. Furthermore, we introduce three evaluation methods specifically tailored to assess the performance in child placement scenarios. By emphasizing transparency and interpretability, our approach aims to provide decision-makers with a valuable tool.

We employed a customized and adapted version of Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network CRNN model to meet our specific requirements and enhance its performance in our context, and then trained the custom CRNN model with the filled-in images from the year of 2019 to 2027 to extract the expiration dates and assess the model performance of LCBVAE on the expiration date recognition. The pipeline of (LCBVAE+CRNN) can be then integrated into an automated sorting systems for extracting the expiry dates and sorting the products accordingly during the manufacture stage. Additionally, it can overcome the manual entry of expiration dates that can be time-consuming and inefficient at the merchants. Due to the lack of the availability of the dotted Arabic expiration date images, we created an Arabic dot-matrix True Type Font (TTF) for the generation of the synthetic images.

However, the addition of links to a social network can also have an effect on the level of conflict in the network -- expressed in terms of polarization and disagreement. To this date, however, we have very little understanding of how these two implications of link formation relate to each other: are the goals of high relevance and conflict reduction aligned, or are the links that users are most likely to accept fundamentally different from the ones with the greatest potential for reducing conflict? Here we provide the first analysis of this question, using the recently popular Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics. We first present a surprising result on how link additions shift the level of opinion conflict, followed by explanation work that relates the amount of shift to structural features of the added links. We then characterize the gap in conflict reduction between the set of links achieving the largest reduction and the set of links achieving the highest relevance. The gap is measured on real-world data, based on instantiations of relevance defined by 13 link recommendation algorithms. We find that some, but not all, of the more accurate algorithms actually lead to better reduction of conflict. Our work suggests that social links recommended for increasing user engagement may not be as conflict-provoking as people might have thought. ",

However, our understanding of this difficulty is still limited. In this study, we substantially advance this field by identifying a major source of the problem: the single hidden state embedding and static item embeddings in the output softmax layer. Specifically, the similarity structure of the global item embeddings in the softmax layer sometimes forces the single hidden state embedding to be close to new items when copying is a better choice, while sometimes forcing the hidden state to be close to the items from the input inappropriately. To alleviate the problem, we adapt the recently-proposed softmax alternatives such as softmax-CPR to sequential recommendation tasks and demonstrate that the new softmax architectures unleash the capability of the neural encoder on learning when to copy and when to exclude the items from the input sequence. By only making some simple modifications on the output softmax layer for SASRec and GRU4Rec, softmax-CPR achieves consistent improvement in 12 datasets. With almost the same model size, our best method not only improves the average NDCG@10 of GRU4Rec in 5 datasets with duplicated items by 10% (4%-17% individually) but also improves 7 datasets without duplicated items by 24% (8%-39%)!

With the recent interest in scientific machine learning, it is natural to ask how sparse matrix computations can leverage neural networks (NN). Unfortunately, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks are typically not natural for either graph or sparse matrix computations. The issue lies with the fact that MLPs require fixed-sized inputs while scientific applications generally generate sparse matrices with arbitrary dimensions and a wide range of nonzero patterns (or matrix graph vertex interconnections). While convolutional NNs could possibly address matrix graphs where all vertices have the same number of nearest neighbors, a more general approach is needed for arbitrary sparse matrices, e.g. arising from discretized partial differential equations on unstructured meshes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are one approach suitable to sparse matrices. GNNs define aggregation functions (e.g., summations) that operate on variable size input data to produce data of a fixed output size so that MLPs can be applied. The goal of this paper is to provide an introduction to GNNs for a numerical linear algebra audience. Concrete examples are provided to illustrate how many common linear algebra tasks can be accomplished using GNNs. We focus on iterative methods that employ computational kernels such as matrix-vector products, interpolation, relaxation methods, and strength-of-connection measures. Our GNN examples include cases where parameters are determined a-priori as well as cases where parameters must be learned. The intent with this article is to help computational scientists understand how GNNs can be used to adapt machine learning concepts to computational tasks associated with sparse matrices. It is hoped that this understanding will stimulate data-driven extensions of classical sparse linear algebra tasks. ",

However, while rsfMRI scans are relatively easy to collect, obtaining sufficient task fMRI scans is much harder as it involves more complex experimental designs and procedures. Thus, the reliance on scarce paired data limits the application of current techniques to only tasks seen during training. We show that this reliance can be reduced by leveraging group-average contrasts, enabling zero-shot predictions for novel tasks. Our approach, named OPIC (short for Omni-Task Prediction of Individual Contrasts), takes as input a subject's rsfMRI-derived connectome and a group-average contrast, to produce a prediction of the subject-specific contrast. Similar to zero-shot learning in large language models using special inputs to obtain answers for novel natural language processing tasks, inputting group-average contrasts guides the OPIC model to generalize to novel tasks unseen in training. Experimental results show that OPIC's predictions for novel tasks are not only better than simple group-averages, but are also competitive with a state-of-the-art model's in-domain predictions that was trained using in-domain tasks' data.

Understanding human desire has the potential to be one of the most fascinating and challenging research domains. It is tightly coupled with sentiment analysis and emotion recognition tasks. It is beneficial for increasing human-computer interactions, recognizing human emotional intelligence, understanding interpersonal relationships, and making decisions. However, understanding human desire is challenging and under-explored because ways of eliciting desire might be different among humans. The task gets more difficult due to the diverse cultures, countries, and languages. Prior studies overlooked the use of image-text pairwise feature representation, which is crucial for the task of human desire understanding. In this research, we have proposed a unified multimodal transformer-based framework with image-text pair settings to identify human desire, sentiment, and emotion. The core of our proposed method lies in the encoder module, which is built using two state-of-the-art multimodal transformer models. These models allow us to extract diverse features. To effectively extract visual and contextualized embedding features from social media image and text pairs, we conducted joint fine-tuning of two pre-trained multimodal transformer models: Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT) and Vision-and-Augmented-Language Transformer (VAuLT). Subsequently, we use an early fusion strategy on these embedding features to obtain combined diverse feature representations of the image-text pair. This consolidation incorporates diverse information about this task, enabling us to robustly perceive the context and image pair from multiple perspectives. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-class cell nuclei detection is a fundamental prerequisite in the diagnosis of histopathology. It is critical to efficiently locate and identify cells with diverse morphology and distributions in digital pathological images. Most existing methods take complex intermediate representations as learning targets and rely on inflexible post-refinements while paying less attention to various cell density and fields of view. In this paper, we propose a novel Affine-Consistent Transformer (AC-Former), which directly yields a sequence of nucleus positions and is trained collaboratively through two sub-networks, a global and a local network. The local branch learns to infer distorted input images of smaller scales while the global network outputs the large-scale predictions as extra supervision signals. We further introduce an Adaptive Affine Transformer (AAT) module, which can automatically learn the key spatial transformations to warp original images for local network training. The AAT module works by learning to capture the transformed image regions that are more valuable for training the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on various benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "When vehicle routing decisions are intertwined with higher-level decisions, the resulting optimization problems pose significant challenges for computation. Examples are the multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP), where customers are assigned to depots before delivery, and the capacitated location routing problem (CLRP), where the locations of depots should be determined first. A simple and straightforward approach for such hierarchical problems would be to separate the higher-level decisions from the complicated vehicle routing decisions. For each higher-level decision candidate, we may evaluate the underlying vehicle routing problems to assess the candidate. As this approach requires solving vehicle routing problems multiple times, it has been regarded as impractical in most cases. We propose a novel deep-learning-based approach called Genetic Algorithm with Neural Cost Predictor (GANCP) to tackle the challenge and simplify algorithm developments. For each higher-level decision candidate, we predict the objective function values of the underlying vehicle routing problems using a pre-trained graph neural network without actually solving the routing problems. In particular, our proposed neural network learns the objective values of the HGS-CVRP open-source package that solves capacitated vehicle routing problems. Our numerical experiments show that this simplified approach is effective and efficient in generating high-quality solutions for both MDVRP and CLRP and has the potential to expedite algorithm developments for complicated hierarchical problems. We provide computational results evaluated in the standard benchmark instances used in the literature. ",

However, previous methods have not fully exploited the relation between brain image and clinical information that is widely adopted by experts in practice. To exploit the heterogeneous features from imaging and tabular data simultaneously, we propose the Visual-Attribute Prompt Learning-based Transformer (VAP-Former), a transformer-based network that efficiently extracts and fuses the multi-modal features with prompt fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a Prompt fine-Tuning (PT) scheme to transfer the knowledge from AD prediction task for progressive MCI (pMCI) diagnosis. In details, we first pre-train the VAP-Former without prompts on the AD diagnosis task and then fine-tune the model on the pMCI detection task with PT, which only needs to optimize a small amount of parameters while keeping the backbone frozen. Next, we propose a novel global prompt token for the visual prompts to provide global guidance to the multi-modal representations. Extensive experiments not only show the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods in pMCI prediction but also demonstrate that the global prompt can make the prompt learning process more effective and stable. Interestingly, the proposed prompt learning model even outperforms the fully fine-tuning baseline on transferring the knowledge from AD to pMCI. ",

However, the learning-based solvers often suffer from severe performance degradation on unseen MILP instances -- especially on large-scale instances from a perturbed environment -- due to the limited diversity of training distributions. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach, which is called Adversarial Instance Augmentation and does not require to know the problem type for new instance generation, to promote data diversity for learning-based branching modules in the branch-and-bound (B&B) Solvers (AdaSolver). We use the bipartite graph representations for MILP instances and obtain various perturbed instances to regularize the solver by augmenting the graph structures with a learned augmentation policy. The major technical contribution of AdaSolver is that we formulate the non-differentiable instance augmentation as a contextual bandit problem and adversarially train the learning-based solver and augmentation policy, enabling efficient gradient-based training of the augmentation policy. To the best of our knowledge, AdaSolver is the first general and effective framework for understanding and improving the generalization of both imitation-learning-based (IL-based) and reinforcement-learning-based (RL-based) B&B solvers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by producing various augmented instances, AdaSolver leads to a remarkable efficiency improvement across various distributions. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, end to end steering prediction for autonomous vehicles has become a major area of research. The primary method for achieving end to end steering was to use computer vision models on a live feed of video data. However, to further increase accuracy, many companies have added data from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and or radar sensors through sensor fusion. However, the addition of lasers and sensors comes at a high financial cost. In this paper, I address both of these issues by increasing the accuracy of the computer vision models without the increased cost of using LiDAR and or sensors. I achieved this by improving the accuracy of computer vision models by sensor fusing CAN bus data, a vehicle protocol, with video data. CAN bus data is a rich source of information about the vehicle's state, including its speed, steering angle, and acceleration. By fusing this data with video data, the accuracy of the computer vision model's predictions can be improved. When I trained the model without CAN bus data, I obtained an RMSE of 0.02492, while the model trained with the CAN bus data achieved an RMSE of 0.01970. This finding indicates that fusing CAN Bus data with video data can reduce the computer vision model's prediction error by 20% with some models decreasing the error by 80%. ",

However, underwater multi-sensor fusion faces challenges such as heterogeneous frequency and dynamic availability of sensors. Traditional filter-based algorithms suffer from low accuracy and robustness when sensors become unavailable. The factor graph optimization (FGO) can enable multi-sensor plug-and-play despite data frequency. Therefore, we present an FGO-based strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) and long baseline location (LBL) system tightly coupled navigation system (FGO-ILNS). Sensors such as Doppler velocity log (DVL), magnetic compass pilot (MCP), pressure sensor (PS), and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) can be tightly coupled with FGO-ILNS to satisfy different navigation scenarios. In this system, we propose a floating LBL slant range difference factor model tightly coupled with IMU preintegration factor to achieve unification of global position above and below water. Furthermore, to address the issue of sensor measurements not being synchronized with the LBL during fusion, we employ forward-backward IMU preintegration to construct sensor factors such as GNSS and DVL. Moreover, we utilize the marginalization method to reduce the computational load of factor graph optimization. Simulation and public KAIST dataset experiments have verified that, compared to filter-based algorithms like the extended Kalman filter and federal Kalman filter, as well as the state-of-the-art optimization-based algorithm ORB-SLAM3, our proposed FGO-ILNS leads in accuracy and robustness.

However, several significant challenges persist in existing research on algorithmic emotion recognition. These challenges include the need for a robust model to effectively learn discriminative node attributes over long paths, the exploration of ambiguous topological information in EEG channels and effective frequency bands, and the mapping between intrinsic data qualities and provided labels. To address these challenges, this study introduces the distribution-based uncertainty method to represent spatial dependencies and temporal-spectral relativeness in EEG signals based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) architecture that adaptively assigns weights to functional aggregate node features, enabling effective long-path capturing while mitigating over-smoothing phenomena. Moreover, the graph mixup technique is employed to enhance latent connected edges and mitigate noisy label issues. Furthermore, we integrate the uncertainty learning method with deep GCN weights in a one-way learning fashion, termed Connectivity Uncertainty GCN (CU-GCN). We evaluate our approach on two widely used datasets, namely SEED and SEEDIV, for emotion recognition tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methodology over previous methods, yielding positive and significant improvements.

The co-existence approach toward ISAC focuses on the receiver processing of overlaid radar and communications signals coming from independent transmitters.

Prior DBD works ignore the evolution of the signal model over time. In this work, we consider a dynamic DBD scenario using a linear state space model (LSSM) such that, apart from the transmit signals and channels of both systems, the LSSM parameters are also unknown. We employ a factor graph representation to model these unknown variables. We avoid the conventional matrix inversion approach to estimate the unknown variables by using an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm, where each iteration employs a Gaussian message passing over the factor graph structure. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accurate estimation of radar and communications channels, including in the presence of noise. ",

However, images tend to consist of many objects whose colors are not perfectly consistent, resulting in the challenge that image is actually a $\\textit{discontinuous piecewise function}$ and cannot be well estimated by a continuous function. In this paper, we empirically investigate that if a neural network is enforced to fit a discontinuous piecewise function to reach a fixed small error, the time costs will increase exponentially with respect to the boundaries in the spatial domain of the target signal. We name this phenomenon the $\\textit{exponential-increase}$ hypothesis. Under the $\\textit{exponential-increase}$ hypothesis, learning INRs for images with many objects will converge very slowly. To address this issue, we first prove that partitioning a complex signal into several sub-regions and utilizing piecewise INRs to fit that signal can significantly speed up the convergence. Based on this fact, we introduce a simple partition mechanism to boost the performance of two INR methods for image reconstruction: one for learning INRs, and the other for learning-to-learn INRs. In both cases, we partition an image into different sub-regions and dedicate smaller networks for each part. In addition, we further propose two partition rules based on regular grids and semantic segmentation maps, respectively.

To relieve these issues, in this work we propose a novel Transformer-based learning framework named TransY-Net for remote sensing image CD, which improves the feature extraction from a global view and combines multi-level visual features in a pyramid manner. More specifically, the proposed framework first utilizes the advantages of Transformers in long-range dependency modeling. It can help to learn more discriminative global-level features and obtain complete CD regions. Then, we introduce a novel pyramid structure to aggregate multi-level visual features from Transformers for feature enhancement. The pyramid structure grafted with a Progressive Attention Module (PAM) can improve the feature representation ability with additional inter-dependencies through spatial and channel attentions. Finally, to better train the whole framework, we utilize the deeply-supervised learning with multiple boundary-aware loss functions.

    "abstract": "Current item-item collaborative filtering algorithms based on artificial neural network, such as Item2vec, have become ubiquitous and are widely applied in the modern recommender system. However, these approaches do not apply to the large-scale item-based recommendation system because of their extremely long training time. To overcome the shortcoming that current algorithms have high training time costs and poor stability when dealing with large-scale data sets, the item graph embedding algorithm Item-Graph2vec is described here. This algorithm transforms the users' shopping list into a item co-occurrence graph, obtains item sequences through randomly travelling on this co-occurrence graph and finally trains item vectors through sequence samples. We posit that because of the stable size of item, the size and density of the item co-occurrence graph change slightly with the increase in the training corpus. Therefore, Item-Graph2vec has a stable runtime on the large scale data set, and its performance advantage becomes more and more obvious with the growth of the training corpus. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world data sets demonstrate that Item-Graph2vec outperforms Item2vec by 3 times in terms of efficiency on douban data set, while the error generated by the random walk sampling is small.

    "abstract": "Molecular representation learning is fundamental for many drug related applications. Most existing molecular pre-training models are limited in using single molecular modality, either SMILES or graph representation. To effectively leverage both modalities, we argue that it is critical to capture the fine-grained 'semantics' between SMILES and graph, because subtle sequence/graph differences may lead to contrary molecular properties. In this paper, we propose a universal SMILE-graph representation learning model, namely UniMAP. Firstly, an embedding layer is employed to obtain the token and node/edge representation in SMILES and graph, respectively. A multi-layer Transformer is then utilized to conduct deep cross-modality fusion. Specially, four kinds of pre-training tasks are designed for UniMAP, including Multi-Level Cross-Modality Masking (CMM), SMILES-Graph Matching (SGM), Fragment-Level Alignment (FLA), and Domain Knowledge Learning (DKL). In this way, both global (i.e. SGM and DKL) and local (i.e. CMM and FLA) alignments are integrated to achieve comprehensive cross-modality fusion. We evaluate UniMAP on various downstream tasks, i.e. molecular property prediction, drug-target affinity prediction and drug-drug interaction. Experimental results show that UniMAP outperforms current state-of-the-art pre-training methods.We also visualize the learned representations to demonstrate the effect of multi-modality integration.

Most of the reported works focus on energy and spectrum efficiency, path loss analyses, and channel modeling. The extension to secure communications remains unexplored. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the secrecy capacity of the HMIMO network with multiple legitimate users and one eavesdropper while taking into consideration artificial noise and max-min fairness. We formulate the power allocation (PA) problem and address it by following successive convex approximation and Taylor expansion. We further study the effect of fixed PA coefficients, imperfect channel state information, inter-element spacing, and the number of Eve's antennas on the sum secrecy rate. Simulation results show that significant performance gain with more than 100\\% increment in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime for the two-user case is obtained by exploiting adaptive/flexible PA compared to the case with fixed PA coefficients.

    "abstract": "Tiny object detection has gained considerable attention in the research community owing to the frequent occurrence of tiny objects in numerous critical real-world scenarios. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used as the backbone for object detection architectures typically neglect Nyquist's sampling theorem during down-sampling operations, resulting in aliasing and degraded performance. This is likely to be a particular issue for tiny objects that occupy very few pixels and therefore have high spatial frequency features. This paper applied an existing approach WaveCNet for anti-aliasing to tiny object detection. WaveCNet addresses aliasing by replacing standard down-sampling processes in CNNs with Wavelet Pooling (WaveletPool) layers, effectively suppressing aliasing. We modify the original WaveCNet to apply WaveletPool in a consistent way in both pathways of the residual blocks in ResNets. Additionally, we also propose a bottom-heavy version of the backbone, which further improves the performance of tiny object detection while also reducing the required number of parameters by almost half. Experimental results on the TinyPerson, WiderFace, and DOTA datasets demonstrate the importance of anti-aliasing in tiny object detection and the effectiveness of the proposed method which achieves new state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.

The model is trained with an on-line imitation learning method. In order to obtain a better training set, a reinforcement learning agent that can directly obtain a ground truth bird's-eye view map from the Carla simulator as a perceptual output, is used as teacher for the imitation learning.

While separate solutions per class endow expensive computation and limited generalizability, this paper focuses on building a unified framework for multiple classes. Under such a challenging setting, popular reconstruction-based networks with continuous latent representation assumption always suffer from the \"identical shortcut\" issue, where both normal and abnormal samples can be well recovered and difficult to distinguish. To address this pivotal issue, we propose a hierarchical vector quantized prototype-oriented Transformer under a probabilistic framework. First, instead of learning the continuous representations, we preserve the typical normal patterns as discrete iconic prototypes, and confirm the importance of Vector Quantization in preventing the model from falling into the shortcut. The vector quantized iconic prototype is integrated into the Transformer for reconstruction, such that the abnormal data point is flipped to a normal data point.Second, we investigate an exquisite hierarchical framework to relieve the codebook collapse issue and replenish frail normal patterns. Third, a prototype-oriented optimal transport method is proposed to better regulate the prototypes and hierarchically evaluate the abnormal score. By evaluating on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, our model surpasses the state-of-the-art alternatives and possesses good interpretability.

Conventional CNN architectures benefit from exploiting the spatial correspondence between the input and output pixels. However, in 3D face reconstruction, the spatial misalignment between the input image (e.g. face) and the canonical/UV output makes the feature encoding-decoding process quite challenging. In this paper, to tackle this problem, we propose a new network architecture, namely the Affine Convolution Networks, which enables CNN based approaches to handle spatially non-corresponding input and output images and maintain high-fidelity quality output at the same time. In our method, an affine transformation matrix is learned from the affine convolution layer for each spatial location of the feature maps. In addition, we represent 3D human heads in UV space with multiple components, including diffuse maps for texture representation, position maps for geometry representation, and light maps for recovering more complex lighting conditions in the real world. All the components can be trained without any manual annotations. Our method is parametric-free and can generate high-quality UV maps at resolution of 512 x 512 pixels, while previous approaches normally generate 256 x 256 pixels or smaller.

However, in real-world scenarios, it is rare to have the chance to collect expert trajectories precisely in the target learning environment. To address this challenge, we propose a novel robust imitation learning approach, where we develop an inverse dynamics state representation learning objective to align the expert environment and the learning environment. With the abstract state representation, we design an effective reward function, which thoroughly measures the similarity between behavior data and expert data not only element-wise, but also from the trajectory level. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed approach under various visual perturbations and in diverse visual control tasks.

This enables the extraction of richer historical speech context without explicit error propagation. We also incorporate conditional latent variational modules to learn conversational level attributes such as role preference and topic coherence.

The text sanitization process starts with a privacy-oriented entity recognizer that seeks to determine the text spans expressing identifiable personal information. This privacy-oriented entity recognizer is trained by combining a standard named entity recognition model with a gazetteer populated by person-related terms extracted from Wikidata. The second step of the text sanitization process consists in assessing the privacy risk associated with each detected text span, either isolated or in combination with other text spans. We present five distinct indicators of the re-identification risk, respectively based on language model probabilities, text span classification, sequence labelling, perturbations, and web search. We provide a contrastive analysis of each privacy indicator and highlight their benefits and limitations, notably in relation to the available labeled data. ",

It arises when electrical conductors are immersed in an external time-varying magnetic field operating at frequencies for which electromagnetic wave propagation effects can be neglected. Popular formulations of the eddy current problem either use the magnetic vector potential or the magnetic scalar potential. They have individual advantages and disadvantages. One challenge is related to differential geometry: Scalar potential based formulations run into trouble when conductors are present in non-trivial topology, as approximation spaces must be then augmented with generators of the first cohomology group of the non-conducting domain. For all existing algorithms based on lowest order methods it is assumed that the extension of the graph-based algorithms to high-order approximations requires hierarchical bases for the curl-conforming discrete spaces. However, building on insight on de Rham complexes approximation with splines, we will show in the present submission that the hierarchical basis condition is not necessary. Algorithms based on spanning tree techniques can instead be adapted to work on an underlying hexahedral mesh arising from isomorphisms between spline spaces of differential forms and de Rham complexes on an auxiliary control mesh.

However, they often need more nuance in assessing the potential harm. Unfortunately, the content of this nature falls beyond the reach of generative models due to its potentially harmful nature. Ethical restrictions prohibit large language models (LLMs) from analyzing and classifying harmful erotics, let alone generating them to create synthetic datasets for other neural models. In such instances where data is scarce and challenging, a thorough analysis of the structure of such texts rather than a large model may offer a viable solution. Especially given that harmful erotic narratives, despite appearing similar to harmless ones, usually reveal their harmful nature first through contextual information hidden in the non-sexual parts of the narrative. This paper introduces a hybrid neural and rule-based context-aware system that leverages coreference resolution to identify harmful contextual cues in erotic content. Collaborating with professional moderators, we compiled a dataset and developed a classifier capable of distinguishing harmful from non-harmful erotic content. Our hybrid model, tested on Polish text, demonstrates a promising accuracy of 84% and a recall of 80%. Models based on RoBERTa and Longformer without explicit usage of coreference chains achieved significantly weaker results, underscoring the importance of coreference resolution in detecting such nuanced content as harmful erotics. This approach also offers the potential for enhanced visual explainability, supporting moderators in evaluating predictions and taking necessary actions to address harmful content. ",

However, rule-based models are hard to optimize, especially on large data sets, due to their discrete parameters and structures. Ensemble methods and fuzzy/soft rules are commonly used to improve performance, but they sacrifice the model interpretability. To obtain both good scalability and interpretability, we propose a new classifier, named Rule-based Representation Learner (RRL), that automatically learns interpretable non-fuzzy rules for data representation and classification. To train the non-differentiable RRL effectively, we project it to a continuous space and propose a novel training method, called Gradient Grafting, that can directly optimize the discrete model using gradient descent. A novel design of logical activation functions is also devised to increase the scalability of RRL and enable it to discretize the continuous features end-to-end. Exhaustive experiments on ten small and four large data sets show that RRL outperforms the competitive interpretable approaches and can be easily adjusted to obtain a trade-off between classification accuracy and model complexity for different scenarios.

Modern deep learning models have been brought to bear for these tasks too, as in the framework of plug-and-play or deep unrolling, where they loosely resemble proximal operators. Yet, something essential is lost in employing these purely data-driven approaches: there is no guarantee that a general deep network represents the proximal operator of any function, nor is there any characterization of the function for which the network might provide some approximate proximal. This not only makes guaranteeing convergence of iterative schemes challenging but, more fundamentally, complicates the analysis of what has been learned by these networks about their training data. Herein we provide a framework to develop learned proximal networks (LPN), prove that they provide exact proximal operators for a data-driven nonconvex regularizer, and show how a new training strategy, dubbed proximal matching, provably promotes the recovery of the log-prior of the true data distribution. Such LPN provide general, unsupervised, expressive proximal operators that can be used for general inverse problems with convergence guarantees. We illustrate our results in a series of cases of increasing complexity, demonstrating that these models not only result in state-of-the-art performance, but provide a window into the resulting priors learned from data.

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can unintentionally leak sensitive information present in their training data. In this paper, we present Model Perturbations (MoPe), a new method to identify with high confidence if a given text is in the training data of a pre-trained language model, given white-box access to the models parameters. MoPe adds noise to the model in parameter space and measures the drop in log-likelihood at a given point $x$, a statistic we show approximates the trace of the Hessian matrix with respect to model parameters. Across language models ranging from $70$M to $12$B parameters, we show that MoPe is more effective than existing loss-based attacks and recently proposed perturbation-based methods. We also examine the role of training point order and model size in attack success, and empirically demonstrate that MoPe accurately approximate the trace of the Hessian in practice. Our results show that the loss of a point alone is insufficient to determine extractability -- there are training points we can recover using our method that have average loss. This casts some doubt on prior works that use the loss of a point as evidence of memorization or unlearning. ",

    "abstract": "The Transformer architecture has gained significant popularity in computer vision tasks due to its capacity to generalize and capture long-range dependencies. This characteristic makes it well-suited for generating spatiotemporal tokens from videos. On the other hand, convolutions serve as the fundamental backbone for processing images and videos, as they efficiently aggregate information within small local neighborhoods to create spatial tokens that describe the spatial dimension of a video. While both CNN-based architectures and pure transformer architectures are extensively studied and utilized by researchers, the effective combination of these two backbones has not received comparable attention in the field of activity recognition. In this research, we propose a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both CNNs and Transformers in an hybrid architecture for performing activity recognition using RGB videos. Specifically, we suggest employing a CNN network to enhance the video representation by generating a 128-channel video that effectively separates the human performing the activity from the background. Subsequently, the output of the CNN module is fed into a transformer to extract spatiotemporal tokens, which are then used for classification purposes. Our architecture has achieved new SOTA results with 90.05 \\%, 99.6\\%, and 95.09\\% on HMDB51, UCF101, and ETRI-Activity3D respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Graphs are mathematical tools that can be used to represent complex real-world interconnected systems, such as financial markets and social networks. Hence, machine learning (ML) over graphs has attracted significant attention recently. However, it has been demonstrated that ML over graphs amplifies the already existing bias towards certain under-represented groups in various decision-making problems due to the information aggregation over biased graph structures. Faced with this challenge, here we take a fresh look at the problem of bias mitigation in graph-based learning by borrowing insights from graph signal processing. Our idea is to introduce predesigned graph filters within an ML pipeline to reduce a novel unsupervised bias measure, namely the correlation between sensitive attributes and the underlying graph connectivity. We show that the optimal design of said filters can be cast as a convex problem in the graph spectral domain. We also formulate a linear programming (LP) problem informed by a theoretical bias analysis, which attains a closed-form solution and leads to a more efficient fairness-aware graph filter. Finally, for a design whose degrees of freedom are independent of the input graph size, we minimize the bias metric over the family of polynomial graph convolutional filters. Our optimal filter designs offer complementary strengths to explore favorable fairness-utility-complexity tradeoffs. For performance evaluation, we conduct extensive and reproducible node classification experiments over real-world networks. Our results show that the proposed framework leads to better fairness measures together with similar utility compared to state-of-the-art fairness-aware baselines. ",

However, resource utilization optimization is a significant challenge for cloud service providers, since the earlier focus is provided on optimizing resources for the applications that run on the cloud, with a low emphasis being provided on optimizing resource utilization of the cloud computing internal processes. Code refactoring has been associated with improving the maintenance and understanding of software code. However, analyzing the impact of the refactoring source code of the cloud and studying its impact on cloud resource usage require further analysis. In this paper, we propose a framework called Unified Regression Modelling (URegM) which predicts the impact of code smell refactoring on cloud resource usage. We test our experiments in a real-life cloud environment using a complex scientific application as a workload. Results show that URegM is capable of accurately predicting resource consumption due to code smell refactoring. This will permit cloud service providers with advanced knowledge about the impact of refactoring code smells on resource consumption, thus allowing them to plan their resource provisioning and code refactoring more effectively.

    "abstract": "CNN-based object detection methods have achieved significant progress in recent years. The classic structures of CNNs produce pyramid-like feature maps due to the pooling or other re-scale operations. The feature maps in different levels of the feature pyramid are used to detect objects with different scales. For more accurate object detection, the highest-level feature, which has the lowest resolution and contains the strongest semantics, is up-scaled and connected with the lower-level features to enhance the semantics in the lower-level features. However, the classic mode of feature connection combines the feature of lower-level with all the features above it, which may result in semantics degradation. In this paper, we propose a skipped connection to obtain stronger semantics at each level of the feature pyramid. In our method, the lower-level feature only connects with the feature at the highest level, making it more reasonable that each level is responsible for detecting objects with fixed scales. In addition, we simplify the generation of anchor for bounding box regression, which can further improve the accuracy of object detection. The experiments on the MS COCO and Wider Face demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "General large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable success, but it has also raised concerns among people about the misuse of AI-generated texts. Therefore, an important question is how to detect whether the texts are generated by ChatGPT or by humans. Existing detectors are built on the assumption that there is a distribution gap between human-generated and AI-generated texts. These gaps are typically identified using statistical information or classifiers. In contrast to prior research methods, we find that large language models such as ChatGPT exhibit strong self-consistency in text generation and continuation. Self-consistency capitalizes on the intuition that AI-generated texts can still be reasoned with by large language models using the same logical reasoning when portions of the texts are masked, which differs from human-generated texts. Using this observation, we subsequently proposed a new method for AI-generated texts detection based on self-consistency with masked predictions to determine whether a text is generated by LLMs. This method, which we call DetectGPT-SC. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of DetectGPT-SC. In these experiments, we employed various mask scheme, zero-shot, and simple prompt for completing masked texts and self-consistency predictions. The results indicate that DetectGPT-SC outperforms the current state-of-the-art across different tasks. ",

Recent pre-computation-based HGNNs use one-time message passing to transform a heterogeneous graph into regular-shaped tensors, enabling efficient mini-batch training. Existing pre-computation-based HGNNs can be mainly categorized into two styles, which differ in how much information loss is allowed and efficiency. We propose a hybrid pre-computation-based HGNN, named Random Projection Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (RpHGNN), which combines the benefits of one style's efficiency with the low information loss of the other style. To achieve efficiency, the main framework of RpHGNN consists of propagate-then-update iterations, where we introduce a Random Projection Squashing step to ensure that complexity increases only linearly. To achieve low information loss, we introduce a Relation-wise Neighbor Collection component with an Even-odd Propagation Scheme, which aims to collect information from neighbors in a finer-grained way. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on seven small and large benchmark datasets while also being 230% faster compared to the most effective baseline.

The essence of our method involves reducing the sampling space of NeRF to a lower resolution and subsequently reinstating it to the original size utilizing a pre-trained VAE decoder, thereby effectively mitigating the sampling time bottleneck encountered during rendering. Although the codebook furnishes representative features, reconstructing fine texture details of the scene remains challenging due to high compression rates. To overcome this constraint, we design an innovative multi-scale NeRF sampling scheme that concurrently optimizes the NeRF model at both compressed and original scales to enhance the network's ability to preserve fine details. Furthermore, we incorporate a semantic loss function to improve the geometric fidelity and semantic coherence of our 3D reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in achieving the optimal trade-off between rendering quality and efficiency.

We aim to address the challenge of LiDAR spoofing attacks, where attackers inject fake objects into LiDAR data and fool AVs to misinterpret their environment and make erroneous decisions. However, current defense algorithms predominantly depend on perception outputs (i.e., bounding boxes) thus face limitations in detecting attackers given the bounding boxes are generated by imperfect perception models processing limited points, acquired based on the ego vehicle's viewpoint. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework, named ADoPT (Anomaly Detection based on Point-level Temporal consistency), which quantitatively measures temporal consistency across consecutive frames and identifies abnormal objects based on the coherency of point clusters.

Despite impressive results, these well-designed models perform poorly on out-of-domain data. One possible solution is to augment the training data with counterfactuals, which are generated by minimally altering the causal features of the original data. However, current counterfactual data augmentation techniques fail to handle multi-hop fact verification due to their incapability to preserve the complex logical relationships within multiple correlated texts. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by developing a rationale-sensitive method to generate linguistically diverse and label-flipping counterfactuals while preserving logical relationships. In specific, the diverse and fluent counterfactuals are generated via an Explain-Edit-Generate architecture. Moreover, the checking and filtering modules are proposed to regularize the counterfactual data with logical relations and flipped labels. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the SOTA baselines and can generate linguistically diverse counterfactual data without disrupting their logical relationships. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, contrastive learning has emerged as a dominant self-supervised paradigm, attracting numerous research interests in the field of graph learning. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to embed augmented anchor samples close to each other while pushing the embeddings of other samples (negative samples) apart. However, existing GCL methods require large and diverse negative samples to ensure the quality of embeddings, and recent studies typically leverage samples excluding the anchor and positive samples as negative samples, potentially introducing false negative samples (negatives that share the same class as the anchor). Additionally, this practice can result in heavy computational burden and high time complexity of $O(N^2)$, which is particularly unaffordable for large graphs. To address these deficiencies, we leverage rank learning and propose a simple yet effective model, GraphRank. Specifically, we first generate two graph views through corruption. Then, we compute the similarity of pairwise nodes (anchor node and positive node) in both views, an arbitrary node in the latter view is selected as a negative node, and its similarity with the anchor node is computed. Based on this, we introduce rank-based learning to measure similarity scores which successfully relieve the false negative provlem and decreases the time complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$. Moreover, we conducted extensive experiments across multiple graph tasks, demonstrating that GraphRank performs favorably against other cutting-edge GCL methods in various tasks. ",

While existing fairness works on graphs mainly focus on protecting sensitive attributes (e.g., age and gender), the fairness incurred by the graph structure should also be given attention. On the other hand, the information aggregation mechanism of graph neural networks amplifies such structure unfairness, as marginal nodes are often far away from other nodes. In this paper, we focus on novel fairness incurred by the graph structure on graph neural networks, named \\emph{structure fairness}. Specifically, we first analyzed multiple graphs and observed that marginal nodes in graphs have a worse performance of downstream tasks than others in graph neural networks. Motivated by the observation, we propose \\textbf{S}tructural \\textbf{Fair} \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{N}etwork (SFairGNN), which combines neighborhood expansion based structure debiasing with hop-aware attentive information aggregation to achieve structure fairness.

    "abstract": "The success of online social platforms hinges on their ability to predict and understand user behavior at scale. Here, we present data suggesting that context-aware modeling approaches may offer a holistic yet lightweight and potentially privacy-preserving representation of user engagement on online social platforms. Leveraging deep LSTM neural networks to analyze more than 100 million Snapchat sessions from almost 80.000 users, we demonstrate that patterns of active and passive use are predictable from past behavior (R2=0.345) and that the integration of context information substantially improves predictive performance compared to the behavioral baseline model (R2=0.522). Features related to smartphone connectivity status, location, temporal context, and weather were found to capture non-redundant variance in user engagement relative to features derived from histories of in-app behaviors. Further, we show that a large proportion of variance can be accounted for with minimal behavioral histories if momentary context information is considered (R2=0.44). These results indicate the potential of context-aware approaches for making models more efficient and privacy-preserving by reducing the need for long data histories. Finally, we employ model explainability techniques to glean preliminary insights into the underlying behavioral mechanisms. Our findings are consistent with the notion of context-contingent, habit-driven patterns of active and passive use, underscoring the value of contextualized representations of user behavior for predicting user engagement on social platforms.

Since RV is known to be skewed and have a fat tail, previous methods transform RV into values that follow a latent distribution with an explicit shape and then apply a prediction model. However, knowing that shape is non-trivial, and the transformation result influences the prediction model. This paper proposes to jointly train the transformation and the prediction model. The training process follows a maximum-likelihood objective function that is derived from the assumption that the prediction residuals on the transformed RV time series are homogeneously Gaussian. The objective function is further approximated using an expectation-maximum algorithm. On a dataset of 100 stocks, our method significantly outperforms other methods using analytical or naive neural-network transformations. ",

This paper proposes a novel Knowledge-Induced Medicine Prescribing Network (KindMed) framework to recommend medicines by inducing knowledge from myriad medical-related external sources upon the EHR cohort, rendering them as medical knowledge graphs (KGs). On top of relation-aware graph representation learning to unravel an adequate embedding of such KGs, we leverage hierarchical sequence learning to discover and fuse clinical and medicine temporal dynamics across patients' historical admissions for encouraging personalized recommendations. In predicting safe, precise, and personalized medicines, we devise an attentive prescribing that accounts for and associates three essential aspects, i.e., a summary of joint historical medical records, clinical condition progression, and the current clinical state of patients. We exhibited the effectiveness of our KindMed on the augmented real-world EHR cohorts, etching leading performances against graph-driven competing baselines. ",

An important way to solve this problem is establishing a local geometry to fit the local curve. However, previous methods build either a local plane or polynomial curve. Local plane brings the loss of sharp feature and the boundary artefacts on open surface. Polynomial curve is hard to combine with neural network due to the local coordinate consistent problem. To address this, we propose a novel polyhedral surface to represent local surface. This method provides more flexible to represent sharp feature and surface boundary on open surface. It does not require any local coordinate system, which is important when introducing neural networks. Specifically, we use normals to construct the polyhedral surface, including both dihedral and trihedral surfaces using 2 and 3 normals, respectively.

This could lead to disastrous results on critical applications such as self-driving cars, surveillance security, and medical diagnosis. At present, adversarial training is one of the most effective defenses against adversarial examples. However, traditional adversarial training makes it difficult to achieve a good trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness since spurious features are still learned by DNNs. The intrinsic reason is that traditional adversarial training makes it difficult to fully learn core features from adversarial examples when adversarial noise and clean examples cannot be disentangled. In this paper, we disentangle the adversarial examples into natural and perturbed patterns by bit-plane slicing. We assume the higher bit-planes represent natural patterns and the lower bit-planes represent perturbed patterns, respectively. We propose a Feature-Focusing Adversarial Training (F$^2$AT), which differs from previous work in that it enforces the model to focus on the core features from natural patterns and reduce the impact of spurious features from perturbed patterns. The experimental results demonstrated that F$^2$AT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. ",

However, these models involve many computationally expensive denoising steps and sampling operations that make them a less desirable option for real-time safety-critical applications. To this end, we present a novel framework that leverages diffusion models for predicting future trajectories in a computationally efficient manner. To minimize the computational bottlenecks in iterative sampling, we employ an efficient sampling mechanism that allows us to maximize the number of sampled trajectories for improved accuracy while maintaining inference time in real time. Moreover, we propose a scoring mechanism to select the most plausible trajectories by assigning relative ranks.

This inspires us to rethink current SNN from the perspective of tensor-relevant theories. Using tensor decomposition, we design the \\textit{projected full attention} (PFA) module, which demonstrates excellent results with linearly growing parameters. Specifically, PFA is composed by the \\textit{linear projection of spike tensor} (LPST) module and \\textit{attention map composing} (AMC) module. In LPST, we start by compressing the original spike tensor into three projected tensors using a single property-preserving strategy with learnable parameters for each dimension. Then, in AMC, we exploit the inverse procedure of the tensor decomposition process to combine the three tensors into the attention map using a so-called connecting factor. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed PFA module, we integrate it into the widely used VGG and ResNet architectures for classification tasks.

Recent studies have recognized that the existence of adversarial examples poses a security threat to deep hashing models, that is, adversarial vulnerability. Notably, it is challenging to efficiently distill reliable semantic representatives for deep hashing to guide adversarial learning, and thereby it hinders the enhancement of adversarial robustness of deep hashing-based retrieval models. Moreover, current researches on adversarial training for deep hashing are hard to be formalized into a unified minimax structure. In this paper, we explore Semantic-Aware Adversarial Training (SAAT) for improving the adversarial robustness of deep hashing models. Specifically, we conceive a discriminative mainstay features learning (DMFL) scheme to construct semantic representatives for guiding adversarial learning in deep hashing. Particularly, our DMFL with the strict theoretical guarantee is adaptively optimized in a discriminative learning manner, where both discriminative and semantic properties are jointly considered. Moreover, adversarial examples are fabricated by maximizing the Hamming distance between the hash codes of adversarial samples and mainstay features, the efficacy of which is validated in the adversarial attack trials. Further, we, for the first time, formulate the formalized adversarial training of deep hashing into a unified minimax optimization under the guidance of the generated mainstay codes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show superb attack performance against the state-of-the-art algorithms, meanwhile, the proposed adversarial training can effectively eliminate adversarial perturbations for trustworthy deep hashing-based retrieval.

Following the recent neural 4D light field network (NeuLF), Relit-NeuLF first leverages a two-plane light field representation to parameterize each ray in a 4D coordinate system, enabling efficient learning and inference. Then, we recover the spatially-varying bidirectional reflectance distribution function (SVBRDF) of a 3D scene in a self-supervised manner. A DecomposeNet learns to map each ray to its SVBRDF components: albedo, normal, and roughness. Based on the decomposed BRDF components and conditioning light directions, a RenderNet learns to synthesize the color of the ray. To self-supervise the SVBRDF decomposition, we encourage the predicted ray color to be close to the physically-based rendering result using the microfacet model.

ASAP) algorithm which perturbs an MCMC sample with noise proportional to its Wasserstein-infinity ($W_\\infty$) distance from a reference distribution that satisfies pure DP or pure Gaussian DP (i.e., $\\delta=0$). We then leverage a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to generate the sample and prove that the algorithm converges in W$_\\infty$ distance. We show that by combining our new techniques with a careful localization step, we obtain the first nearly linear-time algorithm that achieves the optimal rates in the DP-ERM problem with strongly convex and smooth losses.

However, security and privacy guarantees could be compromised due to malicious participants and the centralized FL server. This article proposed a bi-level blockchained architecture for secure federated learning-based traffic prediction. The bottom and top layer blockchain store the local model and global aggregated parameters accordingly, and the distributed homomorphic-encrypted federated averaging (DHFA) scheme addresses the secure computation problems. We propose the partial private key distribution protocol and a partially homomorphic encryption/decryption scheme to achieve the distributed privacy-preserving federated averaging model. We conduct extensive experiments to measure the running time of DHFA operations, quantify the read and write performance of the blockchain network, and elucidate the impacts of varying regional group sizes and model complexities on the resulting prediction accuracy for the online traffic flow prediction task. The results indicate that the proposed system can facilitate secure and decentralized federated learning for real-world traffic prediction tasks. ",

In this work, we make use of the underlying nature of time, all temporally-scoped sentences are strung together through a one-dimensional time axis, and suggest creating a graph structure based on the relative placements of events along the time axis.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the scale imbalance problem of semi-supervised object detection(SSOD) in aerial images. Compared to natural images, objects in aerial images show smaller sizes and larger quantities per image, increasing the difficulty of manual annotation. Meanwhile, the advanced SSOD technique can train superior detectors by leveraging limited labeled data and massive unlabeled data, saving annotation costs. However, as an understudied task in aerial images, SSOD suffers from a drastic performance drop when facing a large proportion of small objects. By analyzing the predictions between small and large objects, we identify three imbalance issues caused by the scale bias, i.e., pseudo-label imbalance, label assignment imbalance, and negative learning imbalance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Scale-discriminative Semi-Supervised Object Detection (S^3OD) learning pipeline for aerial images. In our S^3OD, three key components, Size-aware Adaptive Thresholding (SAT), Size-rebalanced Label Assignment (SLA), and Teacher-guided Negative Learning (TNL), are proposed to warrant scale unbiased learning. Specifically, SAT adaptively selects appropriate thresholds to filter pseudo-labels for objects at different scales. SLA balances positive samples of objects at different scales through resampling and reweighting. TNL alleviates the imbalance in negative samples by leveraging information generated by a teacher model. Extensive experiments conducted on the DOTA-v1.5 benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods over state-of-the-art competitors. Codes will be released soon. ",

In this work, we propose the EDAIN (Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization) layer, a novel adaptive neural layer that learns how to appropriately normalize irregular time series data for a given task in an end-to-end fashion, instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. This is achieved by optimizing its unknown parameters simultaneously with the deep neural network using back-propagation. Our experiments, conducted using synthetic data, a credit default prediction dataset, and a large-scale limit order book benchmark dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of the EDAIN layer when compared to conventional normalization methods and existing adaptive time series preprocessing layers.

In the integrated heat-power system with coupling heat-power generators and demands, the key challenges lie in the interaction between heat and power, the inherent uncertainty of renewable energy and consumers' demands, and the multi-timescale scheduling of heat and power. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic model of the integrated heat-power system. For the welfare-maximizing community operator, its energy dispatch strategy is under chance constraints, where the day-ahead scheduling determines the scheduled energy dispatching strategies, and the real-time dispatch considers the adjustment of generators. For utility-maximizing consumers, their demands are sensitive to the preference parameters. Taking into account the uncertainty in both renewable energy and consumer demand, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg game equilibrium and develop a fixed point algorithm to find the market equilibrium between the community operator and community consumers. Numerical simulations on integrated heat-power system validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-timescale integrated heat and power model. ",

Scrutinizing previous studies, we can reveal a common scheme consisting of three key components: (1) graph tokenizer, which breaks a molecular graph into smaller fragments (i.e., subgraphs) and converts them into tokens; (2) graph masking, which corrupts the graph with masks; (3) graph autoencoder, which first applies an encoder on the masked graph to generate the representations, and then employs a decoder on the representations to recover the tokens of the original graph. However, the previous MGM studies focus extensively on graph masking and encoder, while there is limited understanding of tokenizer and decoder. To bridge the gap, we first summarize popular molecule tokenizers at the granularity of node, edge, motif, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and then examine their roles as the MGM's reconstruction targets. Further, we explore the potential of adopting an expressive decoder in MGM. Our results show that a subgraph-level tokenizer and a sufficiently expressive decoder with remask decoding have a large impact on the encoder's representation learning. Finally, we propose a novel MGM method SimSGT, featuring a Simple GNN-based Tokenizer (SGT) and an effective decoding strategy.

To that end, after presenting the classical DG scheme, we show how to enrich its basis with a prior. Convergence results and error estimates follow, in which we prove that the basis with prior does not change the order of convergence, and that the error constant is improved. To construct the prior, we elect to use parametric PINNs, which we introduce, as well as the algorithms to construct a prior from PINNs. We finally perform several validation experiments on four different hyperbolic balance laws to highlight the properties of the scheme. Namely, we show that the DG scheme with prior is much more accurate on steady solutions than the DG scheme without prior, while retaining the same approximation quality on unsteady solutions. ",

Network models present a potent approach to studying such spreading phenomena because of their ability to represent complex social interactions. While previous studies have shown that network centrality measures are generally able to identify influential spreaders in a susceptible population, it is not yet known if they can also be used to predict infection risks. However, information about infection risks at the individual level is vital for the design of targeted interventions. Here, we use large-scale administrative data from the Netherlands to study whether centrality measures can predict the risk and timing of infections with COVID-19-like diseases. We investigate this issue leveraging the framework of multi-layer networks, which accounts for interactions taking place in different contexts, such as workplaces, households and schools. In epidemic models simulated on real-world network data from over one million individuals, we find that existing centrality measures offer good predictions of relative infection risks, and are correlated with the timing of individual infections. We however find no association between centrality measures and real SARS-CoV-2 test data, which indicates that population-scale network data alone cannot aid predictions of virus transmission. ",

ESS operators can reap benefits from energy arbitrage by optimizing operations of storage equipment. To further enhance ESS flexibility within the energy market and improve renewable energy utilization, a heterogeneous photovoltaic-ESS (PV-ESS) is proposed, which leverages the unique characteristics of battery energy storage (BES) and hydrogen energy storage (HES). For scheduling tasks of the heterogeneous PV-ESS, cost description plays a crucial role in guiding operator's strategies to maximize benefits. We develop a comprehensive cost function that takes into account degradation, capital, and operation/maintenance costs to reflect real-world scenarios. Moreover, while numerous methods excel in optimizing ESS energy arbitrage, they often rely on black-box models with opaque decision-making processes, limiting practical applicability. To overcome this limitation and enable transparent scheduling strategies, a prototype-based policy network with inherent interpretability is introduced. This network employs human-designed prototypes to guide decision-making by comparing similarities between prototypical situations and encountered situations, which allows for naturally explained scheduling strategies. Comparative results across four distinct cases underscore the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed pre-hoc interpretable optimization method when contrasted with black-box models. ",

Deep reinforcement learning has the potential to address these problems by learning optimal control policies through exploration in an environment. For safety-critical environments, it is impractical to explore randomly, and replacing conventional controllers with black-box models is also undesirable. Also, it is expensive in continuous state and action spaces, unless the search space is constrained. To address these challenges we propose a specialized deep residual policy safe reinforcement learning with a cycle of learning approach adapted for complex and continuous state-action spaces. Residual policy learning allows learning a hybrid control architecture where the reinforcement learning agent acts in synchronous collaboration with the conventional controller. The cycle of learning initiates the policy through the expert trajectory and guides the exploration around it. Further, the specialization through the input-output hidden Markov model helps to optimize policy that lies within the region of interest (such as abnormality), where the reinforcement learning agent is required and is activated. The proposed solution is validated on the Tennessee Eastman process control. ",

For neural networks, softmax prediction probabilities are often used as a confidence measure, despite the fact that they are known to be overconfident, even for wrong predictions. This phenomenon is particularly intensified in the presence of sample selection bias, i.e., when data labeling is subject to some constraint. To address this issue, we propose a novel confidence measure, called $\\mathcal{T}$-similarity, built upon the prediction diversity of an ensemble of linear classifiers. We provide the theoretical analysis of our approach by studying stationary points and describing the relationship between the diversity of the individual members and their performance. We empirically demonstrate the benefit of our confidence measure for three different pseudo-labeling policies on classification datasets of various data modalities. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-label text classification is a critical task in the industry. It helps to extract structured information from large amount of textual data. We propose Text to Topic (Text2Topic), which achieves high multi-label classification performance by employing a Bi-Encoder Transformer architecture that utilizes concatenation, subtraction, and multiplication of embeddings on both text and topic. Text2Topic also supports zero-shot predictions, produces domain-specific text embeddings, and enables production-scale batch-inference with high throughput. The final model achieves accurate and comprehensive results compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including large language models (LLMs). In this study, a total of 239 topics are defined, and around 1.6 million text-topic pairs annotations (in which 200K are positive) are collected on approximately 120K texts from 3 main data sources on Booking.com. The data is collected with optimized smart sampling and partial labeling. The final Text2Topic model is deployed on a real-world stream processing platform, and it outperforms other models with 92.9% micro mAP, as well as a 75.8% macro mAP score. We summarize the modeling choices which are extensively tested through ablation studies, and share detailed in-production decision-making steps. ",

    "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated the efficacy of pre-training graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the transferable graph semantics and enhance the performance of various downstream tasks. However, the semantic knowledge learned from pretext tasks might be unrelated to the downstream task, leading to a semantic gap that limits the application of graph pre-training. To reduce this gap, traditional approaches propose hybrid pre-training to combine various pretext tasks together in a multi-task learning fashion and learn multi-grained knowledge, which, however, cannot distinguish tasks and results in some transferable task-specific knowledge distortion by each other. Moreover, most GNNs cannot distinguish nodes located in different parts of the graph, making them fail to learn position-specific knowledge and lead to suboptimal performance. In this work, inspired by the prompt-based tuning in natural language processing, we propose a unified framework for graph hybrid pre-training which injects the task identification and position identification into GNNs through a prompt mechanism, namely multi-task graph dual prompt (ULTRA-DP). Based on this framework, we propose a prompt-based transferability test to find the most relevant pretext task in order to reduce the semantic gap. To implement the hybrid pre-training tasks, beyond the classical edge prediction task (node-node level), we further propose a novel pre-training paradigm based on a group of $k$-nearest neighbors (node-group level). The combination of them across different scales is able to comprehensively express more structural semantics and derive richer multi-grained knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our proposed ULTRA-DP can significantly enhance the performance of hybrid pre-training methods and show the generalizability to other pre-training tasks and backbone architectures.

In order to address these requirements, Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) has emerged as a novel research area in computer vision, focusing on achieving both adaptation ability and robustness (i.e., the ability to detect out-of-distribution samples). While UniDA has led significant progress in computer vision, its application on language input still needs to be explored despite its feasibility. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for natural language that offers thorough viewpoints of the model's generalizability and robustness. Our benchmark encompasses multiple datasets with varying difficulty levels and characteristics, including temporal shifts and diverse domains. On top of our testbed, we validate existing UniDA methods from computer vision and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques from NLP literature, yielding valuable findings: We observe that UniDA methods originally designed for image input can be effectively transferred to the natural language domain while also underscoring the effect of adaptation difficulty in determining the model's performance.

This paper introduces two new tasks to address this shortcoming by considering paraphrase types - specific linguistic perturbations at particular text positions. We name these tasks Paraphrase Type Generation and Paraphrase Type Detection. Our results suggest that while current techniques perform well in a binary classification scenario, i.e., paraphrased or not, the inclusion of fine-grained paraphrase types poses a significant challenge. While most approaches are good at generating and detecting general semantic similar content, they fail to understand the intrinsic linguistic variables they manipulate. Models trained in generating and identifying paraphrase types also show improvements in tasks without them. In addition, scaling these models further improves their ability to understand paraphrase types. We believe paraphrase types can unlock a new paradigm for developing paraphrase models and solving tasks in the future. ",

In this context, as the knowledge graph grows in size, it is prone to have noisy and messy data. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding (KGE) methods to learn numerical representations of the graph entities and, subsequently, explore downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, and triple classification. We also investigate Graph neural networks (GNN) alongside KGEs and compare their performance on the same downstream tasks. Our evaluation highlights the encouraging performance of both KGE and GNN-based methods on node classification, and the superiority of GNN approaches in the link prediction task. Overall, we show that state-of-the-art approaches are relevant in a WoT context, and this preliminary work provides insights to implement and evaluate them in this context. ",

    "abstract": "At the heart of contemporary recommender systems (RSs) are latent factor models that provide quality recommendation experience to users. These models use embedding vectors, which are typically of a uniform and fixed size, to represent users and items. As the number of users and items continues to grow, this design becomes inefficient and hard to scale. Recent lightweight embedding methods have enabled different users and items to have diverse embedding sizes, but are commonly subject to two major drawbacks. Firstly, they limit the embedding size search to optimizing a heuristic balancing the recommendation quality and the memory complexity, where the trade-off coefficient needs to be manually tuned for every memory budget requested. The implicitly enforced memory complexity term can even fail to cap the parameter usage, making the resultant embedding table fail to meet the memory budget strictly. Secondly, most solutions, especially reinforcement learning based ones derive and optimize the embedding size for each each user/item on an instance-by-instance basis, which impedes the search efficiency. In this paper, we propose Budgeted Embedding Table (BET), a novel method that generates table-level actions (i.e., embedding sizes for all users and items) that is guaranteed to meet pre-specified memory budgets. Furthermore, by leveraging a set-based action formulation and engaging set representation learning, we present an innovative action search strategy powered by an action fitness predictor that efficiently evaluates each table-level action. Experiments have shown state-of-the-art performance on two real-world datasets when BET is paired with three popular recommender models under different memory budgets. ",

It can lead to loss of assets, inaccurate fare estimation, enforcing the wrong speed limit, miscalculated toll tax, passengers reaching an incorrect location, etc. The techniques designed to prevent and detect spoofing by using cryptographic solutions or receivers capable of differentiating legitimate and attack signals are insufficient in detecting GNSS spoofing of road users. Recent studies, testbeds, and 3GPP standards are exploring the possibility of hybrid positioning, where GNSS data will be combined with the 5G-NR positioning to increase the security and accuracy of positioning. We design the Location Estimation and Recovery(LER) systems to estimate the correct absolute position using the combination of GNSS and 5G positioning with other road users, where a subset of road users can be malicious and collude to prevent spoofing detection. Our Location Verification Protocol extends the understanding of Message Time of Arrival Codes (MTAC) to prevent attacks against malicious provers. The novel Recovery and Meta Protocol uses road users' dynamic and unpredictable nature to detect GNSS spoofing. This protocol provides fast detection of GNSS spoofing with a very low rate of false positives and can be customized to a large family of settings. Even in a (highly unrealistic) worst-case scenario where each user is malicious with a probability of as large as 0.3, our protocol detects GNSS spoofing with high probability after communication and ranging with at most 20 road users, with a false positive rate close to 0. SUMO simulations for road traffic show that we can detect GNSS spoofing in 2.6 minutes since its start under moderate traffic conditions. ",

Most of them obtain embeddings by learning the structure of the knowledge graph within a link prediction setting. As a result, the embeddings reflect only the semantics of a single knowledge graph, and embeddings for different knowledge graphs are not aligned, e.g., they cannot be used to find similar entities across knowledge graphs via nearest neighbor search. However, knowledge graph embedding applications such as entity disambiguation require a more global representation, i.e., a representation that is valid across multiple sources. We propose to learn universal knowledge graph embeddings from large-scale interlinked knowledge sources. To this end, we fuse large knowledge graphs based on the owl:sameAs relation such that every entity is represented by a unique identity. We instantiate our idea by computing universal embeddings based on DBpedia and Wikidata yielding embeddings for about 180 million entities, 15 thousand relations, and 1.2 billion triples. Moreover, we develop a convenient API to provide embeddings as a service. Experiments on link prediction show that universal knowledge graph embeddings encode better semantics compared to embeddings computed on a single knowledge graph.

We propose an optimisation algorithm which addresses both of these concerns - to our knowledge, the first efficiently-scalable optimisation algorithm to asymptotically use the exact (eigenvalue-modified) inverse Hessian. Our method frames the problem as a series which principally square-roots and inverts the squared Hessian, then uses it to precondition a gradient vector, all without explicitly computing or eigendecomposing the Hessian. A truncation of this infinite series provides a new optimisation algorithm which is scalable and comparable to other first- and second-order optimisation methods in both runtime and optimisation performance.

    "abstract": "The task of action-driven human motion prediction aims to forecast future human motion from the observed sequence while respecting the given action label. It requires modeling not only the stochasticity within human motion but the smooth yet realistic transition between multiple action labels. However, the fact that most of the datasets do not contain such transition data complicates this task. Existing work tackles this issue by learning a smoothness prior to simply promote smooth transitions, yet doing so can result in unnatural transitions especially when the history and predicted motions differ significantly in orientations. In this paper, we argue that valid human motion transitions should incorporate realistic leg movements to handle orientation changes, and cast it as an action-conditioned in-betweening (ACB) learning task to encourage transition naturalness. Because modeling all possible transitions is virtually unreasonable, our ACB is only performed on very few selected action classes with active gait motions, such as Walk or Run. Specifically, we follow a two-stage forecasting strategy by first employing the motion diffusion model to generate the target motion with a specified future action, and then producing the in-betweening to smoothly connect the observation and prediction to eventually address motion prediction. Our method is completely free from the labeled motion transition data during training. To show the robustness of our approach, we generalize our trained in-betweening learning model on one dataset to two unseen large-scale motion datasets to produce natural transitions. Extensive methods on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method yields the state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual quality, prediction accuracy, and action faithfulness. ",

These facts are, however, merely surface forms, the ambiguity of which impedes their downstream usage; e.g., the surface phrase \"Michael Jordan\" may refer to either the former basketball player or the university professor. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), on the other hand, contain facts in a canonical (i.e., unambiguous) form, but their coverage is limited by a static schema (i.e., a fixed set of entities and predicates). To bridge this gap, we need the best of both worlds: (i) high coverage of free-text OIEs, and (ii) semantic precision (i.e., monosemy) of KGs. In order to achieve this goal, we propose a new benchmark with novel evaluation protocols that can, for example, measure fact linking performance on a granular triple slot level, while also measuring if a system has the ability to recognize that a surface form has no match in the existing KG. Our extensive evaluation of several baselines show that detection of out-of-KG entities and predicates is more difficult than accurate linking to existing ones, thus calling for more research efforts on this difficult task.

However, the high-dimensional nature of the data, coupled with the intricate complexity of biological systems renders this task nontrivial. Within the machine learning community, there has been a recent increase of interest in causality, with a focus on adapting established causal techniques and algorithms to handle high-dimensional data. In this perspective, we delineate the application of these methodologies within the realm of single-cell genomics and their challenges. We first present the model that underlies most of current causal approaches to single-cell biology and discuss and challenge the assumptions it entails from the biological point of view. We then identify open problems in the application of causal approaches to single-cell data: generalising to unseen environments, learning interpretable models, and learning causal models of dynamics. For each problem, we discuss how various research directions - including the development of computational approaches and the adaptation of experimental protocols - may offer ways forward, or on the contrary pose some difficulties.

    "abstract": "This article introduces the Event based Prediction Suffix Tree (EPST), a biologically inspired, event-based prediction algorithm. The EPST learns a model online based on the statistics of an event based input and can make predictions over multiple overlapping patterns. The EPST uses a representation specific to event based data, defined as a portion of the power set of event subsequences within a short context window. It is explainable, and possesses many promising properties such as fault tolerance, resistance to event noise, as well as the capability for one-shot learning. The computational features of the EPST are examined in a synthetic data prediction task with additive event noise, event jitter, and dropout. The resulting algorithm outputs predicted projections for the near term future of the signal, which may be applied to tasks such as event based anomaly detection or pattern recognition. ",

However, some challenges remain, for instance the extension of such models to complex three-dimensional geometries, and a study on how such approaches could be combined to classical numerical solvers. In this work, we justify the use of graph neural networks for these problems, based on the similarity between these architectures and the meshes used in traditional numerical techniques for solving partial differential equations. After proving an issue with the Physics-Informed framework for complex geometries, during the computation of PDE residuals, an alternative procedure is proposed, by combining classical numerical solvers and the Physics-Informed framework. Finally, we propose an implementation of this approach, that we test on a three-dimensional problem on an irregular geometry. ",

    "abstract": "With the support of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, it is possible to acquire data from degradation phenomena and design data-driven models to perform anomaly detection in industrial equipment. This approach not only identifies potential anomalies but can also serve as a first step toward building predictive maintenance policies. In this work, we demonstrate a novel anomaly detection system on induction motors used in pumps, compressors, fans, and other industrial machines. This work evaluates a combination of pre-processing techniques and machine learning (ML) models with a low computational cost. We use a combination of pre-processing techniques such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Wavelet Transform (WT), and binning, which are well-known approaches for extracting features from raw data. We also aim to guarantee an optimal balance between multiple conflicting parameters, such as anomaly detection rate, false positive rate, and inference speed of the solution. To this end, multiobjective optimization and analysis are performed on the evaluated models. Pareto-optimal solutions are presented to select which models have the best results regarding classification metrics and computational effort. Differently from most works in this field that use publicly available datasets to validate their models, we propose an end-to-end solution combining low-cost and readily available IoT sensors. The approach is validated by acquiring a custom dataset from induction motors. Also, we fuse vibration, temperature, and noise data from these sensors as the input to the proposed ML model. Therefore, we aim to propose a methodology general enough to be applied in different industrial contexts in the future. ",

Furthermore, a few K-nearest-neighbor-based anomaly-detection methods exhibit excellent performance on many datasets, but their sensitivity to the value of K is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel robust anomaly detection method, called Entropy Density Ratio Outlier Detection (EDROD). This method incorporates the probability density of each sample as the global feature, and the local entropy around each sample as the local feature, to obtain a comprehensive indicator of abnormality for each sample, which is called Entropy Density Ratio (EDR) for short in this paper. By comparing several competing anomaly detection methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, it is found that the EDROD method can detect both point anomalies and cluster anomalies simultaneously with accurate performance. In addition, it is also found that the EDROD method exhibits strong robustness to the number of selected neighboring samples, the dimension of samples in the dataset, and the size of the dataset. Therefore, the proposed EDROD method can be applied to a variety of real-world datasets to detect anomalies with accurate and robust performances. ",

    "abstract": "A crucial element in predicting the outcomes of process interventions and making informed decisions about the process is unraveling the genuine relationships between the execution of process activities. Contemporary process discovery algorithms exploit time precedence as their main source of model derivation. Such reliance can sometimes be deceiving from a causal perspective. This calls for faithful new techniques to discover the true execution dependencies among the tasks in the process. To this end, our work offers a systematic approach to the unveiling of the true causal business process by leveraging an existing causal discovery algorithm over activity timing. In addition, this work delves into a set of conditions under which process mining discovery algorithms generate a model that is incongruent with the causal business process model, and shows how the latter model can be methodologically employed for a sound analysis of the process. Our methodology searches for such discrepancies between the two models in the context of three causal patterns, and derives a new view in which these inconsistencies are annotated over the mined process model. We demonstrate our methodology employing two open process mining algorithms, the IBM Process Mining tool, and the LiNGAM causal discovery technique. We apply it on a synthesized dataset and on two open benchmark data sets. ",

In this paper, we put forward a simple yet effective network conversion algorithm, which is referred to as LC-TTFS, by addressing two main problems that hinder an effective conversion from a high-performance artificial neural network (ANN) to a TTFS-based SNN. We show that our algorithm can achieve a near-perfect mapping between the activation values of an ANN and the spike times of an SNN on a number of challenging AI tasks, including image classification, image reconstruction, and speech enhancement. With TTFS coding, we can achieve up to orders of magnitude saving in computation over ANN and other rate-based SNNs. The study, therefore, paves the way for deploying ultra-low-power TTFS-based SNNs on power-constrained edge computing platforms. ",

In this work we show that representation dissimilarity measures, which are functions that measure the extent to which two model's internal representations differ, can be a valuable tool for gaining insight into the mechanics of language models. Among our insights are: (i) an apparent asymmetry in the internal representations of model using SoLU and GeLU activation functions, (ii) evidence that dissimilarity measures can identify and locate generalization properties of models that are invisible via in-distribution test set performance, and (iii) new evaluations of how language model features vary as width and depth are increased. Our results suggest that dissimilarity measures are a promising set of tools for shedding light on the inner workings of language models. ",

    "abstract": "The inductive bias of a graph neural network (GNN) is largely encoded in its specified graph. Latent graph inference relies on latent geometric representations to dynamically rewire or infer a GNN's graph to maximize the GNN's predictive downstream performance, but it lacks solid theoretical foundations in terms of embedding-based representation guarantees. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a trainable deep learning architecture, coined neural snowflake, that can adaptively implement fractal-like metrics on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. We prove that any given finite weights graph can be isometrically embedded by a standard MLP encoder. Furthermore, when the latent graph can be represented in the feature space of a sufficiently regular kernel, we show that the combined neural snowflake and MLP encoder do not succumb to the curse of dimensionality by using only a low-degree polynomial number of parameters in the number of nodes. This implementation enables a low-dimensional isometric embedding of the latent graph. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the superior metric learning capabilities of neural snowflakes when compared to more familiar spaces like Euclidean space. Additionally, we carry out latent graph inference experiments on graph benchmarks. Consistently, the neural snowflake model achieves predictive performance that either matches or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art latent graph inference models. Importantly, this performance improvement is achieved without requiring random search for optimal latent geometry. Instead, the neural snowflake model achieves this enhancement in a differentiable manner. ",

To manage the potentially severe interference, we propose to rely on joint multi-domain resource aided interference management (JMDR-IM). Specifically, the coverage overlap of the constellations considered is analyzed. Then, multi-domain resources - including both the beam-domain and power-domain - are jointly utilized for managing the CFI in an overlapping coverage region. This joint resource utilization is performed by relying on our specifically designed beam-shut-off and switching based beam scheduling, as well as on long short-term memory based joint autoregressive moving average assisted deep Q network aided power scheduling. Moreover, the outage probability (OP) of the proposed JMDR-IM scheme is derived, and the asymptotic analysis of the OP is also provided. Our performance evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed JMDR-IM scheme in terms of its increased throughput and reduced OP. ",

However, researchers identified insufficient or inadequate documentation examples and flaws with the API's complex structure as barriers to learning an API. As a result, developers may consult other sources (StackOverflow, GitHub, etc.) to learn more about an API. Recent research studies have shown that unofficial documentation is a valuable source of information for generating code summaries. We, therefore, have been motivated to leverage such a type of documentation along with deep learning techniques towards generating high-quality summaries for APIs discussed in informal documentation. This paper proposes an automatic approach using the BART algorithm, a state-of-the-art transformer model, to generate summaries for APIs discussed in StackOverflow. We built an oracle of human-generated summaries to evaluate our approach against it using ROUGE and BLEU metrics which are the most widely used evaluation metrics in text summarization. Furthermore, we evaluated our summaries empirically against a previous work in terms of quality. Our findings demonstrate that using deep learning algorithms can improve summaries' quality and outperform the previous work by an average of %57 for Precision, %66 for Recall, and %61 for F-measure, and it runs 4.4 times faster.

We argue that the key to generalization is representations that are (i) rich enough to capture all task-relevant information and (ii) invariant to superfluous variability between the training and the test domains. We experimentally study such a representation -- containing both depth and semantic information -- for visual navigation and show that it enables a control policy trained entirely in simulated indoor scenes to generalize to diverse real-world environments, both indoors and outdoors. Further, we show that our representation reduces the A-distance between the training and test domains, improving the generalization error bound as a result. Our proposed approach is scalable: the learned policy improves continuously, as the foundation models that it exploits absorb more diverse data during pre-training. ",

We consider a JCAS network consisting of dual-functional nodes operating in radar and communication modes. To gain access to the shared communication channel, each node follows carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based protocol. For this setting, we study the radar and communication performances defined in terms of maximum unambiguous range and aggregated network throughput, respectively.

In the first state, landmarks are matched with new keypoints using visual and IMU measurements. We collect statistical information from the matching and then guide the intra-keypoint matching in the second stage. Secondly, to handle the problem of pure rotation, we detect the motion type and adapt the deferred-triangulation technique during the data-association process. We make the pure-rotational frames into the special subframes. When solving the visual-inertial bundle adjustment, they provide additional constraints to the pure-rotational motion. We evaluate the proposed VIO system on public datasets. Experiments show the proposed RD-VIO has obvious advantages over other methods in dynamic environments. ",

It shifts the traditional paradigm of discrete architecture sampling and evaluation to differentiable super-net optimization and discretization. However, existing DAS methods either only conduct coarse-grained operation-level search, or restrictively explore fine-grained filter-level and weight-level units using manually-defined remaining ratios, which fail to simultaneously achieve small model size and satisfactory model performance. Additionally, they address the high memory consumption of the search process at the expense of search quality. To tackle these issues, we introduce multi-granularity architecture search (MGAS), a unified framework which aims to comprehensively and memory-efficiently explore the multi-granularity search space to discover both effective and efficient neural networks. Specifically, we learn discretization functions specific to each granularity level to adaptively determine the remaining ratios according to the evolving architecture. This ensures an optimal balance among units of different granularity levels for different target model sizes. Considering the memory demands, we break down the super-net optimization and discretization into multiple sub-net stages. By allowing re-pruning and regrowing of units in previous sub-nets during subsequent stages, we compensate for potential bias in earlier stages. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate that MGAS outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in achieving a better trade-off between model performance and model size. ",

Unfortunately, this preprocessing step is vulnerable to so-called image-scaling attacks where an attacker makes unnoticeable changes to an image so that it becomes a new image after scaling. This opens up new ways for attackers to control the prediction or to improve poisoning and backdoor attacks. While effective techniques exist to prevent scaling attacks, their detection has not been rigorously studied yet. Consequently, it is currently not possible to reliably spot these attacks in practice. This paper presents the first in-depth systematization and analysis of detection methods for image-scaling attacks. We identify two general detection paradigms and derive novel methods from them that are simple in design yet significantly outperform previous work. We demonstrate the efficacy of these methods in a comprehensive evaluation with all major learning platforms and scaling algorithms. First, we show that image-scaling attacks modifying the entire scaled image can be reliably detected even under an adaptive adversary. Second, we find that our methods provide strong detection performance even if only minor parts of the image are manipulated. As a result, we can introduce a novel protection layer against image-scaling attacks. ",

The four subtypes are Luminal A (LA), Luminal B (LB), HER2 subtype, and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Immunohistochemistry is the gold-standard evaluation, although interobserver variations are reported and molecular signatures identification is time-consuming. Fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy with machine learning approaches have been used to evaluate cancer samples, presenting biochemical-related explainability. However, this explainability is harder when using deep learning. This study created a 1D deep learning tool for breast cancer subtype evaluation and biochemical contribution. Sixty hyperspectral images were acquired from a human breast cancer microarray. K-Means clustering was applied to select tissue and paraffin spectra. CaReNet-V1, a novel 1D convolutional neural network, was developed to classify breast cancer (CA) and adjacent tissue (AT), and molecular subtypes. A 1D adaptation of Grad-CAM was applied to assess the biochemical impact to the classifications. CaReNet-V1 effectively classified CA and AT (test accuracy of 0.89), as well as HER2 and TNBC subtypes (0.83 and 0.86), with greater difficulty for LA and LB (0.74 and 0.68). The model enabled the evaluation of the most contributing wavenumbers to the predictions, providing a direct relationship with the biochemical content. Therefore, CaReNet-V1 and hyperspectral images is a potential approach for breast cancer biopsies assessment, providing additional information to the pathology report.

Based on these biomarkers expression levels, subtypes are classified as Luminal A (LA), Luminal B (LB), HER2 subtype, and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Immunohistochemistry is used to classify subtypes, although interlaboratory and interobserver variations can affect its accuracy, besides being a time-consuming technique. The Fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy may be coupled with deep learning for cancer evaluation, where there is still a lack of studies for subtypes and biomarker levels prediction. This study presents a novel 2D deep learning approach to achieve these predictions. Sixty micro-FTIR images of 320x320 pixels were collected from a human breast biopsies microarray. Data were clustered by K-means, preprocessed and 32x32 patches were generated using a fully automated approach. CaReNet-V2, a novel convolutional neural network, was developed to classify breast cancer (CA) vs adjacent tissue (AT) and molecular subtypes, and to predict biomarkers level. The clustering method enabled to remove non-tissue pixels. Test accuracies for CA vs AT and subtype were above 0.84. The model enabled the prediction of ER, PR, and HER2 levels, where borderline values showed lower performance (minimum accuracy of 0.54). Ki67 percentage regression demonstrated a mean error of 3.6%. Thus, CaReNet-V2 is a potential technique for breast cancer biopsies evaluation, standing out as a screening analysis technique and helping to prioritize patients. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised representation learning on text-attributed graphs, which aims to create expressive and generalizable representations for various downstream tasks, has received increasing research attention lately. However, existing methods either struggle to capture the full extent of structural context information or rely on task-specific training labels, which largely hampers their effectiveness and generalizability in practice. To solve the problem of self-supervised representation learning on text-attributed graphs, we develop a novel Graph-Centric Language model -- GRENADE. Specifically, GRENADE exploits the synergistic effect of both pre-trained language model and graph neural network by optimizing with two specialized self-supervised learning algorithms: graph-centric contrastive learning and graph-centric knowledge alignment. The proposed graph-centric self-supervised learning algorithms effectively help GRENADE to capture informative textual semantics as well as structural context information on text-attributed graphs. Through extensive experiments, GRENADE shows its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Implementation is available at \\url{https://github.com/bigheiniu/GRENADE}. ",

    "abstract": "At the core of causal inference lies the challenge of determining reliable causal graphs solely based on observational data. Since the well-known backdoor criterion depends on the graph, any errors in the graph can propagate downstream to effect inference. In this work, we initially show that complete graph information is not necessary for causal effect inference; the topological order over graph variables (causal order) alone suffices. Further, given a node pair, causal order is easier to elicit from domain experts compared to graph edges since determining the existence of an edge can depend extensively on other variables. Interestingly, we find that the same principle holds for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, motivating an automated method to obtain causal order (and hence causal effect) with LLMs acting as virtual domain experts. To this end, we employ different prompting strategies and contextual cues to propose a robust technique of obtaining causal order from LLMs. Acknowledging LLMs' limitations, we also study possible techniques to integrate LLMs with established causal discovery algorithms, including constraint-based and score-based methods, to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves causal ordering accuracy as compared to discovery algorithms, highlighting the potential of LLMs to enhance causal inference across diverse fields.

Recent work suggests that patching LLMs against these attacks is possible: manual jailbreak attacks are human-readable but often limited and public, making them easy to block; adversarial attacks generate gibberish prompts that can be detected using perplexity-based filters. In this paper, we show that these solutions may be too optimistic. We propose an interpretable adversarial attack, \\texttt{AutoDAN}, that combines the strengths of both types of attacks. It automatically generates attack prompts that bypass perplexity-based filters while maintaining a high attack success rate like manual jailbreak attacks. These prompts are interpretable and diverse, exhibiting strategies commonly used in manual jailbreak attacks, and transfer better than their non-readable counterparts when using limited training data or a single proxy model. We also customize \\texttt{AutoDAN}'s objective to leak system prompts, another jailbreak application not addressed in the adversarial attack literature. %, demonstrating the versatility of the approach. We can also customize the objective of \\texttt{AutoDAN} to leak system prompts, beyond the ability to elicit harmful content from the model, demonstrating the versatility of the approach.

We study generalization in this setting, training on N models and testing on the next (N+k), following the historical release dates of well-known generation methods. Furthermore, images increasingly consist of both real and generated components, for example through image inpainting. Thus, we extend this approach to pixel prediction, demonstrating strong performance using automatically-generated inpainted data.

For this, meshes are appealing since they 1) enable fast physics-based rendering with realistic material and lighting, 2) support physical simulation, and 3) are memory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructing and statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being topologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D representation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin, open, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for reconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material and lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observation that open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, we parameterize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field on watertight templates. With this parameterization, we further develop a grid-based and differentiable representation that parameterizes both watertight and non-watertight meshes of arbitrary topology. Our new representation, called Ghost-on-the-Shell (G-Shell), enables two important applications: differentiable rasterization-based reconstruction from multiview images and generative modelling of non-watertight meshes. We empirically demonstrate that G-Shell achieves state-of-the-art performance on non-watertight mesh reconstruction and generation tasks, while also performing effectively for watertight meshes. ",

While current learning-based depth estimation models train and test on meticulously curated data, they often overlook out-of-distribution (OoD) situations.

Addressing this oversight, we introduce a comprehensive robustness test suite, RoboDepth, encompassing 18 corruptions spanning three categories: i) weather and lighting conditions; ii) sensor failures and movement; and iii) data processing anomalies. We subsequently benchmark 42 depth estimation models across indoor and outdoor scenes to assess their resilience to these corruptions. Our findings underscore that, in the absence of a dedicated robustness evaluation framework, many leading depth estimation models may be susceptible to typical corruptions. We delve into design considerations for crafting more robust depth estimation models, touching upon pre-training, augmentation, modality, model capacity, and learning paradigms. We anticipate our benchmark will establish a foundational platform for advancing robust OoD depth estimation. ",

Aiming at minimizing average service latency, the corresponding problem is formulated as an integer nonlinear programming under resource, VNF deployment, and time-slotted flow constraints.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the optimality of BDBC algorithm and the low complexity of TEDG algorithm.

    "abstract": "The deep learning recipe of casting real-world problems as mathematical optimisation and tackling the optimisation by training deep neural networks using gradient-based optimisation has undoubtedly proven to be a fruitful one. The understanding behind why deep learning works, however, has lagged behind its practical significance. We aim to make steps towards an improved understanding of deep learning with a focus on optimisation and model regularisation. We start by investigating gradient descent (GD), a discrete-time algorithm at the basis of most popular deep learning optimisation algorithms. Understanding the dynamics of GD has been hindered by the presence of discretisation drift, the numerical integration error between GD and its often studied continuous-time counterpart, the negative gradient flow (NGF). To add to the toolkit available to study GD, we derive novel continuous-time flows that account for discretisation drift. Unlike the NGF, these new flows can be used to describe learning rate specific behaviours of GD, such as training instabilities observed in supervised learning and two-player games. We then translate insights from continuous time into mitigation strategies for unstable GD dynamics, by constructing novel learning rate schedules and regularisers that do not require additional hyperparameters. Like optimisation, smoothness regularisation is another pillar of deep learning's success with wide use in supervised learning and generative modelling. Despite their individual significance, the interactions between smoothness regularisation and optimisation have yet to be explored. We find that smoothness regularisation affects optimisation across multiple deep learning domains, and that incorporating smoothness regularisation in reinforcement learning leads to a performance boost that can be recovered using adaptions to optimisation methods.

Although fully-supervised deep learning-based methods have made significant progress, a large number of labeled images are required to achieve great segmentation performance. Considering that manually labeling all nuclei instances for a dataset is inefficient, obtaining a large-scale human-annotated dataset is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, augmenting a dataset with only a few labeled images to improve the segmentation performance is of significant research and application value. In this paper, we introduce the first diffusion-based augmentation method for nuclei segmentation. The idea is to synthesize a large number of labeled images to facilitate training the segmentation model. To achieve this, we propose a two-step strategy. In the first step, we train an unconditional diffusion model to synthesize the Nuclei Structure that is defined as the representation of pixel-level semantic and distance transform. Each synthetic nuclei structure will serve as a constraint on histopathology image synthesis and is further post-processed to be an instance map. In the second step, we train a conditioned diffusion model to synthesize histopathology images based on nuclei structures. The synthetic histopathology images paired with synthetic instance maps will be added to the real dataset for training the segmentation model. The experimental results show that by augmenting 10% labeled real dataset with synthetic samples, one can achieve comparable segmentation results with the fully-supervised baseline. ",

This poses a significant threat to the security and reliability of ASV systems. To address this issue, we propose a Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification (DAP) method that enhances the robustness of ASV systems against such adversarial attacks. Our method leverages a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to effectively purify the adversarial examples and mitigate the impact of perturbations. DAP first introduces controlled noise into adversarial examples, and then performs a reverse denoising process to reconstruct clean audio. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed DAP in enhancing the security of ASV and meanwhile minimizing the distortion of the purified audio signals. ",

    "abstract": "It is widely known that Boltzmann machines are capable of representing arbitrary probability distributions over the values of their visible neurons, given enough hidden ones. However, sampling -- and thus training -- these models can be numerically hard. Recently we proposed a regularisation of the connections of Boltzmann machines, in order to control the energy landscape of the model, paving a way for efficient sampling and training. Here we formally prove that such regularised Boltzmann machines preserve the ability to represent arbitrary distributions. This is in conjunction with controlling the number of energy local minima, thus enabling easy \\emph{guided} sampling and training. Furthermore, we explicitly show that regularised Boltzmann machines can store exponentially many arbitrarily correlated visible patterns with perfect retrieval, and we connect them to the Dense Associative Memory networks.

A novel machine learning method is proposed for modeling groundwater levels by learning from a 3D lithological texture model of the CV aquifer. The proposed formulation performs multivariate regression by combining Gaussian processes (GP) and deep neural networks (DNN). Proposed hierarchical modeling approach constitutes training the DNN to learn a lithologically informed latent space where non-parametric regression with GP is performed. The methodology is applied for modeling groundwater levels across the CV during 2015 - 2020. We demonstrate the efficacy of GP-DNN regression for modeling non-stationary features in the well data with fast and reliable uncertainty quantification. Our results indicate that the 2017 and 2019 wet years in California were largely ineffective in replenishing the groundwater loss caused during previous drought years. ",

The distinct advantage of the CAD-DA lies in its ability to control the probability of misidentifying anomalies under a pre-specified level $\\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05). The challenge within this DA setting is the necessity to account for the influence of DA to ensure the validity of the inference results. Our solution to this challenge leverages the concept of conditional Selective Inference to handle the impact of DA. To our knowledge, this is the first work capable of conducting a valid statistical inference within the context of DA. We evaluate the performance of the CAD-DA method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks play an important role in brain-like neuromorphic computations and in studying working mechanisms of neural circuits. One drawback of training a large scale spiking neural network is that an expensive cost of updating all weights is required. Furthermore, after training, all information related to the computational task is hidden into the weight matrix, prohibiting us from a transparent understanding of circuit mechanisms. Therefore, in this work, we address these challenges by proposing a spiking mode-based training protocol. The first advantage is that the weight is interpreted by input and output modes and their associated scores characterizing importance of each decomposition term. The number of modes is thus adjustable, allowing more degrees of freedom for modeling the experimental data. This reduces a sizable training cost because of significantly reduced space complexity for learning. The second advantage is that one can project the high dimensional neural activity in the ambient space onto the mode space which is typically of a low dimension, e.g., a few modes are sufficient to capture the shape of the underlying neural manifolds. We analyze our framework in two computational tasks -- digit classification and selective sensory integration tasks. Our work thus derives a mode-based learning rule for spiking neural networks. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of breast tumors from the ultrasound images is essential for the subsequent clinical diagnosis and treatment plan. Although the existing deep learning-based methods have achieved significant progress in automatic segmentation of breast tumor, their performance on tumors with similar intensity to the normal tissues is still not pleasant, especially for the tumor boundaries. To address this issue, we propose a PBNet composed by a multilevel global perception module (MGPM) and a boundary guided module (BGM) to segment breast tumors from ultrasound images. Specifically, in MGPM, the long-range spatial dependence between the voxels in a single level feature maps are modeled, and then the multilevel semantic information is fused to promote the recognition ability of the model for non-enhanced tumors. In BGM, the tumor boundaries are extracted from the high-level semantic maps using the dilation and erosion effects of max pooling, such boundaries are then used to guide the fusion of low and high-level features. Moreover, to improve the segmentation performance for tumor boundaries, a multi-level boundary-enhanced segmentation (BS) loss is proposed. The extensive comparison experiments on both publicly available dataset and in-house dataset demonstrate that the proposed PBNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both qualitative visualization results and quantitative evaluation metrics, with the Dice score, Jaccard coefficient, Specificity and HD95 improved by 0.70%, 1.1%, 0.1% and 2.5% respectively. In addition, the ablation experiments validate that the proposed MGPM is indeed beneficial for distinguishing the non-enhanced tumors and the BGM as well as the BS loss are also helpful for refining the segmentation contours of the tumor.

We extend NCA to capture both transient and stable structures within the same system, as well as learning rules that capture the dynamics of Turing pattern formation in nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We demonstrate that NCA can generalise very well beyond their PDE training data, we show how to constrain NCA to respect given symmetries, and we explore the effects of associated hyperparameters on model performance and stability.

Such a success-driven mechanism has been studied in spatial public goods games in an inter-group way, where each individual's social power is enhanced across all groups. For instance, factors like knowledge can exert an advantage across various social contexts. In contrast, certain factors, especially local material goods, only enhance advantages within their current group. Building on this, we further explore the intra-group Matthew effect where the enhancement of social power is calculated separately in each group. Our findings indicate that the intra-group Matthew effect sustains cooperation more at high productivity, while the inter-group Matthew effect promotes cooperation at low productivity. Moreover, the mixture of the intra- and inter-group Matthew effect harms cooperation. This study provides insights into addressing social dilemmas by adjusting wealth accumulation across diverse social groups. ",

    "abstract": "Compressed Sensing (CS) significantly speeds up Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) processing and achieves accurate MRI reconstruction from under-sampled k-space data. According to the current research, there are still several problems with dynamic MRI k-space reconstruction based on CS. 1) There are differences between the Fourier domain and the Image domain, and the differences between MRI processing of different domains need to be considered. 2) As three-dimensional data, dynamic MRI has its spatial-temporal characteristics, which need to calculate the difference and consistency of surface textures while preserving structural integrity and uniqueness. 3) Dynamic MRI reconstruction is time-consuming and computationally resource-dependent. In this paper, we propose a novel robust low-rank dynamic MRI reconstruction optimization model via highly under-sampled and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) called the Robust Depth Linear Error Decomposition Model (RDLEDM). Our method mainly includes linear decomposition, double Total Variation (TV), and double Nuclear Norm (NN) regularizations. By adding linear image domain error analysis, the noise is reduced after under-sampled and DFT processing, and the anti-interference ability of the algorithm is enhanced. Double TV and NN regularizations can utilize both spatial-temporal characteristics and explore the complementary relationship between different dimensions in dynamic MRI sequences. In addition, Due to the non-smoothness and non-convexity of TV and NN terms, it is difficult to optimize the unified objective model. To address this issue, we utilize a fast algorithm by solving a primal-dual form of the original problem. Compared with five state-of-the-art methods, extensive experiments on dynamic MRI data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and time complexity.

    "abstract": "High-energy large-scale particle colliders produce data at high speed in the order of 1 terabytes per second in nuclear physics and petabytes per second in high-energy physics. Developing real-time data compression algorithms to reduce such data at high throughput to fit permanent storage has drawn increasing attention. Specifically, at the newly constructed sPHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), a time projection chamber is used as the main tracking detector, which records particle trajectories in a volume of a three-dimensional (3D) cylinder. The resulting data are usually very sparse with occupancy around 10.8%. Such sparsity presents a challenge to conventional learning-free lossy compression algorithms, such as SZ, ZFP, and MGARD. The 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach, Bicephalous Convolutional Autoencoder (BCAE), outperforms traditional methods both in compression rate and reconstruction accuracy. BCAE can also utilize the computation power of graphical processing units suitable for deployment in a modern heterogeneous high-performance computing environment. This work introduces two BCAE variants: BCAE++ and BCAE-2D. BCAE++ achieves a 15% better compression ratio and a 77% better reconstruction accuracy measured in mean absolute error compared with BCAE. BCAE-2D treats the radial direction as the channel dimension of an image, resulting in a 3x speedup in compression throughput. In addition, we demonstrate an unbalanced autoencoder with a larger decoder can improve reconstruction accuracy without significantly sacrificing throughput. Lastly, we observe both the BCAE++ and BCAE-2D can benefit more from using half-precision mode in throughput (76-79% increase) without loss in reconstruction accuracy.

CalibrationPhys trains deep learning models without supervised labels by using facial videos captured simultaneously by multiple cameras. Contrastive learning is performed so that the pulse and respiratory waves predicted from the synchronized videos using multiple cameras are positive and those from different videos are negative. CalibrationPhys also improves the robustness of the models by means of a data augmentation technique and successfully leverages a pre-trained model for a particular camera. Experimental results utilizing two datasets demonstrate that CalibrationPhys outperforms state-of-the-art heart and respiratory rate measurement methods. Since we optimize camera-specific models using only videos from multiple cameras, our approach makes it easy to use arbitrary cameras for heart and respiratory rate measurements. ",

Previous work has yielded a hybrid quantum-classical transfer learning scheme for classical data and communication with a hub-spoke topology. While quantum communication is secure from eavesdrop attacks and no measurements from quantum to classical translation, due to no cloning theorem, hub-spoke topology is not ideal for quantum communication without quantum memory. Here we seek to improve this model by implementing a decentralized ring topology for the federated learning scheme, where each client is given a portion of the entire dataset and only performs training on that set. We also demonstrate the first successful use of quantum weights for quantum federated learning, which allows us to perform our training entirely in quantum. ",
