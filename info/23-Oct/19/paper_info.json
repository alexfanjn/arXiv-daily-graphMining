    "abstract": "This study presents a large multi-modal Bangla YouTube clickbait dataset consisting of 253,070 data points collected through an automated process using the YouTube API and Python web automation frameworks. The dataset contains 18 diverse features categorized into metadata, primary content, engagement statistics, and labels for individual videos from 58 Bangla YouTube channels. A rigorous preprocessing step has been applied to denoise, deduplicate, and remove bias from the features, ensuring unbiased and reliable analysis. As the largest and most robust clickbait corpus in Bangla to date, this dataset provides significant value for natural language processing and data science researchers seeking to advance modeling of clickbait phenomena in low-resource languages. Its multi-modal nature allows for comprehensive analyses of clickbait across content, user interactions, and linguistic dimensions to develop more sophisticated detection methods with cross-linguistic applications.

    "title": "Protein 3D Graph Structure Learning for Robust Structure-based Protein  Property Prediction",
    "abstract": "Protein structure-based property prediction has emerged as a promising approach for various biological tasks, such as protein function prediction and sub-cellular location estimation. The existing methods highly rely on experimental protein structure data and fail in scenarios where these data are unavailable. Predicted protein structures from AI tools (e.g., AlphaFold2) were utilized as alternatives. However, we observed that current practices, which simply employ accurately predicted structures during inference, suffer from notable degradation in prediction accuracy. While similar phenomena have been extensively studied in general fields (e.g., Computer Vision) as model robustness, their impact on protein property prediction remains unexplored. In this paper, we first investigate the reason behind the performance decrease when utilizing predicted structures, attributing it to the structure embedding bias from the perspective of structure representation learning. To study this problem, we identify a Protein 3D Graph Structure Learning Problem for Robust Protein Property Prediction (PGSL-RP3), collect benchmark datasets, and present a protein Structure embedding Alignment Optimization framework (SAO) to mitigate the problem of structure embedding bias between the predicted and experimental protein structures. Extensive experiments have shown that our framework is model-agnostic and effective in improving the property prediction of both predicted structures and experimental structures. The benchmark datasets and codes will be released to benefit the community. ",

    "abstract": "Software version migration and program translation are an important and costly part of the lifecycle of large codebases. Traditional machine translation relies on parallel corpora for supervised translation, which is not feasible for program translation due to a dearth of aligned data. Recent unsupervised neural machine translation techniques have overcome data limitations by included techniques such as back translation and low level compiler intermediate representations (IR). These methods face significant challenges due to the noise in code snippet alignment and the diversity of IRs respectively. In this paper we propose a novel model called Code Distillation (CoDist) whereby we capture the semantic and structural equivalence of code in a language agnostic intermediate representation. Distilled code serves as a translation pivot for any programming language, leading by construction to parallel corpora which scale to all available source code by simply applying the distillation compiler. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on CodeXGLUE and TransCoder GeeksForGeeks translation benchmarks, with an average absolute increase of 12.7% on the TransCoder GeeksforGeeks translation benchmark compare to TransCoder-ST.

To this end, we first propose and evaluate various machine learning based systems for the MBFD task.

The proposed machine learning based systems and deep learning based systems are evaluated, compared, and then they are used to identify the best model for the MBFD task. We conducted extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets of motor bearing faults, including those from the American Society for Mechanical Failure Prevention Technology (MFPT), Case Western Reserve University Bearing Center (CWRU), and the Condition Monitoring of Bearing Damage in Electromechanical Drive Systems from Paderborn University (PU). The experimental results on different datasets highlight two main contributions of this study. First, we prove that deep learning based systems are more effective than machine learning based systems for the MBFD task. Second, we achieve a robust and general deep learning based system with a novel loss function for the MBFD task on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its potential for real-life MBFD applications.

    "abstract": "Accurate uncertainty quantification in graph neural networks (GNNs) is essential, especially in high-stakes domains where GNNs are frequently employed. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a promising framework for quantifying uncertainty by providing $\\textit{valid}$ prediction sets for any black-box model. CP ensures formal probabilistic guarantees that a prediction set contains a true label with a desired probability. However, the size of prediction sets, known as $\\textit{inefficiency}$, is influenced by the underlying model and data generating process. On the other hand, Bayesian learning also provides a credible region based on the estimated posterior distribution, but this region is $\\textit{well-calibrated}$ only when the model is correctly specified. Building on a recent work that introduced a scaling parameter for constructing valid credible regions from posterior estimate, our study explores the advantages of incorporating a temperature parameter into Bayesian GNNs within CP framework. We empirically demonstrate the existence of temperatures that result in more efficient prediction sets. Furthermore, we conduct an analysis to identify the factors contributing to inefficiency and offer valuable insights into the relationship between CP performance and model calibration. ",

The former is referred to as Heterogeneous networks, while the latter is known as Multi-layer networks. The present paper provides a generalized network model, namely, a Heterogeneous Multi-layered Network (HMN), which can simultaneously be multi-layered and heterogeneous. The model can represent homogeneous networks as well. We define different structural measures in an HMN. We proved that the sets of all homogeneous, heterogeneous and multi-layered networks are subsets of the set of all HMNs. Accordingly, we established the equivalency of the proposed structural measures of HMNs with that of homogeneous, heterogeneous, and multi-layered networks. Following that, we show how our proposed HMN is more efficient in tasks such as link prediction. In addition, we present a novel parameterized algorithm (with complexity analysis) for generating synthetic HMNs. The networks generated from our proposed algorithm are more consistent in modelling the layer-wise degree distribution of a real-world Twitter network (represented as HMN) than those generated by existing models. Moreover, we also show that our algorithm is more effective in modelling an air-transportation multiplex network when compared to an algorithm designed specifically for the task. ",

However, data generated using software and algorithms can be subject to biases and errors. These can be due to problems with the original software, default settings that do not align with the specific needs of the situation, or even deeper problems with the underlying theories and models. This paper proposes an advanced search and optimization framework aimed at generating and choosing optimal source code capable of correcting errors and biases from previous versions to address typical problems in software systems specializing in data analysis and generation, especially those in the corporate and data science world. Applying this framework multiple times on the same software system would incrementally improve the quality of the output results. It uses Solomonoff Induction as a sound theoretical basis, extending it with Kolmogorov Conditional Complexity, a novel adaptation, to evaluate a set of candidate programs. We propose the use of generative models for the creation of this set of programs, with special emphasis on the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high quality code. ",

WaveFlex works in the presence of frequency diversity: multiple nearby base stations operating on different frequencies, as dictated by a Spectrum Access System coordinator. It also handles time dynamism: due to the dynamic sharing rules of the band, base stations occasionally switch channels, especially when priority users enter the network. Finally, WaveFlex operates independently of the network itself, not requiring access to nor modification of the base station or mobile users, yet it remain compliant with and effective on prevailing cellular protocols. We have designed and fabricated WaveFlex on a custom multi-layer PCB, software defined radio-based network monitor, and supporting control software and hardware. Our experimental evaluation benchmarks an operational Private LTE network running at full line rate. Results demonstrate an 8.50 dB average SNR gain, and an average throughput gain of 4.36 Mbps for a single small cell, and 3.19 Mbps for four small cells, in a realistic indoor office scenario. ",

    "abstract": "CityGML is a widely adopted standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) for representing and exchanging 3D city models. The representation of semantic and topological properties in CityGML makes it possible to query such 3D city data to perform analysis in various applications, e.g., security management and emergency response, energy consumption and estimation, and occupancy measurement. However, the potential of querying CityGML data has not been fully exploited. The official GML/XML encoding of CityGML is only intended as an exchange format but is not suitable for query answering. The most common way of dealing with CityGML data is to store them in the 3DCityDB system as relational tables and then query them with the standard SQL query language. Nevertheless, for end users, it remains a challenging task to formulate queries over 3DCityDB directly for their ad-hoc analytical tasks, because there is a gap between the conceptual semantics of CityGML and the relational schema adopted in 3DCityDB. In fact, the semantics of CityGML itself can be modeled as a suitable ontology. The technology of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), where an ontology is at the core, is a good solution to bridge such a gap. Moreover, embracing KGs makes it easier to integrate with other spatial data sources, e.g., OpenStreetMap and existing (Geo)KGs (e.g., Wikidata, DBPedia, and GeoNames), and to perform queries combining information from multiple data sources. In this work, we describe a CityGML KG framework to populate the concepts in the CityGML ontology using declarative mappings to 3DCityDB, thus exposing the CityGML data therein as a KG. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we use CityGML data from the city of Munich as test data and integrate OpenStreeMap data in the same area. ",

Within the digital era, social media has become an important platform for individuals navigating through depression, enabling them to express their emotional and mental states through various mediums, notably music. Specifically, their music preferences, manifested through sharing practices, inadvertently offer a glimpse into their psychological and emotional landscapes. This work seeks to study the differences in music preferences between individuals diagnosed with depression and non-diagnosed individuals, exploring numerous facets of music, including musical features, lyrics, and musical networks. The music preferences of individuals with depression through music sharing on social media, reveal notable differences in musical features and topics and language use of lyrics compared to non-depressed individuals. We find the network information enhances understanding of the link between music listening patterns. The result highlights a potential echo-chamber effect, where depression individual's musical choices may inadvertently perpetuate depressive moods and emotions. In sum, this study underscores the significance of examining music's various aspects to grasp its relationship with mental health, offering insights for personalized music interventions and recommendation algorithms that could benefit individuals with depression.

In reality, though, agents have only partial observability of their environment, which makes the problem computationally challenging, even in the single-agent setting of partially observable Markov decision processes. Furthermore, in practice, agents increasingly perceive their environment using data-driven approaches such as neural networks trained on continuous data. To tackle this problem, we propose the model of neuro-symbolic partially-observable stochastic games (NS-POSGs), a variant of continuous-space concurrent stochastic games that explicitly incorporates perception mechanisms. We focus on a one-sided setting, comprising a partially-informed agent with discrete, data-driven observations and a fully-informed agent with continuous observations. We present a new point-based method, called one-sided NS-HSVI, for approximating values of one-sided NS-POSGs and implement it based on the popular particle-based beliefs, showing that it has closed forms for computing values of interest. We provide experimental results to demonstrate the practical applicability of our method for neural networks whose preimage is in polyhedral form. ",

Our research, initially spurred by test-time evasion attacks, investigates the intersection of adversarial training and backdoor attacks within federated learning, introducing Adversarial Robustness Unhardening (ARU). ARU is employed by a subset of adversaries to intentionally undermine model robustness during decentralized training, rendering models susceptible to a broader range of evasion attacks. We present extensive empirical experiments evaluating ARU's impact on adversarial training and existing robust aggregation defenses against poisoning and backdoor attacks.

    "abstract": "Due to the popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, numerous backdoor attacks are designed by adversaries to mislead deep neural network predictions by manipulating training samples and training processes. Although backdoor attacks are effective in various real scenarios, they still suffer from the problems of both low fidelity of poisoned samples and non-negligible transfer in latent space, which make them easily detectable by existing backdoor detection algorithms. To overcome the weakness, this paper proposes a novel frequency-based backdoor attack method named WaveAttack, which obtains image high-frequency features through Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to generate backdoor triggers. Furthermore, we introduce an asymmetric frequency obfuscation method, which can add an adaptive residual in the training and inference stage to improve the impact of triggers and further enhance the effectiveness of WaveAttack. Comprehensive experimental results show that WaveAttack not only achieves higher stealthiness and effectiveness, but also outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attack methods in the fidelity of images by up to 28.27\\% improvement in PSNR, 1.61\\% improvement in SSIM, and 70.59\\% reduction in IS.

    "title": "The Efficacy of Transformer-based Adversarial Attacks in Security  Domains",
    "abstract": "Today, the security of many domains rely on the use of Machine Learning to detect threats, identify vulnerabilities, and safeguard systems from attacks. Recently, transformer architectures have improved the state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks such as malware detection and network intrusion detection. But, before abandoning current approaches to transformers, it is crucial to understand their properties and implications on cybersecurity applications. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of transformers to adversarial samples for system defenders (i.e., resiliency to adversarial perturbations generated on different types of architectures) and their adversarial strength for system attackers (i.e., transferability of adversarial samples generated by transformers to other target models). To that effect, we first fine-tune a set of pre-trained transformer, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and hybrid (an ensemble of transformer and CNN) models to solve different downstream image-based tasks. Then, we use an attack algorithm to craft 19,367 adversarial examples on each model for each task. The transferability of these adversarial examples is measured by evaluating each set on other models to determine which models offer more adversarial strength, and consequently, more robustness against these attacks. We find that the adversarial examples crafted on transformers offer the highest transferability rate (i.e., 25.7% higher than the average) onto other models. Similarly, adversarial examples crafted on other models have the lowest rate of transferability (i.e., 56.7% lower than the average) onto transformers. Our work emphasizes the importance of studying transformer architectures for attacking and defending models in security domains, and suggests using them as the primary architecture in transfer attack settings.

    "title": "Learning Neural Implicit through Volume Rendering with Attentive Depth  Fusion Priors",
    "abstract": "Learning neural implicit representations has achieved remarkable performance in 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. Current methods use volume rendering to render implicit representations into either RGB or depth images that are supervised by multi-view ground truth. However, rendering a view each time suffers from incomplete depth at holes and unawareness of occluded structures from the depth supervision, which severely affects the accuracy of geometry inference via volume rendering. To resolve this issue, we propose to learn neural implicit representations from multi-view RGBD images through volume rendering with an attentive depth fusion prior. Our prior allows neural networks to perceive coarse 3D structures from the Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) fused from all depth images available for rendering. The TSDF enables accessing the missing depth at holes on one depth image and the occluded parts that are invisible from the current view. By introducing a novel attention mechanism, we allow neural networks to directly use the depth fusion prior with the inferred occupancy as the learned implicit function. Our attention mechanism works with either a one-time fused TSDF that represents a whole scene or an incrementally fused TSDF that represents a partial scene in the context of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Our evaluations on widely used benchmarks including synthetic and real-world scans show our superiority over the latest neural implicit methods.

    "title": "In defense of parameter sharing for model-compression",
    "abstract": "When considering a model architecture, there are several ways to reduce its memory footprint. Historically, popular approaches included selecting smaller architectures and creating sparse networks through pruning. More recently, randomized parameter-sharing (RPS) methods have gained traction for model compression at start of training. In this paper, we comprehensively assess the trade-off between memory and accuracy across RPS, pruning techniques, and building smaller models. Our findings demonstrate that RPS, which is both data and model-agnostic, consistently outperforms/matches smaller models and all moderately informed pruning strategies, such as MAG, SNIP, SYNFLOW, and GRASP, across the entire compression range. This advantage becomes particularly pronounced in higher compression scenarios. Notably, even when compared to highly informed pruning techniques like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), RPS exhibits superior performance in high compression settings. This points out inherent capacity advantage that RPS enjoys over sparse models. Theoretically, we establish RPS as a superior technique in terms of memory-efficient representation when compared to pruning for linear models. This paper argues in favor of paradigm shift towards RPS based models. During our rigorous evaluation of RPS, we identified issues in the state-of-the-art RPS technique ROAST, specifically regarding stability (ROAST's sensitivity to initialization hyperparameters, often leading to divergence) and Pareto-continuity (ROAST's inability to recover the accuracy of the original model at zero compression). We provably address both of these issues. We refer to the modified RPS, which incorporates our improvements, as STABLE-RPS. ",

In this work we demonstrate how multiple 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 images can be used to generate 50 cm resolution building and road segmentation masks. This is done by training a `student' model with access to Sentinel-2 images to reproduce the predictions of a `teacher' model which has access to corresponding high-resolution imagery. While the predictions do not have all the fine detail of the teacher model, we find that we are able to retain much of the performance: for building segmentation we achieve 78.3% mIoU, compared to the high-resolution teacher model accuracy of 85.3% mIoU. We also describe a related method for counting individual buildings in a Sentinel-2 patch which achieves R^2 = 0.91 against true counts. This work opens up new possibilities for using freely available Sentinel-2 imagery for a range of tasks that previously could only be done with high-resolution satellite imagery. ",

    "abstract": "Current parking slot detection in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) primarily relies on ultrasonic sensors. This method has several limitations such as the need to scan the entire parking slot before detecting it, the incapacity of detecting multiple slots in a row, and the difficulty of classifying them. Due to the complex visual environment, vehicles are equipped with surround view camera systems to detect vacant parking slots. Previous research works in this field mostly use image-domain models to solve the problem. These two-stage approaches separate the 2D detection and 3D pose estimation steps using camera calibration. In this paper, we propose one-step Holistic Parking Slot Network (HPS-Net), a tailor-made adaptation of the You Only Look Once (YOLO)v4 algorithm. This camera-based approach directly outputs the four vertex coordinates of the parking slot in topview domain, instead of a bounding box in raw camera images. Several visible points and shapes can be proposed from different angles. A novel regression loss function named polygon-corner Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) for polygon vertex position optimization is also proposed to manage the slot orientation and to distinguish the entrance line. Experiments show that HPS-Net can detect various vacant parking slots with a F1-score of 0.92 on our internal Valeo Parking Slots Dataset (VPSD) and 0.99 on the public dataset PS2.0. It provides a satisfying generalization and robustness in various parking scenarios, such as indoor (F1: 0.86) or paved ground (F1: 0.91). Moreover, it achieves a real-time detection speed of 17 FPS on Nvidia Drive AGX Xavier. A demo video can be found at https://streamable.com/75j7sj. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical likelihood learning framework for introducing gamma random effects into the Poisson DNN, so as to improve the prediction performance by capturing both nonlinear effects of input variables and subject-specific cluster effects. The proposed method simultaneously yields maximum likelihood estimators for fixed parameters and best unbiased predictors for random effects by optimizing a single objective function. This approach enables a fast end-to-end algorithm for handling clustered count data, which often involve high-cardinality categorical features. Furthermore, state-of-the-art network architectures can be easily implemented into the proposed h-likelihood framework. As an example, we introduce multi-head attention layer and a sparsemax function, which allows feature selection in high-dimensional settings. To enhance practical performance and learning efficiency, we present an adjustment procedure for prediction of random parameters and a method-of-moments estimator for pretraining of variance component. Various experiential studies and real data analyses confirm the advantages of our proposed methods. ",

This paper presents a new method for CCD with guarantees on robustness to nondeterministic disturbances for all initial conditions within a specified region of operation. This is accomplished by calculating the reachable sets of a candidate closed-loop system directly within the optimization problem. Using this approach, the plant and control parameters are simultaneously chosen to shape these reachable sets to be robustly positive invariant and thus safe for all time. Compared to conventional approaches that perform the optimization for a single initial condition and an a priori chosen sequence of disturbances, the proposed set-based method avoids sensitivity to variations in the assumed design scenario.

While a growing body of literature has revealed the limitations of common graph neural networks (GNNs) in handling homogeneous graphs with heterophily, little work has been conducted on investigating the heterophily properties in the context of heterogeneous graphs. To bridge this research gap, we identify the heterophily in heterogeneous graphs using metapaths and propose two practical metrics to quantitatively describe the levels of heterophily. Through in-depth investigations on several real-world heterogeneous graphs exhibiting varying levels of heterophily, we have observed that heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs), which inherit many mechanisms from GNNs designed for homogeneous graphs, fail to generalize to heterogeneous graphs with heterophily or low level of homophily. To address the challenge, we present Hetero$^2$Net, a heterophily-aware HGNN that incorporates both masked metapath prediction and masked label prediction tasks to effectively and flexibly handle both homophilic and heterophilic heterogeneous graphs. We evaluate the performance of Hetero$^2$Net on five real-world heterogeneous graph benchmarks with varying levels of heterophily. The results demonstrate that Hetero$^2$Net outperforms strong baselines in the semi-supervised node classification task, providing valuable insights into effectively handling more complex heterogeneous graphs.

Various augmentation strategies have been widely explored, most of which are motivated by two heuristics, i.e., increasing the distribution similarity and diversity of pseudo data. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for the effectiveness of these strategies remains poorly understood. In this paper, we aim to clarify how data augmentation improves GEC models. To this end, we introduce two interpretable and computationally efficient measures: Affinity and Diversity. Our findings indicate that an excellent GEC data augmentation strategy characterized by high Affinity and appropriate Diversity can better improve the performance of GEC models. Based on this observation, we propose MixEdit, a data augmentation approach that strategically and dynamically augments realistic data, without requiring extra monolingual corpora. To verify the correctness of our findings and the effectiveness of the proposed MixEdit, we conduct experiments on mainstream English and Chinese GEC datasets. The results show that MixEdit substantially improves GEC models and is complementary to traditional data augmentation methods. ",

Our approach streamlines GAD, reducing time and memory consumption while maintaining powerful anomaly detection capabilities. Comprising two modules - a pre-processing module and an ego-neighbor matching module - PREM eliminates the necessity for message-passing propagation during training, and employs a simple contrastive loss, leading to considerable reductions in training time and memory usage. Moreover, through rigorous evaluations of five real-world datasets, our method demonstrated robustness and effectiveness.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of {\\it Live Graph Lab} for temporal graphs, which enables open, dynamic and real transaction graphs from blockchains. Among them, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become one of the most prominent parts of blockchain over the past several years. With more than \\$40 billion market capitalization, this decentralized ecosystem produces massive, anonymous and real transaction activities, which naturally forms a complicated transaction network. However, there is limited understanding about the characteristics of this emerging NFT ecosystem from a temporal graph analysis perspective. To mitigate this gap, we instantiate a live graph with NFT transaction network and investigate its dynamics to provide new observations and insights. Specifically, through downloading and parsing the NFT transaction activities, we obtain a temporal graph with more than 4.5 million nodes and 124 million edges.

    "abstract": "Aphasia, a language disorder resulting from brain damage, requires accurate identification of specific aphasia types, such as Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, for effective treatment. However, little attention has been paid to developing methods to detect different types of aphasia. Recognizing the importance of analyzing co-speech gestures for distinguish aphasia types, we propose a multimodal graph neural network for aphasia type detection using speech and corresponding gesture patterns. By learning the correlation between the speech and gesture modalities for each aphasia type, our model can generate textual representations sensitive to gesture information, leading to accurate aphasia type detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results (F1 84.2\\%). We also show that gesture features outperform acoustic features, highlighting the significance of gesture expression in detecting aphasia types.

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of indoor space geometries is vital for constructing precise digital twins, whose broad industrial applications include navigation in unfamiliar environments and efficient evacuation planning, particularly in low-light conditions. This study introduces EchoScan, a deep neural network model that utilizes acoustic echoes to perform room geometry inference. Conventional sound-based techniques rely on estimating geometry-related room parameters such as wall position and room size, thereby limiting the diversity of inferable room geometries. Contrarily, EchoScan overcomes this limitation by directly inferring room floorplans and heights, thereby enabling it to handle rooms with arbitrary shapes, including curved walls. The key innovation of EchoScan is its ability to analyze the complex relationship between low- and high-order reflections in room impulse responses (RIRs) using a multi-aggregation module. The analysis of high-order reflections also enables it to infer complex room shapes when echoes are unobservable from the position of an audio device. Herein, EchoScan was trained and evaluated using RIRs synthesized from complex environments, including the Manhattan and Atlanta layouts, employing a practical audio device configuration compatible with commercial, off-the-shelf devices. Compared with vision-based methods, EchoScan demonstrated outstanding geometry estimation performance in rooms with various shapes. ",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous information network (HIN), which contains rich semantics depicted by meta-paths, has become a powerful tool to alleviate data sparsity in recommender systems. Existing HIN-based recommendations hold the data centralized storage assumption and conduct centralized model training. However, the real-world data is often stored in a distributed manner for privacy concerns, resulting in the failure of centralized HIN-based recommendations. In this paper, we suggest the HIN is partitioned into private HINs stored in the client side and shared HINs in the server. Following this setting, we propose a federated heterogeneous graph neural network (FedHGNN) based framework, which can collaboratively train a recommendation model on distributed HINs without leaking user privacy. Specifically, we first formalize the privacy definition in the light of differential privacy for HIN-based federated recommendation, which aims to protect user-item interactions of private HIN as well as user's high-order patterns from shared HINs. To recover the broken meta-path based semantics caused by distributed data storage and satisfy the proposed privacy, we elaborately design a semantic-preserving user interactions publishing method, which locally perturbs user's high-order patterns as well as related user-item interactions for publishing. After that, we propose a HGNN model for recommendation, which conducts node- and semantic-level aggregations to capture recovered semantics. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin (up to 34% in HR@10 and 42% in NDCG@10) under an acceptable privacy budget. ",

    "abstract": "One of the primary objectives for future wireless communication networks is to facilitate the provision of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication services while simultaneously ensuring the capability for vast connection. In order to achieve this objective, we examine a hybrid multi-access scheme inside the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. This system combines the benefits of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) schemes with the aim of fulfilling the objectives of future wireless communication networks. In addition, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is utilized to facilitate the establishment of the uplink transmission between the base station and mobile devices in situations when impediments impede their direct communication linkages. This paper aims to minimize the worst-case decoding-error probability for all mobile users by jointly optimizing power allocation, receiving beamforming, blocklength, RIS reflection, and user pairing. To deal with the coupled variables in the formulated mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, we decompose it into three sub-problems, namely, 1) decoding order determination problem, 2) joint power allocation, receiving beamforming, RIS reflection, and blocklength optimization problem, and 3) optimal user pairing problem. Then, we provide the sequential convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithms as potential solutions for iteratively addressing the deconstructed first two sub-problems at a fixed random user pairing. In addition, the Hungarian matching approach is employed to address the challenge of optimizing user pairing. In conclusion, we undertake a comprehensive simulation, which reveals the advantageous qualities of the proposed algorithm and its superior performance compared to existing benchmark methods. ",

Due to the specific requirements of different tasks like optical flow estimation and local feature matching, previous works are primarily categorized into dense matching and sparse feature matching focusing on specialized architectures along with task-specific datasets, which may somewhat hinder the generalization performance of specialized models. In this paper, we propose a deep model for sparse and dense matching, termed RGM (Robust Generalist Matching). In particular, we elaborately design a cascaded GRU module for refinement by exploring the geometric similarity iteratively at multiple scales following an additional uncertainty estimation module for sparsification. To narrow the gap between synthetic training samples and real-world scenarios, we build a new, large-scale dataset with sparse correspondence ground truth by generating optical flow supervision with greater intervals. As such, we are able to mix up various dense and sparse matching datasets, significantly improving the training diversity. The generalization capacity of our proposed RGM is greatly improved by learning the matching and uncertainty estimation in a two-stage manner on the large, mixed data. Superior performance is achieved for zero-shot matching and downstream geometry estimation across multiple datasets, outperforming the previous methods by a large margin. ",

To systematically investigate their competency in the law, we design practical baseline solutions based on LLMs and test on the task of legal judgment prediction. In our solutions, LLMs can work alone to answer open questions or coordinate with an information retrieval (IR) system to learn from similar cases or solve simplified multi-choice questions. We show that similar cases and multi-choice options, namely label candidates, included in prompts can help LLMs recall domain knowledge that is critical for expertise legal reasoning. We additionally present an intriguing paradox wherein an IR system surpasses the performance of LLM+IR due to limited gains acquired by weaker LLMs from powerful IR systems. In such cases, the role of LLMs becomes redundant. Our evaluation pipeline can be easily extended into other tasks to facilitate evaluations in other domains.

To eliminate such inconsistency, in this study we propose a novel Quasi-Wasserstein (QW) loss with the help of the optimal transport defined on graphs, leading to new learning and prediction paradigms of GNNs. In particular, we design a \"Quasi-Wasserstein\" distance between the observed multi-dimensional node labels and their estimations, optimizing the label transport defined on graph edges. The estimations are parameterized by a GNN in which the optimal label transport may determine the graph edge weights optionally. By reformulating the strict constraint of the label transport to a Bregman divergence-based regularizer, we obtain the proposed Quasi-Wasserstein loss associated with two efficient solvers learning the GNN together with optimal label transport. When predicting node labels, our model combines the output of the GNN with the residual component provided by the optimal label transport, leading to a new transductive prediction paradigm. Experiments show that the proposed QW loss applies to various GNNs and helps to improve their performance in node-level classification and regression tasks. ",

In this work, we propose a general framework named Progressive3D, which decomposes the entire generation into a series of locally progressive editing steps to create precise 3D content for complex prompts, and we constrain the content change to only occur in regions determined by user-defined region prompts in each editing step. Furthermore, we propose an overlapped semantic component suppression technique to encourage the optimization process to focus more on the semantic differences between prompts.

The majority of formulations related to graph partitioning exhibit NP-hardness due to their combinatorial nature. As a result, conventional approximation algorithms rely on heuristic methods, sometimes with approximation guarantees and sometimes without. Unfortunately, traditional approaches are tailored for specific partitioning objectives and do not generalize well across other known partitioning objectives from the literature. To overcome this limitation, and learn heuristics from the data directly, neural approaches have emerged, demonstrating promising outcomes. In this study, we extend this line of work through a novel framework, NeuroCut. NeuroCut introduces two key innovations over prevailing methodologies. First, it is inductive to both graph topology and the partition count, which is provided at query time. Second, by leveraging a reinforcement learning based framework over node representations derived from a graph neural network, NeuroCut can accommodate any optimization objective, even those encompassing non-differentiable functions. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that NeuroCut excels in identifying high-quality partitions, showcases strong generalization across a wide spectrum of partitioning objectives, and exhibits resilience to topological modifications.

However, due to insufficient robustness, vanilla PINNs often face challenges when solving complex PDEs, especially those involving multi-scale behaviors or solutions with sharp or oscillatory characteristics. To address these issues, based on the projected gradient descent adversarial attack, we proposed an adversarial training strategy for PINNs termed by AT-PINNs. AT-PINNs enhance the robustness of PINNs by fine-tuning the model with adversarial samples, which can accurately identify model failure locations and drive the model to focus on those regions during training. AT-PINNs can also perform inference with temporal causality by selecting the initial collocation points around temporal initial values. We implement AT-PINNs to the elliptic equation with multi-scale coefficients, Poisson equation with multi-peak solutions, Burgers equation with sharp solutions and the Allen-Cahn equation. The results demonstrate that AT-PINNs can effectively locate and reduce failure regions. Moreover, AT-PINNs are suitable for solving complex PDEs, since locating failure regions through adversarial attacks is independent of the size of failure regions or the complexity of the distribution.

    "abstract": "Innovations like protein diffusion have enabled significant progress in de novo protein design, which is a vital topic in life science. These methods typically depend on protein structure encoders to model residue backbone frames, where atoms do not exist. Most prior encoders rely on atom-wise features, such as angles and distances between atoms, which are not available in this context. Thus far, only several simple encoders, such as IPA, have been proposed for this scenario, exposing the frame modeling as a bottleneck. In this work, we proffer the Vector Field Network (VFN), which enables network layers to perform learnable vector computations between coordinates of frame-anchored virtual atoms, thus achieving a higher capability for modeling frames. The vector computation operates in a manner similar to a linear layer, with each input channel receiving 3D virtual atom coordinates instead of scalar values. The multiple feature vectors output by the vector computation are then used to update the residue representations and virtual atom coordinates via attention aggregation. Remarkably, VFN also excels in modeling both frames and atoms, as the real atoms can be treated as the virtual atoms for modeling, positioning VFN as a potential universal encoder. In protein diffusion (frame modeling), VFN exhibits an impressive performance advantage over IPA, excelling in terms of both designability (67.04% vs. 53.58%) and diversity (66.54% vs. 51.98%). In inverse folding (frame and atom modeling), VFN outperforms the previous SoTA model, PiFold (54.7% vs. 51.66%), on sequence recovery rate. We also propose a method of equipping VFN with the ESM model, which significantly surpasses the previous ESM-based SoTA (62.67% vs. 55.65%), LM-Design, by a substantial margin. ",

We propose the first approach for realistic 3D hand-object shape and pose reconstruction from a single depth map. Unlike previous work, our voxel-based reconstruction network regresses the vertex coordinates of a hand and an object and reconstructs more realistic interaction. Our pipeline additionally predicts voxelized hand-object shapes, having a one-to-one mapping to the input voxelized depth. Thereafter, we exploit the graph nature of the hand and object shapes, by utilizing the recent GraFormer network with positional embedding to reconstruct shapes from template meshes. In addition, we show the impact of adding another GraFormer component that refines the reconstructed shapes based on the hand-object interactions and its ability to reconstruct more accurate object shapes. We perform an extensive evaluation on the HO-3D and DexYCB datasets and show that our method outperforms existing approaches in hand reconstruction and produces plausible reconstructions for the objects ",

The lack of sizeable labelled datasets hinders speech-processing research across languages. Recent advances in contrastive learning provide self-supervised techniques to learn from unlabelled data. Motivated by reducing data dependence and improving generalisation across diverse languages and conditions, we develop a multilingual contrastive framework. This framework enables models to acquire shared representations across languages, facilitating cross-lingual transfer with limited target language data. Additionally, capturing emotional cues within speech is challenging due to subjective perceptual assessments. By learning expressive representations from diverse, multilingual data in a self-supervised manner, our approach aims to develop speech representations that encode emotive dimensions. Our method trains encoders on a large corpus of multi-lingual audio data. Data augmentation techniques are employed to expand the dataset. The contrastive learning approach trains the model to maximise agreement between positive pairs and minimise agreement between negative pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model on emotion recognition, audio classification, and retrieval benchmarks under zero-shot and few-shot conditions. This provides an effective approach for acquiring shared and generalised speech representations across languages and acoustic conditions while encoding latent emotional dimensions. ",

    "abstract": "Within the realm of image recognition, a specific category of multi-label classification (MLC) challenges arises when objects within the visual field may occlude one another, demanding simultaneous identification of both occluded and occluding objects. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can tackle these challenges; however, those models tend to be bulky and can only attain modest levels of accuracy. Leveraging insights from cutting-edge neural science research, specifically the Holistic Bursting (HB) cell, this paper introduces a pioneering integrated network framework named HB-net. Built upon the foundation of HB cell clusters, HB-net is designed to address the intricate task of simultaneously recognizing multiple occluded objects within images. Various Bursting cell cluster structures are introduced, complemented by an evidence accumulation mechanism. Testing is conducted on multiple datasets comprising digits and letters. The results demonstrate that models incorporating the HB framework exhibit a significant $2.98\\%$ enhancement in recognition accuracy compared to models without the HB framework ($1.0298$ times, $p=0.0499$). Although in high-noise settings, standard CNNs exhibit slightly greater robustness when compared to HB-net models, the models that combine the HB framework and EA mechanism achieve a comparable level of accuracy and resilience to ResNet50, despite having only three convolutional layers and approximately $1/30$ of the parameters. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for improving computer vision algorithms. The essential code is provided at https://github.com/d-lab438/hb-net.git. ",

    "title": "Revisiting Transferable Adversarial Image Examples: Attack  Categorization, Evaluation Guidelines, and New Insights",
    "abstract": "Transferable adversarial examples raise critical security concerns in real-world, black-box attack scenarios. However, in this work, we identify two main problems in common evaluation practices: (1) For attack transferability, lack of systematic, one-to-one attack comparison and fair hyperparameter settings. (2) For attack stealthiness, simply no comparisons. To address these problems, we establish new evaluation guidelines by (1) proposing a novel attack categorization strategy and conducting systematic and fair intra-category analyses on transferability, and (2) considering diverse imperceptibility metrics and finer-grained stealthiness characteristics from the perspective of attack traceback. To this end, we provide the first large-scale evaluation of transferable adversarial examples on ImageNet, involving 23 representative attacks against 9 representative defenses. Our evaluation leads to a number of new insights, including consensus-challenging ones: (1) Under a fair attack hyperparameter setting, one early attack method, DI, actually outperforms all the follow-up methods. (2) A state-of-the-art defense, DiffPure, actually gives a false sense of (white-box) security since it is indeed largely bypassed by our (black-box) transferable attacks. (3) Even when all attacks are bounded by the same $L_p$ norm, they lead to dramatically different stealthiness performance, which negatively correlates with their transferability performance. Overall, our work demonstrates that existing problematic evaluations have indeed caused misleading conclusions and missing points, and as a result, hindered the assessment of the actual progress in this field.

    "abstract": "The shift towards clean energy brings about notable transformations to the energy system. In order to optimally plan a future energy system, it is necessary to consider the influence of several sectors as well as the interaction of the transmission grid and distribution grid. The concept of Feasible Operation Region (FOR) is a detailed approach to representing the operational dependencies between the transmission and distribution grid. However, in previous planning procedures, only a simplified expansion of the distribution grids can be taken into account. With the method presented in this paper, a Feasible Planning Region (FPR) is developed, which represents the operational boundaries of the distribution grids for several expansion stages and thus represents an admissible solution space for the planning of distribution grids in systemic planning approaches. It hence enables a more detailed representation of the necessary distribution grid expansion for the integration of distributed technologies in an optimized energy system of the future. In this paper, we present the method by which the FPR is formed and its integration into an energy system planning formulation. In the results, the FPR is presented for different voltage levels, and its use in power system planning is demonstrated. ",

    "abstract": "We propose VQ-NeRF, a two-branch neural network model that incorporates Vector Quantization (VQ) to decompose and edit reflectance fields in 3D scenes. Conventional neural reflectance fields use only continuous representations to model 3D scenes, despite the fact that objects are typically composed of discrete materials in reality. This lack of discretization can result in noisy material decomposition and complicated material editing. To address these limitations, our model consists of a continuous branch and a discrete branch. The continuous branch follows the conventional pipeline to predict decomposed materials, while the discrete branch uses the VQ mechanism to quantize continuous materials into individual ones. By discretizing the materials, our model can reduce noise in the decomposition process and generate a segmentation map of discrete materials. Specific materials can be easily selected for further editing by clicking on the corresponding area of the segmentation outcomes. Additionally, we propose a dropout-based VQ codeword ranking strategy to predict the number of materials in a scene, which reduces redundancy in the material segmentation process. To improve usability, we also develop an interactive interface to further assist material editing. We evaluate our model on both computer-generated and real-world scenes, demonstrating its superior performance. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to enable discrete material editing in 3D scenes. ",

An intuitive manifestation is that networks which excel in certain tasks often fail to deliver satisfactory results in others. To illustrate this point, we select five representative image restoration networks and conduct a comparative study on five classic image restoration tasks. First, we provide a detailed explanation of the characteristics of different image restoration tasks and backbone networks. Following this, we present the benchmark results and analyze the reasons behind the performance disparity of different models across various tasks. Drawing from this comparative study, we propose that a general image restoration backbone network needs to meet the functional requirements of diverse tasks. Based on this principle, we design a new general image restoration backbone network, X-Restormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-Restormer possesses good task generality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Temporal bipartite graphs are widely used to denote time-evolving relationships between two disjoint sets of nodes, such as customer-product interactions in E-commerce and user-group memberships in social networks. Temporal butterflies, $(2,2)$-bicliques that occur within a short period and in a prescribed order, are essential in modeling the structural and sequential patterns of such graphs. Counting the number of temporal butterflies is thus a fundamental task in analyzing temporal bipartite graphs. However, existing algorithms for butterfly counting on static bipartite graphs and motif counting on temporal unipartite graphs are inefficient for this purpose. In this paper, we present a general framework with three sampling strategies for temporal butterfly counting. Since exact counting can be time-consuming on large graphs, our approach alternatively computes approximate estimates accurately and efficiently. We also provide analytical bounds on the number of samples each strategy requires to obtain estimates with small relative errors and high probability. We finally evaluate our framework on six real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior accuracy and efficiency compared to several baselines. Overall, our proposed framework and sampling strategies provide efficient and accurate approaches to approximating temporal butterfly counts on large-scale temporal bipartite graphs. ",

Additionally, simulated scenarios fail to capture all of the complexities present in real network scenarios. While there exists network models based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to minimize these issues, these models are also trained with simulated data and hence vulnerable to the same pitfalls. Consequently, the Graph Neural Networking Challenge 2023 introduces a dataset of captured traffic traces that can be used to build a ML-based network model without these limitations. In this paper we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based solution specifically designed to better capture the complexities of real network scenarios. This is done through a novel encoding method to capture information from the sequence of captured packets, and an improved message passing algorithm to better represent the dependencies present in physical networks. We show that the proposed solution it is able to learn and generalize to unseen captured network scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach to counter adversarial attacks, namely, image resampling. Image resampling transforms a discrete image into a new one, simulating the process of scene recapturing or rerendering as specified by a geometrical transformation. The underlying rationale behind our idea is that image resampling can alleviate the influence of adversarial perturbations while preserving essential semantic information, thereby conferring an inherent advantage in defending against adversarial attacks. To validate this concept, we present a comprehensive study on leveraging image resampling to defend against adversarial attacks. We have developed basic resampling methods that employ interpolation strategies and coordinate shifting magnitudes. Our analysis reveals that these basic methods can partially mitigate adversarial attacks. However, they come with apparent limitations: the accuracy of clean images noticeably decreases, while the improvement in accuracy on adversarial examples is not substantial. We propose implicit representation-driven image resampling (IRAD) to overcome these limitations. First, we construct an implicit continuous representation that enables us to represent any input image within a continuous coordinate space. Second, we introduce SampleNet, which automatically generates pixel-wise shifts for resampling in response to different inputs. Furthermore, we can extend our approach to the state-of-the-art diffusion-based method, accelerating it with fewer time steps while preserving its defense capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the adversarial robustness of diverse deep models against various attacks while maintaining high accuracy on clean images. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, multi-agent collaborative (MAC) perception has been proposed and outperformed the traditional single-agent perception in many applications, such as autonomous driving. However, MAC perception is more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than single-agent perception due to the information exchange. The attacker can easily degrade the performance of a victim agent by sending harmful information from a malicious agent nearby. In this paper, we extend adversarial attacks to an important perception task -- MAC object detection, where generic defenses such as adversarial training are no longer effective against these attacks. More importantly, we propose Malicious Agent Detection (MADE), a reactive defense specific to MAC perception that can be deployed by each agent to accurately detect and then remove any potential malicious agent in its local collaboration network. In particular, MADE inspects each agent in the network independently using a semi-supervised anomaly detector based on a double-hypothesis test with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false positive rate of the inference. For the two hypothesis tests, we propose a match loss statistic and a collaborative reconstruction loss statistic, respectively, both based on the consistency between the agent to be inspected and the ego agent where our detector is deployed. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark 3D dataset V2X-sim and a real-road dataset DAIR-V2X and show that with the protection of MADE, the drops in the average precision compared with the best-case \"oracle\" defender against our attack are merely 1.28% and 0.34%, respectively, much lower than 8.92% and 10.00% for adversarial training, respectively.

    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained models are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks through a new paradigm called prompt learning. In contrast to fine-tuning, prompt learning does not update the pre-trained model's parameters. Instead, it only learns an input perturbation, namely prompt, to be added to the downstream task data for predictions. Given the fast development of prompt learning, a well-generalized prompt inevitably becomes a valuable asset as significant effort and proprietary data are used to create it. This naturally raises the question of whether a prompt may leak the proprietary information of its training data. In this paper, we perform the first comprehensive privacy assessment of prompts learned by visual prompt learning through the lens of property inference and membership inference attacks. Our empirical evaluation shows that the prompts are vulnerable to both attacks. We also demonstrate that the adversary can mount a successful property inference attack with limited cost. Moreover, we show that membership inference attacks against prompts can be successful with relaxed adversarial assumptions. We further make some initial investigations on the defenses and observe that our method can mitigate the membership inference attacks with a decent utility-defense trade-off but fails to defend against property inference attacks. We hope our results can shed light on the privacy risks of the popular prompt learning paradigm. To facilitate the research in this direction, we will share our code and models with the community. ",

    "abstract": "Commonsense Knowledge Graphs (CSKGs) are crucial for commonsense reasoning, yet constructing them through human annotations can be costly. As a result, various automatic methods have been proposed to construct CSKG with larger semantic coverage. However, these unsupervised approaches introduce spurious noise that can lower the quality of the resulting CSKG, which cannot be tackled easily by existing denoising algorithms due to the unique characteristics of nodes and structures in CSKGs. To address this issue, we propose Gold (Global and Local-aware Denoising), a denoising framework for CSKGs that incorporates entity semantic information, global rules, and local structural information from the CSKG. Experiment results demonstrate that Gold outperforms all baseline methods in noise detection tasks on synthetic noisy CSKG benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that denoising a real-world CSKG is effective and even benefits the downstream zero-shot commonsense question-answering task. ",

    "abstract": "Face forgery generation technologies generate vivid faces, which have raised public concerns about security and privacy. Many intelligent systems, such as electronic payment and identity verification, rely on face forgery detection. Although face forgery detection has successfully distinguished fake faces, recent studies have demonstrated that face forgery detectors are very vulnerable to adversarial examples. Meanwhile, existing attacks rely on network architectures or training datasets instead of the predicted labels, which leads to a gap in attacking deployed applications. To narrow this gap, we first explore the decision-based attacks on face forgery detection. However, applying existing decision-based attacks directly suffers from perturbation initialization failure and low image quality. First, we propose cross-task perturbation to handle initialization failures by utilizing the high correlation of face features on different tasks. Then, inspired by using frequency cues by face forgery detection, we propose the frequency decision-based attack. We add perturbations in the frequency domain and then constrain the visual quality in the spatial domain. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance on FaceForensics++, CelebDF, and industrial APIs, with high query efficiency and guaranteed image quality. Further, the fake faces by our method can pass face forgery detection and face recognition, which exposes the security problems of face forgery detectors. ",

CORE includes 4,708 instances of 12 relation types with corresponding textual evidence extracted from company Wikipedia pages. Company names and business entities pose a challenge for few-shot RC models due to the rich and diverse information associated with them. For example, a company name may represent the legal entity, products, people, or business divisions depending on the context. Therefore, deriving the relation type between entities is highly dependent on textual context. To evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art RC models on the CORE dataset, we conduct experiments in the few-shot domain adaptation setting. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps, confirming that models trained on different domains struggle to adapt to CORE. Interestingly, we find that models trained on CORE showcase improved out-of-domain performance, which highlights the importance of high-quality data for robust domain adaptation. Specifically, the information richness embedded in business entities allows models to focus on contextual nuances, reducing their reliance on superficial clues such as relation-specific verbs. In addition to the dataset, we provide relevant code snippets to facilitate reproducibility and encourage further research in the field. ",

    "abstract": "In drug discovery, it is vital to confirm the predictions of pharmaceutical properties from computational models using costly wet-lab experiments. Hence, obtaining reliable uncertainty estimates is crucial for prioritizing drug molecules for subsequent experimental validation. Conformal Prediction (CP) is a promising tool for creating such prediction sets for molecular properties with a coverage guarantee. However, the exchangeability assumption of CP is often challenged with covariate shift in drug discovery tasks: Most datasets contain limited labeled data, which may not be representative of the vast chemical space from which molecules are drawn. To address this limitation, we propose a method called CoDrug that employs an energy-based model leveraging both training data and unlabelled data, and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to assess the densities of a molecule set. The estimated densities are then used to weigh the molecule samples while building prediction sets and rectifying for distribution shift. In extensive experiments involving realistic distribution drifts in various small-molecule drug discovery tasks, we demonstrate the ability of CoDrug to provide valid prediction sets and its utility in addressing the distribution shift arising from de novo drug design models. On average, using CoDrug can reduce the coverage gap by over 35% when compared to conformal prediction sets not adjusted for covariate shift. ",

We propose a solution to overcome these limitations by exploring beyond the first-order moments for robust alignment of categorical distributions. We employ objectives that optimize the intra and inter-class distributions in a domain-invariant fashion and design a robust pseudo-labeling for efficient target supervision. Our approach incorporates a complement entropy objective module to reduce classification uncertainty and flatten incorrect category predictions.

In this paper we study whether given access to a trained GAN, as well as fresh samples from the underlying distribution, if it is possible for an attacker to efficiently identify if a given point is a member of the GAN's training data. This is of interest for both reasons related to copyright, where a user may want to determine if their copyrighted data has been used to train a GAN, and in the study of data privacy, where the ability to detect training set membership is known as a membership inference attack. Unlike the majority of prior work this paper investigates the privacy implications of using GANs in black-box settings, where the attack only has access to samples from the generator, rather than access to the discriminator as well. We introduce a suite of membership inference attacks against GANs in the black-box setting and evaluate our attacks on image GANs trained on the CIFAR10 dataset and tabular GANs trained on genomic data. Our most successful attack, called The Detector, involve training a second network to score samples based on their likelihood of being generated by the GAN, as opposed to a fresh sample from the distribution. We prove under a simple model of the generator that the detector is an approximately optimal membership inference attack. Across a wide range of tabular and image datasets, attacks, and GAN architectures, we find that adversaries can orchestrate non-trivial privacy attacks when provided with access to samples from the generator. At the same time, the attack success achievable against GANs still appears to be lower compared to other generative and discriminative models; this leaves the intriguing open question of whether GANs are in fact more private, or if it is a matter of developing stronger attacks.

Since visual transformers are recently being widely used in most image classification based tasks due to their capability to produce high accuracies, this study tries to explore bias in the transformer based image forensic algorithms that classify natural and GAN generated images. By procuring a bias evaluation corpora, this study analyzes bias in gender, racial, affective, and intersectional domains using a wide set of individual and pairwise bias evaluation measures. As the generalizability of the algorithms against image compression is an important factor to be considered in forensic tasks, this study also analyzes the role of image compression on model bias. Hence to study the impact of image compression on model bias, a two phase evaluation setting is followed, where a set of experiments is carried out in the uncompressed evaluation setting and the other in the compressed evaluation setting.

Most existing approaches rely on adjacency matrices or node embeddings when matching graphs, whose performances are often sub-optimal because of not fully leveraging the multi-modal information hidden in graphs, such as node attributes, subgraph structures, etc. In this study, we propose a novel and effective graph matching method based on a differentiable hierarchical optimal transport (HOT) framework, called DHOT-GM. Essentially, our method represents each graph as a set of relational matrices corresponding to the information of different modalities. Given two graphs, we enumerate all relational matrix pairs and obtain their matching results, and accordingly, infer the node correspondence by the weighted averaging of the matching results. This method can be implemented as computing the HOT distance between the two graphs -- each matching result is an optimal transport plan associated with the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance between two relational matrices, and the weights of all matching results are the elements of an upper-level optimal transport plan defined on the matrix sets. We propose a bi-level optimization algorithm to compute the HOT distance in a differentiable way, making the significance of the relational matrices adjustable. Experiments on various graph matching tasks demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Within the realm of privacy-preserving machine learning, empirical privacy defenses have been proposed as a solution to achieve satisfactory levels of training data privacy without a significant drop in model utility. Most existing defenses against membership inference attacks assume access to reference data, defined as an additional dataset coming from the same (or a similar) underlying distribution as training data. Despite the common use of reference data, previous works are notably reticent about defining and evaluating reference data privacy. As gains in model utility and/or training data privacy may come at the expense of reference data privacy, it is essential that all three aspects are duly considered. In this paper, we first examine the availability of reference data and its privacy treatment in previous works and demonstrate its necessity for fairly comparing defenses. Second, we propose a baseline defense that enables the utility-privacy tradeoff with respect to both training and reference data to be easily understood. Our method is formulated as an empirical risk minimization with a constraint on the generalization error, which, in practice, can be evaluated as a weighted empirical risk minimization (WERM) over the training and reference datasets. Although we conceived of WERM as a simple baseline, our experiments show that, surprisingly, it outperforms the most well-studied and current state-of-the-art empirical privacy defenses using reference data for nearly all relative privacy levels of reference and training data. Our investigation also reveals that these existing methods are unable to effectively trade off reference data privacy for model utility and/or training data privacy. Overall, our work highlights the need for a proper evaluation of the triad model utility / training data privacy / reference data privacy when comparing privacy defenses. ",

    "abstract": "Long-tailed object detection (LTOD) aims to handle the extreme data imbalance in real-world datasets, where many tail classes have scarce instances. One popular strategy is to explore extra data with image-level labels, yet it produces limited results due to (1) semantic ambiguity -- an image-level label only captures a salient part of the image, ignoring the remaining rich semantics within the image; and (2) location sensitivity -- the label highly depends on the locations and crops of the original image, which may change after data transformations like random cropping. To remedy this, we propose RichSem, a simple but effective method, which is robust to learn rich semantics from coarse locations without the need of accurate bounding boxes. RichSem leverages rich semantics from images, which are then served as additional soft supervision for training detectors. Specifically, we add a semantic branch to our detector to learn these soft semantics and enhance feature representations for long-tailed object detection. The semantic branch is only used for training and is removed during inference. RichSem achieves consistent improvements on both overall and rare-category of LVIS under different backbones and detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring complex training and testing procedures. Moreover, we show the effectiveness of our method on other long-tailed datasets with additional experiments. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/MengLcool/RichSem}. ",

We also perform evaluation on multiple MRI datasets (Calgary-Campinas(CC359) and CamCAN) to assess the generalization capability of the proposed models. We found disparities in the performance of brain age prediction models when trained on distinct sex subgroups and datasets, in both final predictions and decision making (assessed using interpretability models).

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are a powerful tool for predicting properties of quantum states from limited measurement data. Here we develop a network model that can simultaneously predict multiple quantum properties, including not only expectation values of quantum observables, but also general nonlinear functions of the quantum state, like entanglement entropies and many-body topological invariants. Remarkably, we find that a model trained on a given set of properties can also discover new properties outside that set. Multi-purpose training also enables the model to infer global properties of many-body quantum systems from local measurements, to classify symmetry protected topological phases of matter, and to discover unknown boundaries between different phases.

    "abstract": "Binwise Variance Scaling (BVS) has recently been proposed as a post hoc recalibration method for prediction uncertainties of machine learning regression problems that is able of more efficient corrections than uniform variance (or temperature) scaling. The original version of BVS uses uncertainty-based binning, which is aimed to improve calibration conditionally on uncertainty, i.e. consistency. I explore here several adaptations of BVS, in particular with alternative loss functions and a binning scheme based on an input-feature (X) in order to improve adaptivity, i.e. calibration conditional on X. The performances of BVS and its proposed variants are tested on a benchmark dataset for the prediction of atomization energies and compared to the results of isotonic regression. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel data-driven method to mitigate the risk of cascading failures in delayed discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. Our approach involves formulating a distributionally robust finite-horizon optimal control problem, where the objective is to minimize a given performance function while satisfying a set of distributionally chances constraints on cascading failures, which accounts for the impact of a known sequence of failures that can be characterized using nested sets. The optimal control problem becomes challenging as the risk of cascading failures and input time-delay poses limitations on the set of feasible control inputs. However, by solving the convex formulation of the distributionally robust model predictive control (DRMPC) problem, the proposed approach is able to keep the system from cascading failures while maintaining the system's performance with delayed control input, which has important implications for designing and operating complex engineering systems, where cascading failures can severely affect system performance, safety, and reliability.

    "abstract": "Recent analyses of neural networks with shaped activations (i.e. the activation function is scaled as the network size grows) have led to scaling limits described by differential equations. However, these results do not a priori tell us anything about \"ordinary\" unshaped networks, where the activation is unchanged as the network size grows. In this article, we find similar differential equation based asymptotic characterization for two types of unshaped networks. Firstly, we show that the following two architectures converge to the same infinite-depth-and-width limit at initialization: (i) a fully connected ResNet with a $d^{-1/2}$ factor on the residual branch, where $d$ is the network depth. (ii) a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with depth $d \\ll$ width $n$ and shaped ReLU activation at rate $d^{-1/2}$. Secondly, for an unshaped MLP at initialization, we derive the first order asymptotic correction to the layerwise correlation. In particular, if $\\rho_\\ell$ is the correlation at layer $\\ell$, then $q_t = \\ell^2 (1 - \\rho_\\ell)$ with $t = \\frac{\\ell}{n}$ converges to an SDE with a singularity at $t=0$. These results together provide a connection between shaped and unshaped network architectures, and opens up the possibility of studying the effect of normalization methods and how it connects with shaping activation functions.

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is vital to the generalization ability and robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) models. Existing augmentation methods for speaker verification manipulate the raw signal, which are time-consuming and the augmented samples lack diversity. In this paper, we present a novel difficulty-aware semantic augmentation (DASA) approach for speaker verification, which can generate diversified training samples in speaker embedding space with negligible extra computing cost. Firstly, we augment training samples by perturbing speaker embeddings along semantic directions, which are obtained from speaker-wise covariance matrices. Secondly, accurate covariance matrices are estimated from robust speaker embeddings during training, so we introduce difficultyaware additive margin softmax (DAAM-Softmax) to obtain optimal speaker embeddings. Finally, we assume the number of augmented samples goes to infinity and derive a closed-form upper bound of the expected loss with DASA, which achieves compatibility and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed approach can achieve a remarkable performance improvement. The best result achieves a 14.6% relative reduction in EER metric on CN-Celeb evaluation set.
