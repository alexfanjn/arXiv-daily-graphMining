    "title": "Enhancing Trustworthiness in ML-Based Network Intrusion Detection with  Uncertainty Quantification",
    "abstract": "The evolution of Internet and its related communication technologies have consistently increased the risk of cyber-attacks. In this context, a crucial role is played by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), which are security devices designed to identify and mitigate attacks to modern networks. In the last decade, data-driven approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) have gained more and more popularity for executing the classification tasks required by IDSs. However, typical ML models adopted for this purpose do not properly take into account the uncertainty associated with their own prediction. This poses significant challenges, as they tend to produce misleadingly high classification scores for both misclassified inputs and inputs belonging to unknown classes (e.g. novel attacks), limiting the trustworthiness of existing ML-based solutions. In this paper we argue that ML-based IDSs should always provide accurate uncertainty quantification to avoid overconfident predictions. In fact, an uncertainty-aware classification would be beneficial to enhance closed-set classification performance, would make it possible to efficiently carry out Active Learning, and would help recognize inputs of unknown classes as truly unknowns (i.e., not belonging to any known class), unlocking open-set classification capabilities and Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection. To verify it, we compare various ML-based methods for uncertainty quantification and for OoD detection, either specifically designed for or tailored to the domain of network intrusion detection, showing how a proper estimation of the model uncertainty can be exploited to significantly enhance the trustworthiness of ML-based IDSs. Our results also confirm that conventional ML-based approaches to network intrusion detection (e.g. based on traditional feed-forward Neural Networks) may not be appropriate and should be adopted with caution.

    "abstract": "Deploying Machine Learning as a Service gives rise to model plagiarism, leading to copyright infringement. Ownership testing techniques are designed to identify model fingerprints for verifying plagiarism. However, previous works often rely on overfitting or robustness features as fingerprints, lacking theoretical guarantees and exhibiting under-performance on generalized models. In this paper, we propose a novel ownership testing method called VeriDIP, which verifies a DNN model's intellectual property. VeriDIP makes two major contributions. (1) It utilizes membership inference attacks to estimate the lower bound of privacy leakage, which reflects the fingerprint of a given model. The privacy leakage fingerprints highlight the unique patterns through which the models memorize sensitive training datasets. (2) We introduce a novel approach using less private samples to enhance the performance of ownership testing. Extensive experimental results confirm that VeriDIP is effective and efficient in validating the ownership of deep learning models trained on both image and tabular datasets. VeriDIP achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on image datasets while significantly reducing computation and communication costs. Enhanced VeriDIP demonstrates superior verification performance on generalized deep learning models, particularly on table-trained models. Additionally, VeriDIP exhibits similar effectiveness on utility-preserving differentially private models compared to non-differentially private baselines. ",

    "title": "Backdoor Attack through Machine Unlearning",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the security issues of artificial intelligence have become increasingly prominent due to the rapid development of deep learning research and applications. Backdoor attack is an attack targeting the vulnerability of deep learning models, where hidden backdoors are activated by triggers embedded by the attacker, thereby outputting malicious predictions that may not align with the intended output for a given input. In this work, we propose a novel black-box backdoor attack based on machine unlearning. The attacker first augments the training set with carefully designed samples, including poison and mitigation data, to train a 'benign' model. Then, the attacker posts unlearning requests for the mitigation samples to remove the impact of relevant data on the model, gradually activating the hidden backdoor. Since backdoors are implanted during the iterative unlearning process, it significantly increases the computational overhead of existing defense methods for backdoor detection or mitigation. To address this new security threat, we propose two methods for detecting or mitigating such malicious unlearning requests. We conduct the experiment in both naive unlearning and SISA settings. Experimental results show that: 1) our attack can successfully implant backdoor into the model, and sharding increases the difficulty of attack; 2) our detection algorithms are effective in identifying the mitigation samples, while sharding reduces the effectiveness of our detection algorithms.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of network attacks poses a significant threat. Researchers propose datasets for network attacks to support research in related fields. Then, many attack detection methods based on these datasets are proposed. These detection methods, whether two-classification or multi-classification, belong to single-label learning, i.e., only one label is given to each sample. However, we discover that there is a noteworthy phenomenon of behavior attribute overlap between attacks, The presentation of this phenomenon in a dataset is that there are multiple samples with the same features but different labels. In this paper, we verify the phenomenon in well-known datasets(UNSW-NB15, CCCS-CIC-AndMal-2020) and re-label these data. In addition, detecting network attacks in a multi-label manner can obtain more information, providing support for tracing the attack source and building IDS. Therefore, we propose a multi-label detection model based on deep learning, MLD-Model, in which Wasserstein-Generative-Adversarial- Network-with-Gradient-Penalty (WGAN-GP) with improved loss performs data enhancement to alleviate the class imbalance problem, and Auto-Encoder (AE) performs classifier parameter pre-training. Experimental results demonstrate that MLD-Model can achieve excellent classification performance. It can achieve F1=80.06% in UNSW-NB15 and F1=83.63% in CCCS-CIC-AndMal-2020. Especially, MLD-Model is 5.99%-7.97% higher in F1 compared with the related single-label methods. ",

    "abstract": "Deception, which includes leading cyber-attackers astray with false information, has shown to be an effective method of thwarting cyber-attacks. There has been little investigation of the effect of probing action costs on adversarial decision-making, despite earlier studies on deception in cybersecurity focusing primarily on variables like network size and the percentage of honeypots utilized in games. Understanding human decision-making when prompted with choices of various costs is essential in many areas such as in cyber security. In this paper, we will use a deception game (DG) to examine different costs of probing on adversarial decisions. To achieve this we utilized an IBLT model and a delayed feedback mechanism to mimic knowledge of human actions. Our results were taken from an even split of deception and no deception to compare each influence. It was concluded that probing was slightly taken less as the cost of probing increased. The proportion of attacks stayed relatively the same as the cost of probing increased. Although a constant cost led to a slight decrease in attacks. Overall, our results concluded that the different probing costs do not have an impact on the proportion of attacks whereas it had a slightly noticeable impact on the proportion of probing. ",

Privacy in the metaverse is a critical concern as the concept evolves and immersive virtual experiences become more prevalent. The metaverse privacy problem refers to the challenges and concerns surrounding the privacy of personal information and data within Virtual Reality (VR) environments as the concept of a shared VR space becomes more accessible. Metaverse will harness advancements from various technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Extended Reality (XR), Mixed Reality (MR), and 5G/6G-based communication to provide personalized and immersive services to its users. Moreover, to enable more personalized experiences, the metaverse relies on the collection of fine-grained user data that leads to various privacy issues. Therefore, before the potential of the metaverse can be fully realized, privacy concerns related to personal information and data within VR environments must be addressed. This includes safeguarding users' control over their data, ensuring the security of their personal information, and protecting in-world actions and interactions from unauthorized sharing. In this paper, we explore various privacy challenges that future metaverses are expected to face, given their reliance on AI for tracking users, creating XR and MR experiences, and facilitating interactions. Moreover, we thoroughly analyze technical solutions such as differential privacy, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Federated Learning (FL) and discuss related sociotechnical issues regarding privacy.

    "title": "Extracting Physical Causality from Measurements to Detect and Localize  False Data Injection Attacks",
    "abstract": "False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) has become a growing concern in modern cyber-physical power systems. Most existing FDIA detection techniques project the raw measurement data into a high-dimensional latent space to separate normal and attacked samples. These approaches focus more on the statistical correlations of data values and are therefore susceptible to data distribution drifts induced by changes in system operating points or changes in FDIA types and strengths, especially for FDIA localization tasks. Causal inference, on the other hand, extracts the causality behind the coordinated fluctuations of different measurements. The causality patterns are determined by fundamental physical laws such as Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Law. They are sensitive to the violation of physical laws caused by FDIA, but tend to remain stable with the drift of system operating points. Leveraging this advantage, this paper proposes a joint FDIA detection and localization framework based on causal inference and the Graph Attention Network (GAT) to identify the attacked system nodes. The proposed framework consists of two levels. The lower level uses the X-learner algorithm to estimate the causality strength between measurements and generate Measurement Causality Graphs (MCGs). The upper level then applies a GAT to identify the anomaly patterns in the MCGs. Since the extracted causality patterns are intrinsically related to the measurements, it is easier for the upper level to figure out the attacked nodes than the existing FDIA localization approaches. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the IEEE 39-bus system. Experimental results show that the causality-based FDIA detection and localization mechanism is highly interpretable and robust. ",

    "abstract": "With the burgeoning advancements of computing and network communication technologies, network infrastructures and their application environments have become increasingly complex. Due to the increased complexity, networks are more prone to hardware faults and highly susceptible to cyber-attacks. Therefore, for rapidly growing network-centric applications, network resilience is essential to minimize the impact of attacks and to ensure that the network provides an acceptable level of services during attacks, faults or disruptions. In this regard, this thesis focuses on developing effective approaches for enhancing network resilience. Existing approaches for enhancing network resilience emphasize on determining bottleneck nodes and edges in the network and designing proactive responses to safeguard the network against attacks. However, existing solutions generally consider broader application domains and possess limited applicability when applied to specific application areas such as cyber defense and information diffusion, which are highly popular application domains among cyber attackers. This thesis aims to design effective, efficient and scalable techniques for discovering bottleneck nodes and edges in the network to enhance network resilience in cyber defense and information diffusion application domains. We first investigate a cyber defense graph optimization problem, i.e., hardening active directory systems by discovering bottleneck edges in the network. We then study the problem of identifying bottleneck structural hole spanner nodes, which are crucial for information diffusion in the network. We transform both problems into graph-combinatorial optimization problems and design machine learning based approaches for discovering bottleneck points vital for enhancing network resilience. ",

    "abstract": "In leading collaborative filtering (CF) models, representations of users and items are prone to learn popularity bias in the training data as shortcuts. The popularity shortcut tricks are good for in-distribution (ID) performance but poorly generalized to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., when popularity distribution of test data shifts w.r.t. the training one. To close the gap, debiasing strategies try to assess the shortcut degrees and mitigate them from the representations. However, there exist two deficiencies: (1) when measuring the shortcut degrees, most strategies only use statistical metrics on a single aspect (i.e., item frequency on item and user frequency on user aspect), failing to accommodate the compositional degree of a user-item pair; (2) when mitigating shortcuts, many strategies assume that the test distribution is known in advance. This results in low-quality debiased representations. Worse still, these strategies achieve OOD generalizability with a sacrifice on ID performance. In this work, we present a simple yet effective debiasing strategy, PopGo, which quantifies and reduces the interaction-wise popularity shortcut without any assumptions on the test data. It first learns a shortcut model, which yields a shortcut degree of a user-item pair based on their popularity representations. Then, it trains the CF model by adjusting the predictions with the interaction-wise shortcut degrees. By taking both causal- and information-theoretical looks at PopGo, we can justify why it encourages the CF model to capture the critical popularity-agnostic features while leaving the spurious popularity-relevant patterns out. We use PopGo to debias two high-performing CF models (MF, LightGCN) on four benchmark datasets. On both ID and OOD test sets, PopGo achieves significant gains over the state-of-the-art debiasing strategies (e.g., DICE, MACR). ",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable prowess in code generation. However, automated code generation is still challenging since it requires a high-level semantic mapping between natural language requirements and codes. Most existing LLMs-based approaches for code generation rely on decoder-only causal language models often treate codes merely as plain text tokens \\ie feeding the requirements as a prompt input, and outputing code as flat sequence of tokens, potentially missing the rich semantic features inherent in source code. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the \"Semantic Chain-of-Thought\" approach to intruduce semantic information of code, named SeCoT. Our motivation is that the semantic information of the source code (\\eg data flow and control flow) describes more precise program execution behavior, intention and function. By guiding LLM consider and integrate semantic information, we can achieve a more granular understanding and representation of code, enhancing code generation accuracy. Meanwhile, while traditional techniques leveraging such semantic information require complex static or dynamic code analysis to obtain features such as data flow and control flow, SeCoT demonstrates that this process can be fully automated via the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs (\\ie in-context learning), while being generalizable and applicable to challenging domains. While SeCoT can be applied with different LLMs, this paper focuses on the powerful GPT-style models: ChatGPT(close-source model) and WizardCoder(open-source model). The experimental study on three popular DL benchmarks (\\ie HumanEval, HumanEval-ET and MBPP) shows that SeCoT can achieves state-of-the-art performance, greatly improving the potential for large models and code generation.

However, these models remain vulnerable to various attacks, among which the adversarial label-flipping attack poses significant threats. In label-flipping attacks, the adversary maliciously flips a portion of training labels to compromise the machine learning model. This paper raises significant concerns as these attacks can camouflage a highly skewed dataset as an easily solvable classification problem, often misleading machine learning practitioners into lower defenses and miscalculations of potential risks. This concern amplifies in tabular data settings, where identifying true labels requires expertise, allowing malicious label-flipping attacks to easily slip under the radar. To demonstrate this risk is inherited in the adversary's objective, we propose FALFA (Fast Adversarial Label-Flipping Attack), a novel efficient attack for crafting adversarial labels. FALFA is based on transforming the adversary's objective and employs linear programming to reduce computational complexity. Using ten real-world tabular datasets, we demonstrate FALFA's superior attack potential, highlighting the need for robust defenses against such threats. ",

Next, a deletion diagnostics procedure is conducted to model relations of these semantic-level representations via perceiving the network outputs and the extracted relations are utilized to guide the semantic-level representations to interact with each other. Finally, the interacted representations are utilized to augment original pixel-level representations for final predictions. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of IDRNet quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "abstract": "Traditional computational methods, such as the finite element analysis, have provided valuable insights into uncovering the underlying mechanisms of brain physical behaviors. However, precise predictions of brain physics require effective constitutive models to represent the intricate mechanical properties of brain tissue. In this study, we aimed to identify the most favorable constitutive material model for human brain tissue. To achieve this, we applied artificial neural network and multiple regression methods to a generalization of widely accepted classic models, and compared the results obtained from these two approaches. To evaluate the applicability and efficacy of the model, all setups were kept consistent across both methods, except for the approach to prevent potential overfitting. Our results demonstrate that artificial neural networks are capable of automatically identifying accurate constitutive models from given admissible estimators. Nonetheless, the five-term and two-term neural network models trained under single-mode and multi-mode loading scenarios, were found to be suboptimal and could be further simplified into two-term and single-term, respectively, with higher accuracy using multiple regression. Our findings highlight the importance of hyperparameters for the artificial neural network and emphasize the necessity for detailed cross-validations of regularization parameters to ensure optimal selection at a global level in the development of material constitutive models. This study validates the applicability and accuracy of artificial neural network to automatically discover constitutive material models with proper regularization as well as the benefits in model simplification without compromising accuracy for traditional multivariable regression.

Standard ReLU deep neural networks (ReLU DNNs) cannot achieve this goal. DSRNs consist primarily of ReLU DNNs, and several layers of the square of ReLU added at the end to smooth the networks output. This approach retains the advantages of ReLU DNNs, leading to the straightforward training. The paper also proves the optimality of DSRNs by estimating the VC-dimension of higher-order derivatives of DNNs, and obtains the generalization error in Sobolev spaces via an estimate of the pseudo-dimension of higher-order derivatives of DNNs.

    "abstract": "Neural networks with wide layers have attracted significant attention due to their equivalence to Gaussian processes, enabling perfect fitting of training data while maintaining generalization performance, known as benign overfitting. However, existing results mainly focus on shallow or finite-depth networks, necessitating a comprehensive analysis of wide neural networks with infinite-depth layers, such as neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and deep equilibrium models (DEQs). In this paper, we specifically investigate the deep equilibrium model (DEQ), an infinite-depth neural network with shared weight matrices across layers. Our analysis reveals that as the width of DEQ layers approaches infinity, it converges to a Gaussian process, establishing what is known as the Neural Network and Gaussian Process (NNGP) correspondence. Remarkably, this convergence holds even when the limits of depth and width are interchanged, which is not observed in typical infinite-depth Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the associated Gaussian vector remains non-degenerate for any pairwise distinct input data, ensuring a strictly positive smallest eigenvalue of the corresponding kernel matrix using the NNGP kernel. These findings serve as fundamental elements for studying the training and generalization of DEQs, laying the groundwork for future research in this area. ",

The recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have also been employed to learn governing equations given data across diverse scientific disciplines. Despite the effectiveness of PINNs for discovering governing equations, the physical models encoded in PINNs may be misspecified in complex systems as some of the physical processes may not be fully understood, leading to the poor accuracy of PINN predictions. In this work, we present a general approach to correct the misspecified physical models in PINNs for discovering governing equations, given some sparse and/or noisy data. Specifically, we first encode the assumed physical models, which may be misspecified, then employ other deep neural networks (DNNs) to model the discrepancy between the imperfect models and the observational data. Due to the expressivity of DNNs, the proposed method is capable of reducing the computational errors caused by the model misspecification and thus enables the applications of PINNs in complex systems where the physical processes are not exactly known. Furthermore, we utilize the Bayesian PINNs (B-PINNs) and/or ensemble PINNs to quantify uncertainties arising from noisy and/or gappy data in the discovered governing equations. A series of numerical examples including non-Newtonian channel and cavity flows demonstrate that the added DNNs are capable of correcting the model misspecification in PINNs and thus reduce the discrepancy between the physical models and the observational data. We envision that the proposed approach will extend the applications of PINNs for discovering governing equations in problems where the physico-chemical or biological processes are not well understood.

Backdoor attacks pose a significant security risk due to their stealthy nature and potentially serious consequences. Such attacks involve embedding triggers within a learning model with the intention of causing malicious behavior when an active trigger is present while maintaining regular functionality without it. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of any backdoor attack incorporating a constant trigger, by establishing tight lower and upper boundaries for the performance of the compromised model on both clean and backdoor test data. The developed theory answers a series of fundamental but previously underexplored problems, including (1) what are the determining factors for a backdoor attack's success, (2) what is the direction of the most effective backdoor attack, and (3) when will a human-imperceptible trigger succeed. Our derived understanding applies to both discriminative and generative models. We also demonstrate the theory by conducting experiments using benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art backdoor attack scenarios. ",

Building upon this concept, we investigate NTKs and alignment in the context of graph neural networks (GNNs), where our analysis reveals that optimizing alignment translates to optimizing the graph representation or the graph shift operator in a GNN. Our results further establish the theoretical guarantees on the optimality of the alignment for a two-layer GNN and these guarantees are characterized by the graph shift operator being a function of the cross-covariance between the input and the output data. The theoretical insights drawn from the analysis of NTKs are validated by our experiments focused on a multi-variate time series prediction task for a publicly available dataset. Specifically, they demonstrate that GNNs with cross-covariance as the graph shift operator indeed outperform those that operate on the covariance matrix from only the input data. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promising results across several domains. Despite this promise, MARL policies often lack robustness and are therefore sensitive to small changes in their environment. This presents a serious concern for the real world deployment of MARL algorithms, where the testing environment may slightly differ from the training environment. In this work we show that we can gain robustness by controlling a policy's Lipschitz constant, and under mild conditions, establish the existence of a Lipschitz and close-to-optimal policy. Based on these insights, we propose a new robust MARL framework, ERNIE, that promotes the Lipschitz continuity of the policies with respect to the state observations and actions by adversarial regularization. The ERNIE framework provides robustness against noisy observations, changing transition dynamics, and malicious actions of agents. However, ERNIE's adversarial regularization may introduce some training instability. To reduce this instability, we reformulate adversarial regularization as a Stackelberg game. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with extensive experiments in traffic light control and particle environments. In addition, we extend ERNIE to mean-field MARL with a formulation based on distributionally robust optimization that outperforms its non-robust counterpart and is of independent interest.

The update time of our algorithm significantly improves the previous upper bound of $O(\\log k)$, which was derived only for $k$-matching on unweighted graphs. For the dynamic streaming model, we present a one-pass algorithm that with high probability computes a maximum weighted $k$-matching in $O(Wk^2 \\cdot \\mbox{polylog}(n)$ space and with $O(\\mbox{polylog}(n))$ update time, where $W$ is the number of distinct edge weights. Again the update time of our algorithm improves the previous upper bound of $O(k^2 \\cdot \\mbox{polylog}(n))$. This algorithm, when applied to unweighted graphs, gives a streaming algorithm on the dynamic model whose space and update time complexities are both near-optimal.

However, we emphasize that style-related features can also be exploited for style-based attacks. Notably, the rise of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled malicious users to mimic the style of trustworthy news outlets at minimal cost. Our analysis reveals that LLM-camouflaged fake news content leads to substantial performance degradation of state-of-the-art text-based detectors (up to 38% decrease in F1 Score), posing a significant challenge for automated detection in online ecosystems. To address this, we introduce SheepDog, a style-agnostic fake news detector robust to news writing styles. SheepDog achieves this adaptability through LLM-empowered news reframing, which customizes each article to match different writing styles using style-oriented reframing prompts. By employing style-agnostic training, SheepDog enhances its resilience to stylistic variations by maximizing prediction consistency across these diverse reframings. Furthermore, SheepDog extracts content-focused veracity attributions from LLMs, where the news content is evaluated against a set of fact-checking rationales. These attributions provide supplementary information and potential interpretability that assist veracity prediction. On three benchmark datasets, empirical results show that SheepDog consistently yields significant improvements over competitive baselines and enhances robustness against LLM-empowered style attacks.

The Laplacian representation is a promising approach to address these problems by inducing intrinsic rewards for temporally-extended action discovery and reward shaping, and informative state encoding. To obtain the Laplacian representation one needs to compute the eigensystem of the graph Laplacian, which is often approximated through optimization objectives compatible with deep learning approaches. These approximations, however, depend on hyperparameters that are impossible to tune efficiently, converge to arbitrary rotations of the desired eigenvectors, and are unable to accurately recover the corresponding eigenvalues. In this paper we introduce a theoretically sound objective and corresponding optimization algorithm for approximating the Laplacian representation. Our approach naturally recovers both the true eigenvectors and eigenvalues while eliminating the hyperparameter dependence of previous approximations. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method and we show that those results translate empirically into robust learning across multiple environments. ",

In the automotive industry, these methods are in high demand for tracing events in time series data. For assessing the active vehicle safety systems, a diverse range of driving scenarios is conducted. These scenarios involve the recording of the vehicle's behavior using external sensors, enabling the evaluation of operational performance. In such setting, automated detection methods not only accelerate but also standardize and objectify the evaluation by avoiding subjective, human-based appraisals in the data inspection. This work proposes a novel event detection method that allows to identify frequency-based events in time series data. To this aim, the time series data is mapped to representations in the time-frequency domain, known as scalograms. After filtering scalograms to enhance relevant parts of the signal, an object detection model is trained to detect the desired event objects in the scalograms. For the analysis of unseen time series data, events can be detected in their scalograms with the trained object detection model and are thereafter mapped back to the time series data to mark the corresponding time interval. The algorithm, evaluated on unseen datasets, achieves a precision rate of 0.97 in event detection, providing sharp time interval boundaries whose accurate indication by human visual inspection is challenging. Incorporating this method into the vehicle development process enhances the accuracy and reliability of event detection, which holds major importance for rapid testing analysis. ",

To alleviate this issue and enhance traffic efficiency, traffic signal control and vehicle routing have proven to be effective measures. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization approach for traffic signal control and vehicle routing in signalized road networks. The objective is to enhance network performance by simultaneously controlling signal timings and route choices using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Signal control agents (SAs) are employed to establish signal timings at intersections, whereas vehicle routing agents (RAs) are responsible for selecting vehicle routes. By establishing relevance between agents and enabling them to share observations and rewards, interaction and cooperation among agents are fostered, which enhances individual training. The Multi-Agent Advantage Actor-Critic algorithm is used to handle multi-agent environments, and Deep Neural Network (DNN) structures are designed to facilitate the algorithm's convergence. Notably, our work is the first to utilize MADRL in determining the optimal joint policy for signal control and vehicle routing. Numerical experiments conducted on the modified Sioux network demonstrate that our integration of signal control and vehicle routing outperforms controlling signal timings or vehicles' routes alone in enhancing traffic efficiency.

    "abstract": "Soybeans are a critical source of food, protein and oil, and thus have received extensive research aimed at enhancing their yield, refining cultivation practices, and advancing soybean breeding techniques. Within this context, soybean pod counting plays an essential role in understanding and optimizing production. Despite recent advancements, the development of a robust pod-counting algorithm capable of performing effectively in real-field conditions remains a significant challenge This paper presents a pioneering work of accurate soybean pod counting utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images captured from actual soybean fields in Michigan, USA. Specifically, this paper presents SoybeanNet, a novel point-based counting network that harnesses powerful transformer backbones for simultaneous soybean pod counting and localization with high accuracy. In addition, a new dataset of UAV-acquired images for soybean pod counting was created and open-sourced, consisting of 113 drone images with more than 260k manually annotated soybean pods captured under natural lighting conditions. Through comprehensive evaluations, SoybeanNet demonstrated superior performance over five state-of-the-art approaches when tested on the collected images. Remarkably, SoybeanNet achieved a counting accuracy of $84.51\\%$ when tested on the testing dataset, attesting to its efficacy in real-world scenarios. The publication also provides both the source code (\\url{https://github.com/JiajiaLi04/Soybean-Pod-Counting-from-UAV-Images}) and the labeled soybean dataset (\\url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiajiali/uav-based-soybean-pod-images}), offering a valuable resource for future research endeavors in soybean pod counting and related fields.

    "abstract": "Community detection, a fundamental problem in computational sciences, finds applications in various domains. Heuristics are often employed to detect communities through maximizing an objective function, modularity, over partitions of network nodes. Our research delves into the performance of different modularity maximization algorithms in achieving optimal partitions. We use 104 networks, comprising real-world instances from diverse contexts and synthetic graphs with modular structures. We analyze ten inexact modularity-based algorithms against an exact baseline which is an exact integer programming method that globally optimizes modularity. The ten algorithms analyzed include eight heuristics, two variations of a graph neural network algorithm, and several variations of the Bayan approximation algorithm. Our analysis uncovers substantial dissimilarities between the partitions obtained by most commonly used modularity-based methods and any optimal partition of the networks, as indicated by both adjusted and reduced mutual information metrics. Importantly, our results show that near-optimal partitions are often disproportionately dissimilar to any optimal partition. Taken together, our analysis points to a crucial limitation of the commonly used unguaranteed modularity-based methods for discovering communities: they rarely produce an optimal partition or a partition resembling an optimal partition even on networks with modular structures. If modularity is to be used for detecting communities, approximate optimization algorithms are recommendable for a more methodologically sound usage of modularity within its applicability limits. ",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that semi-parametric methods, which combine standard neural networks with non-parametric components such as external memory modules and data retrieval, are particularly helpful in data scarcity and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. However, existing semi-parametric methods mostly depend on independent raw data points - this strategy is difficult to scale up due to both high computational costs and the incapacity of current attention mechanisms with a large number of tokens. In this paper, we introduce a novel heterogeneous memory augmentation approach for neural networks which, by introducing learnable memory tokens with attention mechanism, can effectively boost performance without huge computational overhead. Our general-purpose method can be seamlessly combined with various backbones (MLP, CNN, GNN, and Transformer) in a plug-and-play manner. We extensively evaluate our approach on various image and graph-based tasks under both in-distribution (ID) and OOD conditions and show its competitive performance against task-specific state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Depression is a mental health disorder that has a profound impact on people's lives. Recent research suggests that signs of depression can be detected in the way individuals communicate, both through spoken words and written texts. In particular, social media posts are a rich and convenient text source that we may examine for depressive symptoms. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) Questionnaire, which is frequently used to gauge the severity of depression, is one instrument that can aid in this study. We can narrow our study to only those symptoms since each BDI question is linked to a particular depressive symptom. It's important to remember that not everyone with depression exhibits all symptoms at once, but rather a combination of them. Therefore, it is extremely useful to be able to determine if a sentence or a piece of user-generated content is pertinent to a certain condition. With this in mind, the eRisk 2023 Task 1 was designed to do exactly that: assess the relevance of different sentences to the symptoms of depression as outlined in the BDI questionnaire. This report is all about how our team, Mason-NLP, participated in this subtask, which involved identifying sentences related to different depression symptoms. We used a deep learning approach that incorporated MentalBERT, RoBERTa, and LSTM. Despite our efforts, the evaluation results were lower than expected, underscoring the challenges inherent in ranking sentences from an extensive dataset about depression, which necessitates both appropriate methodological choices and significant computational resources. We anticipate that future iterations of this shared task will yield improved results as our understanding and techniques evolve. ",

However, jointly controlling both in real-time to alleviate traffic congestion presents new challenges, such as the inherent physical and behavioral heterogeneity between signal control and platooning, as well as coordination between them. This paper proposes an innovative solution to tackle these challenges based on heterogeneous graph multi-agent reinforcement learning and traffic theories. Our approach involves: 1) designing platoon and signal control as distinct reinforcement learning agents with their own set of observations, actions, and reward functions to optimize traffic flow; 2) designing coordination by incorporating graph neural networks within multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate seamless information exchange among agents on a regional scale. We evaluate our approach through SUMO simulation, which shows a convergent result in terms of various transportation metrics and better performance over sole signal or platooning control. ",

Specifically, an iterative routine is executed, whereby EVs cooperatively determine their charge-discharge profiles that maintain the distribution grid voltages and transformer core temperatures within safe operating limits. Importantly, the algorithm is robust against communication failures potentially arising in real-world implementations. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed EV charging algorithm in terms of network-aware operation and communication-failure tolerant operation. ",

Leveraging the theory of graph local limits, we prove that, under mild assumptions, parameters learned from training sampling-based GNNs on small samples of a large input graph are within an $\\epsilon$-neighborhood of the outcome of training the same architecture on the whole graph. We derive bounds on the number of samples, the size of the graph, and the training steps required as a function of $\\epsilon$. Our results give a novel theoretical understanding for using sampling in training GNNs. They also suggest that by training GNNs on small samples of the input graph, practitioners can identify and select the best models, hyperparameters, and sampling algorithms more efficiently. We empirically illustrate our results on a node classification task on large citation graphs, observing that sampling-based GNNs trained on local subgraphs 12$\\times$ smaller than the original graph achieve comparable performance to those trained on the input graph.

Secondly, considering the magnitude of DNN model parameters, hardware limitations and characteristics of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for noise tolerance, a Parameter Linear Prediction (PLP) method is exploit to perform DNN parameter prediction. Finally, validations are carried out on some representative backbones. Experiment results show that compare to the normal training ways, under the same training conditions and epochs, by employing proposed PLP method, the optimal model is able to obtain average about 1% accuracy improvement and 0.01 top-1/top-5 error reduction for Vgg16, Resnet18 and GoogLeNet based on CIFAR-100 dataset, which shown the effectiveness of the proposed method on different DNN structures, and validated its capacity in enhancing DNN training efficiency and performance.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has been proven to be effective in learning better sentence representations. However, to train a contrastive learning model, large numbers of labeled sentences are required to construct positive and negative pairs explicitly, such as those in natural language inference (NLI) datasets. Unfortunately, acquiring sufficient high-quality labeled data can be both time-consuming and resource-intensive, leading researchers to focus on developing methods for learning unsupervised sentence representations. As there is no clear relationship between these unstructured randomly-sampled sentences, building positive and negative pairs over them is tricky and problematic. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose SemCSR, a semantic-aware contrastive sentence representation framework. By leveraging the generation and evaluation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we can automatically construct a high-quality NLI-style corpus without any human annotation, and further incorporate the generated sentence pairs into learning a contrastive sentence representation model. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework for learning a better sentence representation with LLMs. ",

    "abstract": "Panoptic Narrative Detection (PND) and Segmentation (PNS) are two challenging tasks that involve identifying and locating multiple targets in an image according to a long narrative description. In this paper, we propose a unified and effective framework called NICE that can jointly learn these two panoptic narrative recognition tasks. Existing visual grounding tasks use a two-branch paradigm, but applying this directly to PND and PNS can result in prediction conflict due to their intrinsic many-to-many alignment property. To address this, we introduce two cascading modules based on the barycenter of the mask, which are Coordinate Guided Aggregation (CGA) and Barycenter Driven Localization (BDL), responsible for segmentation and detection, respectively. By linking PNS and PND in series with the barycenter of segmentation as the anchor, our approach naturally aligns the two tasks and allows them to complement each other for improved performance. Specifically, CGA provides the barycenter as a reference for detection, reducing BDL's reliance on a large number of candidate boxes. BDL leverages its excellent properties to distinguish different instances, which improves the performance of CGA for segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NICE surpasses all existing methods by a large margin, achieving 4.1% for PND and 2.9% for PNS over the state-of-the-art. These results validate the effectiveness of our proposed collaborative learning strategy. The project of this work is made publicly available at https://github.com/Mr-Neko/NICE. ",

In particular, ClarifyGPT first detects whether a given requirement is ambiguous by performing a code consistency check. If it is ambiguous, ClarifyGPT prompts an LLM to generate targeted clarifying questions. After receiving question responses, ClarifyGPT refines the ambiguous requirement and inputs it into the same LLM to generate a final code solution. To evaluate our ClarifyGPT, we first conduct a human evaluation involving ten participants who use ClarifyGPT for code generation on two publicly available benchmarks: MBPP-sanitized and MBPP-ET. The results show that ClarifyGPT elevates the performance (Pass@1) of GPT-4 from 70.96% to 80.80% on MBPP-sanitized. Furthermore, to perform large-scale automated evaluations of ClarifyGPT across different LLMs and benchmarks without requiring user participation, we introduce a high-fidelity simulation method to simulate user responses. The automated evaluation results also demonstrate that ClarifyGPT can significantly enhance code generation performance compared to the baselines. In particular, ClarifyGPT improves the average performance of GPT-4 and ChatGPT across four benchmarks from 68.02% to 75.75% and from 58.55% to 67.22%, respectively.

In this paper, a novel Multi-Objective, Risk-Sensitive, and Online Trust Region Policy Optimization (RS-TRPO) Algorithm is proposed to tackle this problem. First, a dispatch paradigm for autonomous MGs in the MGC is proposed, enabling them sequentially implement their self-dispatch to mitigate potential conflicts. This dispatch paradigm is then formulated as a Markov Game model, which is finally solved by the RS-TRPO algorithm. This online algorithm enables MGs to spontaneously search for the Pareto Frontier considering multiple objectives and risk mitigation. The outstanding computational performance of this algorithm is demonstrated in comparison with mathematical programming methods and heuristic algorithms in a modified IEEE 30-Bus Test System integrated with four autonomous MGs.

Although existing Scalable GNNs leverage linear propagation to preprocess the features and accelerate the training and inference procedure, these methods still suffer from scalability issues when making inferences on unseen nodes, as the feature preprocessing requires the graph to be known and fixed. To further accelerate Scalable GNNs inference in this inductive setting, we propose an online propagation framework and two novel node-adaptive propagation methods that can customize the optimal propagation depth for each node based on its topological information and thereby avoid redundant feature propagation. The trade-off between accuracy and latency can be flexibly managed through simple hyper-parameters to accommodate various latency constraints. Moreover, to compensate for the inference accuracy loss caused by the potential early termination of propagation, we further propose Inception Distillation to exploit the multi-scale receptive field information within graphs. The rigorous and comprehensive experimental study on public datasets with varying scales and characteristics demonstrates that the proposed inference acceleration framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art graph inference acceleration methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Particularly, the superiority of our approach is notable on datasets with larger scales, yielding a 75x inference speedup on the largest Ogbn-products dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Link prediction is a common task on graph-structured data that has seen applications in a variety of domains. Classically, hand-crafted heuristics were used for this task. Heuristic measures are chosen such that they correlate well with the underlying factors related to link formation. In recent years, a new class of methods has emerged that combines the advantages of message-passing neural networks (MPNN) and heuristics methods. These methods perform predictions by using the output of an MPNN in conjunction with a \"pairwise encoding\" that captures the relationship between nodes in the candidate link. They have been shown to achieve strong performance on numerous datasets. However, current pairwise encodings often contain a strong inductive bias, using the same underlying factors to classify all links. This limits the ability of existing methods to learn how to properly classify a variety of different links that may form from different factors. To address this limitation, we propose a new method, LPFormer, which attempts to adaptively learn the pairwise encodings for each link. LPFormer models the link factors via an attention module that learns the pairwise encoding that exists between nodes by modeling multiple factors integral to link prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LPFormer can achieve SOTA performance on numerous datasets while maintaining efficiency. ",

While these models have shown impressive performance by learning correlations among features in the data, some fundamental shortcomings are their lack of explainability, the tendency to induce spurious correlations, and poor out-of-distribution extrapolation. In an effort to remedy such challenges, one can incorporate the theory of causality in deep generative modeling. Structural causal models (SCMs) describe data-generating processes and model complex causal relationships and mechanisms among variables in a system. Thus, SCMs can naturally be combined with deep generative models. Causal models offer several beneficial properties to deep generative models, such as distribution shift robustness, fairness, and interoperability. We provide a technical survey on causal generative modeling categorized into causal representation learning and controllable counterfactual generation methods. We focus on fundamental theory, formulations, drawbacks, datasets, metrics, and applications of causal generative models in fairness, privacy, out-of-distribution generalization, and precision medicine.

However, BIO-tagging scheme relies on the correct order of model inputs, which is not guaranteed in real-world NER on scanned VrDs where text are recognized and arranged by OCR systems. Such reading order issue hinders the accurate marking of entities by BIO-tagging scheme, making it impossible for sequence-labeling methods to predict correct named entities. To address the reading order issue, we introduce Token Path Prediction (TPP), a simple prediction head to predict entity mentions as token sequences within documents. Alternative to token classification, TPP models the document layout as a complete directed graph of tokens, and predicts token paths within the graph as entities. For better evaluation of VrD-NER systems, we also propose two revised benchmark datasets of NER on scanned documents which can reflect real-world scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and suggest its potential to be a universal solution to various information extraction tasks on documents. ",

In this work, we regard the self-attention mechanism, the core module of graph Transformers, as a two-step aggregation operation on a fully connected graph. Due to the property of generating positive attention values, the self-attention mechanism is equal to conducting a smooth operation on all nodes, preserving the low-frequency information. However, only capturing the low-frequency information is inefficient in learning complex relations of nodes on diverse graphs, such as heterophily graphs where the high-frequency information is crucial. To this end, we propose a Signed Attention-based Graph Transformer (SignGT) to adaptively capture various frequency information from the graphs. Specifically, SignGT develops a new signed self-attention mechanism (SignSA) that produces signed attention values according to the semantic relevance of node pairs. Hence, the diverse frequency information between different node pairs could be carefully preserved. Besides, SignGT proposes a structure-aware feed-forward network (SFFN) that introduces the neighborhood bias to preserve the local topology information. In this way, SignGT could learn informative node representations from both long-range dependencies and local topology information. Extensive empirical results on both node-level and graph-level tasks indicate the superiority of SignGT against state-of-the-art graph Transformers as well as advanced GNNs. ",

Lately, in software engineering, diagrammatic causal inference methods (e.g., Pearl s model) have gained popularity (e.g., analyzing causes and effects of change in software requirement development). This paper concerns diagrammatical (graphic) models of causal relationships. Specifically, we experiment with using the conceptual language of thinging machines (TMs) as a tool in this context. This would benefit works on causal relationships in requirements engineering, enhance our understanding of the TM modeling, and contribute to the study of the philosophical notion of causality. To specify the causality in a system s description is to constrain the system s behavior and thus exclude some possible chronologies of events. The notion of causality has been studied based on tools to express causal questions in diagrammatic and algebraic forms. Causal models deploy diagrammatic models, structural equations, and counterfactual and interventional logic. Diagrammatic models serve as a language for representing what we know about the world. The research methodology in the paper focuses on converting causal graphs into TM models and contrasts the two types of representation. The results show that the TM depiction of causality is more complete and therefore can provide a foundation for causal graphs. ",

In this context, the high dimensionality of data often results in poor model performance, with the risk of overfitting. Feature selection, the process of selecting a subset of relevant and non-redundant features, is, therefore, an essential step to mitigate these issues. However, classical feature selection approaches do not inspect the causal relationship between selected features and target, which can lead to misleading results in real-world applications. Causal discovery, instead, aims to identify causal relationships between features with observational data. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology at the intersection between feature selection and causal discovery, focusing on time series. We introduce a new causal feature selection approach that relies on the forward and backward feature selection procedures and leverages transfer entropy to estimate the causal flow of information from the features to the target in time series. Our approach enables the selection of features not only in terms of mere model performance but also captures the causal information flow. In this context, we provide theoretical guarantees on the regression and classification errors for both the exact and the finite-sample cases.

Moreover, harnessing the information of non-SL gene relationships within large-scale multi-omics data to facilitate SL prediction poses a non-trivial challenge.

Concretely, we introduce a shallow multi-view GNN to acquire local structural patterns from both SL and multi-omics data. Further, we input gene features that encode multi-view information into the standard self-attention to capture long-range dependencies. Notably, starting with batch genes from SL data, we adopt parallel random walk sampling across multiple omics gene graphs encompassing them. Such sampling effectively and modestly incorporates genes from omics in a structure-aware manner before using self-attention.

Beyond most existing systems, our approach builds a semantic mapping across domains which breaks the requirement for in-domain user behaviors, enabling zero-shot recommendations for new users in a low-resource domain. We experiment MeKB-Rec on well-established public CDR datasets, and demonstrate that the new formulation % is more powerful than previous approaches, achieves a new state-of-the-art that significantly improves HR@10 and NDCG@10 metrics over best previous approaches by 24\\%--91\\%, with a 105\\% improvement for HR@10 of zero-shot users with no behavior in the target domain. We deploy MeKB-Rec in WeiXin recommendation scenarios and achieve significant gains in core online metrics. MeKB-Rec is now serving hundreds of millions of users in real-world products. ",

    "abstract": "Decomposing a target object from a complex background while reconstructing is challenging. Most approaches acquire the perception for object instances through the use of manual labels, but the annotation procedure is costly. The recent advancements in 2D self-supervised learning have brought new prospects to object-aware representation, yet it remains unclear how to leverage such noisy 2D features for clean decomposition. In this paper, we propose a Decomposed Object Reconstruction (DORec) network based on neural implicit representations. Our key idea is to transfer 2D self-supervised features into masks of two levels of granularity to supervise the decomposition, including a binary mask to indicate the foreground regions and a K-cluster mask to indicate the semantically similar regions. These two masks are complementary to each other and lead to robust decomposition. Experimental results show the superiority of DORec in segmenting and reconstructing the foreground object on various datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Adapting models deployed to test distributions can mitigate the performance degradation caused by distribution shifts. However, privacy concerns may render model parameters inaccessible. One promising approach involves utilizing zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) to train a data adaptor to adapt the test data to fit the deployed models. Nevertheless, the data adaptor trained with ZOO typically brings restricted improvements due to the potential corruption of data features caused by the data adaptor. To address this issue, we revisit ZOO in the context of test-time data adaptation. We find that the issue directly stems from the unreliable estimation of the gradients used to optimize the data adaptor, which is inherently due to the unreliable nature of the pseudo-labels assigned to the test data. Based on this observation, we propose pseudo-label-robust data adaptation (SODA) to improve the performance of data adaptation. Specifically, SODA leverages high-confidence predicted labels as reliable labels to optimize the data adaptor with ZOO for label prediction. For data with low-confidence predictions, SODA encourages the adaptor to preserve data information to mitigate data corruption. Empirical results indicate that SODA can significantly enhance the performance of deployed models in the presence of distribution shifts without requiring access to model parameters. ",

    "abstract": "Generative self-supervised learning (SSL) has exhibited significant potential and garnered increasing interest in graph learning. In this study, we aim to explore the problem of generative SSL in the context of heterogeneous graph learning (HGL). The previous SSL approaches for heterogeneous graphs have primarily relied on contrastive learning, necessitating the design of complex views to capture heterogeneity. However, existing generative SSL methods have not fully leveraged the capabilities of generative models to address the challenges of HGL. In this paper, we present HGCVAE, a novel contrastive variational graph auto-encoder that liberates HGL from the burden of intricate heterogeneity capturing. Instead of focusing on complicated heterogeneity, HGCVAE harnesses the full potential of generative SSL. HGCVAE innovatively consolidates contrastive learning with generative SSL, introducing several key innovations. Firstly, we employ a progressive mechanism to generate high-quality hard negative samples for contrastive learning, utilizing the power of variational inference. Additionally, we present a dynamic mask strategy to ensure effective and stable learning. Moreover, we propose an enhanced scaled cosine error as the criterion for better attribute reconstruction. As an initial step in combining generative and contrastive SSL, HGCVAE achieves remarkable results compared to various state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its superiority. ",

Morphing attacks on face biometrics is a serious threat that undermines the security and reliability of face recognition systems deployed in airports and border controls. Therefore, developing a robust Machine Learning (ML) system is necessary to prevent criminals crossing borders with fake identifications especially since it has been shown that security officers cannot detect morphs better than machines. In this study, we investigate the generalization power of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures against morphing attacks. The investigation utilizes 5 distinct CNNs namely ShuffleNet, DenseNet201, VGG16, EffecientNet-B0 and InceptionResNet-v2. Each CNN architecture represents a well-known family of CNN models in terms of number of parameters, architectural design and performance across various computer vision applications. To ensure robust evaluation, we employ 4 different datasets (Utrecht, London, Defacto and KurdFace) that contain a diverse range of digital face images which cover variations in ethnicity, gender, age, lighting condition and camera setting. One of the fundamental concepts of ML system design is the ability to generalize effectively to previously unseen data, hence not only we evaluate the performance of CNN models within individual datasets but also explore their performance across combined datasets and investigating each dataset in testing phase only. Experimental results on more than 8 thousand images (genuine and morph) from the 4 datasets show that InceptionResNet-v2 generalizes better to unseen data and outperforms the other 4 CNN models. ",

However, orthodontic treatment often involves complex, lengthy procedures. As such, generating a 2D photograph depicting aligned teeth prior to orthodontic treatment is crucial for effective dentist-patient communication and, more importantly, for encouraging patients to accept orthodontic intervention. In this paper, we propose a 3D structure-guided tooth alignment network that takes 2D photographs as input (e.g., photos captured by smartphones) and aligns the teeth within the 2D image space to generate an orthodontic comparison photograph featuring aesthetically pleasing, aligned teeth. Notably, while the process operates within a 2D image space, our method employs 3D intra-oral scanning models collected in clinics to learn about orthodontic treatment, i.e., projecting the pre- and post-orthodontic 3D tooth structures onto 2D tooth contours, followed by a diffusion model to learn the mapping relationship. Ultimately, the aligned tooth contours are leveraged to guide the generation of a 2D photograph with aesthetically pleasing, aligned teeth and realistic textures. We evaluate our network on various facial photographs, demonstrating its exceptional performance and strong applicability within the orthodontic industry. ",

We employed topic modeling techniques to uncover the distinct thematic emphases on each platform, which reflect their specific features and target audiences. Additionally, sentiment analysis revealed various public perceptions regarding the topics studied. Lastly, we compared the evolution of engagement across platforms, unveiling unique patterns for the same topic.

Recently, empirical studies showed that neural networks operate by changing topology, transforming a topologically complicated data set into a topologically simpler one as it passes through the layers. This topological simplification has been measured by Betti numbers, which are algebraic invariants of a topological space. We use the same measure to establish lower and upper bounds on the topological simplification a ReLU neural network can achieve with a given architecture. We therefore contribute to a better understanding of the expressivity of ReLU neural networks in the context of binary classification problems by shedding light on their ability to capture the underlying topological structure of the data. In particular the results show that deep ReLU neural networks are exponentially more powerful than shallow ones in terms of topological simplification. This provides a mathematically rigorous explanation why deeper networks are better equipped to handle complex and topologically rich datasets. ",

Determining the graphical structure of a CBN remains a key challenge and is undertaken either by eliciting it from humans, using machine learning to learn it from data, or using a combination of these two approaches. In the latter case, human knowledge is generally provided to the algorithm before it starts, but here we investigate a novel approach where the structure learning algorithm itself dynamically identifies and requests knowledge for relationships that the algorithm identifies as uncertain during structure learning. We integrate this approach into the Tabu structure learning algorithm and show that it offers considerable gains in structural accuracy, which are generally larger than those offered by existing approaches for integrating knowledge. We suggest that a variant which requests only arc orientation information may be particularly useful where the practitioner has little preexisting knowledge of the causal relationships. As well as offering improved accuracy, the approach can use human expertise more effectively and contributes to making the structure learning process more transparent. ",

Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged so far as a popular form of KR, offering a contextual and human-like representation of knowledge. In international economics, KGs have proven valuable in capturing complex interactions between commodities, companies, and countries. By putting the gravity model, which is a common economic framework, into the process of building KGs, important factors that affect trade relationships can be taken into account, making it possible to predict international trade patterns. This paper proposes an approach that leverages Knowledge Graph embeddings for modeling international trade, focusing on link prediction using embeddings. Thus, valuable insights are offered to policymakers, businesses, and economists, enabling them to anticipate the effects of changes in the international trade system. Moreover, the integration of traditional machine learning methods with KG embeddings, such as decision trees and graph neural networks are also explored. The research findings demonstrate the potential for improving prediction accuracy and provide insights into embedding explainability in knowledge representation.

    "abstract": "Multimodal time series (MTS) anomaly detection is crucial for maintaining the safety and stability of working devices (e.g., water treatment system and spacecraft), whose data are characterized by multivariate time series with diverse modalities. Although recent deep learning methods show great potential in anomaly detection, they do not explicitly capture spatial-temporal relationships between univariate time series of different modalities, resulting in more false negatives and false positives. In this paper, we propose a multimodal spatial-temporal graph attention network (MST-GAT) to tackle this problem. MST-GAT first employs a multimodal graph attention network (M-GAT) and a temporal convolution network to capture the spatial-temporal correlation in multimodal time series. Specifically, M-GAT uses a multi-head attention module and two relational attention modules (i.e., intra- and inter-modal attention) to model modal correlations explicitly. Furthermore, MST-GAT optimizes the reconstruction and prediction modules simultaneously. Experimental results on four multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that MST-GAT outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis indicates that MST-GAT strengthens the interpretability of detected anomalies by locating the most anomalous univariate time series. ",

As a variant of the standard t-SNE method, t-SGNE avoids the time-consuming computations of pairwise similarity. Instead, it uses the neighbor structures of the graph to reduce the time complexity from quadratic to linear, thus supporting larger graphs. In addition, to suit t-SGNE, we combined Laplacian Eigenmaps with the shortest path algorithm in graphs to form the graph embedding algorithm ShortestPath Laplacian Eigenmaps Embedding (SPLEE). Performing SPLEE to obtain a high-dimensional embedding of the large-scale graph and then using t-SGNE to reduce its dimension for visualization, we are able to visualize graphs with up to 300K nodes and 1M edges within 5 minutes and achieve approximately 10% improvement in visualization quality.

As the player picks an arm, feedback from multiple users may not be received instantly yet after an arbitrary delay of time which is unknown to the player in advance. For different users in a round, the delays in feedback have no latent correlation. Thus, we formulate an adversarial multi-armed bandit problem with multi-user delayed feedback and design a modified EXP3 algorithm named MUD-EXP3, which makes a decision at each round by considering the importance-weighted estimator of the received feedback from different users. On the premise of known terminal round index $T$, the number of users $M$, the number of arms $N$, and upper bound of delay $d_{max}$, we prove a regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{TM^2\\ln{N}(N\\mathrm{e}+4d_{max})})$. Furthermore, for the more common case of unknown $T$, an adaptive algorithm named AMUD-EXP3 is proposed with a sublinear regret with respect to $T$.

Due to the incompleteness of KGs, query embedding (QE) methods have been proposed to encode queries and entities into the same embedding space, and treat logical operators as neural set operators to obtain answers. However, these methods train KG embeddings and neural set operators concurrently on both simple (one-hop) and complex (multi-hop and logical) queries, which causes performance degradation on simple queries and low training efficiency. In this paper, we propose Query to Triple (Q2T), a novel approach that decouples the training for simple and complex queries. Q2T divides the training into two stages: (1) Pre-training a neural link predictor on simple queries to predict tail entities based on the head entity and relation. (2) Training a query encoder on complex queries to encode diverse complex queries into a unified triple form that can be efficiently solved by the pretrained neural link predictor. Our proposed Q2T is not only efficient to train, but also modular, thus easily adaptable to various neural link predictors that have been studied well. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, even without explicit modeling for neural set operators, Q2T still achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse complex queries over three public benchmarks.

This over-simplified setting falls short of representing the real-world software development scenario where repositories span multiple files with numerous cross-file dependencies, and accessing and understanding cross-file context is often required to complete the code correctly. To fill in this gap, we propose CrossCodeEval, a diverse and multilingual code completion benchmark that necessitates an in-depth cross-file contextual understanding to complete the code accurately. CrossCodeEval is built on a diverse set of real-world, open-sourced, permissively-licensed repositories in four popular programming languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, and C#. To create examples that strictly require cross-file context for accurate completion, we propose a straightforward yet efficient static-analysis-based approach to pinpoint the use of cross-file context within the current file. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art code language models like CodeGen and StarCoder demonstrate that CrossCodeEval is extremely challenging when the relevant cross-file context is absent, and we see clear improvements when adding these context into the prompt. However, despite such improvements, the pinnacle of performance remains notably unattained even with the highest-performing model, indicating that CrossCodeEval is also capable of assessing model's capability in leveraging extensive context to make better code completion. Finally, we benchmarked various methods in retrieving cross-file context, and show that CrossCodeEval can also be used to measure the capability of code retrievers. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained prominence in recommendation systems in recent years. By representing the user-item matrix as a bipartite and undirected graph, GNNs have demonstrated their potential to capture short- and long-distance user-item interactions, thereby learning more accurate preference patterns than traditional recommendation approaches. In contrast to previous tutorials on the same topic, this tutorial aims to present and examine three key aspects that characterize GNNs for recommendation: (i) the reproducibility of state-of-the-art approaches, (ii) the potential impact of graph topological characteristics on the performance of these models, and (iii) strategies for learning node representations when training features from scratch or utilizing pre-trained embeddings as additional item information (e.g., multimodal features). The goal is to provide three novel theoretical and practical perspectives on the field, currently subject to debate in graph learning but long been overlooked in the context of recommendation systems.

Key observation is the dependency between quality of predictions and the size of training set which consists of different source terms and corresponding fine & coarse solutions. We provide the a priori error analysis of the method together with the stability analysis of the neural network.

    "abstract": "Graph representation learning has now become the de facto standard when handling graph-structured data, with the framework of message-passing graph neural networks (MPNN) being the most prevailing algorithmic tool. Despite its popularity, the family of MPNNs suffers from several drawbacks such as transparency and expressivity. Recently, the idea of designing neural models on graphs using the theory of graph kernels has emerged as a more transparent as well as sometimes more expressive alternative to MPNNs known as kernel graph neural networks (KGNNs). Developments on KGNNs are currently a nascent field of research, leaving several challenges from algorithmic design and adaptation to other learning paradigms such as self-supervised learning. In this paper, we improve the design and learning of KGNNs. Firstly, we extend the algorithmic formulation of KGNNs by allowing a more flexible graph-level similarity definition that encompasses former proposals like random walk graph kernel, as well as providing a smoother optimization objective that alleviates the need of introducing combinatorial learning procedures. Secondly, we enhance KGNNs through the lens of self-supervision via developing a novel structure-preserving graph data augmentation method called latent graph augmentation (LGA). Finally, we perform extensive empirical evaluations to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed mechanisms. Experimental results over benchmark datasets suggest that our proposed model achieves competitive performance that is comparable to or sometimes outperforming state-of-the-art graph representation learning frameworks with or without self-supervision on graph classification tasks. Comparisons against other previously established graph data augmentation methods verify that the proposed LGA augmentation scheme captures better semantics of graph-level invariance. ",

    "abstract": "The hyperbolicity of a graph, informally, measures how close a graph is (metrically) to a tree. Hence, it is intuitively similar to treewidth, but the measures are formally incomparable. Motivated by the broad study of algorithms and separators on planar graphs and their relation to treewidth, we initiate the study of planar graphs of bounded hyperbolicity. Our main technical contribution is a novel balanced separator theorem for planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic graphs that is substantially stronger than the classic planar separator theorem. For any fixed $\\delta \\geq 0$, we can find balanced separator that induces either a single geodesic (shortest) path or a single geodesic cycle in the graph. An important advantage of our separator is that the union of our separator (vertex set $Z$) with any subset of the connected components of $G - Z$ induces again a planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic graph, which would not be guaranteed with an arbitrary separator. Our construction runs in near-linear time and guarantees that size of separator is $\\mathrm{poly}(\\delta) \\cdot \\log n$. As an application of our separator theorem and its strong properties, we obtain two novel approximation schemes on planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic graphs. We prove that Maximum Independent Set and the Traveling Salesperson problem have a near-linear time FPTAS for any constant $\\delta$, running in $n\\, \\mathrm{polylog}(n) \\cdot 2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\delta^2)} \\cdot \\varepsilon^{-\\mathcal{O}(\\delta)}$ time. We also show that our approximation scheme for Maximum Independent Set has essentially the best possible running time under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). This immediately follows from our third contribution: we prove that Maximum Independent Set has no $n^{o(\\delta)}$-time algorithm on planar $\\delta$-hyperbolic graphs, unless ETH fails. ",

    "abstract": "In this article, we investigate self-supervised 3D scene flow estimation and class-agnostic motion prediction on point clouds. A realistic scene can be well modeled as a collection of rigidly moving parts, therefore its scene flow can be represented as a combination of the rigid motion of these individual parts. Building upon this observation, we propose to generate pseudo scene flow labels for self-supervised learning through piecewise rigid motion estimation, in which the source point cloud is decomposed into local regions and each region is treated as rigid. By rigidly aligning each region with its potential counterpart in the target point cloud, we obtain a region-specific rigid transformation to generate its pseudo flow labels. To mitigate the impact of potential outliers on label generation, when solving the rigid registration for each region, we alternately perform three steps: establishing point correspondences, measuring the confidence for the correspondences, and updating the rigid transformation based on the correspondences and their confidence. As a result, confident correspondences will dominate label generation and a validity mask will be derived for the generated pseudo labels. By using the pseudo labels together with their validity mask for supervision, models can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments on FlyingThings3D and KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised scene flow learning, without any ground truth scene flow for supervision, even performing better than some supervised counterparts. Additionally, our method is further extended to class-agnostic motion prediction and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on nuScenes dataset. ",

Our contribution includes the design of an optimization-based task and motion planning framework that generates optimal control sequences with formal guarantees of external perturbation recovery. As a core component of the framework, a model predictive controller (MPC) encodes signal temporal logic (STL)-based task specifications as a cost function. In particular, we investigate challenging scenarios where the robot is subjected to lateral perturbations that increase the risk of failure due to leg self-collision. To address this, we synthesize agile and safe crossed-leg maneuvers to enhance locomotion stability.

Accordingly, plenty of research is taking place in the field to find out, for example, what makes code easy to understand and which tools can best support developers in their comprehension process. And while any code comprehension researcher certainly has a rough idea of what they mean when they mention a developer having a good understanding of a piece of code, to date, the research community has not managed to define source code comprehension as a concept. Instead, in primary research on code comprehension, an implicit definition by task prevails, i.e., code comprehension is what the experimental tasks measure. This approach has two negative consequences. First, it makes it difficult to conduct secondary research. Currently, each code comprehension primary study uses different comprehension tasks and measures, and thus it is not clear whether different studies intend to measure the same construct. Second, authors of a primary study run into the difficulty of justifying their design decisions without a definition of what they attempt to measure. An operationalization of an insufficiently described construct occurs, which poses a threat to construct validity. The task of defining code comprehension considering the theory of the past fifty years is not an easy one. Nor is it a task that every author of a primary study must accomplish on their own. Therefore, this paper constitutes a reference work that defines source code comprehension and presents a conceptual framework in which researchers can anchor their empirical code comprehension research.

Intelligent transportation detection is the cornerstone of many intelligent traffic services by identifying task targets through object detection methods. However existing detection methods in intelligent transportation are limited by two aspects. First, there is a difference between the model knowledge pre-trained on large-scale datasets and the knowledge required for target task. Second, most detection models follow the pattern of single-source learning, which limits the learning ability. To address these problems, we propose a Multi Self-supervised Pre-fine-tuned Transformer Fusion (MSPTF) network, consisting of two steps: unsupervised pre-fine-tune domain knowledge learning and multi-model fusion target task learning. In the first step, we introduced self-supervised learning methods into transformer model pre-fine-tune which could reduce data costs and alleviate the knowledge gap between pre-trained model and target task. In the second step, we take feature information differences between different model architectures and different pre-fine-tune tasks into account and propose Multi-model Semantic Consistency Cross-attention Fusion (MSCCF) network to combine different transformer model features by considering channel semantic consistency and feature vector semantic consistency, which obtain more complete and proper fusion features for detection task. We experimented the proposed method on vehicle recognition dataset and road disease detection dataset and achieved 1.1%, 5.5%, 4.2% improvement compared with baseline and 0.7%, 1.8%, 1.7% compared with sota, which proved the effectiveness of our method.

Existing monocular 3D detection knowledge distillation methods usually project the LiDAR onto the image plane and train the teacher network accordingly.

To alleviate cross-modal prob-lem, we propose MonoSKD, a novel Knowledge Distillation framework for Monocular 3D detection based on Spearman correlation coefficient, to learn the relative correlation between cross-modal features. Considering the large gap between these features, strict alignment of features may mislead the training, so we propose a looser Spearman loss. Furthermore, by selecting appropriate distillation locations and removing redundant modules, our scheme saves more GPU resources and trains faster than existing methods.

Compared to previous works, the proposed autoencoder looks for anomalies in DoH traffic, and thus can detect malicious traffic that has not been previously observed, i.e., zero-day attacks. We run extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed autoencoder and compare it to that of other anomaly detection algorithms, namely, local outlier factor, one-class support vector machine, isolation forest, and variational autoencoders.

    "abstract": "Envisioned application areas for reinforcement learning (RL) include autonomous driving, precision agriculture, and finance, which all require RL agents to make decisions in the real world. A significant challenge hindering the adoption of RL methods in these domains is the non-robustness of conventional algorithms. In this paper, we argue that a fundamental issue contributing to this lack of robustness lies in the focus on the expected value of the return as the sole \"correct\" optimization objective. The expected value is the average over the statistical ensemble of infinitely many trajectories. For non-ergodic returns, this average differs from the average over a single but infinitely long trajectory. Consequently, optimizing the expected value can lead to policies that yield exceptionally high returns with probability zero but almost surely result in catastrophic outcomes. This problem can be circumvented by transforming the time series of collected returns into one with ergodic increments. This transformation enables learning robust policies by optimizing the long-term return for individual agents rather than the average across infinitely many trajectories. We propose an algorithm for learning ergodicity transformations from data and demonstrate its effectiveness in an instructive, non-ergodic environment and on standard RL benchmarks. ",

However, these methods often struggle when faced with unfamiliar testing environments due to the lack of diverse training data encompassing various viewpoints and environments. To address this, we propose a novel method that aligns 3D detection with 2D camera plane results, ensuring consistent and accurate detections. Our framework, anchored in perspective debiasing, helps the learning of features resilient to domain shifts. In our approach, we render diverse view maps from BEV features and rectify the perspective bias of these maps, leveraging implicit foreground volumes to bridge the camera and BEV planes. This two-step process promotes the learning of perspective- and context-independent features, crucial for accurate object detection across varying viewpoints, camera parameters and environment conditions. Notably, our model-agnostic approach preserves the original network structure without incurring additional inference costs, facilitating seamless integration across various models and simplifying deployment. Furthermore, we also show our approach achieves satisfactory results in real data when trained only with virtual datasets, eliminating the need for real scene annotations. Experimental results on both Domain Generalization (DG) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) clearly demonstrate its effectiveness. Our code will be released. ",

Much work has focused on the case where the symmetry group employed is compact or abelian, or both. Recent work has explored enlarging the class of transformations used to the case of Lie groups, principally through the use of their Lie algebra, as well as the group exponential and logarithm maps. The applicability of such methods to larger transformation groups is limited by the fact that depending on the group of interest $G$, the exponential map may not be surjective. Further limitations are encountered when $G$ is neither compact nor abelian. Using the structure and geometry of Lie groups and their homogeneous spaces, we present a framework by which it is possible to work with such groups primarily focusing on the Lie groups $G = \\text{GL}^{+}(n, \\mathbb{R})$ and $G = \\text{SL}(n, \\mathbb{R})$, as well as their representation as affine transformations $\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rtimes G$. Invariant integration as well as a global parametrization is realized by decomposing the `larger` groups into subgroups and submanifolds which can be handled individually. Under this framework, we show how convolution kernels can be parametrized to build models equivariant with respect to affine transformations. We evaluate the robustness and out-of-distribution generalisation capability of our model on the standard affine-invariant benchmark classification task, where we outperform all previous equivariant models as well as all Capsule Network proposals.

    "title": "Towards Operationalizing Social Bonding in Human-Robot Dyads",
    "abstract": "With momentum increasing in the use of social robots as long-term assistive and collaborative partners, humans developing social bonds with these artificial agents appears to be inevitable. In human-human dyads, social bonding plays a powerful role in regulating behaviours, emotions, and even health. If this is to extend to human-robot dyads, the phenomenology of such relationships (including their emergence and stability) must be better understood. In this paper, we discuss potential approaches towards operationalizing the phenomenon of social bonding between human-robot dyads. We will discuss a number of biobehavioural proxies of social bonding, moving away from existing approaches that use subjective, psychological measures, and instead grounding our approach in some of the evolutionary, neurobiological and physiological correlates of social bond formation in natural systems: (a) reductions in physiological stress (the ''social buffering'' phenomenon), (b) narrowing of spatial proximity between dyads, and (c) inter-dyad behavioural synchrony. We provide relevant evolutionary support for each proposed component, with suggestions and considerations for how they can be recorded in (real-time) human-robot interaction scenarios. With this, we aim to inspire more robust operationalisation of ''social bonding'' between human and artificial (robotic) agents. ",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for natural language processing, enabling novel applications and user experiences. However, to achieve optimal performance, LLMs often require adaptation with private data, which poses privacy and security challenges. Several techniques have been proposed to adapt LLMs with private data, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), and In-Context Learning (ICL), but their comparative privacy and security properties have not been systematically investigated. In this work, we fill this gap by evaluating the robustness of LoRA, SPT, and ICL against three types of well-established attacks: membership inference, which exposes data leakage (privacy); backdoor, which injects malicious behavior (security); and model stealing, which can violate intellectual property (privacy and security). Our results show that there is no silver bullet for privacy and security in LLM adaptation and each technique has different strengths and weaknesses. ",

    "abstract": "In the realm of deep learning, the self-attention mechanism has substantiated its pivotal role across a myriad of tasks, encompassing natural language processing and computer vision. Despite achieving success across diverse applications, the traditional self-attention mechanism primarily leverages linear transformations for the computation of query, key, and value (QKV), which may not invariably be the optimal choice under specific circumstances. This paper probes into a novel methodology for QKV computation-implementing a specially-designed neural network structure for the calculation. Utilizing a modified Marian model, we conducted experiments on the IWSLT 2017 German-English translation task dataset and juxtaposed our method with the conventional approach. The experimental results unveil a significant enhancement in BLEU scores with our method. Furthermore, our approach also manifested superiority when training the Roberta model with the Wikitext-103 dataset, reflecting a notable reduction in model perplexity compared to its original counterpart. These experimental outcomes not only validate the efficacy of our method but also reveal the immense potential in optimizing the self-attention mechanism through neural network-based QKV computation, paving the way for future research and practical applications.

Traditionally, post-retrieval predictors have focused upon either the distribution of the retrieval scores, or the coherence of the top-ranked documents using traditional bag-of-words index representations. More recently, BERT-based models using dense embedded document representations have been used to create new predictors, but mostly applied to predict the performance of rankings created by BM25. Instead, we aim to predict the effectiveness of rankings created by single-representation dense retrieval models (ANCE & TCT-ColBERT). Therefore, we propose a number of variants of existing unsupervised coherence-based predictors that employ neural embedding representations. In our experiments on the TREC Deep Learning Track datasets, we demonstrate improved accuracy upon dense retrieval (up to 92% compared to sparse variants for TCT-ColBERT and 188% for ANCE). Going deeper, we select the most representative and best performing predictors to study the importance of differences among predictors and query types on query performance. Using existing distribution-based evaluation QPP measures and a particular type of linear mixed models, we find that query types further significantly influence query performance (and are up to 35% responsible for the unstable performance of QPP predictors), and that this sensitivity is unique to dense retrieval models. Our approach introduces a new setting for obtaining richer information on query differences in dense QPP that can explain potential unstable performance of existing predictors and outlines the unique characteristics of different query types on dense retrieval models.

    "abstract": "Existing visual change detectors usually adopt CNNs or Transformers for feature representation learning and focus on learning effective representation for the changed regions between images. Although good performance can be obtained by enhancing the features of the change regions, however, these works are still limited mainly due to the ignorance of mining the unchanged background context information. It is known that one main challenge for change detection is how to obtain the consistent representations for two images involving different variations, such as spatial variation, sunlight intensity, etc. In this work, we demonstrate that carefully mining the common background information provides an important cue to learn the consistent representations for the two images which thus obviously facilitates the visual change detection problem. Based on this observation, we propose a novel Visual change Transformer (VcT) model for visual change detection problem. To be specific, a shared backbone network is first used to extract the feature maps for the given image pair. Then, each pixel of feature map is regarded as a graph node and the graph neural network is proposed to model the structured information for coarse change map prediction. Top-K reliable tokens can be mined from the map and refined by using the clustering algorithm. Then, these reliable tokens are enhanced by first utilizing self/cross-attention schemes and then interacting with original features via an anchor-primary attention learning module. Finally, the prediction head is proposed to get a more accurate change map. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validated the effectiveness of our proposed VcT model. ",

In this work, we investigate how to leverage established concept-based explanation techniques in the context of bearing fault detection with deep neural networks trained on vibration signals. Since bearings are prevalent in almost every rotating equipment, ensuring the reliability of intransparent fault detection models is crucial to prevent costly repairs and downtimes of industrial machinery.

In this paper, we seek to empirically investigate knowledge transfer from larger to smaller models through a parametric perspective. To achieve this, we employ sensitivity-based techniques to extract and align knowledge-specific parameters between different LLMs. Moreover, the LoRA module is used as the intermediary mechanism for injecting the extracted knowledge into smaller models. Evaluations across four benchmarks validate the efficacy of our proposed method. Our findings highlight the critical factors contributing to the process of parametric knowledge transfer, underscoring the transferability of model parameters across LLMs of different scales.

    "abstract": "We present DE-VAE, a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to search for a compressed representation of dynamical dark energy (DE) models in observational studies of the cosmic large-scale structure. DE-VAE is trained on matter power spectra boosts generated at wavenumbers $k\\in(0.01-2.5) \\ h/\\rm{Mpc}$ and at four redshift values $z\\in(0.1,0.48,0.78,1.5)$ for the most typical dynamical DE parametrization with two extra parameters describing an evolving DE equation of state. The boosts are compressed to a lower-dimensional representation, which is concatenated with standard cold dark matter (CDM) parameters and then mapped back to reconstructed boosts; both the compression and the reconstruction components are parametrized as neural networks. Remarkably, we find that a single latent parameter is sufficient to predict 95% (99%) of DE power spectra generated over a broad range of cosmological parameters within $1\\sigma$ ($2\\sigma$) of a Gaussian error which includes cosmic variance, shot noise and systematic effects for a Stage IV-like survey. This single parameter shows a high mutual information with the two DE parameters, and these three variables can be linked together with an explicit equation through symbolic regression. Considering a model with two latent variables only marginally improves the accuracy of the predictions, and adding a third latent variable has no significant impact on the model's performance. We discuss how the DE-VAE architecture can be extended from a proof of concept to a general framework to be employed in the search for a common lower-dimensional parametrization of a wide range of beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM models and for different cosmological datasets. Such a framework could then both inform the development of cosmological surveys by targeting optimal probes, and provide theoretical insight into the common phenomenological aspects of beyond-$\\Lambda$CDM models.

In this paper, we show \"inference of articulatory kinematics\" as fundamental property of SSL models, i.e., the ability of these models to transform acoustics into the causal articulatory dynamics underlying the speech signal. We also show that this abstraction is largely overlapping across the language of the data used to train the model, with preference to the language with similar phonological system. Furthermore, we show that with simple affine transformations, Acoustic-to-Articulatory inversion (AAI) is transferrable across speakers, even across genders, languages, and dialects, showing the generalizability of this property. Together, these results shed new light on the internals of SSL models that are critical to their superior performance, and open up new avenues into language-agnostic universal models for speech engineering, that are interpretable and grounded in speech science.

Computational prediction of binding affinity between TCRs and epitope sequences using machine/deep learning has attracted intense attention recently. However, its success is hindered by the lack of large collections of annotated TCR-epitope pairs. Annotating their binding affinity requires expensive and time-consuming wet-lab evaluation. To reduce annotation cost, we present ActiveTCR, a framework that incorporates active learning and TCR-epitope binding affinity prediction models. Starting with a small set of labeled training pairs, ActiveTCR iteratively searches for unlabeled TCR-epitope pairs that are ''worth'' for annotation. It aims to maximize performance gains while minimizing the cost of annotation. We compared four query strategies with a random sampling baseline and demonstrated that ActiveTCR reduces annotation costs by approximately 40%. Furthermore, we showed that providing ground truth labels of TCR-epitope pairs to query strategies can help identify and reduce more than 40% redundancy among already annotated pairs without compromising model performance, enabling users to train equally powerful prediction models with less training data. Our work is the first systematic investigation of data optimization for TCR-epitope binding affinity prediction. ",

Typical approaches for spoofing detection in the physical layer declare an attack when a change is observed in certain channel features, such as the received signal strength (RSS) measured by spatially distributed receivers. However, since channels change over time, for example due to user movement, such approaches are impractical. To sidestep this limitation, this paper proposes a scheme that combines the decisions of a position-change detector based on a deep neural network to distinguish spoofing from movement. Building upon community detection on graphs, the sequence of received frames is partitioned into subsequences to detect concurrent transmissions from distinct locations. The scheme can be easily deployed in practice since it just involves collecting a small dataset of measurements at a few tens of locations that need not even be computed or recorded. The scheme is evaluated on real data collected for this purpose. ",

    "abstract": "Single neurons in neural networks are often ``interpretable'' in that they represent individual, intuitively meaningful features. However, many neurons exhibit $\\textit{mixed selectivity}$, i.e., they represent multiple unrelated features. A recent hypothesis proposes that features in deep networks may be represented in $\\textit{superposition}$, i.e., on non-orthogonal axes by multiple neurons, since the number of possible interpretable features in natural data is generally larger than the number of neurons in a given network. Accordingly, we should be able to find meaningful directions in activation space that are not aligned with individual neurons. Here, we propose (1) an automated method for quantifying visual interpretability that is validated against a large database of human psychophysics judgments of neuron interpretability, and (2) an approach for finding meaningful directions in network activation space. We leverage these methods to discover directions in convolutional neural networks that are more intuitively meaningful than individual neurons, as we confirm and investigate in a series of analyses. Moreover, we apply the same method to two recent datasets of visual neural responses in the brain and find that our conclusions largely transfer to real neural data, suggesting that superposition might be deployed by the brain. This also provides a link with disentanglement and raises fundamental questions about robust, efficient and factorized representations in both artificial and biological neural systems. ",
