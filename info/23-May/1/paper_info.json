    "abstract": "We propose a novel learning-based approach for robust 3D shape matching. Our method builds upon deep functional maps and can be trained in a fully unsupervised manner. Previous deep functional map methods mainly focus on predicting optimised functional maps alone, and then rely on off-the-shelf post-processing to obtain accurate point-wise maps during inference. However, this two-stage procedure for obtaining point-wise maps often yields sub-optimal performance. In contrast, building upon recent insights about the relation between functional maps and point-wise maps, we propose a novel unsupervised loss to couple the functional maps and point-wise maps, and thereby directly obtain point-wise maps without any post-processing. Our approach obtains accurate correspondences not only for near-isometric shapes, but also for more challenging non-isometric shapes and partial shapes, as well as shapes with different discretisation or topological noise. Using a total of nine diverse datasets, we extensively evaluate the performance and demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, even compared to recent supervised methods.

    "abstract": "Measures of power grid vulnerability are often assessed by the amount of damage an adversary can exact on the network. However, the cascading impact of such attacks is often overlooked, even though cascades are one of the primary causes of large-scale blackouts. This paper explores modifications of transmission line protection settings as candidates for adversarial attacks, which can remain undetectable as long as the network equilibrium state remains unaltered. This forms the basis of a black-box function in a Bayesian optimization procedure, where the objective is to find protection settings that maximize network degradation due to cascading. Extensive experiments reveal that, against conventional wisdom, maximally misconfiguring the protection settings of all network lines does not cause the most cascading. More surprisingly, even when the degree of misconfiguration is resource constrained, it is still possible to find settings that produce cascades comparable in severity to instances where there are no constraints.

    "abstract": "Current LiDAR-based 3D object detectors for autonomous driving are almost entirely trained on human-annotated data collected in specific geographical domains with specific sensor setups, making it difficult to adapt to a different domain. MODEST is the first work to train 3D object detectors without any labels. Our work, HyperMODEST, proposes a universal method implemented on top of MODEST that can largely accelerate the self-training process and does not require tuning on a specific dataset. We filter intermediate pseudo-labels used for data augmentation with low confidence scores. On the nuScenes dataset, we observe a significant improvement of 1.6% in AP BEV in 0-80m range at IoU=0.25 and an improvement of 1.7% in AP BEV in 0-80m range at IoU=0.5 while only using one-fifth of the training time in the original approach by MODEST. On the Lyft dataset, we also observe an improvement over the baseline during the first round of iterative self-training. We explore the trade-off between high precision and high recall in the early stage of the self-training process by comparing our proposed method with two other score filtering methods: confidence score filtering for pseudo-labels with and without static label retention.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose using deep neural networks to extract important information from Vietnamese legal questions, a fundamental task towards building a question answering system in the legal domain. Given a legal question in natural language, the goal is to extract all the segments that contain the needed information to answer the question. We introduce a deep model that solves the task in three stages. First, our model leverages recent advanced autoencoding language models to produce contextual word embeddings, which are then combined with character-level and POS-tag information to form word representations. Next, bidirectional long short-term memory networks are employed to capture the relations among words and generate sentence-level representations. At the third stage, borrowing ideas from graph-based dependency parsing methods which provide a global view on the input sentence, we use biaffine classifiers to estimate the probability of each pair of start-end words to be an important segment. Experimental results on a public Vietnamese legal dataset show that our model outperforms the previous work by a large margin, achieving 94.79% in the F1 score. The results also prove the effectiveness of using contextual features extracted from pre-trained language models combined with other types of features such as character-level and POS-tag features when training on a limited dataset.

In this study, we focus on understanding the generation and influence of extreme ideas in routine conversations which we label \"eccentric\" ideas. The eccentricity of any idea is defined as the deviation of that idea from the norm of the social neighborhood. We collected and analyzed data from two completely different sources: public social media and online experiments in a controlled environment. We compared the popularity of ideas against their eccentricity to understand individuals' fascination towards eccentricity. We found that more eccentric ideas have a higher probability of getting a greater number of \"likes\". Additionally, we demonstrate that the social neighborhood of an individual conceals eccentricity changes in one's own opinions and facilitates generation of eccentric ideas at a collective level. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate 3D object detection in all weather conditions remains a key challenge to enable the widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles, as most work to date has been performed on clear weather data. In order to generalize to adverse weather conditions, supervised methods perform best if trained from scratch on all weather data instead of finetuning a model pretrained on clear weather data. Training from scratch on all data will eventually become computationally infeasible and expensive as datasets continue to grow and encompass the full extent of possible weather conditions. On the other hand, naive finetuning on data from a different weather domain can result in catastrophic forgetting of the previously learned domain. Inspired by the success of replay-based continual learning methods, we propose Gradient-based Maximally Interfered Retrieval (GMIR), a gradient based sampling strategy for replay. During finetuning, GMIR periodically retrieves samples from the previous domain dataset whose gradient vectors show maximal interference with the gradient vector of the current update. Our 3D object detection experiments on the SeeingThroughFog (STF) dataset show that GMIR not only overcomes forgetting but also offers competitive performance compared to scratch training on all data with a 46.25% reduction in total training time.

To reduce the adverse effect of different speeds, shapes, structures, and the presence of several vehicles in a single image, we introduce the concept of augmentation which highlights the region of interest containing the vehicles. The augmented map is generated by exploring the combination of multiresolution analysis and maximally stable extremal regions (MR-MSER). The output of MR-MSER is supplied to fast CNN to generate a confidence map, which results in candidate regions. Furthermore, unlike existing models that implement complicated models for vehicle detection, we explore the combination of a rough set and fuzzy-based models for robust vehicle detection. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on our dataset captured by drones and on several vehicle detection benchmark datasets, namely, KITTI and UA-DETRAC. The results on our dataset and the benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of time efficiency and achieves a good detection rate. ",

In this paper we consider the problem of execution time minimization of compute graphs subject to a memory budget. In particular, we develop a new constraint programming formulation called \\textsc{Moccasin} with only $O(n)$ integer variables, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the compute graph. This is a significant improvement over the works in the recent literature that propose formulations with $O(n^2)$ Boolean variables.

Our extensive evaluation of attack effectiveness across five datasets, complemented by three distinct human cognition assessments, reveals that Figure 4 achieves comparable attack performance while maintaining superior stealthiness relative to baseline methods.

Combining the physical principles of the imaging system with the advantages of data-driven deep learning networks, physics-embedded deep unrolling networks have recently emerged as a promising solution in computational imaging. However, the inherent nonlinear and ill-posed properties of EIT image reconstruction still present challenges to existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability. To tackle this challenge, we propose the learned half-quadratic splitting (HQSNet) algorithm for incorporating physics into learning-based EIT imaging. We then apply Anderson acceleration (AA) to the HQSNet algorithm, denoted as AA-HQSNet, which can be interpreted as AA applied to the Gauss-Newton step and the learned proximal gradient descent step of the HQSNet, respectively. AA is a widely-used technique for accelerating the convergence of fixed-point iterative algorithms and has gained significant interest in numerical optimization and machine learning. However, the technique has received little attention in the inverse problems community thus far. Employing AA enhances the convergence rate compared to the standard HQSNet while simultaneously avoiding artifacts in the reconstructions. Lastly, we conduct rigorous numerical and visual experiments to show that the AA module strengthens the HQSNet, leading to robust, accurate, and considerably superior reconstructions compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our Anderson acceleration scheme to enhance HQSNet is generic and can be applied to improve the performance of various physics-embedded deep learning methods. ",

Additionally, pulse oximeters may not be available in marginalized communities and undeveloped countries. To address these limitations and provide a more comfortable and unobtrusive way to monitor SpO2, recent studies have investigated SpO2 measurement using videos. However, measuring SpO2 using cameras in a contactless way, particularly from smartphones, is challenging due to weaker physiological signals and lower optical selectivity of smartphone camera sensors. The system includes three main steps: 1) extraction of the region of interest (ROI), which includes the palm and back of the hand, from the smartphone-captured videos; 2) spatial averaging of the ROI to produce R, G, and B time series; and 3) feeding the time series into an optophysiology-inspired CNN for SpO2 estimation.

In this paper, we propose an effective oil spill image segmentation network named SRCNet by leveraging SAR image representation and the training for oil spill segmentation simultaneously. Specifically, our proposed segmentation network is constructed with a pair of deep neural nets with the collaboration of the seminal representation that describes SAR images, where one deep neural net is the generative net which strives to produce oil spill segmentation maps, and the other is the discriminative net which trys its best to distinguish between the produced and the true segmentations, and they thus built a two-player game. Particularly, the seminal representation exploited in our proposed SRCNet originates from SAR imagery, modelling with the internal characteristics of SAR images. Thus, in the training process, the collaborated seminal representation empowers the mapped generative net to produce accurate oil spill segmentation maps efficiently with small amount of training data, promoting the discriminative net reaching its optimal solution at a fast speed. Therefore, our proposed SRCNet operates effective oil spill segmentation in an economical and efficient manner. Additionally, to increase the segmentation capability of the proposed segmentation network in terms of accurately delineating oil spill details in SAR images, a regularisation term that penalises the segmentation loss is devised. This encourages our proposed SRCNet for accurately segmenting oil spill areas from SAR images. Empirical experimental evaluations from different metrics validate the effectiveness of our proposed SRCNet for oil spill image segmentation. ",

    "abstract": "The extensive utilization of biometric authentication systems have emanated attackers / imposters to forge user identity based on morphed images. In this attack, a synthetic image is produced and merged with genuine. Next, the resultant image is user for authentication. Numerous deep neural convolutional architectures have been proposed in literature for face Morphing Attack Detection (MADs) to prevent such attacks and lessen the risks associated with them. Although, deep learning models achieved optimal results in terms of performance, it is difficult to understand and analyse these networks since they are black box/opaque in nature. As a consequence, incorrect judgments may be made. There is, however, a dearth of literature that explains decision-making methods of black box deep learning models for biometric Presentation Attack Detection (PADs) or MADs that can aid the biometric community to have trust in deep learning-based biometric systems for identification and authentication in various security applications such as border control, criminal database establishment etc. In this work, we present a novel visual explanation approach named Ensemble XAI integrating Saliency maps, Class Activation Maps (CAM) and Gradient-CAM (Grad-CAM) to provide a more comprehensive visual explanation for a deep learning prognostic model (EfficientNet-B1) that we have employed to predict whether the input presented to a biometric authentication system is morphed or genuine. The experimentations have been performed on three publicly available datasets namely Face Research Lab London Set, Wide Multi-Channel Presentation Attack (WMCA), and Makeup Induced Face Spoofing (MIFS). The experimental evaluations affirms that the resultant visual explanations highlight more fine-grained details of image features/areas focused by EfficientNet-B1 to reach decisions along with appropriate reasoning.

    "abstract": "We focus on the signal detection for large quasi-symmetric (LQS) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where the numbers of both service (M) and user (N) antennas are large and N/M tends to 1. It is challenging to achieve maximum-likelihood detection (MLD) performance with square-order complexity due to the ill-conditioned channel matrix. In the emerging MIMO paradigm termed with an extremely large aperture array, the channel matrix can be more ill-conditioned due to spatial non-stationarity. In this paper, projected-Jacobi (PJ) is proposed for signal detection in (non-) stationary LQS-MIMO systems. It is theoretically and empirically demonstrated that PJ can achieve MLD performance, even when N/M = 1. Moreover, PJ has square-order complexity of N and supports parallel computation. The main idea of PJ is to add a projection step and to set a (quasi-) orthogonal initialization for the classical Jacobi iteration. Moreover, the symbol error rate (SER) of PJ is mathematically derived and it is tight to the simulation results. ",

For simplicity and efficiency reasons, we assume that the distributions are multivariate normals and then train large language models to produce mean and variance vectors for these distributions. We provide a theoretical foundation for the proposed framework and show that it can be seamlessly integrated into the existing approximate nearest neighbor algorithms to perform retrieval efficiently.

    "abstract": "The policy represented by the deep neural network can overfit the spurious features in observations, which hamper a reinforcement learning agent from learning effective policy. This issue becomes severe in high-dimensional state, where the agent struggles to learn a useful policy. Data augmentation can provide a performance boost to RL agents by mitigating the effect of overfitting. However, such data augmentation is a form of prior knowledge, and naively applying them in environments might worsen an agent's performance. In this paper, we propose a novel RL algorithm to mitigate the above issue and improve the efficiency of the learned policy. Our approach consists of a max-min game theoretic objective where a perturber network modifies the state to maximize the agent's probability of taking a different action while minimizing the distortion in the state. In contrast, the policy network updates its parameters to minimize the effect of perturbation while maximizing the expected future reward. Based on this objective, we propose a practical deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Adversarial Policy Optimization (APO). Our method is agnostic to the type of policy optimization, and thus data augmentation can be incorporated to harness the benefit. We evaluated our approaches on several DeepMind Control robotic environments with high-dimensional and noisy state settings. Empirical results demonstrate that our method APO consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on-policy PPO agent. We further compare our method with state-of-the-art data augmentation, RAD, and regularization-based approach DRAC. Our agent APO shows better performance compared to these baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Network slicing enables the deployment of multiple dedicated virtual sub-networks, i.e. slices on a shared physical infrastructure. Unlike traditional one-size-fits-all resource provisioning schemes, each network slice (NS) in 5G is tailored to the specific service requirements of a group of customers. An end-to-end (E2E) mobile NS orchestration requires the simultaneous provisioning of computing, storage, and networking resources across the core network (CN) and the radio access network (RAN). Constant temporospatial changes in mobile user demand profiles further complicate the E2E NSs resource provisioning beyond the limits of the existing best-effort schemes that are only effective under accurate demand forecasts for all slices. This paper proposes a practical two-time-scale resource provisioning framework for E2E network slicing under demand uncertainty. At each macro-scale instance, we assume that only the spatial probability distribution of the NS demands is available. We formulate the NSs resource allocation problem as a stochastic mixed integer program (SMIP) with the objective of minimizing the total resource cost at the CN and the RAN. At each microscale instance, utilizing the exact slice demand profiles, a linear program is solved to jointly minimize the unsupported traffic and the resource cost at the RAN. We verify the effectiveness of our resource allocation scheme through numerical experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Bitcoin is undoubtedly a great alternative to today's existing digital payment systems. Even though Bitcoin's scalability has been debated for a long time, we see that it is no longer a concern thanks to its layer-2 solution Lightning Network (LN). LN has been growing non-stop since its creation and enabled fast, cheap, anonymous, censorship-resistant Bitcoin transactions. However, as known, LN nodes need an active Internet connection to operate securely which may not be always possible. For example, in the aftermath of natural disasters or power outages, users may not have Internet access for a while. Thus, in this paper, we propose LNMesh which enables offline LN payments on top of wireless mesh networks. Users of a neighborhood or a community can establish a wireless mesh network to use it as an infrastructure to enable offline LN payments when they do not have any Internet connection. As such, we first present proof-of-concept implementations where we successfully perform offline LN payments utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy and WiFi. For larger networks with more users where users can also move around, channel assignments in the network need to be made strategically and thus, we propose 1) minimum connected dominating set; and 2) uniform spanning tree based channel assignment approaches. Finally, to test these approaches, we implemented a simulator in Python along with the support of BonnMotion mobility tool. We then extensively tested the performance metrics of large-scale realistic offline LN payments on mobile wireless mesh networks. Our simulation results show that, success rates up to %95 are achievable with the proposed channel assignment approaches when channels have enough liquidity. ",

Existing methods on similar lines, such as NICE-SLAM, has some critical practical limitations to put to use for such an important indoor scene understanding problem. To this end, we contend for the following proposition for modern semantic V-SLAM contrary to existing methods assuming RGB-D frames as input (i) For a rigid scene, robust and accurate camera motion could be computed with disentangled tracking and 3D mapping pipeline. (ii) Using neural fields, a dense and multifaceted scene representation of SDF, semantics, RGB, and depth is provided memory efficiently. (iii) Rather than using every frame, we demonstrate that the set of keyframes is sufficient to learn excellent scene representation, thereby improving the pipeline's train time. (iv) Multiple local mapping networks could be used to extend the pipeline for large-scale scenes. We show via extensive experiments on several popular benchmark datasets that our approach offers accurate tracking, mapping, and semantic labeling at test time even with noisy and highly sparse depth measurements. Later in the paper, we show that our pipeline can easily extend to RGB image input. Overall, the proposed pipeline offers a favorable solution to an important scene understanding task that can assist in diverse robot visual perception and related problems. ",

While diffusion models conditioned on text prompts have produced impressive and high-quality images, accurately representing complex text prompts such as the number of instances of a specific object remains challenging. To address this limitation, we propose a novel guidance approach for the sampling process in the diffusion model that leverages bounding box and segmentation map information at inference time without additional training data. Through a novel loss in the sampling process, our approach guides the model with semantic features from CLIP embeddings and enforces geometric constraints, leading to high-resolution images that accurately represent the scene. To obtain bounding box and segmentation map information, we structure the text prompt as a scene graph and enrich the nodes with CLIP embeddings. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks for image generation from scene graphs, surpassing both scene graph to image and text-based diffusion models in various metrics. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating bounding box and segmentation map guidance in the diffusion model sampling process for more accurate text-to-image generation. ",

In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied in many embedding-based EA methods. However, existing GNN-based methods either suffer from the structural heterogeneity issue that especially appears in the real KG distributions or ignore the heterogeneous representation learning for unseen (unlabeled) entities, which would lead the model to overfit on few alignment seeds (i.e., training data) and thus cause unsatisfactory alignment performance. To enhance the EA ability, we propose GAEA, a novel EA approach based on graph augmentation. In this model, we design a simple Entity-Relation (ER) Encoder to generate latent representations for entities via jointly modeling comprehensive structural information and rich relation semantics. Moreover, we use graph augmentation to create two graph views for margin-based alignment learning and contrastive entity representation learning, thus mitigating structural heterogeneity and further improving the model's alignment performance.

With advancements in surgical training programs in both physical and virtual environments, it is imperative to develop generalizable methods for automatically assessing skills.

Our approach leverages labeled data from common surgical training tasks such as Suturing, Needle Passing, and Knot Tying to jointly train a model with both labeled and unlabeled data. Pseudo labels are generated for the unlabeled data through an iterative manner that incorporates uncertainty estimation to ensure accurate labeling. We evaluate our method on a virtual reality simulated training task (Ring Transfer) using data from the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). The results show that trainees with robotic assistance have significantly higher expert probability compared to these without any assistance, p < 0.05, which aligns with previous studies showing the benefits of robotic assistance in improving training proficiency. Our method offers a significant advantage over other existing works as it does not require manual labeling or prior knowledge of the surgical training task for robot-assisted surgery. ",

We demonstrate that TA will obtain diverse temporal views, which significantly affect the focus of neural networks. Training with these examples remedies the flaw of unbalanced temporal information perception and enhances the ability to defend against temporal shifts, ultimately leading to better generalization.

We evaluate TAF with four powerful models (TSM, GST, TAM, and TPN) over three challenging temporal-related benchmarks (Something-something V1&V2 and diving48). Experimental results demonstrate that TAF effectively improves the test accuracy of these models with notable margins without introducing additional parameters or computational costs.

Although deep learning (DL)-based pan-sharpening methods have achieved promising performance, most of them have a two-fold deficiency. For one thing, the universally adopted black box principle limits the model interpretability. For another thing, existing DL-based methods fail to efficiently capture local and global dependencies at the same time, inevitably limiting the overall performance. To address these mentioned issues, we first formulate the degradation process of the high-resolution multispectral (HrMS) image as a unified variational optimization problem, and alternately solve its data and prior subproblems by the designed iterative proximal gradient descent (PGD) algorithm. Moreover, we customize a Local-Global Transformer (LGT) to simultaneously model local and global dependencies, and further formulate an LGT-based prior module for image denoising. Besides the prior module, we also design a lightweight data module. Finally, by serially integrating the data and prior modules in each iterative stage, we unfold the iterative algorithm into a stage-wise unfolding network, Local-Global Transformer Enhanced Unfolding Network (LGTEUN), for the interpretable MS pan-sharpening. Comprehensive experimental results on three satellite data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LGTEUN compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

    "abstract": "Multi-sensor fusion (MSF) is widely adopted for perception in autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly for the task of 3D object detection with camera and LiDAR sensors. The rationale behind fusion is to capitalize on the strengths of each modality while mitigating their limitations. The exceptional and leading performance of fusion models has been demonstrated by advanced deep neural network (DNN)-based fusion techniques. Fusion models are also perceived as more robust to attacks compared to single-modal ones due to the redundant information in multiple modalities. In this work, we challenge this perspective with single-modal attacks that targets the camera modality, which is considered less significant in fusion but more affordable for attackers. We argue that the weakest link of fusion models depends on their most vulnerable modality, and propose an attack framework that targets advanced camera-LiDAR fusion models with adversarial patches. Our approach employs a two-stage optimization-based strategy that first comprehensively assesses vulnerable image areas under adversarial attacks, and then applies customized attack strategies to different fusion models, generating deployable patches. Evaluations with five state-of-the-art camera-LiDAR fusion models on a real-world dataset show that our attacks successfully compromise all models. Our approach can either reduce the mean average precision (mAP) of detection performance from 0.824 to 0.353 or degrade the detection score of the target object from 0.727 to 0.151 on average, demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed attack framework.

    "title": "A positive feedback method based on F-measure value for Salient Object  Detection",
    "abstract": "The majority of current salient object detection (SOD) models are focused on designing a series of decoders based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) or Transformer architectures and integrating them in a skillful manner. These models have achieved remarkable high performance and made significant contributions to the development of SOD. Their primary research objective is to develop novel algorithms that can outperform state-of-the-art models, a task that is extremely difficult and time-consuming. In contrast, this paper proposes a positive feedback method based on F-measure value for SOD, aiming to improve the accuracy of saliency prediction using existing methods. Specifically, our proposed method takes an image to be detected and inputs it into several existing models to obtain their respective prediction maps. These prediction maps are then fed into our positive feedback method to generate the final prediction result, without the need for careful decoder design or model training. Moreover, our method is adaptive and can be implemented based on existing models without any restrictions. Experimental results on five publicly available datasets show that our proposed positive feedback method outperforms the latest 12 methods in five evaluation metrics for saliency map prediction. Additionally, we conducted a robustness experiment, which shows that when at least one good prediction result exists in the selected existing model, our proposed approach can ensure that the prediction result is not worse. Our approach achieves a prediction speed of 20 frames per second (FPS) when evaluated on a low configuration host and after removing the prediction time overhead of inserted models. These results highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our proposed approach for salient object detection. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we trialled different methods of data preparation for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training and semantic segmentation of land use land cover (LULC) features within aerial photography over the Wet Tropics and Atherton Tablelands, Queensland, Australia. This was conducted through trialling and ranking various training patch selection sampling strategies, patch and batch sizes and data augmentations and scaling. We also compared model accuracy through producing the LULC classification using a single pass of a grid of patches and averaging multiple grid passes and three rotated version of each patch. Our results showed: a stratified random sampling approach for producing training patches improved the accuracy of classes with a smaller area while having minimal effect on larger classes; a smaller number of larger patches compared to a larger number of smaller patches improves model accuracy; applying data augmentations and scaling are imperative in creating a generalised model able to accurately classify LULC features in imagery from a different date and sensor; and producing the output classification by averaging multiple grids of patches and three rotated versions of each patch produced and more accurate and aesthetic result. Combining the findings from the trials, we fully trained five models on the 2018 training image and applied the model to the 2015 test image with the output LULC classifications achieving an average kappa of 0.84 user accuracy of 0.81 and producer accuracy of 0.87. This study has demonstrated the importance of data pre-processing for developing a generalised deep-learning model for LULC classification which can be applied to a different date and sensor. Future research using CNN and earth observation data should implement the findings of this study to increase LULC model accuracy and transferability. ",

    "abstract": "Pictorial visualization seamlessly integrates data and semantic context into visual representation, conveying complex information in a manner that is both engaging and informative. Extensive studies have been devoted to developing authoring tools to simplify the creation of pictorial visualizations. However, mainstream works mostly follow a retrieving-and-editing pipeline that heavily relies on retrieved visual elements from a dedicated corpus, which often compromise the data integrity. Text-guided generation methods are emerging, but may have limited applicability due to its predefined recognized entities. In this work, we propose ChartSpark, a novel system that embeds semantic context into chart based on text-to-image generative model. ChartSpark generates pictorial visualizations conditioned on both semantic context conveyed in textual inputs and data information embedded in plain charts. The method is generic for both foreground and background pictorial generation, satisfying the design practices identified from an empirical research into existing pictorial visualizations. We further develop an interactive visual interface that integrates a text analyzer, editing module, and evaluation module to enable users to generate, modify, and assess pictorial visualizations. We experimentally demonstrate the usability of our tool, and conclude with a discussion of the potential of using text-to-image generative model combined with interactive interface for visualization design.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural reconstruction using posed image sequences have made remarkable progress. However, due to the lack of depth information, existing volumetric-based techniques simply duplicate 2D image features of the object surface along the entire camera ray. We contend this duplication introduces noise in empty and occluded spaces, posing challenges for producing high-quality 3D geometry. Drawing inspiration from traditional multi-view stereo methods, we propose an end-to-end 3D neural reconstruction framework CVRecon, designed to exploit the rich geometric embedding in the cost volumes to facilitate 3D geometric feature learning. Furthermore, we present Ray-contextual Compensated Cost Volume (RCCV), a novel 3D geometric feature representation that encodes view-dependent information with improved integrity and robustness. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the reconstruction quality in various metrics and recovers clear fine details of the 3D geometries. Our extensive ablation studies provide insights into the development of effective 3D geometric feature learning schemes. Project page: https://cvrecon.ziyue.cool/ ",

Unfortunately, these systems are more open to intrusions that range from passive listening to aggressive spying. A Hybrid Team centric Re-Key Control Framework (HT-RCF) suggests that this research examines private group communication in Adhoc environments. Each group selects a Group Manager to oversee the group's members choose the group manager, and the suggested HT-RCF uses the Improved Hybrid Power-Aware Decentralized (I-HPAD) mechanism. The Key Distribution Center (KDC) generates the keys and distributes them to the group managers (GMs) using the base algorithm Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA). The key agreement technique is investigated for safe user-user communication. Threats that aim to exploit a node are recognized and stopped using regular transmissions. The rekeying procedure is started every time a node enters and exits the network. The research findings demonstrate that the suggested approach outperforms the currently used Cluster-based Group Key Management in terms of power use, privacy level, storage use, and processing time.

MANETs require communication privacy and security, notably in core routing protocols, when functioning in hostile or suspicious environments. The Trust Aware Privacy-Preserving Protocol (TAP3) is a mechanism for supporting the origin in proactively selecting a trust-able target and doing privacy-preserving route verification. We suggest TAP3 using the fellow recommendation model for MANETs in this work. Nodes use their features to discover their fellow node and use the trust to create strong connections with the random node via a multi-hop trusting chain by identifying the secure location. The verification duties are then spread among the nodes and validate the log updates without exposing the nodes' details. Unlike previous models that uncover node vulnerabilities or misconduct after an attack, TAP3 may guarantee the origin node to prevent data from being transferred through malicious nodes from the beginning and do verification without needing a third party. Our results show that this approach can locate problematic nodes with minimal overhead than the conventional routing protocol. ",

    "abstract": "The two biggest problems with wireless sensor networks are security and energy usage. In sensing devices, malicious nodes could be found in large numbers. The researchers have proposed several methods to find these rogue nodes. To prevent assaults on these networks and data transmission, the data must be secured. Data aggregation aids in reducing the number of messages transmitted within the network, which in turn lowers total network energy consumption. Additionally, when decrypting the aggregated data, the base station can distinguish between encrypted and consolidated analysis based on top of the cryptographic keys. By examining the effectiveness of the data aggregation in this research. To solve the above problem, the system provides a method in which an efficient cluster agent is preferred pedestal on its location at the access point and energy availability. The sensor network's energy consumption is reduced by selecting an effective cluster agent, extending the network's lifespan. The cluster's agent is in indict of compiling data for each member node. The clustering agent validates the data and tosses any errors before aggregation. The clustering agent only aggregates confirmed data. To provide end-to-end anonymity, ElGamal elliptic curve (ECE) encryption is used to secure the client data and reassign the encrypted information en route for the cluster agent. Only the base station (BS) can decrypt the data. Furthermore, an ID-based signature system is utilized to enable authenticity. This research presents a technique for recuperating lost data. The access point employs a cache-based backup system to search for lost data. ",

    "abstract": "Machine and deep learning methods for medical and healthcare applications have shown significant progress and performance improvement in recent years. These methods require vast amounts of training data which are available in the medical sector, albeit decentralized. Medical institutions generate vast amounts of data for which sharing and centralizing remains a challenge as the result of data and privacy regulations. The federated learning technique is well-suited to tackle these challenges. However, federated learning comes with a new set of open problems related to communication overhead, efficient parameter aggregation, client selection strategies and more. In this work, we address the step prior to the initiation of a federated network for model training, client recruitment. By intelligently recruiting clients, communication overhead and overall cost of training can be reduced without sacrificing predictive performance. Client recruitment aims at pre-excluding potential clients from partaking in the federation based on a set of criteria indicative of their eventual contributions to the federation. In this work, we propose a client recruitment approach using only the output distribution and sample size at the client site. We show how a subset of clients can be recruited without sacrificing model performance whilst, at the same time, significantly improving computation time. By applying the recruitment approach to the training of federated models for accurate patient Length of Stay prediction using data from 189 Intensive Care Units, we show how the models trained in federations made up from recruited clients significantly outperform federated models trained with the standard procedure in terms of predictive power and training time.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of videos collected during in-the-wild natural settings has pushed the development of effective Video Quality Assessment (VQA) methodologies. Contemporary supervised opinion-driven VQA strategies predominantly hinge on training from expensive human annotations for quality scores, which limited the scale and distribution of VQA datasets and consequently led to unsatisfactory generalization capacity of methods driven by these data. On the other hand, although several handcrafted zero-shot quality indices do not require training from human opinions, they are unable to account for the semantics of videos, rendering them ineffective in comprehending complex authentic distortions (e.g., white balance, exposure) and assessing the quality of semantic content within videos. To address these challenges, we introduce the text-prompted Semantic Affinity Quality Index (SAQI) and its localized version (SAQI-Local) using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to ascertain the affinity between textual prompts and visual features, facilitating a comprehensive examination of semantic quality concerns without the reliance on human quality annotations. By amalgamating SAQI with existing low-level metrics, we propose the unified Blind Video Quality Index (BVQI) and its improved version, BVQI-Local, which demonstrates unprecedented performance, surpassing existing zero-shot indices by at least 24\\% on all datasets. Moreover, we devise an efficient fine-tuning scheme for BVQI-Local that jointly optimizes text prompts and final fusion weights, resulting in state-of-the-art performance and superior generalization ability in comparison to prevalent opinion-driven VQA methods. We conduct comprehensive analyses to investigate different quality concerns of distinct indices, demonstrating the effectiveness and rationality of our design. ",

We propose an original implementation of GNNs over the power system's factor graph to simplify the integration of various types and quantities of measurements on power system buses and branches. Furthermore, we augment the factor graph to improve the robustness of GNN predictions. This model is highly efficient and scalable, as its computational complexity is linear with respect to the number of nodes in the power system. Training and test examples were generated by randomly sampling sets of power system measurements and annotated with the exact solutions of linear SE with PMUs. The numerical results demonstrate that the GNN model provides an accurate approximation of the SE solutions. Furthermore, errors caused by PMU malfunctions or communication failures that would normally make the SE problem unobservable have a local effect and do not deteriorate the results in the rest of the power system.

However, given the limited number of available channels, the use of multiple links by a group of contending Basic Service Sets (BSSs) can result in higher interference and channel contention, thus potentially leading to lower performance and reliability. In such a situation, it could be better for all contending BSSs to use less links if that contributes to reduce channel access contention. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its potential for optimizing resource allocation in wireless networks. However, the independent operation of each wireless network makes difficult -- if not almost impossible -- for each individual network to learn a good configuration. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose the use of a Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, i.e., a collaborative machine learning approach to train models across multiple distributed agents without exchanging data, to collaboratively learn the the best MLO-Link Allocation (LA) strategy by a group of neighboring BSSs. The simulation results show that the FRL-based decentralized MLO-LA strategy achieves a better throughput fairness, and so a higher reliability -- because it allows the different BSSs to find a link allocation strategy which maximizes the minimum achieved data rate -- compared to fixed, random and RL-based MLO-LA schemes.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Search-in-the-Chain (SearChain) to improve the accuracy, credibility and traceability of LLM-generated content for multi-hop question answering, which is a typical complex knowledge-intensive task. SearChain is a framework that deeply integrates LLM and information retrieval (IR). In SearChain, LLM constructs a chain-of-query, which is the decomposition of the multi-hop question. Each node of the chain is a query-answer pair consisting of an IR-oriented query and the answer generated by LLM for this query. IR verifies, completes, and traces the information of each node of the chain, so as to guide LLM to construct the correct chain-of-query, and finally answer the multi-hop question. SearChain makes LLM change from trying to give a answer to trying to construct the chain-of-query when faced with the multi-hop question, which can stimulate the knowledge-reasoning ability and provides the interface for IR to be deeply involved in reasoning process of LLM. IR interacts with each node of chain-of-query of LLM. It verifies the information of the node and provides the unknown knowledge to LLM, which ensures the accuracy of the whole chain in the process of LLM generating the answer. Besides, the contents returned by LLM to the user include not only the final answer but also the reasoning process for the question, that is, the chain-of-query and the supporting documents retrieved by IR for each node of the chain, which improves the credibility and traceability of the contents generated by LLM.

    "abstract": "Most real-world knowledge graphs, including Wikidata, DBpedia, and Yago are incomplete. Answering queries on such incomplete graphs is an important, but challenging problem. Recently, a number of approaches, including complex query decomposition (CQD), have been proposed to answer complex, multi-hop queries with conjunctions and disjunctions on such graphs. However, all state-of-the-art approaches only consider graphs consisting of entities and relations, neglecting literal values. In this paper, we propose LitCQD -- an approach to answer complex, multi-hop queries where both the query and the knowledge graph can contain numeric literal values: LitCQD can answer queries having numerical answers or having entity answers satisfying numerical constraints. For example, it allows to query (1)~persons living in New York having a certain age, and (2)~the average age of persons living in New York. We evaluate LitCQD on query types with and without literal values. To evaluate LitCQD, we generate complex, multi-hop queries and their expected answers on a version of the FB15k-237 dataset that was extended by literal values. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the FlowTransformer framework, a novel approach for implementing transformer-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs). FlowTransformer leverages the strengths of transformer models in identifying the long-term behaviour and characteristics of networks, which are often overlooked by most existing NIDSs. By capturing these complex patterns in network traffic, FlowTransformer offers a flexible and efficient tool for researchers and practitioners in the cybersecurity community who are seeking to implement NIDSs using transformer-based models. FlowTransformer allows the direct substitution of various transformer components, including the input encoding, transformer, classification head, and the evaluation of these across any flow-based network dataset. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the FlowTransformer framework, we utilise it to provide an extensive evaluation of various common transformer architectures, such as GPT 2.0 and BERT, on three commonly used public NIDS benchmark datasets. We provide results for accuracy, model size and speed. A key finding of our evaluation is that the choice of classification head has the most significant impact on the model performance. Surprisingly, Global Average Pooling, which is commonly used in text classification, performs very poorly in the context of NIDS. In addition, we show that model size can be reduced by over 50\\%, and inference and training times improved, with no loss of accuracy, by making specific choices of input encoding and classification head instead of other commonly used alternatives.

They can enforce appropriate inductive biases, regularize the model and improve performance -- especially in the presence of limited data. In this work, we propose a simple and efficient way for optimizing hyperparameters inspired by the marginal likelihood, an optimization objective that requires no validation data. Our method partitions the training data and a neural network model into $K$ data shards and parameter partitions, respectively. Each partition is associated with and optimized only on specific data shards. Combining these partitions into subnetworks allows us to define the ``out-of-training-sample\" loss of a subnetwork, i.e., the loss on data shards unseen by the subnetwork, as the objective for hyperparameter optimization. We demonstrate that we can apply this objective to optimize a variety of different hyperparameters in a single training run while being significantly computationally cheaper than alternative methods aiming to optimize the marginal likelihood for neural networks. Lastly, we also focus on optimizing hyperparameters in federated learning, where retraining and cross-validation are particularly challenging. ",

Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of specific GitHub Actions on the collaboration networks of Open Source Software teams, using a network-analytic approach. The study will focus on Code Review bots, one of the most frequently implemented types of bots. Method: Fine-grained, time-stamped data of co-editing networks, developer-file contribution networks, as well as workflow runs and git commit logs will be obtained from a large sample of GitHub repositories. This will allow us to study how bots affect the collaboration networks of developers over time. By using a more representative sample of GitHub repositories than previous studies, which includes projects whose sizes span the whole range of Open Source communities, this study will provide generalizable results and updated findings on the general usage and distribution of GitHub Actions. With this study, we aim to contribute to advancing our knowledge of human-bot interaction and the effects of support tools on software engineering teams. ",

Inspired by this, we present NeRF-LIDAR, a novel LiDAR simulation method that leverages real-world information to generate realistic LIDAR point clouds. Different from existing LiDAR simulators, we use real images and point cloud data collected by self-driving cars to learn the 3D scene representation, point cloud generation and label rendering. We verify the effectiveness of our NeRF-LiDAR by training different 3D segmentation models on the generated LiDAR point clouds. It reveals that the trained models are able to achieve similar accuracy when compared with the same model trained on the real LiDAR data. Besides, the generated data is capable of boosting the accuracy through pre-training which helps reduce the requirements of the real labeled data. ",

Our main idea is to assign a probability to a counterfactual (A v B) > C at a causal model M as a weighted average of the probability of C in those submodels that truthmake A v B (Briggs 2012; Fine 2016, 2017). The weights of the submodels are given by the inverse distance to the original model M, based on a distance metric proposed by Eva, Stern, and Hartmann (2019).

Prior methods focus on extracting large amounts of often redundant locally reliable features, resulting in limited efficiency and accuracy, especially in large-scale environments under challenging conditions. Instead, we propose to extract globally reliable features by implicitly embedding high-level semantics into both the detection and description processes. Specifically, our semantic-aware detector is able to detect keypoints from reliable regions (e.g. building, traffic lane) and suppress unreliable areas (e.g. sky, car) implicitly instead of relying on explicit semantic labels. This boosts the accuracy of keypoint matching by reducing the number of features sensitive to appearance changes and avoiding the need of additional segmentation networks at test time. Moreover, our descriptors are augmented with semantics and have stronger discriminative ability, providing more inliers at test time. Particularly, experiments on long-term large-scale visual localization Aachen Day-Night and RobotCar-Seasons datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms previous local features and gives competitive accuracy to advanced matchers but is about 2 and 3 times faster when using 2k and 4k keypoints, respectively.

We target symbolic music, where notes are explicitly encoded, and model this task as a Multi-Trajectory Tracking (MTT) problem from discrete observations, i.e., notes in a pitch-time space. Our approach builds a graph from a musical piece, by creating one node for every note, and separates the melodic trajectories by predicting a link between two notes if they are consecutive in the same voice/stream. This kind of local, greedy prediction is made possible by node embeddings created by a heterogeneous graph neural network that can capture inter- and intra-trajectory information. Furthermore, we propose a new regularization loss that encourages the output to respect the MTT premise of at most one incoming and one outgoing link for every node, favouring monophonic (voice) trajectories; this loss function might also be useful in other general MTT scenarios. Our approach does not use domain-specific heuristics, is scalable to longer sequences and a higher number of voices, and can handle complex cases such as voice inversions and overlaps. We reach new state-of-the-art results for the voice separation task in classical music of different styles. ",

    "abstract": "Analysis of how semantic concepts are represented within Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a widely used approach in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for interpreting CNNs. A motivation is the need for transparency in safety-critical AI-based systems, as mandated in various domains like automated driving. However, to use the concept representations for safety-relevant purposes, like inspection or error retrieval, these must be of high quality and, in particular, stable. This paper focuses on two stability goals when working with concept representations in computer vision CNNs: stability of concept retrieval and of concept attribution. The guiding use-case is a post-hoc explainability framework for object detection (OD) CNNs, towards which existing concept analysis (CA) methods are successfully adapted. To address concept retrieval stability, we propose a novel metric that considers both concept separation and consistency, and is agnostic to layer and concept representation dimensionality. We then investigate impacts of concept abstraction level, number of concept training samples, CNN size, and concept representation dimensionality on stability. For concept attribution stability we explore the effect of gradient instability on gradient-based explainability methods. The results on various CNNs for classification and object detection yield the main findings that (1) the stability of concept retrieval can be enhanced through dimensionality reduction via data aggregation, and (2) in shallow layers where gradient instability is more pronounced, gradient smoothing techniques are advised. Finally, our approach provides valuable insights into selecting the appropriate layer and concept representation dimensionality, paving the way towards CA in safety-critical XAI applications. ",

    "abstract": "Neural ranking models (NRMs) have attracted considerable attention in information retrieval. Unfortunately, NRMs may inherit the adversarial vulnerabilities of general neural networks, which might be leveraged by black-hat search engine optimization practitioners. Recently, adversarial attacks against NRMs have been explored in the paired attack setting, generating an adversarial perturbation to a target document for a specific query. In this paper, we focus on a more general type of perturbation and introduce the topic-oriented adversarial ranking attack task against NRMs, which aims to find an imperceptible perturbation that can promote a target document in ranking for a group of queries with the same topic. We define both static and dynamic settings for the task and focus on decision-based black-box attacks. We propose a novel framework to improve topic-oriented attack performance based on a surrogate ranking model. The attack problem is formalized as a Markov decision process (MDP) and addressed using reinforcement learning. Specifically, a topic-oriented reward function guides the policy to find a successful adversarial example that can be promoted in rankings to as many queries as possible in a group. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly outperform existing attack strategies, and we conclude by re-iterating that there exist potential risks for applying NRMs in the real world.

Most existing methods perform sparse supervision on a subset of high-scoring proposals, while other proposals fail to obtain effective shape and location guidance, resulting in poor overall quality. To address this, we densely modulate all proposals to generate topologically and spatially high-quality lane predictions with discriminative representations. Specifically, we first ensure that lane proposals are physically meaningful by applying single-lane shape and location constraints. Benefitting from the proposed proposal-to-label matching algorithm, we assign each proposal a target ground truth lane to efficiently learn from spatial layout priors. To enhance the generalization and model the inter-proposal relations, we diversify the shape difference of proposals matching the same ground-truth lane. In addition to the shape and location constraints, we design a quality-aware classification loss to adaptively supervise each positive proposal so that the discriminative power can be further boosted. Our DHPM achieves very competitive performances on four popular benchmark datasets. Moreover, we consistently outperform the baseline model on most metrics without introducing new parameters and reducing inference speed. ",

These interactions not only bring significant economic benefits to society but also provide additional operating flexibilities, which are essential to handle fluctuations of the large-scale renewable power generation (RPG) and power system contingencies. Moreover, neglecting these interactions in power system operation may not only result in infeasible operation status in the gas systems but also increase the decision-making operation costs of both systems. Previous studies suffered from two significant drawbacks, namely (1) they assumed the existence of only one utility that has full control authority over the power system and gas system; (2) the economic interactions between power systems and gas systems have been neglected, which goes against the current industrial practice. This research revisits the day-ahead resilient and economic operations of power systems considering the economic and physical interactions with gas systems, which are characterized by the modeling of bilateral energy purchase contracts and operational constraints of gas systems. This thesis provides a novel perspective and solution for the resilient and economically coordinated robust operation of integrated electric-gas systems (IEGSs) under uncertainties.

    "abstract": "Congestion in traffic is an unavoidable circumstance in many cities in India and other countries. It is an issue of major concern. The steep rise in the number of automobiles on the roads followed by old infrastructure, accidents, pedestrian traffic, and traffic rule violations all add to challenging traffic conditions. Given these poor conditions of traffic, there is a critical need for automatically detecting and signaling systems. There are already various technologies that are used for traffic management and signaling systems like video analysis, infrared sensors, and wireless sensors. The main issue with these methods is they are very costly and high maintenance is required. In this paper, we have proposed a three-phase system that can guide emergency vehicles and manage traffic based on the degree of congestion. In the first phase, the system processes the captured images and calculates the Index value which is used to discover the degree of congestion. The Index value of a particular road depends on its width and the length up to which the camera captures images of that road. We have to take input for the parameters (length and width) while setting up the system. In the second phase, the system checks whether there are any emergency vehicles present or not in any lane. In the third phase, the whole processing and decision-making part is performed at the edge server. The proposed model is robust and it takes into consideration adverse weather conditions such as hazy, foggy, and windy. It works very efficiently in low light conditions also. The edge server is a strategically placed server that provides us with low latency and better connectivity. Using Edge technology in this traffic management system reduces the strain on cloud servers and the system becomes more reliable in real-time because the latency and bandwidth get reduced due to processing at the intermediate edge server.

    "title": "Uncertainty Aware Neural Network from Similarity and Sensitivity",
    "abstract": "Researchers have proposed several approaches for neural network (NN) based uncertainty quantification (UQ). However, most of the approaches are developed considering strong assumptions. Uncertainty quantification algorithms often perform poorly in an input domain and the reason for poor performance remains unknown. Therefore, we present a neural network training method that considers similar samples with sensitivity awareness in this paper. In the proposed NN training method for UQ, first, we train a shallow NN for the point prediction. Then, we compute the absolute differences between prediction and targets and train another NN for predicting those absolute differences or absolute errors. Domains with high average absolute errors represent a high uncertainty. In the next step, we select each sample in the training set one by one and compute both prediction and error sensitivities. Then we select similar samples with sensitivity consideration and save indexes of similar samples. The ranges of an input parameter become narrower when the output is highly sensitive to that parameter. After that, we construct initial uncertainty bounds (UB) by considering the distribution of sensitivity aware similar samples. Prediction intervals (PIs) from initial uncertainty bounds are larger and cover more samples than required. Therefore, we train bound correction NN. As following all the steps for finding UB for each sample requires a lot of computation and memory access, we train a UB computation NN. The UB computation NN takes an input sample and provides an uncertainty bound. The UB computation NN is the final product of the proposed approach. Scripts of the proposed method are available in the following GitHub repository: github.com/dipuk0506/UQ ",

We use recent changes to Twitter's verification process as a unique case study wherein the meaning of a verification indicator has rapidly shifted. The study consists of a U.S. demographically-representative survey of 300 respondents and quantitative and qualitative analyses of results, and an analysis of verified Twitter accounts sampled from a large-scale dataset of 15 million Tweets collected in October 2022. The survey addresses differences in user-perceived and actual requirements for verification marks on popular social media platforms, with a focus on evolving perceptions of verification marks on Twitter. We find that more than half of survey respondents misunderstood Twitter's criteria for assigning blue verification check marks to user accounts; more than 80% of survey respondents did not understand what differentiated blue check marks from gold and grey check marks. We also note interesting correlations between respondent age and perception of verification marks. From our qualitative analysis of verified user accounts, we find that cryptocurrency promotion accounts constitute significantly more Blue subscribers than our randomly sampled control dataset, indicating that a significant number of Blue users may be leveraging the confusion between legacy and Blue verification to promote their own commodities. Finally, we provide recommendations for improving verification indicators and processes on social media. ",

    "abstract": "A road is the skeleton of a city and is a fundamental and important geographical component. Currently, many countries have built geo-information databases and gathered large amounts of geographic data. However, with the extensive construction of infrastructure and rapid expansion of cities, automatic updating of road data is imperative to maintain the high quality of current basic geographic information. However, obtaining bi-phase images for the same area is difficult, and complex post-processing methods are required to update the existing databases.To solve these problems, we proposed a road detection method based on semi-supervised learning (SRUNet) specifically for road-updating applications; in this approach, historical road information was fused with the latest images to directly obtain the latest state of the road.Considering that the texture of a road is complex, a multi-branch network, named the Map Encoding Branch (MEB) was proposed for representation learning, where the Boundary Enhancement Module (BEM) was used to improve the accuracy of boundary prediction, and the Residual Refinement Module (RRM) was used to optimize the prediction results. Further, to fully utilize the limited amount of label information and to enhance the prediction accuracy on unlabeled images, we utilized the mean teacher framework as the basic semi-supervised learning framework and introduced Regional Contrast (ReCo) in our work to improve the model capacity for distinguishing between the characteristics of roads and background elements.We applied our method to two datasets. Our model can effectively improve the performance of a model with fewer labels. Overall, the proposed SRUNet can provide stable, up-to-date, and reliable prediction results for a wide range of road renewal tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG), which contains rich side information, becomes an essential part to boost the recommendation performance and improve its explainability. However, existing knowledge-aware recommendation methods directly perform information propagation on KG and user-item bipartite graph, ignoring the impacts of \\textit{task-irrelevant knowledge propagation} and \\textit{vulnerability to interaction noise}, which limits their performance. To solve these issues, we propose a robust knowledge-aware recommendation framework, called \\textit{Knowledge-refined Denoising Network} (KRDN), to prune the task-irrelevant knowledge associations and noisy implicit feedback simultaneously. KRDN consists of an adaptive knowledge refining strategy and a contrastive denoising mechanism, which are able to automatically distill high-quality KG triplets for aggregation and prune noisy implicit feedback respectively. Besides, we also design the self-adapted loss function and the gradient estimator for model optimization. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of KRDN over the state-of-the-art knowledge-aware methods like KGIN, MCCLK, and KGCL, and also outperform robust recommendation models like SGL and SimGCL.

    "abstract": "This paper provides a systematic study of the robust Stackelberg equilibrium (RSE), which naturally generalizes the widely adopted solution concept of the strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE). The RSE accounts for any possible up-to-$\\delta$ suboptimal follower responses in Stackelberg games and is adopted to improve the robustness of the leader's strategy. While a few variants of robust Stackelberg equilibrium have been considered in previous literature, the RSE solution concept we consider is importantly different -- in some sense, it relaxes previously studied robust Stackelberg strategies and is applicable to much broader sources of uncertainties. We provide a thorough investigation of several fundamental properties of RSE, including its utility guarantees, algorithmics, and learnability. We first show that the RSE we defined always exists and thus is well-defined. Then we characterize how the leader's utility in RSE changes with the robustness level considered. On the algorithmic side, we show that, in sharp contrast to the tractability of computing an SSE, it is NP-hard to obtain a fully polynomial approximation scheme (FPTAS) for any constant robustness level. Nevertheless, we develop a quasi-polynomial approximation scheme (QPTAS) for RSE. Finally, we examine the learnability of the RSE in a natural learning scenario, where both players' utilities are not known in advance, and provide almost tight sample complexity results on learning the RSE. As a corollary of this result, we also obtain an algorithm for learning SSE, which strictly improves a key result of Bai et al. in terms of both utility guarantee and computational efficiency. ",

While global minimization of the PDE residual over the network parameters works well for boundary value problems, catastrophic forgetting impairs the applicability of this approach to initial value problems (IVPs). In an alternative local-in-time approach, the optimization problem can be converted into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) on the network parameters and the solution propagated forward in time; however, we demonstrate that current methods based on this approach suffer from two key issues. First, following the ODE produces an uncontrolled growth in the conditioning of the problem, ultimately leading to unacceptably large numerical errors. Second, as the ODE methods scale cubically with the number of model parameters, they are restricted to small neural networks, significantly limiting their ability to represent intricate PDE initial conditions and solutions. Building on these insights, we develop Neural IVP, an ODE based IVP solver which prevents the network from getting ill-conditioned and runs in time linear in the number of parameters, enabling us to evolve the dynamics of challenging PDEs with neural networks.

Using neuroimaging while members of the same community viewed brief film clips, we found that more similar neural responding of participants was associated with a greater likelihood to share content. We then tested this relationship using behavioral studies and found (1) that people were particularly likely to share content about which they believed others in their social circles would share their viewpoints and (2) that this relationship is causal.

    "abstract": "Purpose: The importance of robust proton treatment planning to mitigate the impact of uncertainty is well understood. However, its computational cost grows with the number of uncertainty scenarios, prolonging the treatment planning process. We developed a fast and scalable distributed optimization platform that parallelizes this computation over the scenarios. Methods: We modeled the robust proton treatment planning problem as a weighted least-squares problem. To solve it, we employed an optimization technique called the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers with Barzilai-Borwein step size (ADMM-BB). We reformulated the problem in such a way as to split the main problem into smaller subproblems, one for each proton therapy uncertainty scenario. The subproblems can be solved in parallel, allowing the computational load to be distributed across multiple processors (e.g., CPU threads/cores). We evaluated ADMM-BB on four head-and-neck proton therapy patients, each with 13 scenarios accounting for 3 mm setup and 3:5% range uncertainties. We then compared the performance of ADMM-BB with projected gradient descent (PGD) applied to the same problem. Results: For each patient, ADMM-BB generated a robust proton treatment plan that satisfied all clinical criteria with comparable or better dosimetric quality than the plan generated by PGD. However, ADMM-BB's total runtime averaged about 6 to 7 times faster. This speedup increased with the number of scenarios. Conclusion: ADMM-BB is a powerful distributed optimization method that leverages parallel processing platforms, such as multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cloud servers, to accelerate the computationally intensive work of robust proton treatment planning. This results in 1) a shorter treatment planning process and 2) the ability to consider more uncertainty scenarios, which improves plan quality. ",

In this empirical study, we investigate the robustness and zero-shot generalizability of the SAM in the domain of robotic surgery in various settings of (i) prompted vs. unprompted; (ii) bounding box vs. points-based prompt; (iii) generalization under corruptions and perturbations with five severity levels; and (iv) state-of-the-art supervised model vs. SAM. We conduct all the observations with two well-known robotic instrument segmentation datasets of MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and 2018 challenges. Our extensive evaluation results reveal that although SAM shows remarkable zero-shot generalization ability with bounding box prompts, it struggles to segment the whole instrument with point-based prompts and unprompted settings. Furthermore, our qualitative figures demonstrate that the model either failed to predict the parts of the instrument mask (e.g., jaws, wrist) or predicted parts of the instrument as different classes in the scenario of overlapping instruments within the same bounding box or with the point-based prompt. In fact, it is unable to identify instruments in some complex surgical scenarios of blood, reflection, blur, and shade. Additionally, SAM is insufficiently robust to maintain high performance when subjected to various forms of data corruption. Therefore, we can argue that SAM is not ready for downstream surgical tasks without further domain-specific fine-tuning. ",

We analyze the global Twitter discourse on this event over a three week window around the collapse date over the years $2013$ to $2022$ by a mixture of network-theoretic quantitative and discourse-theoretic qualitative methods. In particular, key communicators and the community structure of the discourse participants are identified using a multilayer network modeling approach and the interpretative patterns of the key communicator's tweets of all years are analyzed using the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse. This combination of quantitative and qualitative methods reveals that the discourse is separated into three phases: reporting, reprocessing, and commemoration. These phases can be identified by the temporal evolution, network-structural properties, and the contentual analysis of the discourse. After the negotiation of the interpretative framework in the reprocessing phase, subsequent years are characterized by its commemorative repetition as well as resulting demands by different international actor groups despite highly fluctuating participants.

    "abstract": "Feature selection is one of the most relevant processes in any methodology for creating a statistical learning model. Generally, existing algorithms establish some criterion to select the most influential variables, discarding those that do not contribute any relevant information to the model. This methodology makes sense in a classical static situation where the joint distribution of the data does not vary over time. However, when dealing with real data, it is common to encounter the problem of the dataset shift and, specifically, changes in the relationships between variables (concept shift). In this case, the influence of a variable cannot be the only indicator of its quality as a regressor of the model, since the relationship learned in the traning phase may not correspond to the current situation. Thus, we propose a new feature selection methodology for regression problems that takes this fact into account, using Shapley values to study the effect that each variable has on the predictions. Five examples are analysed: four correspond to typical situations where the method matches the state of the art and one example related to electricity price forecasting where a concept shift phenomenon has occurred in the Iberian market. In this case the proposed algorithm improves the results significantly. ",

It is a tantalizing and important open problem in theoretical computer science whether the computation of a combinatorial shortest path between two vertices of the associahedron can be done in polynomial time, which is identical to the computation of the flip distance between two triangulations of a convex polygon, and the rotation distance between two rooted binary trees. Our result shows that a certain generalized approach to tackling this open problem is not promising. As a corollary of our theorem, we prove that the computation of a combinatorial shortest path between two vertices of a polymatroid base polytope cannot be done in polynomial time unless P = NP. Since a combinatorial shortest path on the matroid base polytope can be computed in polynomial time, our result reveals an unexpected contrast between matroids and polymatroids. ",

However, precise detection remains a considerable challenge due to subtle variabilities across subjects, channels and time points. Thus, capturing fine-grained, discriminative features of EEG patterns, which is associated with high-frequency textural information, is yet to be resolved. In this work, we propose Scattering Transformer (ScatterFormer), an invariant scattering transform-based hierarchical Transformer that specifically pays attention to subtle features. In particular, the disentangled frequency-aware attention (FAA) enables the Transformer to capture clinically informative high-frequency components, offering a novel clinical explainability based on visual encoding of multichannel EEG signals. Evaluations on two distinct tasks of epileptiform detection demonstrate the effectiveness our method. Our proposed model achieves median AUCROC and accuracy of 98.14%, 96.39% in patients with Rolandic epilepsy. On a neonatal seizure detection benchmark, it outperforms the state-of-the-art by 9% in terms of average AUCROC. ",

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal can accurately reflect the mental fatigue state and thus has been widely studied in drowsiness monitoring. However, the raw EEG data is inherently noisy and redundant, which is neglected by existing works that just use single-channel EEG data or full-head channel EEG data for model training, resulting in limited performance of driver drowsiness detection. In this paper, we are the first to propose an Interpretability-guided Channel Selection (ICS) framework for the driver drowsiness detection task. Specifically, we design a two-stage training strategy to progressively select the key contributing channels with the guidance of interpretability. We first train a teacher network in the first stage using full-head channel EEG data. Then we apply the class activation mapping (CAM) to the trained teacher model to highlight the high-contributing EEG channels and further propose a channel voting scheme to select the top N contributing EEG channels. Finally, we train a student network with the selected channels of EEG data in the second stage for driver drowsiness detection. Experiments are designed on a public dataset, and the results demonstrate that our method is highly applicable and can significantly improve the performance of cross-subject driver drowsiness detection.

    "abstract": "Epilepsy affects more than 50 million people worldwide, making it one of the world's most prevalent neurological diseases. The main symptom of epilepsy is seizures, which occur abruptly and can cause serious injury or death. The ability to predict the occurrence of an epileptic seizure could alleviate many risks and stresses people with epilepsy face. Most of the previous work is focused at seizure detection, we pivot our focus to seizure prediction problem. We formulate the problem of detecting preictal (or pre-seizure) with reference to normal EEG as a precursor to incoming seizure. To this end, we developed several supervised deep learning approaches model to identify preictal EEG from normal EEG. We further develop novel unsupervised deep learning approaches to train the models on only normal EEG, and detecting pre-seizure EEG as an anomalous event. These deep learning models were trained and evaluated on two large EEG seizure datasets in a person-specific manner. We found that both supervised and unsupervised approaches are feasible; however, their performance varies depending on the patient, approach and architecture. This new line of research has the potential to develop therapeutic interventions and save human lives. ",

    "title": "Deep sound-field denoiser: optically-measured sound-field denoising  using deep neural network",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a deep sound-field denoiser, a deep neural network (DNN) based denoising of optically measured sound-field images. Sound-field imaging using optical methods has gained considerable attention due to its ability to achieve high-spatial-resolution imaging of acoustic phenomena that conventional acoustic sensors cannot accomplish. However, the optically measured sound-field images are often heavily contaminated by noise because of the low sensitivity of optical interferometric measurements to airborne sound. Here, we propose a DNN-based sound-field denoising method. Time-varying sound-field image sequences are decomposed into harmonic complex-amplitude images by using a time-directional Fourier transform. The complex images are converted into two-channel images consisting of real and imaginary parts and denoised by a nonlinear-activation-free network. The network is trained on a sound-field dataset obtained from numerical acoustic simulations with randomized parameters. We compared the method with conventional ones, such as image filters and a spatiotemporal filter, on numerical and experimental data. The experimental data were measured by parallel phase-shifting interferometry and holographic speckle interferometry. The proposed deep sound-field denoiser significantly outperformed the conventional methods on both the numerical and experimental data. ",
