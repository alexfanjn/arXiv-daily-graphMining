    "title": "Neuro-symbolic model for cantilever beams damage detection",
    "abstract": "In the last decade, damage detection approaches swiftly changed from advanced signal processing methods to machine learning and especially deep learning models, to accurately and non-intrusively estimate the state of the beam structures. But as the deep learning models reached their peak performances, also their limitations in applicability and vulnerabilities were observed. One of the most important reason for the lack of trustworthiness in operational conditions is the absence of intrinsic explainability of the deep learning system, due to the encoding of the knowledge in tensor values and without the inclusion of logical constraints. In this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic model for the detection of damages in cantilever beams based on a novel cognitive architecture in which we join the processing power of convolutional networks with the interactive control offered by queries realized through the inclusion of real logic directly into the model. The hybrid discriminative model is introduced under the name Logic Convolutional Neural Regressor and it is tested on a dataset of values of the relative natural frequency shifts of cantilever beams derived from an original mathematical relation. While the obtained results preserve all the predictive capabilities of deep learning models, the usage of three distances as predicates for satisfiability, makes the system more trustworthy and scalable for practical applications. Extensive numerical and laboratory experiments were performed, and they all demonstrated the superiority of the hybrid approach, which can open a new path for solving the damage detection problem. ",

    "abstract": "Training and inference with graph neural networks (GNNs) on massive graphs has been actively studied since the inception of GNNs, owing to the widespread use and success of GNNs in applications such as recommendation systems and financial forensics. This paper is concerned with minibatch training and inference with GNNs that employ node-wise sampling in distributed settings, where the necessary partitioning of vertex features across distributed storage causes feature communication to become a major bottleneck that hampers scalability. To significantly reduce the communication volume without compromising prediction accuracy, we propose a policy for caching data associated with frequently accessed vertices in remote partitions. The proposed policy is based on an analysis of vertex-wise inclusion probabilities (VIP) during multi-hop neighborhood sampling, which may expand the neighborhood far beyond the partition boundaries of the graph. VIP analysis not only enables the elimination of the communication bottleneck, but it also offers a means to organize in-memory data by prioritizing GPU storage for the most frequently accessed vertex features. We present SALIENT++, which extends the prior state-of-the-art SALIENT system to work with partitioned feature data and leverages the VIP-driven caching policy. SALIENT++ retains the local training efficiency and scalability of SALIENT by using a deep pipeline and drastically reducing communication volume while consuming only a fraction of the storage required by SALIENT. We provide experimental results with the Open Graph Benchmark data sets and demonstrate that training a 3-layer GraphSAGE model with SALIENT++ on 8 single-GPU machines is 7.1 faster than with SALIENT on 1 single-GPU machine, and 12.7 faster than with DistDGL on 8 single-GPU machines.

    "abstract": "In recent years, several reaction templates-based and template-free approaches have been reported for single-step retrosynthesis prediction. Even though many of these approaches perform well from traditional data-driven metrics standpoint, there is a disconnect between model architectures used and underlying chemistry principles governing retrosynthesis. Here, we propose a novel chemistry-aware retrosynthesis prediction framework that combines powerful data-driven models with chemistry knowledge. We report a tree-to-sequence transformer architecture based on hierarchical SMILES grammar trees as input containing underlying chemistry information that is otherwise ignored by models based on purely SMILES-based representations. The proposed framework, grammar-based molecular attention tree transformer (G-MATT), achieves significant performance improvements compared to baseline retrosynthesis models. G-MATT achieves a top-1 accuracy of 51% (top-10 accuracy of 79.1%), invalid rate of 1.5%, and bioactive similarity rate of 74.8%. Further analyses based on attention maps demonstrate G-MATT's ability to preserve chemistry knowledge without having to use extremely complex model architectures. ",

    "abstract": "In the era of big data, there is an increasing need for healthcare providers, communities, and researchers to share data and collaborate to improve health outcomes, generate valuable insights, and advance research. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal law designed to protect sensitive health information by defining regulations for protected health information (PHI). However, it does not provide efficient tools for detecting or removing PHI before data sharing. One of the challenges in this area of research is the heterogeneous nature of PHI fields in data across different parties. This variability makes rule-based sensitive variable identification systems that work on one database fail on another. To address this issue, our paper explores the use of machine learning algorithms to identify sensitive variables in structured data, thus facilitating the de-identification process. We made a key observation that the distributions of metadata of PHI fields and non-PHI fields are very different. Based on this novel finding, we engineered over 30 features from the metadata of the original features and used machine learning to build classification models to automatically identify PHI fields in structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. We trained the model on a variety of large EHR databases from different data sources and found that our algorithm achieves 99% accuracy when detecting PHI-related fields for unseen datasets. The implications of our study are significant and can benefit industries that handle sensitive data. ",

This paper presents a new adversarial example detector that outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in identifying the latest adversarial attacks on image datasets. Specifically, we propose to use sentiment analysis for adversarial example detection, qualified by the progressively manifesting impact of an adversarial perturbation on the hidden-layer feature maps of a DNN under attack. Accordingly, we design a modularized embedding layer with the minimum learnable parameters to embed the hidden-layer feature maps into word vectors and assemble sentences ready for sentiment analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the new detector consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art detection algorithms in detecting the latest attacks launched against ResNet and Inception neutral networks on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets. The detector only has about 2 million parameters, and takes shorter than 4.6 milliseconds to detect an adversarial example generated by the latest attack models using a Tesla K80 GPU card. ",

    "abstract": "Link recommendation algorithms contribute to shaping human relations of billions of users worldwide in social networks. To maximize relevance, they typically propose connecting users that are similar to each other. This has been found to create information silos, exacerbating the isolation suffered by vulnerable salient groups and perpetuating societal stereotypes. To mitigate these limitations, a significant body of work has been devoted to the implementation of fair link recommendation methods. However, most approaches do not question the ultimate goal of link recommendation algorithms, namely the monetization of users' engagement in intricate business models of data trade. This paper advocates for a diversification of players and purposes of social network platforms, aligned with the pursue of social justice. To illustrate this conceptual goal, we present ERA-Link, a novel link recommendation algorithm based on spectral graph theory that counteracts the systemic societal discrimination suffered by vulnerable groups by explicitly implementing affirmative action. We propose four principled evaluation measures, derived from effective resistance, to quantitatively analyze the behavior of the proposed method and compare it to three alternative approaches. Experiments with synthetic and real-world networks illustrate how ERA-Link generates better outcomes according to all evaluation measures, not only for the vulnerable group but for the whole network. In other words, ERA-Link recommends connections that mitigate the structural discrimination of a vulnerable group, improves social cohesion and increases the social capital of all network users. Furthermore, by promoting the access to a diversity of users, ERA-Link facilitates innovation opportunities. ",

    "abstract": "The ability to faithfully represent real social networks is critical from the perspective of testing various what-if scenarios which are not feasible to be implemented in a real system as the system's state would be irreversibly changed. High fidelity simulators allow one to investigate the consequences of different actions before introducing them to the real system. For example, in the context of social systems, an accurate social network simulator can be a powerful tool used to guide policy makers, help companies plan their advertising campaigns or authorities to analyse fake news spread. In this study we explore different Social Network Simulators (SNSs) and assess to what extent they are able to mimic the real social networks. We conduct a critical review and assessment of existing Social Network Simulators under the Digital Twin-Oriented Modelling framework proposed in our previous study. We subsequently extend one of the most promising simulators from the evaluated ones, to facilitate generation of social networks of varied structural complexity levels. This extension brings us one step closer to a Digital Twin Oriented SNS (DT Oriented SNS). We also propose an approach to assess the similarity between real and simulated networks with the composite performance indexes based on both global and local structural measures, while taking runtime of the simulator as an indicator of its efficiency. We illustrate various characteristics of the proposed DT Oriented SNS using a well known Karate Club network as an example. While not considered to be of sufficient complexity, the simulator is intended as one of the first steps on a journey towards building a Digital Twin of a social network that perfectly mimics the reality.

In this paper, we introduce a context-aware OOD intent detection (Caro) framework to model multi-turn contexts in OOD intent detection tasks. Specifically, we follow the information bottleneck principle to extract robust representations from multi-turn dialogue contexts. Two different views are constructed for each input sample and the superfluous information not related to intent detection is removed using a multi-view information bottleneck loss. Moreover, we also explore utilizing unlabeled data in Caro. A two-stage training process is introduced to mine OOD samples from these unlabeled data, and these OOD samples are used to train the resulting model with a bootstrapping approach. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Caro establishes state-of-the-art performances on multi-turn OOD detection tasks by improving the F1-OOD score of over $29\\%$ compared to the previous best method.

In this paper we show how, given an edge-weighted graph with constant-size separators, we can support the following operations on it in time polylogarithmic in the number of vertices and the number of facilities placed on the vertices, where distances between vertices are measured with respect to the edge weights: Add (v, f, w, d) places a facility of weight w and with effect radius d onto vertex v. Remove (v, f) removes a facility f previously placed on v using Add from v.

For example, a large-area surveillance system is typically equipped with multi-modal sensors such as cameras and LIDARs and is required to execute deep learning algorithms for action, face, behavior, and object recognition. However, these systems face power and memory constraints due to their ubiquitous nature, making it crucial to optimize data processing, deep learning algorithm input, and model inference communication. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive optimization framework for a testbed comprising two Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and two NVIDIA Jetson devices. This framework efficiently manages multiple tasks (storage, processing, computation, transmission, inference) on heterogeneous nodes concurrently. It involves compressing and masking input image frames, identifying similar frames, and profiling devices to obtain boundary conditions for optimization.. Finally, we propose and optimize a novel parameter split-ratio, which indicates the proportion of the data required to be offloaded to another device while considering the networking bandwidth, busy factor, memory (CPU, GPU, RAM), and power constraints of the devices in the testbed. Our evaluations captured while executing multiple tasks (e.g., PoseNet, SegNet, ImageNet, DetectNet, DepthNet) simultaneously, reveal that executing 70% (split-ratio=70%) of the data on the auxiliary node minimizes the offloading latency by approx. 33% (18.7 ms/image to 12.5 ms/image) and the total operation time by approx. 47% (69.32s to 36.43s) compared to the baseline configuration (executing on the primary node).

Due to the benefits of the coding scheme, both theoretical and experimental analysis indicate that FedNC improves the performance of traditional FL in several important ways, including security, throughput, and robustness.

    "abstract": "Forecasting the scalable future states of surrounding traffic participants in complex traffic scenarios is a critical capability for autonomous vehicles, as it enables safe and feasible decision-making. Recent successes in learning-based prediction and planning have introduced two primary challenges: generating accurate joint predictions for the environment and integrating prediction guidance for planning purposes. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage integrated neural planning framework, termed OPGP, that incorporates joint prediction guidance from occupancy forecasting. The preliminary planning phase simultaneously outputs the predicted occupancy for various types of traffic actors based on imitation learning objectives, taking into account shared interactions, scene context, and actor dynamics within a unified Transformer structure. Subsequently, the transformed occupancy prediction guides optimization to further inform safe and smooth planning under Frenet coordinates. We train our planner using a large-scale, real-world driving dataset and validate it in open-loop configurations. Our proposed planner outperforms strong learning-based methods, exhibiting improved performance due to occupancy prediction guidance. ",

    "abstract": "Graphs model several real-world phenomena. With the growth of unstructured and semi-structured data, parallelization of graph algorithms is inevitable. Unfortunately, due to inherent irregularity of computation, memory access, and communication, graph algorithms are traditionally challenging to parallelize. To tame this challenge, several libraries, frameworks, and domain-specific languages (DSLs) have been proposed to reduce the parallel programming burden of the users, who are often domain experts. However, existing frameworks to model graph algorithms typically target a single architecture. In this paper, we present a graph DSL, named StarPlat, that allows programmers to specify graph algorithms in a high-level format, but generates code for three different backends from the same algorithmic specification. In particular, the DSL compiler generates OpenMP for multi-core, MPI for distributed, and CUDA for many-core GPUs. Since these three are completely different parallel programming paradigms, binding them together under the same language is challenging. We share our experience with the language design. Central to our compiler is an intermediate representation which allows a common representation of the high-level program, from which individual backend code generations begin. We demonstrate the expressiveness of StarPlat by specifying four graph algorithms: betweenness centrality computation, page rank computation, single-source shortest paths, and triangle counting. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the performance of the generated codes with that obtained with hand-crafted library codes. We find that the generated code is competitive to library-based codes in many cases. More importantly, we show the feasibility to generate efficient codes for different target architectures from the same algorithmic specification of graph algorithms. ",

Though recent pretraining language models achieve satisfying performances in many NLP tasks, they are still restricted by a pre-defined maximum length, making them challenging to be extended to longer sequences. So some recent works utilize hierarchies to model long sequences. However, most of them apply sequential models for upper hierarchies, suffering from long dependency issues. In this paper, we alleviate these issues through a graph-based method. We first chunk the sequence with a fixed length to model the sentence-level information. We then leverage graphs to model intra- and cross-sentence correlations with a new attention mechanism. Additionally, due to limited standard benchmarks for long document classification (LDC), we propose a new challenging benchmark, totaling six datasets with up to 53k samples and 4034 average tokens' length. Evaluation shows our model surpasses competitive baselines by 2.6% in F1 score, and 4.8% on the longest sequence dataset. Our method is shown to outperform hierarchical sequential models with better performance and scalability, especially for longer sequences. ",

When a fault occurs, only the measure values within specific attribute combinations are abnormal. Such attribute combinations are substantial clues to the underlying root causes and thus are called root causes of multidimensional data. This paper proposes a generic and robust root cause localization approach for multi-dimensional data, PSqueeze. We propose a generic property of root cause for multi-dimensional data, generalized ripple effect (GRE). Based on it, we propose a novel probabilistic cluster method and a robust heuristic search method. Moreover, we identify the importance of determining external root causes and propose an effective method for the first time in literature. Our experiments on two real-world datasets with 5400 faults show that the F1-score of PSqueeze outperforms baselines by 32.89%, while the localization time is around 10 seconds across all cases. The F1-score in determining external root causes of PSqueeze achieves 0.90. Furthermore, case studies in several production systems demonstrate that PSqueeze is helpful to fault diagnosis in the real world. ",

However, complex KBQA is a more challenging task that requires to perform complex multi-step reasoning. Recently, a new semantic parser called KoPL has been proposed to explicitly model the reasoning processes, which achieved the state-of-the-art on complex KBQA. In this paper, we further explore how to unlock the reasoning ability of semantic parsers by a simple proposed parse-execute-refine paradigm. We refine and improve the KoPL parser by demonstrating the executed intermediate reasoning steps to the KBQA model. We show that such simple strategy can significantly improve the ability of complex reasoning. Specifically, we propose three components: a parsing stage, an execution stage and a refinement stage, to enhance the ability of complex reasoning. The parser uses the KoPL to generate the transparent logical forms. Then, the execution stage aligns and executes the logical forms over knowledge base to obtain intermediate reasoning processes. Finally, the intermediate step-by-step reasoning processes are demonstrated to the KBQA model in the refinement stage. With the explicit reasoning processes, it is much easier to answer the complex questions. Experiments on benchmark dataset shows that the proposed PER-KBQA performs significantly better than the stage-of-the-art baselines on the complex KBQA. ",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in safety-critical systems has raised concerns about their potential for exhibiting ill-behaviors. While DNN verification and testing provide post hoc conclusions regarding unexpected behaviors, they do not prevent the erroneous behaviors from occurring. To address this issue, DNN repair/patch aims to eliminate unexpected predictions generated by defective DNNs. Two typical DNN repair paradigms are retraining and fine-tuning. However, existing methods focus on the high-level abstract interpretation or inference of state spaces, ignoring the underlying neurons' outputs. This renders patch processes computationally prohibitive and limited to piecewise linear (PWL) activation functions to great extent. To address these shortcomings, we propose a behavior-imitation based repair framework, BIRDNN, which integrates the two repair paradigms for the first time. BIRDNN corrects incorrect predictions of negative samples by imitating the closest expected behaviors of positive samples during the retraining repair procedure. For the fine-tuning repair process, BIRDNN analyzes the behavior differences of neurons on positive and negative samples to identify the most responsible neurons for the erroneous behaviors. To tackle more challenging domain-wise repair problems (DRPs), we synthesize BIRDNN with a domain behavior characterization technique to repair buggy DNNs in a probably approximated correct style. We also implement a prototype tool based on BIRDNN and evaluate it on ACAS Xu DNNs. Our experimental results show that BIRDNN can successfully repair buggy DNNs with significantly higher efficiency than state-of-the-art repair tools. Additionally, BIRDNN is highly compatible with different activation functions. ",

CNNs have many parameters and filters, with some having a larger impact on the performance than others. This means that networks may contain many unnecessary filters, increasing a CNN's computation and memory requirements while providing limited performance benefits. To make CNNs more efficient, we propose a pruning framework that eliminates filters with the highest \"commonality\". We measure this commonality using the graph-theoretic concept of \"centrality\". We hypothesise that a filter with a high centrality should be eliminated as it represents commonality and can be replaced by other filters without affecting the performance of a network much. An experimental evaluation of the proposed framework is performed on acoustic scene classification and audio tagging. On the DCASE 2021 Task 1A baseline network, our proposed method reduces computations per inference by 71\\% with 50\\% fewer parameters at less than a two percentage point drop in accuracy compared to the original network.

Despite all the benefits they offer, their misuse can lead to mishaps, and tackling them becomes more challenging particularly at night due to their small size and low visibility conditions. To overcome those limitations and improve the detection accuracy at night, we propose an object detector called Ghost Auto Anchor Network (GAANet) for infrared (IR) images. The detector uses a YOLOv5 core to address challenges in object detection for IR images, such as poor accuracy and a high false alarm rate caused by extended altitudes, poor lighting, and low image resolution. To improve performance, we implemented auto anchor calculation, modified the conventional convolution block to ghost-convolution, adjusted the input channel size, and used the AdamW optimizer. To enhance the precision of multiscale tiny object recognition, we also introduced an additional extra-small object feature extractor and detector. Experimental results in a custom IR dataset with multiple classes (birds, drones, planes, and helicopters) demonstrate that GAANet shows improvement compared to state-of-the-art detectors. In comparison to GhostNet-YOLOv5, GAANet has higher overall mean average precision (mAP@50), recall, and precision around 2.5\\%, 2.3\\%, and 1.4\\%, respectively.

When designing such rules, it is natural to think about the desired outcome state, i.e., the desired effect, rather than the specific steps required to achieve it; these steps may vary depending on the specific rule-application context. Existing graph-transformation approaches either require a separate rule to be written for every possible application context or lack the ability to constrain the maximal change that a rule will create. We introduce effect-oriented graph transformation, shifting the semantics of a rule from specifying actions to representing the desired effect. A single effect-oriented rule can encode a large number of induced classic rules. Which of the potential actions is executed depends on the application context; ultimately, all ways lead to Rome. If a graph element to be deleted (created) by a potential action is already absent (present), this action need not be performed because the desired outcome is already present. We formally define effect-oriented graph transformation, show how matches can be computed without explicitly enumerating all induced classic rules, and report on a prototypical implementation of effect-oriented graph transformation in Henshin.

Aiming to boost the computation efficiency and rendering quality of 3D scenes, a popular line of research maps the 3D coordinate system to another measuring system, e.g., 2D manifolds and hash tables, for modeling neural fields. The conversion of coordinate systems can be typically dubbed as gauge transformation, which is usually a pre-defined mapping function, e.g., orthogonal projection or spatial hash function. This begs a question: can we directly learn a desired gauge transformation along with the neural field in an end-to-end manner? In this work, we extend this problem to a general paradigm with a taxonomy of discrete & continuous cases, and develop an end-to-end learning framework to jointly optimize the gauge transformation and neural fields. To counter the problem that the learning of gauge transformations can collapse easily, we derive a general regularization mechanism from the principle of information conservation during the gauge transformation. To circumvent the high computation cost in gauge learning with regularization, we directly derive an information-invariant gauge transformation which allows to preserve scene information inherently and yield superior performance.

    "title": "Reducing Idleness in Financial Cloud via Multi-objective Evolutionary  Reinforcement Learning based Load Balancer",
    "abstract": "In recent years, various companies started to shift their data services from traditional data centers onto cloud. One of the major motivations is to save operation costs with the aid of cloud elasticity. This paper discusses an emerging need from financial services to reduce idle servers retaining very few user connections, without disconnecting them from the server side. This paper considers this need as a bi-objective online load balancing problem. A neural network based scalable policy is designed to route user requests to varied numbers of servers for elasticity. An evolutionary multi-objective training framework is proposed to optimize the weights of the policy. Not only the new objective of idleness is reduced by over 130% more than traditional industrial solutions, but the original load balancing objective is slightly improved. Extensive simulations help reveal the detailed applicability of the proposed method to the emerging problem of reducing idleness in financial services. ",

The construction is based on the observation that one can decode certain proper subsets of the coefficients of a polynomial with fewer evaluations than is necessary to interpolate the entire polynomial. These codes are proven to outperform, in terms of recovery threshold, the currently best-known polynomial codes for the inner product partition. We also present Generalized Gap Additive Secure Polynomial (GGASP) codes for the grid partition. These two families of codes are shown experimentally to perform favorably in terms of recovery threshold when compared to other comparable polynomials codes for SDMM. Both MP and GGASP codes achieve the recovery threshold of Entangled Polynomial Codes for robustness against stragglers, but MP codes can decode below this recovery threshold depending on the set of worker nodes which fails. The decoding complexity of MP codes is shown to be lower than other approaches in the literature, due to the user not being tasked with interpolating an entire polynomial. ",

The model relies on a single cue and a single encoding stream to correlate this representation with emotions. Our model competes with the state-of-the-art, achieving an mAP of 0.3002 on the EMOTIC dataset while also being capable of execution on consumer-grade hardware at approximately 90 frames per second.

The current work focuses on the problem of citation-worthiness identification. It is designed as the initial step in today's citation recommendation systems to lighten the burden of extracting an adequate set of citation contexts. To accomplish this, we introduce a labeled dataset of 178M sentences for citation-worthiness detection in the legal domain from the Caselaw Access Project (CAP).

To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages the power of ChatGPT for specific tasks, such as text classification, while improving its interpretability. The proposed framework conducts a knowledge graph extraction task to extract refined and structural knowledge from the raw data using ChatGPT. The rich knowledge is then converted into a graph, which is further used to train an interpretable linear classifier to make predictions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on four datasets. The result shows that our method can significantly improve the performance compared to directly utilizing ChatGPT for text classification tasks.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are capable of successfully performing many language processing tasks zero-shot (without the need for training data). If this capacity also applies to the coding of social phenomena like persuasiveness and political ideology, then LLMs could effectively transform Computational Social Science (CSS). This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 24 representative CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers' gold references. We conclude that today's LLMs can radically augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the hidden meaning behind text). In summary, LLMs can significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency of social science analysis in partnership with humans. ",

    "abstract": "Incorporating auxiliary modalities such as images into event detection models has attracted increasing interest over the last few years. The complexity of natural language in describing situations has motivated researchers to leverage the related visual context to improve event detection performance. However, current approaches in this area suffer from data scarcity, where a large amount of labelled text-image pairs are required for model training. Furthermore, limited access to the visual context at inference time negatively impacts the performance of such models, which makes them practically ineffective in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel domain-adaptive visually-fused event detection approach that can be trained on a few labelled image-text paired data points. Specifically, we introduce a visual imaginator method that synthesises images from text in the absence of visual context. Moreover, the imaginator can be customised to a specific domain. In doing so, our model can leverage the capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models and can be trained in a few-shot setting. This also allows for effective inference where only single-modality data (i.e. text) is available. The experimental evaluation on the benchmark M2E2 dataset shows that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, by up to 11 points. ",

With DP-OTA-FedAvg, the gradients are aligned by an alignment coefficient and aggregated over the air, and channel noise is employed to protect privacy. We aim to improve the learning performance by jointly designing the device scheduling, alignment coefficient, and the number of aggregation rounds of federated averaging (FedAvg) subject to sum power and privacy constraints. We first present the privacy analysis based on differential privacy (DP) to quantify the impact of the alignment coefficient on privacy preservation in each communication round. Furthermore, to study how the device scheduling, alignment coefficient, and the number of the global aggregation affect the learning process, we conduct the convergence analysis of DP-OTA-FedAvg in the cases of convex and non-convex loss functions. Based on these analytical results, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the optimality gap of the DP-OTA-FedAvg subject to limited sum power and privacy budgets. The problem is solved by decoupling it into two sub-problems. Given the number of communication rounds, we conclude the relationship between the number of scheduled devices and the alignment coefficient, which offers a set of potential optimal solution pairs of device scheduling and the alignment coefficient. Thanks to the reduced search space, the optimal solution can be efficiently obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed policy is validated through simulations. ",

Nevertheless, we observe that several important issues largely remain open. On the one hand, graph clustering from the geometric perspective is appealing but has rarely been touched before, as it lacks a promising space for geometric clustering. On the other hand, contrastive learning boosts the deep graph clustering but usually struggles in either graph augmentation or hard sample mining. To bridge this gap, we rethink the problem of graph clustering from geometric perspective and, to the best of our knowledge, make the first attempt to introduce a heterogeneous curvature space to graph clustering problem. Correspondingly, we present a novel end-to-end contrastive graph clustering model named CONGREGATE, addressing geometric graph clustering with Ricci curvatures. To support geometric clustering, we construct a theoretically grounded Heterogeneous Curvature Space where deep representations are generated via the product of the proposed fully Riemannian graph convolutional nets. Thereafter, we train the graph clusters by an augmentation-free reweighted contrastive approach where we pay more attention to both hard negatives and hard positives in our curvature space. Empirical results on real-world graphs show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors. ",

    "abstract": "High-density, unsignalized intersection has always been a bottleneck of efficiency and safety. The emergence of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) results in a mixed traffic condition, further increasing the complexity of the transportation system. Against this background, this paper aims to study the intricate and heterogeneous interaction of vehicles and conflict resolution at the high-density, mixed, unsignalized intersection. Theoretical insights about the interaction between CAVs and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) and the cooperation of CAVs are synthesized, based on which a novel cooperative decision-making framework in heterogeneous mixed traffic is proposed. Normalized Cooperative game is concatenated with Level-k game (NCL game) to generate a system optimal solution. Then Lattice planner generates the optimal and collision-free trajectories for CAVs. To reproduce HVs in mixed traffic, interactions from naturalistic human driving data are extracted as prior knowledge. Non-cooperative game and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) are integrated to mimic the decision making of heterogeneous HVs. Finally, three cases are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, including the comparative analysis with different methods, the case study under different Rates of Penetration (ROP) and the interaction analysis with heterogeneous HVs. It is found that the proposed cooperative decision-making framework is beneficial to the driving conflict resolution and the traffic efficiency improvement of the mixed unsignalized intersection. Besides, due to the consideration of driving heterogeneity, better human-machine interaction and cooperation can be realized in this paper. ",

The latent space is structured to dissociate the latent dynamical factors that are shared between the modalities from those that are specific to each modality. A static latent variable is also introduced to encode the information that is constant over time within an audiovisual speech sequence. The model is trained in an unsupervised manner on an audiovisual emotional speech dataset, in two stages. In the first stage, a vector quantized VAE (VQ-VAE) is learned independently for each modality, without temporal modeling. The second stage consists in learning the MDVAE model on the intermediate representation of the VQ-VAEs before quantization. The disentanglement between static versus dynamical and modality-specific versus modality-common information occurs during this second training stage. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate how audiovisual speech latent factors are encoded in the latent space of MDVAE. These experiments include manipulating audiovisual speech, audiovisual facial image denoising, and audiovisual speech emotion recognition. The results show that MDVAE effectively combines the audio and visual information in its latent space. They also show that the learned static representation of audiovisual speech can be used for emotion recognition with few labeled data, and with better accuracy compared with unimodal baselines and a state-of-the-art supervised model based on an audiovisual transformer architecture.

While significant advancements have been achieved recently, there are still two broad limitations: (1) The explicit information mining for significant guiding semantics concealed in both vision and language is still under-explored; (2) The previously structured map method provides the average historical appearance of visited nodes, while it ignores distinctive contributions of various images and potent information retention in the reasoning process. This work proposes a dual semantic-aware recurrent global-adaptive network (DSRG) to address the above problems. First, DSRG proposes an instruction-guidance linguistic module (IGL) and an appearance-semantics visual module (ASV) for boosting vision and language semantic learning respectively. For the memory mechanism, a global adaptive aggregation module (GAA) is devised for explicit panoramic observation fusion, and a recurrent memory fusion module (RMF) is introduced to supply implicit temporal hidden states.

Our findings indicate that: (1) instance hardness in both classes displays a right-skewed distribution, with the defective class exhibiting a more scattered distribution; (2) class overlap is the primary factor influencing instance hardness and can be characterized through feature, structural, instance, and multiresolution overlap; (3) no universal preprocessing technique is applicable to all datasets, and it may not consistently reduce data complexity, fortunately, dataset complexity measures can help identify suitable techniques for specific datasets; (4) integrating data complexity information into the learning process can enhance an algorithm's learning capacity.

Its probability distribution is inferred by means of the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method applied to clinical data. The resulting model is patient-specific and can be employed for predicting the disease's future development. Forward uncertainty quantification techniques (Monte Carlo and sparse grid stochastic collocation) are applied with the aim of quantifying the impact of the variability of the reaction coefficient on the progression of protein accumulation within the next 20 years.

    "abstract": "Verifying the robustness of machine learning models against evasion attacks at test time is an important research problem. Unfortunately, prior work established that this problem is NP-hard for decision tree ensembles, hence bound to be intractable for specific inputs. In this paper, we identify a restricted class of decision tree ensembles, called large-spread ensembles, which admit a security verification algorithm running in polynomial time. We then propose a new approach called verifiable learning, which advocates the training of such restricted model classes which are amenable for efficient verification. We show the benefits of this idea by designing a new training algorithm that automatically learns a large-spread decision tree ensemble from labelled data, thus enabling its security verification in polynomial time. Experimental results on publicly available datasets confirm that large-spread ensembles trained using our algorithm can be verified in a matter of seconds, using standard commercial hardware. Moreover, large-spread ensembles are more robust than traditional ensembles against evasion attacks, while incurring in just a relatively small loss of accuracy in the non-adversarial setting. ",

Continual Learning (CL) approaches seek to bridge this gap by facilitating the transfer of knowledge to both previous tasks (backward transfer) and future ones (forward transfer) during training. Recent research has shown that self-supervision can produce versatile models that can generalize well to diverse downstream tasks. However, contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL), a popular self-supervision technique, has limited effectiveness in online CL (OCL). OCL only permits one iteration of the input dataset, and CSSL's low sample efficiency hinders its use on the input data-stream. In this work, we propose Continual Learning via Equivariant Regularization (CLER), an OCL approach that leverages equivariant tasks for self-supervision, avoiding CSSL's limitations. Our method represents the first attempt at combining equivariant knowledge with CL and can be easily integrated with existing OCL methods. Extensive ablations shed light on how equivariant pretext tasks affect the network's information flow and its impact on CL dynamics. ",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained transformers are popular in state-of-the-art dialogue generation (DG) systems. Such language models are, however, vulnerable to various adversarial samples as studied in traditional tasks such as text classification, which inspires our curiosity about their robustness in DG systems. One main challenge of attacking DG models is that perturbations on the current sentence can hardly degrade the response accuracy because the unchanged chat histories are also considered for decision-making. Instead of merely pursuing pitfalls of performance metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, we observe that crafting adversarial samples to force longer generation outputs benefits attack effectiveness -- the generated responses are typically irrelevant, lengthy, and repetitive. To this end, we propose a white-box multi-objective attack method called DGSlow. Specifically, DGSlow balances two objectives -- generation accuracy and length, via a gradient-based multi-objective optimizer and applies an adaptive searching mechanism to iteratively craft adversarial samples with only a few modifications. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DGSlow could significantly degrade state-of-the-art DG models with a higher success rate than traditional accuracy-based methods. Besides, our crafted sentences also exhibit strong transferability in attacking other models. ",

Discovering causal relationships in time-series health data is even more challenging when relationships change over the course of a disease, such as medications that are most effective early on or for individuals with severe disease. Stage variables such as weeks of pregnancy, disease stages, or biomarkers like HbA1c, can influence what causal relationships are true for a patient. However, causal inference within each stage is often not possible due to limited amounts of data, and combining all data risks incorrect or missed inferences. To address this, we propose Causal Discovery with Stage Variables (CDSV), which uses stage variables to reweight data from multiple time-series while accounting for different causal relationships in each stage. In simulated data, CDSV discovers more causes with fewer false discoveries compared to baselines, in eICU it has a lower FDR than baselines, and in MIMIC-III it discovers more clinically relevant causes of high blood pressure.

We find evidence of un-equal SP access and participation. In particular, advice from intimate and social connections (ISC) is more prevalent among women, while online content is preferred by men. ISC do not closely associate with nor predict the use of SP technologies, whereas online sources (such as online forums, reviews, specialist pages and technology adverts) and training do. Men are also more likely to use multiple advice sources, that enhances the likelihood of using SP technologies. Women are motivated to approach ISC due to their perceptions of the advisor (such as IT related expertise, experience and trustworthiness) while men approach ISC to evaluate options and seek reassurance for their own practices.

However, often it is important to know whether a given property holds globally for the whole input domain, and if not then for what proportion of the input the property is true. While exact preimage generation can construct an equivalent representation of neural networks that can aid such (quantitative) global robustness verification, it is intractable at scale. In this work, we propose an efficient and practical anytime algorithm for generating symbolic under-approximations of the preimage of neural networks based on linear relaxation. Our algorithm iteratively minimizes the volume approximation error by partitioning the input region into subregions, where the neural network relaxation bounds become tighter. We further employ sampling and differentiable approximations to the volume in order to prioritize regions to split and optimize the parameters of the relaxation, leading to faster improvement and more compact under-approximations. Evaluation results demonstrate that our approach is able to generate preimage approximations significantly faster than exact methods and scales to neural network controllers for which exact preimage generation is intractable. We also demonstrate an application of our approach to quantitative global verification. ",

Our paper proposes an alternative method called LMEye, a play-plug-in Interactive Perception Network for Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to improve the accuracy of image understanding for the LVLM. Previous methods that infuse visual information into LLMs utilize a static visual mapping network, but lack dynamic interaction between the LLMs and visual information. LMEye addresses this issue by allowing the LLM to incorporate the visual information that aligned with human instruction. Specifically, the LMEye network consists of a static visual mapping network to provide the basic perception of an image to LLMs. Then, it also contains additional linear layers responsible for acquiring requests from LLMs, decomposing image features, and transmitting the interleaved information to LLMs, respectively. In this way, LLMs act to be in charge of understanding human instructions, sending it to the interactive perception network, and generating the response based on the interleaved multimodal information. We evaluate LMEye through extensive experiments on multimodal question answering and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that it significantly improves the zero-shot performance of LLMs on multimodal tasks compared to previous methods.

Although deep learning-based 3D object detection methods have achieved great success in recent years, current methods still struggle on small objects due to weak geometric information. With in-depth study, we find increasing the spatial resolution of the feature maps significantly boosts the performance of 3D small object detection. And more interestingly, though the computational overhead increases dramatically with resolution, the growth mainly comes from the upsampling operation of the decoder. Inspired by this, we present a high-resolution multi-level detector with dynamic spatial pruning named DSPDet3D, which detects objects from large to small by iterative upsampling and meanwhile prunes the spatial representation of the scene at regions where there is no smaller object to be detected in higher resolution. As the 3D detector only needs to predict sparse bounding boxes, pruning a large amount of uninformative features does not degrade the detection performance but significantly reduces the computational cost of upsampling. In this way, our DSPDet3D achieves high accuracy on small object detection while requiring even less memory footprint and inference time. On ScanNet and TO-SCENE dataset, our method improves the detection performance of small objects to a new level while achieving leading inference speed among all mainstream indoor 3D object detection methods.

By allowing each node in the network to have its own level of approximation, one can focus on improving the accuracy of MP approaches in a targeted manner. We perform a systematic analysis of 109 real-world networks and show that our node-based MP approximation is able to increase both the accuracy and speed of traditional MP approaches. We find that, compared to conventional message passing, a heterogeneous approach based on a simple heuristic is more accurate in 81% of tested networks, faster in 64% of cases, and both more accurate and faster in 49% of cases.

Notions such as the core of a graph and the homomorphism order on cores are then extended to maps. We also develop a purely combinatorial framework for various topological features of a map such as the contractibility of closed walks, which in particular allows us to characterize map cores. We then show that the poset of map cores ordered by the existence of a homomorphism is connected and, in contrast to graph homomorphisms, does not contain any dense interval (so it is not universal for countable posets). Finally, we give examples of a pair of cores with an infinite number of cores between them, an infinite chain of gaps, and arbitrarily large antichains with a common homomorphic image. ",

For problems of interest, FTQC will require millions of physical qubits with long coherence times, high-fidelity gates, and compact sizes to surpass classical systems. Just as heterogeneous specialization has offered scaling benefits in classical computing, it is likewise gaining interest in FTQC. However, systematic use of heterogeneity in either hardware or software elements of FTQC systems remains a serious challenge due to the vast design space and variable physical constraints. This paper meets the challenge of making heterogeneous FTQC design practical by introducing HetArch, a toolbox for designing heterogeneous quantum systems, and using it to explore heterogeneous design scenarios. Using a hierarchical approach, we successively break quantum algorithms into smaller operations (akin to classical application kernels), thus greatly simplifying the design space and resulting tradeoffs. Specializing to superconducting systems, we then design optimized heterogeneous hardware composed of varied superconducting devices, abstracting physical constraints into design rules that enable devices to be assembled into standard cells optimized for specific operations. Finally, we provide a heterogeneous design space exploration framework which reduces the simulation burden by a factor of 10^4 or more and allows us to characterize optimal design points. We use these techniques to design superconducting quantum modules for entanglement distillation, error correction, and code teleportation, reducing error rates by 2.6x, 10.7x, and 3.0x compared to homogeneous systems.

Using the notion of entropy, which measures the quantity of information, we show that factors with low centrality have more useful information and less noise for the forecast asset price than those with high centrality do.

    "title": "Time-weighted Frequency Domain Audio Representation with GMM Estimator  for Anomalous Sound Detection",
    "abstract": "Although deep learning is the mainstream method in unsupervised anomalous sound detection, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with statistical audio frequency representation as input can achieve comparable results with much lower model complexity and fewer parameters. Existing statistical frequency representations, e.g, the log-Mel spectrogram's average or maximum over time, do not always work well for different machines. This paper presents Time-Weighted Frequency Domain Representation (TWFR) with the GMM method (TWFR-GMM) for anomalous sound detection. The TWFR is a generalized statistical frequency domain representation that can adapt to different machine types, using the global weighted ranking pooling over time-domain. This allows GMM estimator to recognize anomalies, even under domain-shift conditions, as visualized with a Mahalanobis distance-based metric. Experiments on DCASE 2022 Challenge Task2 dataset show that our method has better detection performance than recent deep learning methods. TWFR-GMM is the core of our submission that achieved the 3rd place in DCASE 2022 Challenge Task2. ",

    "title": "AsConvSR: Fast and Lightweight Super-Resolution Network with Assembled  Convolutions",
    "abstract": "In recent years, videos and images in 720p (HD), 1080p (FHD) and 4K (UHD) resolution have become more popular for display devices such as TVs, mobile phones and VR. However, these high resolution images cannot achieve the expected visual effect due to the limitation of the internet bandwidth, and bring a great challenge for super-resolution networks to achieve real-time performance. Following this challenge, we explore multiple efficient network designs, such as pixel-unshuffle, repeat upscaling, and local skip connection removal, and propose a fast and lightweight super-resolution network. Furthermore, by analyzing the applications of the idea of divide-and-conquer in super-resolution, we propose assembled convolutions which can adapt convolution kernels according to the input features. Experiments suggest that our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art efficient super-resolution models, and achieves optimal results in terms of runtime and quality. In addition, our method also wins the first place in NTIRE 2023 Real-Time Super-Resolution - Track 1 ($\\times$2).

    "title": "Sparsifying Bayesian neural networks with latent binary variables and  normalizing flows",
    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are powerful machine learning methods used in many modern applications such as facial recognition, machine translation, and cancer diagnostics. A common issue with ANNs is that they usually have millions or billions of trainable parameters, and therefore tend to overfit to the training data. This is especially problematic in applications where it is important to have reliable uncertainty estimates. Bayesian neural networks (BNN) can improve on this, since they incorporate parameter uncertainty. In addition, latent binary Bayesian neural networks (LBBNN) also take into account structural uncertainty by allowing the weights to be turned on or off, enabling inference in the joint space of weights and structures. In this paper, we will consider two extensions to the LBBNN method: Firstly, by using the local reparametrization trick (LRT) to sample the hidden units directly, we get a more computationally efficient algorithm. More importantly, by using normalizing flows on the variational posterior distribution of the LBBNN parameters, the network learns a more flexible variational posterior distribution than the mean field Gaussian. Experimental results show that this improves predictive power compared to the LBBNN method, while also obtaining more sparse networks. We perform two simulation studies. In the first study, we consider variable selection in a logistic regression setting, where the more flexible variational distribution leads to improved results. In the second study, we compare predictive uncertainty based on data generated from two-dimensional Gaussian distributions. Here, we argue that our Bayesian methods lead to more realistic estimates of predictive uncertainty. ",

    "abstract": "Optical neural networks (ONNs) enable high speed parallel and energy efficient processing compared to conventional digital electronic counterparts. However, realizing large scale systems is an open problem. Among various integrated and non-integrated ONNs, free-space diffractive ONNs benefit from a large number of pixels of spatial light modulators to realize millions of neurons. However, a significant fraction of computation time and energy is consumed by the nonlinear activation function that is typically implemented using a camera sensor. Here, we propose a novel surface-normal photodetector (SNPD) with a nonlinear response to replace the camera sensor that enables about three orders of magnitude faster (5.7 us response time) and more energy efficient (less than 10 nW/pixel) response. Direct efficient vertical optical coupling, polarization insensitivity, inherent nonlinearity with no control electronics, low optical power requirements, and the possibility of implementing large scale arrays make the SNPD a promising nonlinear activation function for diffractive ONNs. To show the applicability, successful classification simulation of MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets using the measured response of SNPD with accuracy comparable to that of an ideal ReLU function are demonstrated.
