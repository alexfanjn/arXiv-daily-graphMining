    "abstract": "Data trading has been hindered by privacy concerns associated with user-owned data and the infinite reproducibility of data, making it challenging for data owners to retain exclusive rights over their data once it has been disclosed. Traditional data pricing models relied on uniform pricing or subscription-based models. However, with the development of Privacy-Preserving Computing techniques, the market can now protect the privacy and complete transactions using progressively disclosed information, which creates a technical foundation for generating greater social welfare through data usage. In this study, we propose a novel approach to modeling multi-round data trading with progressively disclosed information using a matchmaking-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) and introduce a Social Welfare-optimized Data Pricing Mechanism (SWDPM) to find optimal pricing strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to model multi-round data trading with progressively disclosed information. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the SWDPM can increase social welfare 3 times by up to 54\\% in trading feasibility, 43\\% in trading efficiency, and 25\\% in trading fairness by encouraging better matching of demand and price negotiation among traders.

    "abstract": "Efficiently training a multi-task neural solver for various combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) has been less studied so far. In this paper, we propose a general and efficient training paradigm based on multi-armed bandits to deliver a unified multi-task neural solver. To this end, we resort to the theoretical loss decomposition for multiple tasks under an encoder-decoder framework, which enables more efficient training via proper bandit task-sampling algorithms through an intra-task influence matrix. Our method achieves much higher overall performance with either limited training budgets or the same training epochs, compared to standard training schedules, which can be promising for advising efficient training of other multi-task large models. Additionally, the influence matrix can provide empirical evidence of some common practices in the area of learning to optimize, which in turn supports the validity of our approach. ",

Prediction quality can be improved by calibrating the scoring model, typically by adjusting the prediction thresholds using manually annotated examples. In this paper, we attempt for the first time cold-start calibration for KGC, where no annotated examples exist initially for calibration, and only a limited number of tuples can be selected for annotation. Our new method ACTC finds good per-relation thresholds efficiently based on a limited set of annotated tuples. Additionally to a few annotated tuples, ACTC also leverages unlabeled tuples by estimating their correctness with Logistic Regression or Gaussian Process classifiers. We also experiment with different methods for selecting candidate tuples for annotation: density-based and random selection. Experiments with five scoring models and an oracle annotator show an improvement of 7% points when using ACTC in the challenging setting with an annotation budget of only 10 tuples, and an average improvement of 4% points over different budgets.

    "abstract": "Adaptive learning is an area of educational technology that consists in delivering personalized learning experiences to address the unique needs of each learner. An important subfield of adaptive learning is learning path personalization: it aims at designing systems that recommend sequences of educational activities to maximize students' learning outcomes. Many machine learning approaches have already demonstrated significant results in a variety of contexts related to learning path personalization. However, most of them were designed for very specific settings and are not very reusable. This is accentuated by the fact that they often rely on non-scalable models, which are unable to integrate new elements after being trained on a specific set of educational resources. In this paper, we introduce a flexible and scalable approach towards the problem of learning path personalization, which we formalize as a reinforcement learning problem. Our model is a sequential recommender system based on a graph neural network, which we evaluate on a population of simulated learners. Our results demonstrate that it can learn to make good recommendations in the small-data regime. ",

In this study we conduct a comprehensive robustness investigation of SAM under diverse real-world conditions. Our experiments encompass a wide range of image perturbations. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAM's performance generally declines under perturbed images, with varying degrees of vulnerability across different perturbations. By customizing prompting techniques and leveraging domain knowledge based on the unique characteristics of each dataset, the model's resilience to these perturbations can be enhanced, addressing dataset-specific challenges.

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a global health priority, especially in low- and-middle-income countries, where over 50% of premature deaths are attributed to high blood glucose. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using Community Health Worker (CHW) programs to provide affordable and culturally tailored solutions for early detection and management of diabetes. Yet, scalable models to design and implement CHW programs while accounting for screening, management, and patient enrollment decisions have not been proposed. We introduce an optimization framework to determine personalized CHW visits that maximize glycemic control at a community-level. Our framework explicitly models the trade-off between screening new patients and providing management visits to individuals who are already enrolled in treatment. We account for patients' motivational states, which affect their decisions to enroll or drop out of treatment and, therefore, the effectiveness of the intervention. We incorporate these decisions by modeling patients as utility-maximizing agents within a bi-level provider problem that we solve using approximate dynamic programming. By estimating patients' health and motivational states, our model builds visit plans that account for patients' tradeoffs when deciding to enroll in treatment, leading to reduced dropout rates and improved resource allocation. We apply our approach to generate CHW visit plans using operational data from a social enterprise serving low-income neighborhoods in urban areas of India. Through extensive simulation experiments, we find that our framework requires up to 73.4% less capacity than the best naive policy to achieve the same performance in terms of glycemic control. Our experiments also show that our solution algorithm can improve upon naive policies by up to 124.5% using the same CHW capacity. ",

    "abstract": "In Islam, readers must apply a set of pronunciation rules called Tajweed rules to recite the Quran in the same way that the angel Jibrael taught the Prophet, Muhammad. The traditional process of learning the correct application of these rules requires a human who must have a license and great experience to detect mispronunciation. Due to the increasing number of Muslims around the world, the number of Tajweed teachers is not enough nowadays for daily recitation practice for every Muslim. Therefore, lots of work has been done for automatic Tajweed rules' mispronunciation detection to help readers recite Quran correctly in an easier way and shorter time than traditional learning ways. All previous works have three common problems. First, most of them focused on machine learning algorithms only. Second, they used private datasets with no benchmark to compare with. Third, they did not take into consideration the sequence of input data optimally, although the speech signal is time series. To overcome these problems, we proposed a solution that consists of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks which use the time series, to detect mispronunciation in Tajweed rules. In addition, our experiments were performed on a public dataset, the QDAT dataset, which contains more than 1500 voices of the correct and incorrect recitation of three Tajweed rules (Separate stretching , Tight Noon , and Hide ). To the best of our knowledge, the QDAT dataset has not been used by any research paper yet. We compared the performance of the proposed LSTM model with traditional machine learning algorithms used in SoTA. The LSTM model with time series showed clear superiority over traditional machine learning. The accuracy achieved by LSTM on the QDAT dataset was 96%, 95%, and 96% for the three rules (Separate stretching, Tight Noon, and Hide), respectively. ",

Most existing GCNs are limited to deal with documents included in a pre-defined graph, i.e., it cannot be generalized to out-of-graph documents. To address this issue, we propose to transform the document graph into a word graph, to decouple data samples (i.e., documents in training and test sets) and a GCN model by using a document-independent graph. Such word-level GCN could therefore naturally inference out-of-graph documents in an inductive way. The proposed Word-level Graph (WGraph) can not only implicitly learning word presentation with commonly-used word co-occurrences in corpora, but also incorporate extra global semantic dependency derived from inter-document relationships (e.g., literature citations). An inductive Word-grounded Graph Convolutional Network (WGCN) is proposed to learn word and document representations based on WGraph in a supervised manner. Experiments on text classification with and without citation networks evidence that the proposed WGCN model outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. ",

This leads to loss of pertinent information related to temporal relationships, rendering actions such as `enter' and `leave' to be indistinguishable. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Latent Time Navigation (LTN), a time-parameterized contrastive learning strategy that is streamlined to capture fine-grained motions. Specifically, we maximize the representation similarity between different video segments from one video, while maintaining their representations time-aware along a subspace of the latent representation code including an orthogonal basis to represent temporal changes. Our extensive experimental analysis suggests that learning video representations by LTN consistently improves performance of action classification in fine-grained and human-oriented tasks (e.g., on Toyota Smarthome dataset). In addition, we demonstrate that our proposed model, when pre-trained on Kinetics-400, generalizes well onto the unseen real world video benchmark datasets UCF101 and HMDB51, achieving state-of-the-art performance in action recognition.

The recent proliferation of mental health discussions on social media platforms presents research opportunities to investigate mental health and potentially detect instances of mental illness. However, existing depression detection methods are constrained due to two major limitations: (1) the reliance on feature engineering and (2) the lack of consideration for time-varying factors. Specifically, these methods require extensive feature engineering and domain knowledge, which heavily rely on the amount, quality, and type of user-generated content. Moreover, these methods ignore the important impact of time-varying factors on depression detection, such as the dynamics of linguistic patterns and interpersonal interactive behaviors over time on social media (e.g., replies, mentions, and quote-tweets). To tackle these limitations, we propose an early depression detection framework, ContrastEgo treats each user as a dynamic time-evolving attributed graph (ego-network) and leverages supervised contrastive learning to maximize the agreement of users' representations at different scales while minimizing the agreement of users' representations to differentiate between depressed and control groups. ContrastEgo embraces four modules, (1) constructing users' heterogeneous interactive graphs, (2) extracting the representations of users' interaction snapshots using graph neural networks, (3) modeling the sequences of snapshots using attention mechanism, and (4) depression detection using contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on Twitter data demonstrate that ContrastEgo significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of all the effectiveness metrics in various experimental settings.

However, the extent to which LLMs can comprehend user preferences based on their previous behavior remains an emerging and still unclear research question. Traditionally, Collaborative Filtering (CF) has been the most effective method for these tasks, predominantly relying on the extensive volume of rating data. In contrast, LLMs typically demand considerably less data while maintaining an exhaustive world knowledge about each item, such as movies or products. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of both CF and LLMs within the classic task of user rating prediction, which involves predicting a user's rating for a candidate item based on their past ratings. We investigate various LLMs in different sizes, ranging from 250M to 540B parameters and evaluate their performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. We conduct comprehensive analysis to compare between LLMs and strong CF methods, and find that zero-shot LLMs lag behind traditional recommender models that have the access to user interaction data, indicating the importance of user interaction data. However, through fine-tuning, LLMs achieve comparable or even better performance with only a small fraction of the training data, demonstrating their potential through data efficiency. ",

In this work, we instead focus on predicting a higher level plan representation for one such embodied task completion dataset - TEACh, under the assumption that techniques for high-level plan prediction from natural language are expected to be more transferable to physical robot systems. We demonstrate that better plans can be predicted using multimodal context, and that plan prediction and plan execution modules are likely dependent on each other and hence it may not be ideal to fully decouple them. Further, we benchmark execution of oracle plans to quantify the scope for improvement in plan prediction models. ",

    "abstract": "Coded caching, introduced by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN), is a model where a server broadcasts multicast packets to users with a local cache that is leveraged so as to reduce the peak network communication load. The original MAN model does not consider missing demands (i.e., some users may not request a file) or privacy issues (i.e., decoding the multicast packets may expose the users' demands). The former issue was captured by the hotplug model with offline users, where the server starts sending multicast packets after having received a certain number of file requests. The latter issue was addressed by devoting part of the cache to store privacy keys to help users decode their requested file while remaining completely ignorant about the demands of the remaining users. This paper investigates the problem of private demands against colluding users in the hotplug model with offline users. Two achievable schemes are proposed based on Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. They achieve lower subpacketization, and lower load in the small memory regime compared to baseline schemes that trivially include demand privacy or offline users in known schemes. ",

    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained language models have shown outstanding performance in a variety of NLP tasks. However, they are also known to be significantly brittle against specifically crafted adversarial examples, leading to increasing interest in probing the adversarial robustness of NLP systems. We introduce RSMI, a novel two-stage framework that combines randomized smoothing (RS) with masked inference (MI) to improve the adversarial robustness of NLP systems. RS transforms a classifier into a smoothed classifier to obtain robust representations, whereas MI forces a model to exploit the surrounding context of a masked token in an input sequence. RSMI improves adversarial robustness by 2 to 3 times over existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. We also perform in-depth qualitative analysis to validate the effectiveness of the different stages of RSMI and probe the impact of its components through extensive ablations. By empirically proving the stability of RSMI, we put it forward as a practical method to robustly train large-scale NLP models.

    "abstract": "Large time-varying graphs are increasingly common in financial, social and biological settings. Feature extraction that efficiently encodes the complex structure of sparse, multi-layered, dynamic graphs presents computational and methodological challenges. In the past decade, a persistence diagram (PD) from topological data analysis (TDA) has become a popular descriptor of shape of data with a well-defined distance between points. However, applications of TDA to graphs, where there is no intrinsic concept of distance between the nodes, remain largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by introducing a computationally efficient framework to extract shape information from graph data. Our framework has two main steps: first, we compute a PD using the so-called lower-star filtration which utilizes quantitative node attributes, and then vectorize it by averaging the associated Betti function over successive scale values on a one-dimensional grid. Our approach avoids embedding a graph into a metric space and has stability properties against input noise. In simulation studies, we show that the proposed vector summary leads to improved change point detection rate in time-varying graphs. In a real data application, our approach provides up to 22% gain in anomalous price prediction for the Ethereum cryptocurrency transaction networks. ",

Different from existing embedding methods that treat the incorporation of graph structure and semantic as the simple combination of two optimization objectives, we propose a novel semantic graph representation (SGR) method to formulate the joint optimization of the two heterogeneous sources into a common high-order proximity based framework. Concretely, we first construct an auxiliary weighted graph, where the complex homogeneous and heterogeneous relations among nodes and attributes in the original graph are comprehensively encoded. Conventional embedding methods that consider high-order topology proximities can then be easily applied to the newly constructed graph to learn the representations of both node and attribute while capturing the nonlinear high-order intrinsic correlation inside or among graph structure and semantic. The learned attribute embeddings can also effectively support some semantic-oriented inference tasks (e.g., semantic community detection), helping to reveal the graph's deep semantic. The effectiveness of SGR is further verified on a series of real graphs, where it achieves impressive performance over other baselines. ",

To improve attack efficiency, we suggest to make full use of the property of video frame interpolation task. The intuition is that the gap between adjacent frames would be small, leading to the corresponding adversarial perturbations being similar as well. Then we propose a novel attack method named Inter-frame Accelerate Attack (IAA) that initializes the perturbation as the perturbation for the previous adjacent frame and reduces the number of attack iterations. It is shown that our method can improve attack efficiency greatly while achieving comparable attack performance with traditional methods. Besides, we also extend our method to video recognition models which are higher level vision tasks and achieves great attack efficiency. ",

Then, we develop a novel quality-of-experience (QoE) model to formulate the semantic-aware resource allocation problem in terms of semantic compression, channel assignment, and transmit power allocation. To solve the formulated problem, we first decouple it into two subproblems. The first one is to optimize semantic compression with given channel assignment and power allocation results, which is solved by a developed deep Q-network (DQN) based method. The second one is to optimize the channel assignment and transmit power, which is modeled as a many-to-one matching game and solved by a proposed low-complexity matching algorithm.

    "abstract": "While ensuring stability for linear systems is well understood, it remains a major challenge for systems with nonlinear dynamics. A general approach in such cases is to leverage Lyapunov stability theory to compute a combination of a Lyapunov control function and an associated control policy. However, finding Lyapunov functions for general nonlinear systems is a challenging task. To address this challenge, several methods have been recently proposed that represent Lyapunov functions using neural networks. However, such approaches have been designed exclusively for continuous-time systems. We propose the first approach for learning neural Lyapunov control in discrete-time systems. Three key ingredients enable us to effectively learn provably stable control policies. The first is a novel mixed-integer linear programming approach for verifying the stability conditions in discrete-time systems. The second is a novel approach for computing sub-level sets which characterize the region of attraction. Finally, we rely on a heuristic gradient-based approach for quickly finding counterexamples to significantly speed up Lyapunov function learning. Our experiments on four standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. For example, on the path tracking benchmark, we outperform recent neural Lyapunov control baselines by an order of magnitude in both running time and the size of the region of attraction, and on two of the four benchmarks (cartpole and PVTOL), ours is the first automated approach to return a provably stable controller.

However, most of the graphical password systems are vulnerable to shoulder-surfing attack due to the usage of the visual interface. In this research, a method that uses shifting condition with digraph substitution rules is proposed to address shoulder-surfing attack problem. The proposed algorithm uses both password images and decoy images throughout the user authentication procedure to confuse adversaries from obtaining the password images via direct observation or watching from a recorded session. The pass-images generated by this suggested algorithm are random and can only be generated if the algorithm is fully understood. As a result, adversaries will have no clue to obtain the right password images to log in. A user study was undertaken to assess the proposed method's effectiveness to avoid shoulder-surfing attacks. The results of the user study indicate that the proposed approach can withstand shoulder-surfing attacks (both direct observation and video recording method).The proposed method was tested and the results showed that it is able to resist shoulder-surfing and frequency of occurrence analysis attacks. Moreover, the experience gained in this research can be pervaded the gap on the realm of knowledge of the graphical password. ",

We define shape and propose a new behavioral metric to measure the extent to which a CNN utilizes shape information. We then execute a set of experiments with synthetic and real-world data to progressively uncover under which circumstances CNNs learn shape and what can be done to encourage such behavior. We conclude that (i) CNNs do not learn shape in typical settings but rather rely on other features available to identify the objects of interest, (ii) CNNs can learn shape, but only if the shape is the only feature available to identify the object, (iii) sufficiently large receptive field size relative to the size of target objects is necessary for shape learning; (iv) a limited set of augmentations can encourage shape learning; (v) learning shape is indeed useful in the presence of out-of-distribution data.

We perform extensive experiments on four entity alignment datasets covering 14 distinct KGs across five languages. Without any supervision or hyper-parameter tuning, FGWEA surpasses 21 competitive baselines, including cutting-edge supervised entity alignment methods.

A large-scale study released that writing programs requires programming thinking, i.e., analyzing and implementing requirements in programming logic (e.g., sequence, branch, loop). Existing studies use LLMs to generate programs from requirements directly and do not explicitly introduce the programming thinking. This paper explores how to unlock the programming thinking of LLMs in code generation and proposes an approach named TiP. Our idea is to decompose code generation into two steps and progressively lead LLMs to analyze&implement requirements in programming logic. Specifically, TiP first generates a code sketch, which provides a high-level solving process using programming logic but omits implementation details (e.g., APIs). Then, TiP implements the sketch into a program using specific programming languages. We conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, and MBCPP). (1) TiP outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline - ChatGPT by up to 17.5% in Pass@1, 11.02% in Pass@3, and 9.84% in Pass@5. (2) Human evaluation shows that TiP outperforms ChatGPT in three aspects (i.e., correctness, code quality, and maintainability). (3) TiP is effective for different LLMs. (4) We explore multiple choices (e.g., chain-of-thought) for the code sketch and validate the superiority of our design.

Nevertheless, the current federated recommender system faces challenges such as heterogeneity and personalization, model performance degradation, and communication bottleneck. Previous studies have attempted to address these issues, but none have been able to solve them simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named PerFedRec++, to enhance the personalized federated recommendation with self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, we utilize the privacy-preserving mechanism of federated recommender systems to generate two augmented graph views, which are used as contrastive tasks in self-supervised graph learning to pre-train the model. Pre-training enhances the performance of federated models by improving the uniformity of representation learning. Also, by providing a better initial state for federated training, pre-training makes the overall training converge faster, thus alleviating the heavy communication burden. We then construct a collaborative graph to learn the client representation through a federated graph neural network. Based on these learned representations, we cluster users into different user groups and learn personalized models for each cluster. Each user learns a personalized model by combining the global federated model, the cluster-level federated model, and its own fine-tuned local model. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed method achieves superior performance over existing methods. ",

    "abstract": "Robust reinforcement learning (RL) aims at learning a policy that optimizes the worst-case performance over an uncertainty set. Given nominal Markov decision process (N-MDP) that generates samples for training, the set contains MDPs obtained by some perturbations from N-MDP. In this paper, we introduce a new uncertainty set containing more realistic MDPs in practice than the existing sets. Using this uncertainty set, we present a robust RL, named ARQ-Learning, for tabular cases. Also, we characterize the finite-time error bounds and prove that it converges as fast as Q-Learning and robust Q-Learning (i.e., the state-of-the-art robust RL method) while providing better robustness for real applications. We propose {\\em pessimistic agent} that efficiently tackles the key bottleneck for the extension of ARQ-Learning into large or continuous state spaces. Using this technique, we first propose PRQ-Learning. To the next, combining this with DQN and DDPG, we develop PR-DQN and PR-DDPG, respectively. We emphasize that our technique can be easily combined with the other popular model-free methods. Via experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in various RL applications with model uncertainties. ",

Unlike previous studies targeting simpler tasks, this study contends with the complexities of label interdependencies in sequence labeling tasks. The proposed algorithm utilizes a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) approach for worker selection. The challenge of dealing with imbalanced and small-scale datasets, which hinders offline simulation of worker selection, is tackled using an innovative data augmentation method termed shifting, expanding, and shrinking (SES). The SES method is designed specifically for sequence labeling tasks. Rigorous testing on CoNLL 2003 NER and Chinese OEI datasets showcased the algorithm's efficiency, with an increase in F1 score up to 100.04% of the expert-only baseline, alongside cost savings up to 65.97%. The paper also encompasses a dataset-independent test emulating annotation evaluation through a Bernoulli distribution, which still led to an impressive 97.56% F1 score of the expert baseline and 59.88% cost savings. This research addresses and overcomes numerous obstacles in worker selection for complex NLP tasks. ",

Despite competitive performances in tackling this problem, machine learning methods often ignore other competing risks that preclude the event of interest.

This paper leverages constrained monotonic neural networks to model each competing survival distribution. This modelling choice ensures the exact likelihood maximisation at a reduced computational cost by using automatic differentiation. The effectiveness of the solution is demonstrated on one synthetic and three medical datasets.

    "abstract": "Rutting of asphalt pavements is a crucial design criterion in various pavement design guides. A good road transportation base can provide security for the transportation of oil and gas in road transportation. This study attempts to develop a robust artificial intelligence model to estimate different asphalt pavements' rutting depth clips, temperature, and load axes as primary characteristics. The experiment data were obtained from 19 asphalt pavements with different crude oil sources on a 2.038 km long full-scale field accelerated pavement test track (RIOHTrack, Road Track Institute) in Tongzhou, Beijing. In addition, this paper also proposes to build complex networks with different pavement rutting depths through complex network methods and the Louvain algorithm for community detection. The most critical structural elements can be selected from different asphalt pavement rutting data, and similar structural elements can be found. An extreme learning machine algorithm with residual correction (RELM) is designed and optimized using an independent adaptive particle swarm algorithm. The experimental results of the proposed method are compared with several classical machine learning algorithms, with predictions of Average Root Mean Squared Error, Average Mean Absolute Error, and Average Mean Absolute Percentage Error for 19 asphalt pavements reaching 1.742, 1.363, and 1.94\\% respectively. The experiments demonstrate that the RELM algorithm has an advantage over classical machine learning methods in dealing with non-linear problems in road engineering. Notably, the method ensures the adaptation of the simulated environment to different levels of abstraction through the cognitive analysis of the production environment parameters. ",

CANTS utilizes a continuous search space to indirectly-encode a neural architecture search space. Synthetic ant agents explore CANTS' continuous search space based on the density and distribution of pheromones, strongly inspired by how ants move in the real world. This continuous search space allows CANTS to automate the design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) of any size, removing a key limitation inherent to many current NAS algorithms that must operate within structures of a size that is predetermined by the user. This work expands CANTS by adding a fourth dimension to its search space representing potential neural synaptic weights. Adding this extra dimension allows CANTS agents to optimize both the architecture as well as the weights of an ANN without applying backpropagation (BP), which leads to a significant reduction in the time consumed in the optimization process. The experiments of this study - using real-world data - demonstrate that the BP-Free~CANTS algorithm exhibits highly competitive performance compared to both CANTS and ANTS while requiring significantly less operation time.

In contrast, adverse weather conditions constitute a much more realistic threat scenario. Hence, in this work, we present a novel attack on motion estimation that exploits adversarially optimized particles to mimic weather effects like snowflakes, rain streaks or fog clouds. At the core of our attack framework is a differentiable particle rendering system that integrates particles (i) consistently over multiple time steps (ii) into the 3D space (iii) with a photo-realistic appearance. Through optimization, we obtain adversarial weather that significantly impacts the motion estimation. Surprisingly, methods that previously showed good robustness towards small per-pixel perturbations are particularly vulnerable to adversarial weather. At the same time, augmenting the training with non-optimized weather increases a method's robustness towards weather effects and improves generalizability at almost no additional cost. ",

The performance of Albertina and competing models was assessed by evaluating them on prominent downstream language processing tasks adapted for Portuguese. Both Albertina PT-PT and PT-BR versions are distributed free of charge and under the most permissive license possible and can be run on consumer-grade hardware, thus seeking to contribute to the advancement of research and innovation in language technology for Portuguese.

In this work, we systematically explore the generative dynamics of RBMs, characterizing the number of states visited during top-down sampling and investigating whether the heterogeneity of visited attractors could be increased by starting the generation process from biased hidden states. By considering an RBM trained on a classic dataset of handwritten digits, we show that the capacity to produce diverse data prototypes can be increased by initiating top-down sampling from chimera states, which encode high-level visual features of multiple digits. We also found that the model is not capable of transitioning between all possible digit states within a single generation trajectory, suggesting that the top-down dynamics is heavily constrained by the shape of the energy function.

Recent debates have shown that attention maps and attribution methods are unreliable (Pruthi et al., 2019; Brunner et al., 2019).

COCKATIEL is a novel, post-hoc, concept-based, model-agnostic XAI technique that generates meaningful explanations from the last layer of a neural net model trained on an NLP classification task by using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to discover the concepts the model leverages to make predictions and by exploiting a Sensitivity Analysis to estimate accurately the importance of each of these concepts for the model. It does so without compromising the accuracy of the underlying model or requiring a new one to be trained. We conduct experiments in single and multi-aspect sentiment analysis tasks and we show COCKATIEL's superior ability to discover concepts that align with humans' on Transformer models without any supervision, we objectively verify the faithfulness of its explanations through fidelity metrics, and we showcase its ability to provide meaningful explanations in two different datasets.

Although computer vision is relevant to the African communities in various applications, yet computer vision research is under-explored in the continent and constructs only 0.06% of top-tier publications in the last 10 years. In this paper, our goal is to have a better understanding of the computer vision research conducted in Africa and provide pointers on whether there is equity in research or not. We do this through an empirical analysis of the African computer vision publications that are Scopus indexed. We first study the opportunities available for African institutions to publish in top-tier computer vision venues. We show that African publishing trends in top-tier venues over the years do not exhibit consistent growth. We also devise a novel way to retrieve African authors through their affiliation history to have a better understanding of their contributions in top-tier venues. Moreover, we study all computer vision publications beyond top-tier venues in different African regions to find that mainly Northern and Southern Africa are publishing in computer vision with more than 85% of African publications. Finally, we present the most recurring keywords in computer vision publications. In summary, our analysis reveals that African researchers are key contributors to African research, yet there exists multiple barriers to publish in top-tier venues and the current trend of topics published in the continent might not necessarily reflect the communities' needs. This work is part of a community based effort that is focused on improving computer vision research in Africa. ",

    "abstract": "Computing systems have shifted towards highly parallel and heterogeneous architectures to tackle the challenges imposed by limited power budgets. These architectures must be supported by novel power management paradigms addressing the increasing design size, parallelism, and heterogeneity while ensuring high accuracy and low overhead. In this work, we propose a systematic, automated, and architecture-agnostic approach to accurate and lightweight DVFS-aware statistical power modeling of the CPU and GPU sub-systems of a heterogeneous platform, driven by the sub-systems' local performance monitoring counters (PMCs). Counter selection is guided by a generally applicable statistical method that identifies the minimal subsets of counters robustly correlating to power dissipation. Based on the selected counters, we train a set of lightweight, linear models characterizing each sub-system over a range of frequencies. Such models compose a lookup-table-based system-level model that efficiently captures the non-linearity of power consumption, showing desirable responsiveness and decomposability. We validate the system-level model on real hardware by measuring the total energy consumption of an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform over a set of benchmarks. The resulting average estimation error is 1.3%, with a maximum of 3.1%. Furthermore, the model shows a maximum evaluation runtime of 500 ns, thus implying a negligible impact on system utilization and applicability to online dynamic power management (DPM). ",

We achieve this using a biomedical language model trained to produce similar representations for entity names and their definitions, called BioLORD. The importance of this definition-based approach is highlighted by comparing the BioLORD model to two other state-of-the-art biomedical language models based on Transformer: SapBERT and CODER. Our results show that the BioLORD model has a strong ability to identify idiomatic MWEs, not replicated in other models.

Recently, a large number of forecasting algorithms using either convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks have been developed to exploit the complex temporal and spatial dependencies present in the time series. While these solutions have shown significant advantages over statistical approaches, one open question is to effectively incorporate the global information which represents the seasonality patterns via the time component of time series into the forecasting models to improve their accuracy. This paper presents a general approach to integrating the time component into forecasting models. The main idea is to employ conditional neural fields to represent the auxiliary features extracted from the time component to obtain the global information, which will be effectively combined with the local information extracted from autoregressive neural networks through a layer-wise gated fusion module. Extensive experiments on road traffic and cellular network traffic datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ",

We propose a simple method for measuring a scale of models' reliance on any identified spurious feature and assess the robustness towards a large set of known and newly found prediction biases for various pre-trained models and debiasing methods in Question Answering (QA). We find that the reported OOD gains of debiasing methods can not be explained by mitigated reliance on biased features, suggesting that biases are shared among QA datasets. We further evidence this by measuring that performance of OOD models depends on bias features comparably to the ID model, motivating future work to refine the reports of LLMs' robustness to a level of known spurious features.

Results illustrate that dependable facial appearance credited with changing lighting conditions for separating reasonable facial terminology display emotions is an efficient representation of clean and assorted moving expressions.

An efficient RANSAC map matching is employed to achieve a good tradeoff between computational efficiency and accuracy. In the latter pole class matching module, the local and global poles paired by the RANSAC map-matching are further compared by means of pole attribute class. To this end, a predefined set of pseudo pole classes is learned via k-means clustering in a self-supervised manner. Experiments using publicly available NCLT dataset showed that the pole-like landmark classification method has an improved effect on the visual self-localization system compared with the baseline method.

    "abstract": "We study the computational complexity of fair division of indivisible items in an enriched model: there is an underlying graph on the set of items. And we have to allocate the items (i.e., the vertices of the graph) to a set of agents in such a way that (a) the allocation is fair (for appropriate notions of fairness) and (b) each agent receives a bundle of items (i.e., a subset of vertices) that induces a subgraph with a specific \"nice structure.\" This model has previously been studied in the literature with the nice structure being a connected subgraph. In this paper, we propose an alternative for connectivity in fair division. We introduce what we call compact graphs, and look for fair allocations in which each agent receives a compact bundle of items. Through compactness, we try to capture the idea that every agent must receive a set of \"closely related\" items. We prove a host of hardness and tractability results for restricted input settings with respect to fairness concepts such as proportionality, envy-freeness and maximin share guarantee. ",

However, the problem of optimizing FL client selection in mobile federated learning networks (MFLNs), where devices move in and out of each others' coverage and no FL server knows all the data owners, remains open. To bridge this gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind \\underline{Soc}ially-aware \\underline{Fed}erated \\underline{C}lient \\underline{S}election (SocFedCS) approach to minimize costs and train high-quality FL models. SocFedCS enriches the candidate FL client pool by enabling data owners to propagate FL task information through their local networks of trust, even as devices are moving into and out of each others' coverage. Based on Lyapunov optimization, we first transform this time-coupled problem into a step-by-step optimization problem. Then, we design a method based on alternating minimization and self-adaptive global best harmony search to solve this mixed-integer optimization problem. Extensive experiments comparing SocFedCS against five state-of-the-art approaches based on four real-world multimedia datasets demonstrate that it achieves 2.06\\% higher test accuracy and 12.24\\% lower cost on average than the best-performing baseline.

    "abstract": "Empirical networks possess considerable heterogeneity of node connections, resulting in a small portion of nodes playing crucial roles in network structure and function. Yet, how to characterize nodes' influence and identify vital nodes is by far still unclear in the study of networks with higher-order interactions. In this paper, we introduce a multi-order graph obtained by incorporating the higher-order bipartite graph and the classical pairwise graph, and propose a Higher-order Augmented Random Walk (HoRW) model through random walking on it. This representation preserves as much information about the higher-interacting network as possible. The results indicate that the proposed method effectively addresses the localization problem of certain classical centralities. In contrast to random walks along pairwise interactions only, performing more walks along higher-order interactions assists in not only identifying the most important nodes but also distinguishing nodes that ranked in the middle and bottom. Our method outperforms classical centralities in identifying vital nodes and can scale to various tasks in networks, including information spread maximization and network dismantling problems. The proposed higher-order representation and the random walk model provide novel insights and potent tools for studying higher-order mechanisms and functionality. ",

The small size and versatility of switched-mode power converters has resulted in their widespread adoption. Whereas transformer-based systems passively convert voltage, switched-mode converters feature an actively regulated feedback loop, which relies on accurate sensor measurements. Previous academic work has shown that many types of sensors are vulnerable to Intentional Electromagnetic Interference (IEMI) attacks, and it has been postulated that power converters, too, are affected. In this paper, we present the first detailed study on switched-mode power converters by targeting their voltage and current sensors through IEMI attacks. We present a theoretical framework for evaluating IEMI attacks against feedback-based power supplies in the general case. We experimentally validate our theoretical predictions by analyzing multiple AC-DC and DC-DC converters, automotive grade current sensors, and dedicated battery chargers, and demonstrate the systematic vulnerability of all examined categories under real-world conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that sensor attacks on power converters can cause permanent damage to Li-Ion batteries during the charging process. ",

    "abstract": "In the recent past, complex deep neural networks have received huge interest in various document understanding tasks such as document image classification and document retrieval. As many document types have a distinct visual style, learning only visual features with deep CNNs to classify document images have encountered the problem of low inter-class discrimination, and high intra-class structural variations between its categories. In parallel, text-level understanding jointly learned with the corresponding visual properties within a given document image has considerably improved the classification performance in terms of accuracy. In this paper, we design a self-attention-based fusion module that serves as a block in our ensemble trainable network. It allows to simultaneously learn the discriminant features of image and text modalities throughout the training stage. Besides, we encourage mutual learning by transferring the positive knowledge between image and text modalities during the training stage. This constraint is realized by adding a truncated-Kullback-Leibler divergence loss Tr-KLD-Reg as a new regularization term, to the conventional supervised setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to leverage a mutual learning approach along with a self-attention-based fusion module to perform document image classification. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of accuracy for the single-modal and multi-modal modalities. Thus, the proposed ensemble self-attention-based mutual learning model outperforms the state-of-the-art classification results based on the benchmark RVL-CDIP and Tobacco-3482 datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Deep multi-view subspace clustering (DMVSC) has recently attracted increasing attention due to its promising performance. However, existing DMVSC methods still have two issues: (1) they mainly focus on using autoencoders to nonlinearly embed the data, while the embedding may be suboptimal for clustering because the clustering objective is rarely considered in autoencoders, and (2) existing methods typically have a quadratic or even cubic complexity, which makes it challenging to deal with large-scale data. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a novel deep multi-view subspace clustering method with anchor graph (DMCAG). To be specific, DMCAG firstly learns the embedded features for each view independently, which are used to obtain the subspace representations. To significantly reduce the complexity, we construct an anchor graph with small size for each view. Then, spectral clustering is performed on an integrated anchor graph to obtain pseudo-labels. To overcome the negative impact caused by suboptimal embedded features, we use pseudo-labels to refine the embedding process to make it more suitable for the clustering task. Pseudo-labels and embedded features are updated alternately. Furthermore, we design a strategy to keep the consistency of the labels based on contrastive learning to enhance the clustering performance. Empirical studies on real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior clustering performance over other state-of-the-art methods. ",

An automated analysis of such images using deep learning models is therefore of high demand. The transformer architecture has been proposed as a possible candidate for effectively leveraging the high-resolution information. Here, the whole-slide image is partitioned into smaller image patches and feature tokens are extracted from these image patches. However, while the conventional transformer allows for a simultaneous processing of a large set of input tokens, the computational demand scales quadratically with the number of input tokens and thus quadratically with the number of image patches. To address this problem we propose a novel cascaded cross-attention network (CCAN) based on the cross-attention mechanism that scales linearly with the number of extracted patches. Our experiments demonstrate that this architecture is at least on-par with and even outperforms other attention-based state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets: On the use-case of lung cancer (TCGA NSCLC) our model reaches a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.970 $\\pm$ 0.008 and on renal cancer (TCGA RCC) reaches a mean AUC of 0.985 $\\pm$ 0.004.

    "abstract": "One of the central questions in the theory of deep learning is to understand how neural networks learn hierarchical features. The ability of deep networks to extract salient features is crucial to both their outstanding generalization ability and the modern deep learning paradigm of pretraining and finetuneing. However, this feature learning process remains poorly understood from a theoretical perspective, with existing analyses largely restricted to two-layer networks. In this work we show that three-layer neural networks have provably richer feature learning capabilities than two-layer networks. We analyze the features learned by a three-layer network trained with layer-wise gradient descent, and present a general purpose theorem which upper bounds the sample complexity and width needed to achieve low test error when the target has specific hierarchical structure. We instantiate our framework in specific statistical learning settings -- single-index models and functions of quadratic features -- and show that in the latter setting three-layer networks obtain a sample complexity improvement over all existing guarantees for two-layer networks. Crucially, this sample complexity improvement relies on the ability of three-layer networks to efficiently learn nonlinear features. We then establish a concrete optimization-based depth separation by constructing a function which is efficiently learnable via gradient descent on a three-layer network, yet cannot be learned efficiently by a two-layer network. Our work makes progress towards understanding the provable benefit of three-layer neural networks over two-layer networks in the feature learning regime. ",

Furthermore, adaptions of Smatch for extended tasks (e.g., fine-grained semantic similarity) are spread out, and lack a unifying framework. For better inspection, we divide the metric into three modules: pre-processing, alignment, and scoring. Examining each module, we specify its goals and diagnose potential issues, for which we discuss and test mitigation strategies. For pre-processing, we show how to fully conform to annotation guidelines that allow structurally deviating but valid graphs. For safer and enhanced alignment, we show the feasibility of optimal alignment in a standard evaluation setup, and develop a lossless graph compression method that shrinks the search space and significantly increases efficiency.

Working in the teacher-student scenario, with a sparse teacher, and focusing on tasks of different complexity, we quantify the effects of changing the mini-batch size $m$. We find that often the generalization performances of the student strongly depend on $m$ and may undergo sharp phase transitions at a critical value $m_c$, such that for $m<m_c$ the training process fails, while for $m>m_c$ the student learns perfectly or generalizes very well the teacher. Phase transitions are induced by collective phenomena firstly discovered in statistical mechanics and later observed in many fields of science. Finding a phase transition varying the mini-batch size raises several important questions on the role of a hyperparameter which have been somehow overlooked until now. ",

Stain normalization can effectively reduce the differences in color and brightness of digital pathology images, thus improving the performance of computer-aided diagnostic systems.

Although learning-based stain normalization methods are a general approach, they use complex deep networks, which not only greatly reduce computational efficiency, but also risk introducing artifacts. StainNet is a fast and robust stain normalization network, but it has not a sufficient capability for complex stain normalization due to its too simple network structure.

ParamNet contains a parameter prediction sub-network and a color mapping sub-network, where the parameter prediction sub-network can automatically determine the appropriate parameters for the color mapping sub-network according to each input image. The feature of parameter variable ensures that our network has a sufficient capability for various stain normalization tasks. The color mapping sub-network is a fully 1x1 convolutional network with a total of 59 variable parameters, which allows our network to be extremely computationally efficient and does not introduce artifacts.

The proposed NNCI methodology is applied to some of the most well established neural network-based models for treatment effect estimation with the use of observational data. Numerical experiments and analysis provide empirical and statistical evidence that the integration of NNCI with state-of-the-art neural network models leads to considerably improved treatment effect estimations on a variety of well-known challenging benchmarks.

    "title": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Discovering Localised Eigenstates  in Disordered Media",
    "abstract": "The Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with random potentials is a fundamental model for understanding the behaviour of particles in disordered systems. Disordered media are characterised by complex potentials that lead to the localisation of wavefunctions, also called Anderson localisation. These wavefunctions may have similar scales of eigenenergies which poses difficulty in their discovery. It has been a longstanding challenge due to the high computational cost and complexity of solving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. Recently, machine-learning tools have been adopted to tackle these challenges. In this paper, based upon recent advances in machine learning, we present a novel approach for discovering localised eigenstates in disordered media using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We focus on the spectral approximation of Hamiltonians in one dimension with potentials that are randomly generated according to the Bernoulli, normal, and uniform distributions. We introduce a novel feature to the loss function that exploits known physical phenomena occurring in these regions to scan across the domain and successfully discover these eigenstates, regardless of the similarity of their eigenenergies. We present various examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach and compare it with isogeometric analysis. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an approach for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which aims to reconstruct a real-time video of a beating heart from continuous highly under-sampled measurements. This task is challenging since the object to be reconstructed (the heart) is continuously changing during signal acquisition. To address this challenge, we represent the beating heart with an implicit neural network and fit the network so that the representation of the heart is consistent with the measurements. The network in the form of a multi-layer perceptron with Fourier-feature inputs acts as an effective signal prior and enables adjusting the regularization strength in both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the signal. We examine the proposed approach for 2D free-breathing cardiac real-time MRI in different operating regimes, i.e., for different image resolutions, slice thicknesses, and acquisition lengths. Our method achieves reconstruction quality on par with or slightly better than state-of-the-art untrained convolutional neural networks and superior image quality compared to a recent method that fits an implicit representation directly to Fourier-domain measurements. However, this comes at a higher computational cost. Our approach does not require any additional patient data or biosensors including electrocardiography, making it potentially applicable in a wide range of clinical scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a general framework for visualizing any intermediate embedding representation used by any neural survival analysis model. Our framework is based on so-called anchor directions in an embedding space. We show how to estimate these anchor directions using clustering or, alternatively, using user-supplied \"concepts\" defined by collections of raw inputs (e.g., feature vectors all from female patients could encode the concept \"female\"). For tabular data, we present visualization strategies that reveal how anchor directions relate to raw clinical features and to survival time distributions. We then show how these visualization ideas extend to handling raw inputs that are images. Our framework is built on looking at angles between vectors in an embedding space, where there could be \"information loss\" by ignoring magnitude information. We show how this loss results in a \"clumping\" artifact that appears in our visualizations, and how to reduce this information loss in practice. ",

    "title": "Reinterpreting causal discovery as the task of predicting unobserved  joint statistics",
    "abstract": "If $X,Y,Z$ denote sets of random variables, two different data sources may contain samples from $P_{X,Y}$ and $P_{Y,Z}$, respectively. We argue that causal discovery can help inferring properties of the `unobserved joint distributions' $P_{X,Y,Z}$ or $P_{X,Z}$. The properties may be conditional independences (as in `integrative causal inference') or also quantitative statements about dependences. More generally, we define a learning scenario where the input is a subset of variables and the label is some statistical property of that subset. Sets of jointly observed variables define the training points, while unobserved sets are possible test points. To solve this learning task, we infer, as an intermediate step, a causal model from the observations that then entails properties of unobserved sets. Accordingly, we can define the VC dimension of a class of causal models and derive generalization bounds for the predictions. Here, causal discovery becomes more modest and better accessible to empirical tests than usual: rather than trying to find a causal hypothesis that is `true' a causal hypothesis is {\\it useful} whenever it correctly predicts statistical properties of unobserved joint distributions. This way, a sparse causal graph that omits weak influences may be more useful than a dense one (despite being less accurate) because it is able to reconstruct the full joint distribution from marginal distributions of smaller subsets. Within such a `pragmatic' application of causal discovery, some popular heuristic approaches become justified in retrospect. It is, for instance, allowed to infer DAGs from partial correlations instead of conditional independences if the DAGs are only used to predict partial correlations. ",

Here we tackle this challenge utilizing the recently developed Fermionic neural network (FermiNet) wave function Ansatz for variational Monte Carlo calculations. We study the unitary Fermi gas, a system with strong, short-range, two-body interactions known to possess a superfluid ground state but difficult to describe quantitively. We demonstrate key limitations of the FermiNet Ansatz in studying the unitary Fermi gas and propose a simple modification that outperforms the original FermiNet significantly, giving highly accurate results. We prove mathematically that the new Ansatz is a strict generalization of the original FermiNet architecture, despite the use of fewer parameters. Our approach shares several advantanges with the FermiNet: the use of a neural network removes the need for an underlying basis set; and the flexiblity of the network yields extremely accurate results within a variational quantum Monte Carlo framework that provides access to unbiased estimates of arbitrary ground-state expectation values. We discuss how the method can be extended to study other superfluids. ",
