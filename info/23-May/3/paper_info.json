    "abstract": "Critical infrastructures like water treatment facilities and power plants depend on industrial control systems (ICS) for monitoring and control, making them vulnerable to cyber attacks and system malfunctions. Traditional ICS anomaly detection methods lack transparency and interpretability, which make it difficult for practitioners to understand and trust the results. This paper proposes a two-phase dual Copula-based Outlier Detection (COPOD) method that addresses these challenges. The first phase removes unwanted outliers using an empirical cumulative distribution algorithm, and the second phase develops two parallel COPOD models based on the output data of phase 1. The method is based on empirical distribution functions, parameter-free, and provides interpretability by quantifying each feature's contribution to an anomaly. The method is also computationally and memory-efficient, suitable for low- and high-dimensional datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in terms of F1-score and recall on three open-source ICS datasets, enabling real-time ICS anomaly detection. ",

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective deep learning models to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependency of traffic data, achieving ideal prediction performance. In this paper, we propose attention-based graph neural ODE (ASTGODE) that explicitly learns the dynamics of the traffic system, which makes the prediction of our machine learning model more explainable. Our model aggregates traffic patterns of different periods and has satisfactory performance on two real-world traffic data sets. The results show that our model achieves the highest accuracy of the root mean square error metric among all the existing GNN models in our experiments. ",

    "abstract": "In most retail stores, the number of days since initial processing is used as a proxy for estimating the freshness of perishable foods or freshness is assessed manually by an employee. While the former method can lead to wastage, as some fresh foods might get disposed after a fixed number of days, the latter can be time-consuming, expensive and impractical at scale. This project aims to propose a Machine Learning (ML) based approach that evaluates freshness of food based on live data. For the current scope, it only considers meat as a the subject of analysis and attempts to classify pieces of meat as fresh, half-fresh or spoiled. Finally the model achieved an accuracy of above 90% and relatively high performance in terms of the cost of misclassification. It is expected that the technology will contribute to the optimization of the client's business operation, reducing the risk of selling defective or rotten products that can entail serious monetary, non-monetary and health-based consequences while also achieving higher corporate value as a sustainable company by reducing food wastage through timely sales and disposal.

    "abstract": "A theory of neural networks (NNs) built upon collective variables would provide scientists with the tools to better understand the learning process at every stage. In this work, we introduce two such variables, the entropy and the trace of the empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) built on the training data passed to the model. We empirically analyze the NN performance in the context of these variables and find that there exists correlation between the starting entropy, the trace of the NTK, and the generalization of the model computed after training is complete. This framework is then applied to the problem of optimal data selection for the training of NNs. To this end, random network distillation (RND) is used as a means of selecting training data which is then compared with random selection of data. It is shown that not only does RND select data-sets capable of outperforming random selection, but that the collective variables associated with the RND data-sets are larger than those of the randomly selected sets. The results of this investigation provide a stable ground from which the selection of data for NN training can be driven by this phenomenological framework. ",

Although numerous research has been done to detect deception in all these domains, information shortage in a new event necessitates these domains to associate with each other to battle deception. To form this association, we propose a feature augmentation method by harnessing the intermediate layer representation of neural models. Our approaches provide an improvement over the self-domain baseline models by up to 6.60%. We find Tweets to be the most helpful information provider for Fake News and Phishing Email detection, whereas News helps most in Tweet Rumor detection. Our analysis provides a useful insight for domain knowledge transfer which can help build a stronger deception detection system than the existing literature. ",

We study both discrete- and continuous-time models, and allow operations to be coupled into a single parallel group. Our algorithms to decide if a collision may occur run in $O(n^2\\log^2 n)$ time, $O(n^2)$ time, or $O(n\\log^2 n)$ time, depending on the presence and type of coupled operations, in a continuous-time model for a modular robot with $n$ nodes. To decide if collisions can be avoided, we show that a very restricted version is already NP-complete in the discrete-time model, while the same problem is polynomial in the continuous-time model. A less restricted version is NP-hard in the continuous-time model. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, permissionless blockchains have gained significant attention for their ability to secure and provide transparency in transactions. The development of blockchain technology has shifted from cryptocurrency to decentralized finance, benefiting millions of unbanked individuals, and serving as the foundation of Web3, which aims to provide the next generation of the internet with data ownership for users. The rise of NFTs has also helped artists and creative workers to protect their intellectual property and reap the benefits of their work. However, privacy risks associated with permissionless blockchains have become a major concern for individuals and institutions. The role of blockchain in the transition from Web2 to Web3 is crucial, as it is rapidly evolving. As more individuals, institutions, and organizations adopt this technology, it becomes increasingly important to closely monitor the new risks associated with permissionless blockchains and provide updated solutions to mitigate them. This paper endeavors to examine the privacy risks inherent in permissionless blockchains, including Remote Procedure Call (RPC) issues, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), miner extractable value (MEV) bots, on-chain data analysis, data breaches, transaction linking, transaction metadata, and others. The existing solutions to these privacy risks, such as zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, Hyperledger Fabric, and stealth addresses, shall be analyzed. Finally, suggestions for the future improvement of privacy solutions in the permissionless blockchain space shall be put forward. ",

In this work, we present CLIP-S$^4$ that leverages self-supervised pixel representation learning and vision-language models to enable various semantic segmentation tasks (e.g., unsupervised, transfer learning, language-driven segmentation) without any human annotations and unknown class information. We first learn pixel embeddings with pixel-segment contrastive learning from different augmented views of images. To further improve the pixel embeddings and enable language-driven semantic segmentation, we design two types of consistency guided by vision-language models: 1) embedding consistency, aligning our pixel embeddings to the joint feature space of a pre-trained vision-language model, CLIP; and 2) semantic consistency, forcing our model to make the same predictions as CLIP over a set of carefully designed target classes with both known and unknown prototypes. Thus, CLIP-S$^4$ enables a new task of class-free semantic segmentation where no unknown class information is needed during training. As a result, our approach shows consistent and substantial performance improvement over four popular benchmarks compared with the state-of-the-art unsupervised and language-driven semantic segmentation methods. More importantly, our method outperforms these methods on unknown class recognition by a large margin. ",

    "abstract": "We study the robust communication complexity of maximum matching. Edges of an arbitrary $n$-vertex graph $G$ are randomly partitioned between Alice and Bob independently and uniformly. Alice has to send a single message to Bob such that Bob can find an (approximate) maximum matching of the whole graph $G$. We specifically study the best approximation ratio achievable via protocols where Alice communicates only $\\widetilde{O}(n)$ bits to Bob. There has been a growing interest on the robust communication model due to its connections to the random-order streaming model. An algorithm of Assadi and Behnezhad [ICALP'21] implies a $(2/3+\\epsilon_0 \\sim .667)$-approximation for a small constant $0 < \\epsilon_0 < 10^{-18}$, which remains the best-known approximation for general graphs. For bipartite graphs, Assadi and Behnezhad [Random'21] improved the approximation to .716 albeit with a computationally inefficient (i.e., exponential time) protocol. In this paper, we study a natural and efficient protocol implied by a random-order streaming algorithm of Bernstein [ICALP'20] which is based on edge-degree constrained subgraphs (EDCS) [Bernstein and Stein; ICALP'15]. The result of Bernstein immediately implies that this protocol achieves an (almost) $(2/3 \\sim .666)$-approximation in the robust communication model. We present a new analysis, proving that it achieves a much better (almost) $(5/6 \\sim .833)$-approximation. This significantly improves previous approximations both for general and bipartite graphs. We also prove that our analysis of Bernstein's protocol is tight. ",

    "abstract": "Modern automated surveillance techniques are heavily reliant on deep learning methods. Despite the superior performance, these learning systems are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks - maliciously crafted inputs that are designed to mislead, or trick, models into making incorrect predictions. An adversary can physically change their appearance by wearing adversarial t-shirts, glasses, or hats or by specific behavior, to potentially avoid various forms of detection, tracking and recognition of surveillance systems; and obtain unauthorized access to secure properties and assets. This poses a severe threat to the security and safety of modern surveillance systems. This paper reviews recent attempts and findings in learning and designing physical adversarial attacks for surveillance applications. In particular, we propose a framework to analyze physical adversarial attacks and provide a comprehensive survey of physical adversarial attacks on four key surveillance tasks: detection, identification, tracking, and action recognition under this framework. Furthermore, we review and analyze strategies to defend against the physical adversarial attacks and the methods for evaluating the strengths of the defense. The insights in this paper present an important step in building resilience within surveillance systems to physical adversarial attacks. ",

    "abstract": "While many phenomena in physics and engineering are formally high-dimensional, their long-time dynamics often live on a lower-dimensional manifold. The present work introduces an autoencoder framework that combines implicit regularization with internal linear layers and $L_2$ regularization (weight decay) to automatically estimate the underlying dimensionality of a data set, produce an orthogonal manifold coordinate system, and provide the mapping functions between the ambient space and manifold space, allowing for out-of-sample projections. We validate our framework's ability to estimate the manifold dimension for a series of datasets from dynamical systems of varying complexities and compare to other state-of-the-art estimators. We analyze the training dynamics of the network to glean insight into the mechanism of low-rank learning and find that collectively each of the implicit regularizing layers compound the low-rank representation and even self-correct during training. Analysis of gradient descent dynamics for this architecture in the linear case reveals the role of the internal linear layers in leading to faster decay of a \"collective weight variable\" incorporating all layers, and the role of weight decay in breaking degeneracies and thus driving convergence along directions in which no decay would occur in its absence. We show that this framework can be naturally extended for applications of state-space modeling and forecasting by generating a data-driven dynamic model of a spatiotemporally chaotic partial differential equation using only the manifold coordinates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework is robust to hyperparameter choices. ",

    "abstract": "Performative prediction, as introduced by Perdomo et al. (2020), is a framework for studying social prediction in which the data distribution itself changes in response to the deployment of a model. Existing work on optimizing accuracy in this setting hinges on two assumptions that are easily violated in practice: that the performative risk is convex over the deployed model, and that the mapping from the model to the data distribution is known to the model designer in advance. In this paper, we initiate the study of tractable performative prediction problems that do not require these assumptions. To tackle this more challenging setting, we develop a two-level zeroth-order optimization algorithm, where one level aims to compute the distribution map, and the other level reparameterizes the performative prediction objective as a function of the induced data distribution. Under mild conditions, this reparameterization allows us to transform the non-convex objective into a convex one and achieve provable regret guarantees. In particular, we provide a regret bound that is sublinear in the total number of performative samples taken and only polynomial in the dimension of the model parameter. ",

The model is constructed based on the real-world highD dataset, acquired from German highways with the assistance of camera-equipped drones. We evaluated the ACC system under aggressive lane changes when the side lane preceding vehicle cut off, forcing the targeted driver to reduce speed. To this end, the proposed system was assessed on a simulated driving environment and compared with a feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and Model Predictive Control (MPC) model. The results show that the LSTM-based system is 19.25% more accurate than the ANN model and 5.9% more accurate than the MPC model in terms of predicting future values of subject vehicle acceleration.

While ACC relies on the vehicle's sensors to obtain the position and velocity of the leading vehicle, CACC also has access to the acceleration of multiple vehicles through V2V communication. This paper compares the type of information (position, velocity, acceleration) and the number of surrounding vehicles for driver lane change prediction. We trained an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) on the HighD dataset to predict lane change intention. Results indicate a significant improvement in accuracy with an increase in the number of surrounding vehicles and the information received from them.

This is a highly challenging task as involves multiple non-linear parameters. In this direction, we extract and analyse spatio-temporal visual features of both pedestrian and traffic contexts. The pedestrian features include body pose and local context features that represent the pedestrian's behaviour. Additionally, to understand the global context, we utilise location, motion, and environmental information using scene parsing technology that represents the pedestrian's surroundings, and may affect the pedestrian's intention. Finally, these multi-modality features are intelligently fused for effective intention prediction learning.

To directly leverage the abundant geospatial information associated with images in pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference stages, we present Contrastive Spatial Pre-Training (CSP), a self-supervised learning framework for geo-tagged images. We use a dual-encoder to separately encode the images and their corresponding geo-locations, and use contrastive objectives to learn effective location representations from images, which can be transferred to downstream supervised tasks such as image classification. Experiments show that CSP can improve model performance on both iNat2018 and fMoW datasets.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for analyzing dynamic graphs, which are graphs that evolve over time. However, there is still a lack of understanding of how different temporal graph neural network (TGNs) configurations can impact the accuracy of predictions on dynamic graphs. Moreover, the hunt for benchmark datasets for these TGNs models is still ongoing. Up until recently, Pytorch Geometric Temporal came up with a few benchmark datasets but most of these datasets have not been analyzed with different TGN models to establish the state-of-the-art. Therefore, this project aims to address this gap in the literature by performing a qualitative analysis of spatial-temporal dependence structure learning on dynamic graphs, as well as a comparative study of the effectiveness of selected TGNs on node and edge prediction tasks. Additionally, an extensive ablation study will be conducted on different variants of the best-performing TGN to identify the key factors contributing to its performance. By achieving these objectives, this project will provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of TGNs for dynamic graph analysis, with potential applications in areas such as disease spread prediction, social network analysis, traffic prediction, and more. Moreover, an attempt is made to convert snapshot-based data to the event-based dataset and make it compatible with the SOTA model namely TGN to perform node regression task. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, there is an emerging interest in adversarially training a classifier with a rejection option (also known as a selective classifier) for boosting adversarial robustness. While rejection can incur a cost in many applications, existing studies typically associate zero cost with rejecting perturbed inputs, which can result in the rejection of numerous slightly-perturbed inputs that could be correctly classified. In this work, we study adversarially-robust classification with rejection in the stratified rejection setting, where the rejection cost is modeled by rejection loss functions monotonically non-increasing in the perturbation magnitude. We theoretically analyze the stratified rejection setting and propose a novel defense method -- Adversarial Training with Consistent Prediction-based Rejection (CPR) -- for building a robust selective classifier. Experiments on image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods under strong adaptive attacks. For instance, on CIFAR-10, CPR reduces the total robust loss (for different rejection losses) by at least 7.3% under both seen and unseen attacks. ",

Current approaches rely on learning geometries to embed entities in vector space for logical query operations, but they suffer from subpar performance on complex queries and dataset-specific representations. In this paper, we propose a novel decoupled approach, Language-guided Abstract Reasoning over Knowledge graphs (LARK), that formulates complex KG reasoning as a combination of contextual KG search and abstract logical query reasoning, to leverage the strengths of graph extraction algorithms and large language models (LLM), respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art KG reasoning methods on standard benchmark datasets across several logical query constructs, with significant performance gain for queries of higher complexity. Furthermore, we show that the performance of our approach improves proportionally to the increase in size of the underlying LLM, enabling the integration of the latest advancements in LLMs for logical reasoning over KGs. Our work presents a new direction for addressing the challenges of complex KG reasoning and paves the way for future research in this area. ",

This supports the scenario of cooperatively modelling a scene using multiple agents. Our contribution is the first federated learning algorithm for NeRF, which splits the training effort across multiple compute nodes and obviates the need to pool the images at a central node. A technique based on low-rank decomposition of NeRF layers is introduced to reduce bandwidth consumption to transmit the model parameters for aggregation. Transferring compressed models instead of the raw data also contributes to the privacy of the data collecting agents. ",

As optimal network configuration depends on system operating states (e.g., loads at each node), existing analytical and population-based approaches need to repeat the entire analysis and computation to find the optimal network configuration with a change in system operating states. Contrary to this, if properly trained, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based DNR can determine optimal or near-optimal configuration quickly even with changes in system states. In this paper, a Deep Q Learning-based framework is proposed for the optimal DNR to improve reliability of the system. An optimization problem is formulated with an objective function that minimizes the average curtailed power. Constraints of the optimization problem are radial topology constraint and all nodes traversing constraint. The distribution network is modeled as a graph and the optimal network configuration is determined by searching for an optimal spanning tree. The optimal spanning tree is the spanning tree with the minimum value of the average curtailed power. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through several case studies on 33-node and 69-node distribution test systems. ",

Despite the promising progress, their performances are heavily bound by the expression power and the tracking accuracy of the templates. In this work, we present LatentAvatar, an expressive neural head avatar driven by latent expression codes. Such latent expression codes are learned in an end-to-end and self-supervised manner without templates, enabling our method to get rid of expression and tracking issues. To achieve this, we leverage a latent head NeRF to learn the person-specific latent expression codes from a monocular portrait video, and further design a Y-shaped network to learn the shared latent expression codes of different subjects for cross-identity reenactment. By optimizing the photometric reconstruction objectives in NeRF, the latent expression codes are learned to be 3D-aware while faithfully capturing the high-frequency detailed expressions. Moreover, by learning a mapping between the latent expression code learned in shared and person-specific settings, LatentAvatar is able to perform expressive reenactment between different subjects. Experimental results show that our LatentAvatar is able to capture challenging expressions and the subtle movement of teeth and even eyeballs, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art solutions in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons.

In this paper, we first annotate a Chinese Natural Topic Dialogue (CNTD) corpus consisting of 1308 dialogues to fill the gap in the Chinese natural conversation topic corpus. And then we focus on the response-unknown task and propose a teacher-student framework based on hierarchical contrastive learning to predict the topic shift without the response. Specifically, the response at high-level teacher-student is introduced to build the contrastive learning between the response and the context, while the label contrastive learning is constructed at low-level student.

We study the impact of a deviation from the standard tip selection by a subset of block issuers with the aim of halting the confirmation of honest blocks entirely. We provide models on this so-called orphanage of blocks and validate these through open-sourced simulation studies. A critical threshold for the adversary issuance rate is shown to exist, above which the tip pool becomes unstable, while for values below the orphanage decrease exponentially.

Code evaluation datasets, containing curated synthesis problems with input/output test-cases, are used to measure the performance of various LLMs on code synthesis. However, test-cases in these datasets can be limited in both quantity and quality for fully assessing the functional correctness of the generated code. Such limitation in the existing benchmarks begs the following question: In the era of LLMs, is the code generated really correct? To answer this, we propose EvalPlus -- a code synthesis benchmarking framework to rigorously evaluate the functional correctness of LLM-synthesized code. In short, EvalPlus takes in the base evaluation dataset and uses an automatic input generation step to produce and diversify large amounts of new test inputs using both LLM-based and mutation-based input generators to further validate the synthesized code. We extend the popular HUMANEVAL benchmark and build HUMANEVAL+ with 81x additionally generated tests. Our extensive evaluation across 14 popular LLMs demonstrates that HUMANEVAL+ is able to catch significant amounts of previously undetected wrong code synthesized by LLMs, reducing the pass@k by 15.1% on average! Moreover, we even found several incorrect ground-truth implementations in HUMANEVAL. Our work not only indicates that prior popular code synthesis evaluation results do not accurately reflect the true performance of LLMs for code synthesis but also opens up a new direction to improve programming benchmarks through automated test input generation.

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently merged as a promising technique to provide sensing services in future wireless networks. In the literature, numerous works have adopted a monostatic radar architecture to realize ISAC, i.e., employing the same base station (BS) to transmit the ISAC signal and receive the echo. Yet, the concurrent information transmission causes severe self-interference (SI) to the radar echo at the BS which cannot be effectively suppressed. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper, we propose a coordinated cellular network-supported multistatic radar architecture to implement ISAC. In particular, among all the coordinated BSs, we select a BS as the multistatic receiver to receive the sensing echo signal, while the other BSs act as the multistatic transmitters to collaborate with each other to facilitate cooperative ISAC. This allows us to spatially separate the ISAC signal transmission and radar echo reception, intrinsically circumventing the problem of SI. To this end, we jointly optimize the transmit and receive beamforming policy to minimize the sensing beam pattern mismatch error subject to both the communication and sensing quality-of-service requirements. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is tackled by a low-complexity alternating optimization-based suboptimal algorithm. Simulation results showed that the proposed scheme outperforms the two baseline schemes adopting conventional designs. Moreover, our results confirm that the proposed architecture is promising in achieving high-quality ISAC. ",

Previous works usually assume the malware families are known to the classifier in a close-set scenario, i.e., testing families are the subset or at most identical to training families. However, novel unknown malware families frequently emerge in real-world applications, and as such, require to recognize malware instances in an open-set scenario, i.e., some unknown families are also included in the test-set, which has been rarely and non-thoroughly investigated in the cyber-security domain. One practical solution for MOSR may consider jointly classifying known and detecting unknown malware families by a single classifier (e.g., neural network) from the variance of the predicted probability distribution on known families. However, conventional well-trained classifiers usually tend to obtain overly high recognition probabilities in the outputs, especially when the instance feature distributions are similar to each other, e.g., unknown v.s. known malware families, and thus dramatically degrades the recognition on novel unknown malware families. In this paper, we propose a novel model that can conservatively synthesize malware instances to mimic unknown malware families and support a more robust training of the classifier. Moreover, we also build a new large-scale malware dataset, named MAL-100, to fill the gap of lacking large open-set malware benchmark dataset. Experimental results on two widely used malware datasets and our MAL-100 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model compared with other representative methods. ",

Existing works mostly rely on a well-trained classifier considering the predicted probabilities of each known family with a threshold-based detection to achieve the MOSR.

Thus the obtained classifier may produce overly high probabilities of testing unknown samples toward known families and degrade the model performance. In this paper, we propose the Multi-modal Dual-Embedding Networks, dubbed MDENet, to take advantage of comprehensive malware features (i.e., malware images and malware sentences) from different modalities to enhance the diversity of malware feature space, which is more representative and discriminative for down-stream recognition. Last, to further guarantee the open-set recognition, we dually embed the fused multi-modal representation into one primary space and an associated sub-space, i.e., discriminative and exclusive spaces, with contrastive sampling and rho-bounded enclosing sphere regularizations, which resort to classification and detection, respectively.

    "abstract": "Medical internet of things leads to revolutionary improvements in medical services, also known as smart healthcare. With the big healthcare data, data mining and machine learning can assist wellness management and intelligent diagnosis, and achieve the P4-medicine. However, healthcare data has high sparsity and heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Transferring Prediction System (HTPS). Feature engineering mechanism transforms the dataset into sparse and dense feature matrices, and autoencoders in the embedding networks not only embed features but also transfer knowledge from heterogeneous datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed HTPS outperforms the benchmark systems on various prediction tasks and datasets, and ablation studies present the effectiveness of each designed mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate the negative impact of heterogeneous data on benchmark systems and the high transferability of the proposed HTPS. ",

This class not only recovers many known LDP schemes in a unified framework of combinatorial block design, but also suggests a novel way of finding new schemes achieving the optimal (or near-optimal) privacy-utility trade-off with lower communication costs. Indeed, we find many new LDP schemes that achieve both the optimal privacy-utility trade-off and the minimum communication cost among all the unbiased schemes for a certain set of input data size and LDP constraint. Furthermore, to partially solve the sparse existence issue of block design schemes, we consider a broader class of LDP schemes based on regular and pairwise-balanced designs, called RPBD schemes, which relax one of the symmetry requirements on block designs. By considering this broader class of RPBD schemes, we can find LDP schemes achieving near-optimal privacy-utility trade-off with reasonably low communication costs for a much larger set of input data size and LDP constraint.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) attempts to train a global model by aggregating local models from distributed devices under the coordination of a central server. However, the existence of a large number of heterogeneous devices makes FL vulnerable to various attacks, especially the stealthy backdoor attack. Backdoor attack aims to trick a neural network to misclassify data to a target label by injecting specific triggers while keeping correct predictions on original training data. Existing works focus on client-side attacks which try to poison the global model by modifying the local datasets. In this work, we propose a new attack model for FL, namely Data-Agnostic Backdoor attack at the Server (DABS), where the server directly modifies the global model to backdoor an FL system. Extensive simulation results show that this attack scheme achieves a higher attack success rate compared with baseline methods while maintaining normal accuracy on the clean data. ",

In this paper, we present Arax, a runtime system that decouples applications from heterogeneous accelerators within a server. First, Arax maps application tasks dynamically to available resources, managing all required task state, memory allocations, and task dependencies. As a result, Arax can share accelerators across applications in a server and adjust the resources used by each application as load fluctuates over time. dditionally, Arax offers a simple API and includes Autotalk, a stub generator that automatically generates stub libraries for applications already written for specific accelerator types, such as NVIDIA GPUs. Consequently, Arax applications are written once without considering physical details, including the number and type of accelerators. Our results show that applications, such as Caffe, TensorFlow, and Rodinia, can run using Arax with minimum effort and low overhead compared to native execution, about 12% (geometric mean). Arax supports efficient accelerator sharing, by offering up to 20% improved execution times compared to NVIDIA MPS, which supports NVIDIA GPUs only. Arax can transparently provide elasticity, decreasing total application turn-around time by up to 2x compared to native execution without elasticity support. ",

Method: We analyzed 13,903 developers posts across Stack Overflow (SO), Software Engineering Stack Exchange (SESE), and Project Management Stack Exchange (PMSE) forums. A mixed method approach, consisting of the topic modeling technique (i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)) and qualitative analysis, is used to identify frequently discussed topics of software development approaches, trends (popular, difficult topics), and the challenges faced by practitioners in adopting different software development approaches. Findings: We identified 15 frequently mentioned software development approaches topics on Q&A sites and observed an increase in trends for the top-3 most difficult topics requiring more attention. Finally, our study identified 49 challenges faced by practitioners while deploying various software development approaches, and we subsequently created a thematic map to represent these findings. Conclusions: The study findings serve as a useful resource for practitioners to overcome challenges, stay informed about current trends, and ultimately improve the quality of software products they develop.

However, collecting sufficient dialogues that are naturally grounded on flowcharts is costly, thus FTD systems are impeded by scarce training data. To mitigate the data sparsity issue, we propose a plan-based data augmentation (PlanDA) approach that generates diverse synthetic dialog data at scale by transforming concise flowchart into dialogues. Specifically, its generative model employs a variational-base framework with a hierarchical planning strategy that includes global and local latent planning variables. Experiments on the FloDial dataset show that synthetic dialogue produced by PlanDA improves the performance of downstream tasks, including flowchart path retrieval and response generation, in particular on the Out-of-Flowchart settings. In addition, further analysis demonstrate the quality of synthetic data generated by PlanDA in paths that are covered by current sample dialogues and paths that are not covered. ",

This paper addresses the problem of having a better labeling process by (i) reviewing the needs of stakeholders of the datasets, from creators to model users, (ii) presenting a new ontology of label assignment, (iii) presenting a new tool for assigning structured labels for Zeek network flows based on the ontology, and (iv) studying the differences between generating labels and consuming labels in real-life scenarios.

    "abstract": "In order to make data-driven models of physical systems interpretable and reliable, it is essential to include prior physical knowledge in the modeling framework. Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) implement Hamiltonian theory in deep learning and form a comprehensive framework for modeling autonomous energy-conservative systems. Despite being suitable to estimate a wide range of physical system behavior from data, classical HNNs are restricted to systems without inputs and require noiseless state measurements and information on the derivative of the state to be available. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an Output Error Hamiltonian Neural Network (OE-HNN) modeling approach to address the modeling of physical systems with inputs and noisy state measurements. Furthermore, it does not require the state derivatives to be known. Instead, the OE-HNN utilizes an ODE-solver embedded in the training process, which enables the OE-HNN to learn the dynamics from noisy state measurements. In addition, extending HNNs based on the generalized Hamiltonian theory enables to include external inputs into the framework which are important for engineering applications. We demonstrate via simulation examples that the proposed OE-HNNs results in superior modeling performance compared to classical HNNs. ",

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are highly vulnerable to adversarial samples, which are highly transferable and can be used to attack other unknown black-box models. To improve the transferability of adversarial samples, several feature-based adversarial attack methods have been proposed to disrupt neuron activation in middle layers. However, current state-of-the-art feature-based attack methods typically require additional computation costs for estimating the importance of neurons. To address this challenge, we propose a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based feature-level attack method. Our approach is inspired by the discovery that eigenvectors associated with the larger singular values decomposed from the middle layer features exhibit superior generalization and attention properties. Specifically, we conduct the attack by retaining the decomposed Top-1 singular value-associated feature for computing the output logits, which are then combined with the original logits to optimize adversarial perturbations. Our extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, which significantly enhances the transferability of adversarial samples against various baseline models and defense strategies.The source code of this study is available at \\href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SVD-SSA-13BF/README.md}.

However, it suffers from issues in terms of communication, resource of MTs, and privacy. Existing privacy-preserving FL methods usually adopt the instance-level differential privacy (DP), which provides a rigorous privacy guarantee but with several bottlenecks: severe performance degradation, transmission overhead, and resource constraints of edge devices such as MTs. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose Fed-LTP, an efficient and privacy-enhanced FL framework with \\underline{\\textbf{L}}ottery \\underline{\\textbf{T}}icket \\underline{\\textbf{H}}ypothesis (LTH) and zero-concentrated D\\underline{\\textbf{P}} (zCDP). It generates a pruned global model on the server side and conducts sparse-to-sparse training from scratch with zCDP on the client side. On the server side, two pruning schemes are proposed: (i) the weight-based pruning (LTH) determines the pruned global model structure; (ii) the iterative pruning further shrinks the size of the pruned model's parameters. Meanwhile, the performance of Fed-LTP is also boosted via model validation based on the Laplace mechanism. On the client side, we use sparse-to-sparse training to solve the resource-constraints issue and provide tighter privacy analysis to reduce the privacy budget. We evaluate the effectiveness of Fed-LTP on several real-world datasets in both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings. The results clearly confirm the superiority of Fed-LTP over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in communication, computation, and memory efficiencies while realizing a better utility-privacy trade-off.

An inner bound of the capacity is provided. To establish the inner bound, we investigate coding schemes incorporating wiretap coding and secret key agreement between the sender and the legitimate receiver. Two kinds of block Markov coding schemes are studied. The first one uses backward decoding and Wyner-Ziv coding and the secret key is constructed from a lossy reproduction of the CSI. The other one is an extended version of the existing coding scheme for point-to-point wiretap channels with causal CSI. We further investigate some capacity-achieving cases for state-dependent multiple access wiretap channels (SD-MAWCs) with degraded message sets.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the joint state estimation and control problems for unknown linear time-invariant systems subject to both process and measurement noise. The aim is to redesign the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller based solely on data. The LQG controller comprises a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and a steady-state Kalman observer; while the data-based LQR design problem has been previously studied, constructing the Kalman gain and the LQG controller from noisy data presents a novel challenge. In this work, a data-based formulation for computing the steady-state Kalman gain is proposed based on semi-definite programming (SDP) using some noise-free input-state-output data. Additionally, a data-based LQG controller is developed, which is shown to be equivalent to the model-based LQG controller. For cases where offline data are corrupted by noise, a robust data-based observer gain is constructed by tackling a relaxed SDP. The proposed controllers are proven to achieve robust global exponential stability (RGES) for state estimation and input-to-state practical stability (ISpS) under standard conditions. Finally, numerical tests are conducted to validate the proposed controllers' correctness and effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "With the advent of deep learning methods, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems have become increasingly powerful. However, deep learning based systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible changes to the input can cause undesirable changes at the output of the system. To date there has been little work investigating adversarial attacks on sequence-to-sequence systems, such as NMT models. Previous work in NMT has examined attacks with the aim of introducing target phrases in the output sequence. In this work, adversarial attacks for NMT systems are explored from an output perception perspective. Thus the aim of an attack is to change the perception of the output sequence, without altering the perception of the input sequence. For example, an adversary may distort the sentiment of translated reviews to have an exaggerated positive sentiment. In practice it is challenging to run extensive human perception experiments, so a proxy deep-learning classifier applied to the NMT output is used to measure perception changes. Experiments demonstrate that the sentiment perception of NMT systems' output sequences can be changed significantly. ",

SZCCSs are used in developing optimal training sequences for broadband generalized spatial modulation systems over frequency-selective channels because they have ZCZ width on both the front and tail ends. The construction of optimal SZCCS with large set sizes and prime power lengths is presented for the first time in this paper. Furthermore, it is worth noting that several existing works on ZCCS and SZCCS can be viewed as special cases of the proposed construction. ",

Multimedia Information Retrieval has filled this gap and has witnessed exciting progress in recent years. Tasks such as search and retrieval of extensive multimedia archives have undergone massive performance improvements, driven to a large extent by recent developments in multimodal deep learning. However, methods in this field remain limited in the kinds of queries they support and, in particular, their inability to answer database-like queries. For this reason, inspired by recent work on neural databases, we propose a new framework, which we name Multimodal Neural Databases (MMNDBs). MMNDBs can answer complex database-like queries that involve reasoning over different input modalities, such as text and images, at scale. In this paper, we present the first architecture able to fulfill this set of requirements and test it with several baselines, showing the limitations of currently available models. The results show the potential of these new techniques to process unstructured data coming from different modalities, paving the way for future research in the area.

As our main contribution, we present an efficient method to compute these partial derivatives. To scale our approach to models with thousands of parameters, we present an extension of this method that selects the subset of $k$ parameters with the highest partial derivative. Our methods are based on linear programming and differentiating these programs around a given value for the parameters. The experiments show the applicability of our approach on models with over a million states and thousands of parameters.

We found that adding a sentence embedding loss term reduces overfitting, but also increased SPIDEr from 0.397 to 0.418 in our first setting on the AudioCaps corpus. When we increased the weight decay value, we found our model to be much closer to the current state-of-the-art methods, with a SPIDEr score up to 0.444 compared to a 0.475 score. Moreover, this model uses eight times less trainable parameters. In this training setting, the sentence embedding loss has no more impact on the model performance. ",

We reinforce several data pre-processing and refinement methods along with a window-based cross-attention ViT to squeeze the best of the data. We also employ learnable anchor points in the embedding space with label distributions and multi-head self-attention mechanism to optimize performance against weak predictions with reliability balancing, which is a strategy that leverages anchor points, attention scores, and confidence values to enhance the resilience of label predictions. To ensure correct label classification and improve the models' discriminative power, we introduce anchor loss, which encourages large margins between anchor points. Additionally, the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which is also trainable, plays an integral role in identifying accurate labels. This approach provides critical elements for improving the reliability of predictions and has a substantial positive effect on final prediction capabilities. Our adaptive model can be integrated with any deep neural network to forestall challenges in various recognition tasks.

The binary-state network is a basic network, where the state of each component is either success or failure, i.e., the binary-state. Network reliability plays an important role in evaluating the performance of network planning, design, and management. Because more networks are being set up in the real world currently, there is a need for their reliability. It is necessary to build a reliable network within a limited budget. However, existing studies are focused on the budget limit for each minimal path (MP) in networks without considering the total budget of the entire network. We propose a novel concept to consider how to build a more reliable binary-state network under the budget limit. In addition, we propose an algorithm based on the binary-addition-tree algorithm (BAT) and stepwise vectors to solve the problem efficiently. ",

In pursuit of better quality, the model size and complexity grow over time, which requires additional training data to avoid overfitting. This model growth demands a large number of resources in data centers. Hence, training efficiency is becoming considerably more important to keep the data center power demand manageable. In Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM), sparse features capturing categorical inputs through embedding tables are the major contributors to model size and require high memory bandwidth. In this paper, we study the bandwidth requirement and locality of embedding tables in real-world deployed models. We observe that the bandwidth requirement is not uniform across different tables and that embedding tables show high temporal locality. We then design MTrainS, which leverages heterogeneous memory, including byte and block addressable Storage Class Memory for DLRM hierarchically. MTrainS allows for higher memory capacity per node and increases training efficiency by lowering the need to scale out to multiple hosts in memory capacity bound use cases. By optimizing the platform memory hierarchy, we reduce the number of nodes for training by 4-8X, saving power and cost of training while meeting our target training performance. ",

Our method EXPLAIGNN overcomes these limitations by integrating information from a mixture of sources with user-comprehensible explanations for answers. It constructs a heterogeneous graph from entities and evidence snippets retrieved from a KB, a text corpus, web tables, and infoboxes. This large graph is then iteratively reduced via graph neural networks that incorporate question-level attention, until the best answers and their explanations are distilled.

In this paper, a novel framework named TTEA -- Type-enhanced Ensemble Triple Representation via Triple-aware Attention for Cross-lingual Entity Alignment is proposed to overcome the above issues considering ensemble triple specificity and entity role features. Specifically, the ensemble triple representation is derived by regarding relation as information carrier between semantic space and type space, and hence the noise influence during spatial transformation and information propagation can be smoothly controlled via specificity-aware triple attention. Moreover, our framework uses triple-ware entity enhancement to model the role diversity of triple elements.

However, most commonly used models may underestimate the influence of newly published papers over time, and fail to encapsulate this dynamics of citation network into the graph. In this study, we construct hierarchical and heterogeneous graphs for target papers with an annual perspective. The constructed graphs can record the annual dynamics of target papers' scientific context information. Then, a novel graph neural network, Hierarchical and Heterogeneous Contrastive Graph Learning Model (H2CGL), is proposed to incorporate heterogeneity and dynamics of the citation network. H2CGL separately aggregates the heterogeneous information for each year and prioritizes the highly-cited papers and relationships among references, citations, and the target paper. It then employs a weighted GIN to capture dynamics between heterogeneous subgraphs over years. Moreover, it leverages contrastive learning to make the graph representations more sensitive to potential citations. Particularly, co-cited or co-citing papers of the target paper with large citation gap are taken as hard negative samples, while randomly dropping low-cited papers could generate positive samples. Extensive experimental results on two scholarly datasets demonstrate that the proposed H2CGL significantly outperforms a series of baseline approaches for both previously and freshly published papers.

Annotating a large database in the medical setting is expensive and time-consuming, typically requiring the collaboration of several experts over years.

In this work, we experiment with self-supervised pre-training of a convolutional neural network on large audio datasets. We show that pre-training with SSL contrastive loss (SimCLR) performs significantly better than supervised pre-training for both neuro injury and cry triggers. In addition, we demonstrate further performance gains through SSL-based domain adaptation using unlabeled infant cries.

We study the details of this manifold to find that networks with different architectures follow distinguishable trajectories but other factors have a minimal influence; larger networks train along a similar manifold as that of smaller networks, just faster; and networks initialized at very different parts of the prediction space converge to the solution along a similar manifold.

    "abstract": "Computational models of syntax are predominantly text-based. Here we propose that basic syntax can be modeled directly from raw speech in a fully unsupervised way. We focus on one of the most ubiquitous and basic properties of syntax -- concatenation. We introduce spontaneous concatenation: a phenomenon where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on acoustic recordings of individual words start generating outputs with two or even three words concatenated without ever accessing data with multiple words in the input. Additionally, networks trained on two words learn to embed words into novel unobserved word combinations. To our knowledge, this is a previously unreported property of CNNs trained on raw speech in the Generative Adversarial Network setting and has implications both for our understanding of how these architectures learn as well as for modeling syntax and its evolution from raw acoustic inputs.

    "abstract": "Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.

    "abstract": "Stochastic allocation of resources in the context of wireless systems ultimately demands reactive decision making for meaningfully optimizing network-wide random utilities, while respecting certain resource constraints. Standard ergodic-optimal policies are however susceptible to the statistical variability of fading, often leading to systems which are severely unreliable and spectrally wasteful. On the flip side, minimax/outage-optimal policies are too pessimistic and often hard to determine. We propose a new risk-aware formulation of the resource allocation problem for standard multi-user point-to-point power-constrained communication with no cross-interference, by employing the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CV@R) as a measure of fading risk. A remarkable feature of this approach is that it is a convex generalization of the ergodic setting while inducing robustness and reliability in a fully tunable way, thus bridging the gap between the (naive) ergodic and (conservative) minimax approaches. We provide a closed-form expression for the CV@R-optimal policy given primal/dual variables, extending the classical stochastic waterfilling policy. We then develop a primal-dual tail-waterfilling scheme to recursively learn a globally optimal risk-aware policy. The effectiveness of the approach is verified via detailed simulations. ",

While there is enormous progress towards learning the structure to property relationship of materials, methods that allow for general representations of crystals to effectively explore the vast material search space and identify high-performance candidates remain limited. In this work, we introduce a material discovery framework that uses natural language embeddings derived from material science-specific language models as representations of compositional and structural features. The discovery framework consists of a joint scheme that, given a query material, first recalls candidates based on representational similarity, and ranks the candidates based on target properties through multi-task learning. The contextual knowledge encoded in language representations is found to convey information about material properties and structures, enabling both similarity analysis for recall, and multi-task learning to share information for related properties. By applying the discovery framework to thermoelectric materials, we demonstrate diversified recommendations of prototype structures and identify under-studied high-performance material spaces, including halide perovskite, delafossite-like, and spinel-like structures. By leveraging material language representations, our framework provides a generalized means for effective material recommendation, which is task-agnostic and can be applied to various material systems.

    "abstract": "Voice communication between air traffic controllers (ATCos) and pilots is critical for ensuring safe and efficient air traffic control (ATC). This task requires high levels of awareness from ATCos and can be tedious and error-prone. Recent attempts have been made to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into ATC in order to reduce the workload of ATCos. However, the development of data-driven AI systems for ATC demands large-scale annotated datasets, which are currently lacking in the field. This paper explores the lessons learned from the ATCO2 project, a project that aimed to develop a unique platform to collect and preprocess large amounts of ATC data from airspace in real time. Audio and surveillance data were collected from publicly accessible radio frequency channels with VHF receivers owned by a community of volunteers and later uploaded to Opensky Network servers, which can be considered an \"unlimited source\" of data. In addition, this paper reviews previous work from ATCO2 partners, including (i) robust automatic speech recognition, (ii) natural language processing, (iii) English language identification of ATC communications, and (iv) the integration of surveillance data such as ADS-B. We believe that the pipeline developed during the ATCO2 project, along with the open-sourcing of its data, will encourage research in the ATC field. A sample of the ATCO2 corpus is available on the following website: https://www.atco2.org/data, while the full corpus can be purchased through ELDA at this http URL We demonstrated that ATCO2 is an appropriate dataset to develop ASR engines when little or near to no ATC in-domain data is available. For instance, with the CNN-TDNNf kaldi model, we reached the performance of as low as 17.9% and 24.9% WER on public ATC datasets which is 6.6/7.6% better than \"out-of-domain\" but supervised CNN-TDNNf model.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient self-supervised arbitrary-scale super-resolution (SR) framework to reconstruct isotropic magnetic resonance (MR) images from anisotropic MRI inputs without involving external training data. The proposed framework builds a training dataset using in-the-wild anisotropic MR volumes with arbitrary image resolution. We then formulate the 3D volume SR task as a SR problem for 2D image slices. The anisotropic volume's high-resolution (HR) plane is used to build the HR-LR image pairs for model training. We further adapt the implicit neural representation (INR) network to implement the 2D arbitrary-scale image SR model. Finally, we leverage the well-trained proposed model to up-sample the 2D LR plane extracted from the anisotropic MR volumes to their HR views. The isotropic MR volumes thus can be reconstructed by stacking and averaging the generated HR slices. Our proposed framework has two major advantages: (1) It only involves the arbitrary-resolution anisotropic MR volumes, which greatly improves the model practicality in real MR imaging scenarios (e.g., clinical brain image acquisition); (2) The INR-based SR model enables arbitrary-scale image SR from the arbitrary-resolution input image, which significantly improves model training efficiency. We perform experiments on a simulated public adult brain dataset and a real collected 7T brain dataset. The results indicate that our current framework greatly outperforms two well-known self-supervised models for anisotropic MR image SR tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Graph learning from signals is a core task in Graph Signal Processing (GSP). One of the most commonly used models to learn graphs from stationary signals is SpecT. However, its practical formulation rSpecT is known to be sensitive to hyperparameter selection and, even worse, to suffer from infeasibility. In this paper, we give the first condition that guarantees the infeasibility of rSpecT and design a novel model (LogSpecT) and its practical formulation (rLogSpecT) to overcome this issue. Contrary to rSpecT, the novel practical model rLogSpecT is always feasible. Furthermore, we provide recovery guarantees of rLogSpecT, which are derived from modern optimization tools related to epi-convergence. These tools could be of independent interest and significant for various learning problems. To demonstrate the advantages of rLogSpecT in practice, a highly efficient algorithm based on the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (L-ADMM) is proposed. The subproblems of L-ADMM admit closed-form solutions and the convergence is guaranteed. Extensive numerical results on both synthetic and real networks corroborate the stability and superiority of our proposed methods, underscoring their potential for various graph learning applications.

    "abstract": "Molecular relational learning, whose goal is to learn the interaction behavior between molecular pairs, got a surge of interest in molecular sciences due to its wide range of applications. Recently, graph neural networks have recently shown great success in molecular relational learning by modeling a molecule as a graph structure, and considering atom-level interactions between two molecules. Despite their success, existing molecular relational learning methods tend to overlook the nature of chemistry, i.e., a chemical compound is composed of multiple substructures such as functional groups that cause distinctive chemical reactions. In this work, we propose a novel relational learning framework, called CGIB, that predicts the interaction behavior between a pair of graphs by detecting core subgraphs therein. The main idea is, given a pair of graphs, to find a subgraph from a graph that contains the minimal sufficient information regarding the task at hand conditioned on the paired graph based on the principle of conditional graph information bottleneck. We argue that our proposed method mimics the nature of chemical reactions, i.e., the core substructure of a molecule varies depending on which other molecule it interacts with. Extensive experiments on various tasks with real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of CGIB over state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Namkyeong/CGIB. ",

Although the practice is illegal with traditional assets, lack of supervision in the non-fungible token market enables criminals to wash trade and scam unsuspecting buyers while operating under regulators radar. AnChain.AI designed an algorithm that flags transactions within an NFT collection history as wash trades when a wallet repurchases a token within 30 days of previously selling it. The algorithm also identifies intermediate transactions within a wash trade cycle. Testing on 7 popular NFT collections reveals that on average, 0.14% of transactions, 0.11% of wallets, and 0.16% of tokens in each collection are involved in wash trading. These wash trades generate an overall total price manipulation, sales, and repurchase profit of \\$900K, \\$1.1M, and negative \\$1.6M respectively. The results draw attention to the prevalent market manipulation taking place and inform unsuspecting buyers which tokens and sellers may be involved in criminal activity. ",

We obtain a model that is able to explain 75\\% of the family members' satisfaction with one another. We found three indicators for more satisfied families. First, larger families, on average, have more satisfied members. Moreover, families with kids from the same parents - i.e., without step-siblings also express more satisfaction from both their siblings and parents when the children are already adults. Lastly, the average satisfaction of the family's oldest alive generation has a positive linear and non-linear correlation with the satisfaction of the entire extended family. ",
