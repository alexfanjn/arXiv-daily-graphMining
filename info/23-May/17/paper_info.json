    "title": "Spiking Network Initialisation and Firing Rate Collapse",
    "abstract": "In recent years, newly developed methods to train spiking neural networks (SNNs) have rendered them as a plausible alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in terms of accuracy, while at the same time being much more energy efficient at inference and potentially at training time. However, it is still unclear what constitutes a good initialisation for an SNN. We often use initialisation schemes developed for ANN training which are often inadequate and require manual tuning. In this paper, we attempt to tackle this issue by using techniques from the ANN initialisation literature as well as computational neuroscience results. We show that the problem of weight initialisation for ANNs is a more nuanced problem than it is for ANNs due to the spike-and-reset non-linearity of SNNs and the firing rate collapse problem. We firstly identify and propose several solutions to the firing rate collapse problem under different sets of assumptions which successfully solve the issue by leveraging classical random walk and Wiener processes results. Secondly, we devise a general strategy for SNN initialisation which combines variance propagation techniques from ANNs and different methods to obtain the expected firing rate and membrane potential distribution based on diffusion and shot-noise approximations. Altogether, we obtain theoretical results to solve the SNN initialisation which consider the membrane potential distribution in the presence of a threshold. Yet, to what extent can these methods be successfully applied to SNNs on real datasets remains an open question. ",

    "abstract": "Optimizing energy consumption and coordination of utility systems have long been a concern of the building industry. Buildings are one of the largest energy consumers in the world, making their energy efficiency crucial for preventing waste and reducing costs. Additionally, buildings generate substantial amounts of raw data, which can be used to understand energy consumption patterns and assist in developing optimization strategies. Using a real-world dataset, this research aims to identify the factors that influence building cost reduction and energy consumption. To achieve this, we utilize three regression models (Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) to predict primary fuel usage, electrical energy consumption, and cost savings in buildings. An analysis of the factors influencing energy consumption and cost reduction is conducted, and the decision tree algorithm is optimized using metaheuristics. By employing metaheuristic techniques, we fine-tune the decision tree algorithm's parameters and improve its accuracy. Finally, we review the most practical features of potential and nonpotential buildings that can reduce primary fuel usage, electrical energy consumption, and costs ",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy time series forecasting (FTSF) is a typical forecasting method with wide application. Traditional FTSF is regarded as an expert system which leads to lose the ability to recognize undefined feature. The mentioned is main reason of poor forecasting with FTSF. To solve the problem, the proposed model Differential Fuzzy Convolutional Neural Network (DFCNN) utilizes convolution neural network to re-implement FTSF with learnable ability. DFCNN is capable of recognizing the potential information and improve the forecasting accuracy. Thanks to learnable ability of neural network, length of fuzzy rules established in FTSF is expended to arbitrary length which expert is not able to be handle by expert system. At the same time, FTSF usually cannot achieve satisfactory performance of non-stationary time series due to trend of non-stationary time series. The trend of non-stationary time series causes the fuzzy set established by FTSF to invalid and cause the forecasting to fail. DFCNN utilizes the Difference algorithm to weaken the non-stationarity of time series, so that DFCNN can forecast the non-stationary time series with low error that FTSF cannot forecast in satisfactory performance. After mass of experiments, DFCNN has excellent prediction effect, which is ahead of the existing FTSF and common time series forecasting algorithms. Finally, DFCNN provides further ideas for improving FTSF and holds continued research value. ",

    "abstract": "Billboard advertising is a popular out-of-home advertising technique adopted by commercial houses. Companies own billboards and offer them to commercial houses on a payment basis. Given a database of billboards with slot information, we want to determine which k slots to choose to maximize influence. We call this the INFLUENTIAL BILLBOARD SLOT SELECTION (IBSS) Problem and pose it as a combinatorial optimization problem. We show that the influence function considered in this paper is non-negative, monotone, and submodular. The incremental greedy approach based on the marginal gain computation leads to a constant factor approximation guarantee. However, this method scales very poorly when the size of the problem instance is very large. To address this, we propose a spatial partitioning and pruned submodularity graph-based approach that is divided into the following three steps: preprocessing, pruning, and selection. We analyze the proposed solution approaches to understand their time, space requirement, and performance guarantee. We conduct extensive set of experiments with real-world datasets and compare the performance of the proposed solution approaches with the available baseline methods. We observe that the proposed approaches lead to more influence than all the baseline methods within reasonable computational time. ",

    "abstract": "Interpreting the inner function of neural networks is crucial for the trustworthy development and deployment of these black-box models. Prior interpretability methods focus on correlation-based measures to attribute model decisions to individual examples. However, these measures are susceptible to noise and spurious correlations encoded in the model during the training phase (e.g., biased inputs, model overfitting, or misspecification). Moreover, this process has proven to result in noisy and unstable attributions that prevent any transparent understanding of the model's behavior. In this paper, we develop a robust interventional-based method grounded by causal analysis to capture cause-effect mechanisms in pre-trained neural networks and their relation to the prediction. Our novel approach relies on path interventions to infer the causal mechanisms within hidden layers and isolate relevant and necessary information (to model prediction), avoiding noisy ones. The result is task-specific causal explanatory graphs that can audit model behavior and express the actual causes underlying its performance. We apply our method to vision models trained on classification tasks. On image classification tasks, we provide extensive quantitative experiments to show that our approach can capture more stable and faithful explanations than standard attribution-based methods. Furthermore, the underlying causal graphs reveal the neural interactions in the model, making it a valuable tool in other applications (e.g., model repair). ",

We propose three methods to efficiently reduce the variance of the gradient estimation in the neural network training process.

We present results of our efforts to apply this approach to estimate homelessness at the state level throughout the US during the period 2010-2019 and 2022 using a dataset of roughly 1 million geotagged tweets containing the substring ``homeless.'' Correlations between homelessness-related tweet counts and ranked per capita homelessness volume, but not general-population densities, suggest a relationship between the likelihood of Twitter users to personally encounter or observe homelessness in their everyday lives and their likelihood to communicate about it online. An increase to the log-odds of ``homeless'' appearing in an English-language tweet, as well as an acceleration in the increase in average tweet sentiment, suggest that tweets about homelessness are also affected by trends at the nation-scale. Additionally, changes to the lexical content of tweets over time suggest that reversals to the polarity of national or state-level trends may be detectable through an increase in political or service-sector language over the semantics of charity or direct appeals. An analysis of user account type also revealed changes to Twitter-use patterns by accounts authored by individuals versus entities that may provide an additional signal to confirm changes to homelessness density in a given jurisdiction. While a computational approach to social media analysis may provide a low-cost, real-time dataset rich with information about nationwide and localized impacts of homelessness and homelessness policy, we find that practical issues abound, limiting the potential of social media as a proxy to complement other measures of homelessness.

Traditional signature-based malware detection methods have become ineffective in detecting new and unknown malware due to their rapid evolution. One of the most promising techniques that can overcome the limitations of signature-based detection is to use control flow graphs (CFGs). CFGs leverage the structural information of a program to represent the possible paths of execution as a graph, where nodes represent instructions and edges represent control flow dependencies. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are being used to extract these features from CFGs and classify them as malicious or benign. In this survey, we aim to review some state-of-the-art methods for malware detection through CFGs using ML, focusing on the different ways of extracting, representing, and classifying. Specifically, we present a comprehensive overview of different types of CFG features that have been used as well as different ML algorithms that have been applied to CFG-based malware detection. We provide an in-depth analysis of the challenges and limitations of these approaches, as well as suggest potential solutions to address some open problems and promising future directions for research in this field.

Hierarchical FL (HFL), as a device-edge-cloud aggregation hierarchy, can enjoy both the cloud server's access to more datasets and the edge servers' efficient communications with devices. However, the learning latency increases with the HFL network scale due to the increasing number of edge servers and devices with limited local computation capability and communication bandwidth. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce model pruning for HFL in wireless networks to reduce the neural network scale. We present the convergence analysis of an upper on the l2 norm of gradients for HFL with model pruning, analyze the computation and communication latency of the proposed model pruning scheme, and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the convergence rate under a given latency threshold by jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation. By decoupling the optimization problem and using Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions, closed-form solutions of pruning ratio and wireless resource allocation are derived. Simulation results show that our proposed HFL with model pruning achieves similar learning accuracy compared with the HFL without model pruning and reduces about 50 percent communication cost. ",

The model uses a convolutional long-short term memory (ConvLSTM) to capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of the state evolution dynamics in the porous flow. The ConvLSTM is linked to the state space equations, enabling the incorporation of a discrete-time sequence of well control. The model requires initial state condition and a sequence of well controls as inputs, and predicts the state variables of the system, such as pressure, as output. By minimizing the residuals of reservoir flow state-space equations, the network is trained without the need for labeled data. The model is designed to serve as a surrogate model for predicting future reservoir states based on the initial reservoir state and input engineering controls. Boundary conditions are enforced into the state-space equations so no additional loss term is needed. Three numerical cases are studied, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in predicting reservoir dynamics based on future well/system controls. The proposed model provides a new approach for efficient and accurate prediction of subsurface fluid flow, with potential applications in optimal control design for reservoir engineering. ",

Automatic code generation that produces a code snippet from a natural language description can be a promising technique to accelerate ML programming tasks. In recent years, although many deep learning-based neural code generation models have been proposed with high accuracy, the fact that most of them are mainly evaluated on general programming tasks calls into question their effectiveness and usefulness in ML programming tasks. In this paper, we set out to investigate the effectiveness of existing neural code generation models on ML programming tasks. For our analysis, we select six state-of-the-art neural code generation models, and evaluate their performance on four widely used ML libraries, with newly-created 83K pairs of natural-language described ML programming tasks. Our empirical study reveals some good, bad, and missing aspects of neural code generation models on ML tasks, with a few major ones listed below. (Good) Neural code generation models perform significantly better on ML tasks than on non-ML tasks. (Bad) Most of the generated code is semantically incorrect. (Bad) Code generation models cannot significantly improve developers' completion time. (Good) The generated code can help developers write more correct code by providing developers with clues for using correct APIs. (Missing) The observation from our user study reveals the missing aspects of code generation for ML tasks, e.g., decomposing code generation for divide-and-conquer into two tasks: API sequence identification and API usage generation.

We develop a framework relying on Toeplitz representation of CNNs, and then utilize it to reveal the Hessian structure and, in particular, its rank. We prove tight upper bounds (with linear activations), which closely follow the empirical trend of the Hessian rank and hold in practice in more general settings.

    "abstract": "Graph representation learning (a.k.a. network embedding) is a significant topic of network analysis, due to its effectiveness to support various graph inference tasks. In this paper, we study the representation learning with multiple information sources in attributed graphs. Recent studies usually focus on several specific sources (e.g., high-order proximity and node attributes) but few of them can be extended to incorporate other available sources not specified. In addition, most existing methods assume that all the integrated sources share consistent latent features but may ignore the possible inconsistency among them, lacking the required robustness. To address these issues, we propose a novel adaptive hybrid graph representation (AHGR) method from a view of graph reweighting, where each information source is formulated as a corresponding auxiliary graph, enabling AHGR to integrate arbitrary available information sources. Moreover, a new transition relation among the reweighted graphs is then introduced to perceive and resist the possible inconsistency among multiple sources, enhancing the robustness of AHGR. We verify the effectiveness of AHGR on a series of synthetic and real attributed graphs, where it presents superior performance over other baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Generative modeling and self-supervised learning have in recent years made great strides towards learning from data in a completely unsupervised way. There is still however an open area of investigation into guiding a neural network to encode the data into representations that are interpretable or explainable. The problem of unsupervised disentanglement is of particular importance as it proposes to discover the different latent factors of variation or semantic concepts from the data alone, without labeled examples, and encode them into structurally disjoint latent representations. Without additional constraints or inductive biases placed in the network, a generative model may learn the data distribution and encode the factors, but not necessarily in a disentangled way. Here, we introduce a novel deep generative VAE-based model, ProtoVAE, that leverages a deep metric learning Prototypical network trained using self-supervision to impose these constraints. The prototypical network constrains the mapping of the representation space to data space to ensure that controlled changes in the representation space are mapped to changes in the factors of variations in the data space. Our model is completely unsupervised and requires no a priori knowledge of the dataset, including the number of factors. We evaluate our proposed model on the benchmark dSprites, 3DShapes, and MPI3D disentanglement datasets, showing state of the art results against previous methods via qualitative traversals in the latent space, as well as quantitative disentanglement metrics. We further qualitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the real-world CelebA dataset. ",

Meta-learning for classifier selection gains knowledge from characteristics of different datasets and/or previous performance of machine learning techniques to make better decisions for the current modeling process. Meta-learning approaches first collect meta-data that describe this prior experience and then use it as input for an algorithm selection model. In this paper, however, we propose an automatic learning scheme in which we train convolutional networks directly with the information of tabular datasets for binary classification. The goal of this study is to learn the inherent structure of the data without identifying meta-features. Experiments with simulated datasets show that the proposed approach achieves nearly perfect performance in identifying linear and nonlinear patterns, outperforming the traditional two-step method based on meta-features. The proposed method is then applied to real-world datasets, making suggestions about the best classifiers that can be considered based on the structure of the data. ",

    "abstract": "Symbolic control problems aim to synthesize control policies for dynamical systems under complex temporal specifications. For such problems, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is increasingly used as the formal specification language due to its rich expressiveness. Moreover, the degree of satisfaction of STL specifications can be evaluated using ``STL robust semantics'' as a scalar robustness measure. This capability of STL enables transforming a symbolic control problem into an optimization problem that optimizes the corresponding robustness measure. However, since these robustness measures are non-smooth and non-convex, exact solutions can only be computed using computationally inefficient mixed-integer programming techniques that do not scale well. Therefore, recent literature has focused on using smooth approximations of these robustness measures to apply scalable and computationally efficient gradient-based methods to find local optima solutions. In this paper, we first generalize two recently established smooth robustness measures (SRMs) and two new ones and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Next, we propose ``STL error semantics'' to characterize the approximation errors associated with different SRMs under different parameter configurations. This allows one to sensibly select an SRM (to optimize) along with its parameter values. We then propose ``STL gradient semantics'' to derive explicit gradients of SRMs leading to improve computational efficiency as well as accuracy compared to when using numerically estimated gradients. Finally, these contributions are highlighted using extensive simulation results. ",

While most recent efforts in adapting TL techniques to estimate average causal effect (ACE) have been focused on the heterogeneous covariate space setting, those methods are inadequate for tackling the TCL problem since their algorithm designs are based on the decomposition into shared and domain-specific covariate spaces. To address this issue, we propose a generic framework called \\texttt{$\\ell_1$-TCL}, which incorporates $\\ell_1$ regularized TL for nuisance parameter estimation and downstream plug-in ACE estimators, including outcome regression, inverse probability weighted, and doubly robust estimators. Most importantly, with the help of Lasso for high-dimensional regression, we establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantees for the generalized linear model (GLM) under the sparsity assumption for the proposed \\texttt{$\\ell_1$-TCL}. Moreover, the success of \\texttt{$\\ell_1$-TCL} could inspire the adaptations of many recently proposed principled approaches in statistics literature to be adapted to this novel TCL problem. From an empirical perspective, \\texttt{$\\ell_1$-TCL} is a generic learning framework that can incorporate not only GLM but also many recently developed non-parametric methods, which can enhance robustness to model mis-specification. We demonstrate this empirical benefit through extensive experiments using GLM and recent neural network based \\texttt{$\\ell_1$-TCL} on both benchmark semi-synthetic and real datasets, which shows improved performance compared with existing TL approaches for ACE estimation.

DualGenerator introduces a local refinement module in generation paths, which captures general structures from partial inputs, and then refines shape details of the point cloud.

Figuring out the properties of such polytopes is of fundamental importance for the research and development of neural networks. So far, either theoretical or empirical studies on polytopes only stay at the level of counting their number, which is far from a complete characterization of polytopes. To upgrade the characterization to a new level, here we propose to study the shapes of polytopes via the number of simplices obtained by triangulating the polytope. Then, by computing and analyzing the histogram of simplices across polytopes, we find that a ReLU network has relatively simple polytopes under both initialization and gradient descent, although these polytopes theoretically can be rather diverse and complicated. This finding can be appreciated as a novel implicit bias. Next, we use nontrivial combinatorial derivation to theoretically explain why adding depth does not create a more complicated polytope by bounding the average number of faces of polytopes with a function of the dimensionality. Our results concretely reveal what kind of simple functions a network learns and its space partition property. Also, by characterizing the shape of polytopes, the number of simplices be a leverage for other problems, \\textit{e.g.}, serving as a generic functional complexity measure to explain the power of popular shortcut networks such as ResNet and analyzing the impact of different regularization strategies on a network's space partition.

Based on our findings, we propose a dual-alignment pre-training (DAP) framework for cross-lingual sentence embedding that incorporates both sentence-level and token-level alignment. To achieve this, we introduce a novel representation translation learning (RTL) task, where the model learns to use one-side contextualized token representation to reconstruct its translation counterpart. This reconstruction objective encourages the model to embed translation information into the token representation. Compared to other token-level alignment methods such as translation language modeling, RTL is more suitable for dual encoder architectures and is computationally efficient. Extensive experiments on three sentence-level cross-lingual benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve sentence embedding.

Borrowing techniques from Statistical Machine Translation, we propose intermediate signals which are intermediate sequences from the \"source-like\" structure to the \"target-like\" structure. Such intermediate sequences introduce an inductive bias that reflects a domain-agnostic principle of translation, which reduces spurious correlations that are harmful to out-of-domain generalisation. Furthermore, we introduce a full-permutation multi-task learning to alleviate the spurious causal relations from intermediate sequences to the target, which results from exposure bias. The Minimum Bayes Risk decoding algorithm is used to pick the best candidate translation from all permutations to further improve the performance. Experiments show that the introduced intermediate signals can effectively improve the domain robustness of NMT and reduces the amount of hallucinations on out-of-domain translation. Further analysis shows that our methods are especially promising in low-resource scenarios. ",

Meanwhile, recent advancements in computer vision (CV), propelled by deep learning, have led to significant progress in optical flow estimation, a task closely related to motion perception. Here we propose an image-computable model of human motion perception by bridging the gap between human and CV models. Specifically, we introduce a novel two-stage approach that combines trainable motion energy sensing with a recurrent self-attention network for adaptive motion integration and segregation. This model architecture aims to capture the computations in V1-MT, the core structure for motion perception in the biological visual system. In silico neurophysiology reveals that our model's unit responses are similar to mammalian neural recordings regarding motion pooling and speed tuning. The proposed model can also replicate human responses to a range of stimuli examined in past psychophysical studies. The experimental results on the Sintel benchmark demonstrate that our model predicts human responses better than the ground truth, whereas the CV models show the opposite. Further partial correlation analysis indicates our model outperforms several state-of-the-art CV models in explaining the human responses that deviate from the ground truth.

In this research, we aim to uncover the inherent generalization properties, i.e., inductive bias, of RNNs with respect to how frequently RNNs switch the outputs through time steps in the sequence classification task, which we call output sequence frequency. Previous work analyzed inductive bias by training models with a few synthetic data and comparing the model's generalization with candidate generalization patterns. However, when examining the output sequence frequency, previous methods cannot be directly applied since enumerating candidate patterns is computationally difficult for longer sequences. To this end, we propose to directly calculate the output sequence frequency for each model by regarding the outputs of the model as discrete-time signals and applying frequency domain analysis. Experimental results showed that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) have an inductive bias towards lower-frequency patterns, while Elman RNN tends to learn patterns in which the output changes at high frequencies. We also found that the inductive bias of LSTM and GRU varies with the number of layers and the size of hidden layers. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of aerodynamic forces in real-time is crucial for autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper presents a data-driven aerodynamic force prediction model based on a small number of pressure sensors located on the surface of UAV. The model is built on a linear term that can make a reasonably accurate prediction and a nonlinear correction for accuracy improvement. The linear term is based on a reduced basis reconstruction of the surface pressure distribution, where the basis is extracted from numerical simulation data and the basis coefficients are determined by solving linear pressure reconstruction equations at a set of sensor locations. Sensor placement is optimized using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Aerodynamic forces are computed by integrating the reconstructed surface pressure distribution. The nonlinear term is an artificial neural network (NN) that is trained to bridge the gap between the ground truth and the DEIM prediction, especially in the scenario where the DEIM model is constructed from simulation data with limited fidelity. A large network is not necessary for accurate correction as the linear model already captures the main dynamics of the surface pressure field, thus yielding an efficient DEIM+NN aerodynamic force prediction model. The model is tested on numerical and experimental dynamic stall data of a 2D NACA0015 airfoil, and numerical simulation data of dynamic stall of a 3D drone. Numerical results demonstrate that the machine learning enhanced model can make fast and accurate predictions of aerodynamic forces using only a few pressure sensors, even for the NACA0015 case in which the simulations do not agree well with the wind tunnel experiments. Furthermore, the model is robust to noise. ",

    "abstract": "Counterfactual outcome prediction in longitudinal data has recently gained attention due to its potential applications in healthcare and social sciences. In this paper, we explore the use of the state space model, a popular sequence model, for this task. Specifically, we compare the performance of two models: Treatment Effect Neural Controlled Differential Equation (TE-CDE) and structured state space model (S4Model). While TE-CDE uses controlled differential equations to address time-dependent confounding, it suffers from optimization issues and slow training. In contrast, S4Model is more efficient at modeling long-range dependencies and easier to train. We evaluate the models on a simulated lung tumor growth dataset and find that S4Model outperforms TE-CDE with 1.63x reduction in per epoch training time and 10x better normalized mean squared error. Additionally, S4Model is more stable during training and less sensitive to weight initialization than TE-CDE. Our results suggest that the state space model may be a promising approach for counterfactual outcome prediction in longitudinal data, with S4Model offering a more efficient and effective alternative to TE-CDE.

    "abstract": "We propose a privacy-preserving ensemble infused enhanced Deep Neural Network (DNN) based learning framework in this paper for Internet-of-Things (IoT), edge, and cloud convergence in the context of healthcare. In the convergence, edge server is used for both storing IoT produced bioimage and hosting DNN algorithm for local model training. The cloud is used for ensembling local models. The DNN-based training process of a model with a local dataset suffers from low accuracy, which can be improved by the aforementioned convergence and Ensemble Learning. The ensemble learning allows multiple participants to outsource their local model for producing a generalized final model with high accuracy. Nevertheless, Ensemble Learning elevates the risk of leaking sensitive private data from the final model. The proposed framework presents a Differential Privacy-based privacy-preserving DNN with Transfer Learning for a local model generation to ensure minimal loss and higher efficiency at edge server. We conduct several experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework. ",

    "abstract": "Band selection has a great impact on the spectral recovery quality. To solve this ill-posed inverse problem, most band selection methods adopt hand-crafted priors or exploit clustering or sparse regularization constraints to find most prominent bands. These methods are either very slow due to the computational cost of repeatedly training with respect to different selection frequencies or different band combinations. Many traditional methods rely on the scene prior and thus are not applicable to other scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel one-shot Neural Band Selection (NBS) framework for spectral recovery. Unlike conventional searching approaches with a discrete search space and a non-differentiable search strategy, our NBS is based on the continuous relaxation of the band selection process, thus allowing efficient band search using gradient descent. To enable the compatibility for se- lecting any number of bands in one-shot, we further exploit the band-wise correlation matrices to progressively suppress similar adjacent bands. Extensive evaluations on the NTIRE 2022 Spectral Reconstruction Challenge demonstrate that our NBS achieves consistent performance gains over competitive baselines when examined with four different spectral recov- ery methods. Our code will be publicly available. ",

This work provides a proof-of-concept for one of the most mature PLS technologies, i.e., secret key generation (SKG) from wireless fading coefficients during the channel's coherence time. As opposed to other works, where only specific parts of the protocol are typically investigated, here, we implement the full SKG chain in four indoor experimental campaigns. In detail, we consider two legitimate nodes, who use the wireless channel to extract secret keys and a malicious node placed in the immediate vicinity of one of them, who acts as a passive eavesdropper. To estimate the final SKG rate we evaluate the conditional min-entropy by taking into account all information available to the eavesdropper. Finally, we use this paper to announce the first ever physical layer security challenge, mirroring practices in cryptography. We call the community to scrutinize the presented results and try to ``break'' our SKG implementation. To this end, we provide, i) the full dataset observed by the eavesdroppers and all algorithms used, ii) $20$ blocks of $16-$byte long ciphertexts, encrypted using AES-256 with $20$ distilled secret keys, and, iii) all codes and software used in our SKG implementation.

As computing blends into everyday physical artifacts, powerful opportunities open up for social connection. Prior connected media objects span a broad spectrum of design combinations.

However, since these designs have largely been studied in isolation, we do not have a holistic understanding around how people would configure and behave within a ubiquitous social ecosystem of physically-grounded artifacts. In this paper, we create a technology probe called Social Wormholes, that lets people configure their own home ecosystem of connected artifacts.

Despite the success, generating data augmentations as hard positive examples that may increase their effectiveness is under-explored. This paper proposes an Adversarial Word Dilution (AWD) method that can generate hard positive examples as text data augmentations to train the low-resource text classification model efficiently. Our idea of augmenting the text data is to dilute the embedding of strong positive words by weighted mixing with unknown-word embedding, making the augmented inputs hard to be recognized as positive by the classification model. We adversarially learn the dilution weights through a constrained min-max optimization process with the guidance of the labels. Empirical studies on three benchmark datasets show that AWD can generate more effective data augmentations and outperform the state-of-the-art text data augmentation methods. The additional analysis demonstrates that the data augmentations generated by AWD are interpretable and can flexibly extend to new examples without further training. ",

However, due to the severe attenuation in harsh underground soil and the tight energy budget of the underground sensors, traditional WPUSNs relying on the channel state information (CSI) are highly inefficient, especially in massive WET scenarios. To address this challenge, we comparatively assess the feasibility of several state-of-the-art CSI-free multi-antenna WET schemes for WPUSNs, under a given power budget. Moreover, to overcome the extremely low WET efficiency in underground channels, we propose a distributed CSI-free system, where multiple power beacons (PBs) simultaneously charge a large set of underground sensors without any CSI. We consider the position-aware K-Means and the position-agnostic equally-far-from-center (EFFC) approaches for the optimal deployment of the PBs. Our results evince that the performance of the proposed distributed CSI-free system can approach or even surpass that of a traditional full-CSI WET strategy, especially when adopting an appropriate CSI-free scheme, applying the advisable PBs deployment approach, and equipping the PBs with an appropriate number of antennas. Finally, we discuss the impact of underground parameters, i.e., the burial depth of devices and the volumetric water content of soil, on the system's performance, and identify potential challenges and research opportunities for practical distributed CSI-free WPUSNs deployment.

Based on this, we hypothesize that PreNorm may overfit supervised directions and thus have low generalizability for ZST. Through experiments on OPUS, IWSLT, and Europarl datasets for 54 ZST directions, we demonstrate that the original Transformer setting of LayerNorm after residual connections (PostNorm) consistently outperforms PreNorm by up to 12.3 BLEU points. We then study the performance disparities by analyzing the differences in off-target rates and structural variations between PreNorm and PostNorm.

Recently, neural-based techniques have demonstrated significant promise in generating correct patches for buggy code snippets.

Additionally, we observe that existing neural models may output an unaltered patch consistent with the input buggy code snippet, which fails to be the correct human-written one for fixing the given bug. To address the aforementioned limitations, we present in this paper a novel neural program repair framework called \\approach, which adapts the general pre-trained language model for fixing single-line Java bugs. We make the first attempt to use program slicing to extract contextual information directly related to the given buggy statement as repair ingredients from the corresponding program dependence graph and eliminate unaltered patches using an intuitive but effective filter mechanism.

For gleaning further insights, the diversity orders and navigation accuracy are evaluated for illustrating the performance of the INAC networks. According to our analysis, when RIS elements are sufficient, the proposed INAC network can perform better than conventional terrestrial communication networks in terms of channel capacity. Numerical results are provided for confirming that the NO-INAC and CO-INAC scenarios have superior performance for communication in the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regimes and high SNR regimes, respectively, which indicates a hybrid CO/NO-INAC network is preferable.

However, most existing topic models still rely on bag-of-words (BoW) information, either as training input or training target. This limits their ability to capture word order information in documents and causes them to suffer from the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue, i.e. they cannot handle unobserved words in new documents. Contextualized word embeddings from pre-trained language models show superiority in the ability of word sense disambiguation and prove to be effective in dealing with OOV words. In this work, we developed a novel neural topic model combining contextualized word embeddings from the pre-trained language model BERT. The model can infer the topic distribution of a document without using any BoW information. In addition, the model can infer the topic distribution of each word in a document directly from the contextualized word embeddings. Experiments on several datasets show that our model outperforms existing topic models in terms of both document classification and topic coherence metrics and can accommodate unseen words from newly arrived documents. Experiments on the NER dataset also show that our model can produce high-quality word topic representations. ",

Traditional ED models are too data-hungry to accommodate real applications with scarce labeled data. Besides, typical ED models are facing the context-bypassing and disabled generalization issues caused by the trigger bias stemming from ED datasets. Therefore, we focus on the true few-shot paradigm to satisfy the low-resource scenarios. In particular, we propose a multi-step prompt learning model (MsPrompt) for debiasing few-shot event detection, that consists of the following three components: an under-sampling module targeting to construct a novel training set that accommodates the true few-shot setting, a multi-step prompt module equipped with a knowledge-enhanced ontology to leverage the event semantics and latent prior knowledge in the PLMs sufficiently for tackling the context-bypassing problem, and a prototypical module compensating for the weakness of classifying events with sparse data and boost the generalization performance. Experiments on two public datasets ACE-2005 and FewEvent show that MsPrompt can outperform the state-of-the-art models, especially in the strict low-resource scenarios reporting 11.43% improvement in terms of weighted F1-score against the best-performing baseline and achieving an outstanding debiasing performance.

To accelerate the most common operations (matrix-vector multiplication) in NNs, hardware accelerator architectures such as computation-in-memory (CiM) with non-volatile memristive crossbars are utilized. Although they offer benefits such as power efficiency, parallelism, and nonvolatility, they suffer from various faults and variations, both during manufacturing and lifetime operations. This can lead to faulty computations and, in turn, degradation of post-mapping inference accuracy, which is unacceptable for many applications, including safety-critical applications. Therefore, proper testing of NN hardware accelerators is required.

Our approach can consistently achieve $100\\%$ fault coverage across several large topologies with up to $201$ layers and challenging tasks like semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Many jobs rely on news to learn about causal events in the past and present, to make informed decisions and predictions about the future. With the ever-increasing amount of news and text available on the internet, there is a need to automate the extraction of causal events from unstructured texts. In this work, we propose a methodology to construct causal knowledge graphs (KGs) from news using two steps: (1) Extraction of Causal Relations, and (2) Argument Clustering and Representation into KG. We aim to build graphs that emphasize on recall, precision and interpretability. For extraction, although many earlier works already construct causal KGs from text, most adopt rudimentary pattern-based methods. We close this gap by using the latest BERT-based extraction models alongside pattern-based ones. As a result, we achieved a high recall, while still maintaining a high precision. For clustering, we utilized a topic modelling approach to cluster our arguments, so as to increase the connectivity of our graph. As a result, instead of 15,686 disconnected subgraphs, we were able to obtain 1 connected graph that enables users to infer more causal relationships from. Our final KG effectively captures and conveys causal relationships, validated through multiple use cases and user feedback. ",

This information could be used for developmental research and to support clinical decision-making, such as detection of developmental problems and guiding of their therapeutic interventions. MAIJU-based analyses rely fully on the classification of infant's posture and movement; it is hence essential to study ways to increase the accuracy of such classifications, aiming to increase the reliability and robustness of the automated analysis. Here, we investigated how self-supervised pre-training improves performance of the classifiers used for analyzing MAIJU recordings, and we studied whether performance of the classifier models is affected by context-selective quality-screening of pre-training data to exclude periods of little infant movement or with missing sensors. Our experiments show that i) pre-training the classifier with unlabeled data leads to a robust accuracy increase of subsequent classification models, and ii) selecting context-relevant pre-training data leads to substantial further improvements in the classifier performance.

The proposed neural network jointly learns the attributes along with the overall aesthetic scores of images. This multi-task learning framework allows for effective generalization through the utilization of shared representations. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in predicting overall aesthetic scores for images in one benchmark of image aesthetics. We achieve near-human performance in terms of overall aesthetic scores when considering the Spearman's rank correlations. Moreover, our model pioneers the application of multi-tasking in another benchmark, serving as a new baseline for future research. Notably, our approach achieves this performance while using fewer parameters compared to existing multi-task neural networks in the literature, and consequently makes our method more efficient in terms of computational complexity.

In this paper we propose a novel method of synthetic data creation meant to close the sim2real gap for the challenging pedestrian detection task. Our method uses a diffusion-based architecture to learn a real-world distribution which, once trained, is used to generate datasets. We mix this generated data with simulated data as a form of augmentation and show that training on a combination of generated and simulated data increases average precision by as much as 27.3% for pedestrian detection models in real-world data, compared against training on purely simulated data.

    "abstract": "Visual quality inspection in high performance manufacturing can benefit from automation, due to cost savings and improved rigor. Deep learning techniques are the current state of the art for generic computer vision tasks like classification and object detection. Manufacturing data can pose a challenge for deep learning because data is highly repetitive and there are few images of defects or deviations to learn from. Deep learning models trained with such data can be fragile and sensitive to context, and can under-detect new defects not found in the training data. In this work, we explore training defect detection models to learn specific defects out of context, so that they are more likely to be detected in new situations. We demonstrate how models trained on diverse images containing a common defect type can pick defects out in new circumstances. Such generic models could be more robust to new defects not found data collected for training, and can reduce data collection impediments to implementing visual inspection on production lines. Additionally, we demonstrate that object detection models trained to predict a label and bounding box outperform classifiers that predict a label only on held out test data typical of manufacturing inspection tasks. Finally, we studied the factors that affect generalization in order to train models that work under a wider range of conditions. ",

We describe a generic transformation of distance-based outlier scores into interpretable, probabilistic estimates. The transformation is ranking-stable and increases the contrast between normal and outlier data points. Determining distance relationships between data points is necessary to identify the nearest-neighbor relationships in the data, yet, most of the computed distances are typically discarded. We show that the distances to other data points can be used to model distance probability distributions and, subsequently, use the distributions to turn distance-based outlier scores into outlier probabilities. Our experiments show that the probabilistic transformation does not impact detection performance over numerous tabular and image benchmark datasets but results in interpretable outlier scores with increased contrast between normal and outlier samples. Our work generalizes to a wide range of distance-based outlier detection methods, and because existing distance computations are used, it adds no significant computational overhead. ",

    "abstract": "Mobility service route design requires potential demand information to well accommodate travel demand within the service region. Transit planners and operators can access various data sources including household travel survey data and mobile device location logs. However, when implementing a mobility system with emerging technologies, estimating demand level becomes harder because of more uncertainties with user behaviors. Therefore, this study proposes an artificial intelligence-driven algorithm that combines sequential transit network design with optimal learning. An operator gradually expands its route system to avoid risks from inconsistency between designed routes and actual travel demand. At the same time, observed information is archived to update the knowledge that the operator currently uses. Three learning policies are compared within the algorithm: multi-armed bandit, knowledge gradient, and knowledge gradient with correlated beliefs. For validation, a new route system is designed on an artificial network based on public use microdata areas in New York City. Prior knowledge is reproduced from the regional household travel survey data. The results suggest that exploration considering correlations can achieve better performance compared to greedy choices in general. In future work, the problem may incorporate more complexities such as demand elasticity to travel time, no limitations to the number of transfers, and costs for expansion. ",

Previous researchers have proposed EditGAN for high-quality, high-precision semantic image editing with limited semantic annotations by finding `editing vectors'. However, it is noticed that there are many features that are not highly associated with semantics, and EditGAN may fail on them. Based on the orthogonality of latent space observed by EditGAN, we propose a method to estimate editing vectors that do not rely on semantic segmentation nor differentiable feature estimation network. Our method assumes that there is a correlation between the intensity distribution of features and the distribution of hidden vectors, and estimates the relationship between the above distributions by sampling the feature intensity of the image corresponding to several hidden vectors. We modified Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to deal with both binary feature editing and continuous feature editing. We then found that this method has a good effect in processing features such as clothing type and texture, skin color and hair. ",

As technology improves, new attacks have been developed by hackers. Traditional statistical and shallow machine learning techniques can detect superficial anomalies based on shallow data and feature selection, however, these approaches cannot detect unseen DDoS attacks. In this context, we propose a reconstruction-based anomaly detection model named LSTM-Autoencoder (LSTM-AE) which combines two deep learning-based models for detecting DDoS attack anomalies. The proposed structure of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks provides units that work with each other to learn the long short-term correlation of data within a time series sequence. Autoencoders are used to identify the optimal threshold based on the reconstruction error rates evaluated on each sample across all time-series sequences. As such, a combination model LSTM-AE can not only learn delicate sub-pattern differences in attacks and benign traffic flows, but also minimize reconstructed benign traffic to obtain a lower range reconstruction error, with attacks presenting a larger reconstruction error. In this research, we trained and evaluated our proposed LSTM-AE model on reflection-based DDoS attacks (DNS, LDAP, and SNMP). The results of our experiments demonstrate that our method performs better than other state-of-the-art methods, especially for LDAP attacks, with an accuracy of over 99. ",

To the best of our knowledge, the Beehive SPIR-V Toolkit is the first Java programming framework that can dynamically generate SPIR-V binary modules. To demonstrate the use of our framework, we showcase the integration of the SPIR-V Beehive Toolkit in the context of the TornadoVM, a Java framework for automatically offloading and running Java programs on heterogeneous hardware.

    "abstract": "Many convolutional neural networks (CNNs) rely on progressive downsampling of their feature maps to increase the network's receptive field and decrease computational cost. However, this comes at the price of losing granularity in the feature maps, limiting the ability to correctly understand images or recover fine detail in dense prediction tasks. To address this, common practice is to replace the last few downsampling operations in a CNN with dilated convolutions, allowing to retain the feature map resolution without reducing the receptive field, albeit increasing the computational cost. This allows to trade off predictive performance against cost, depending on the output feature resolution. By either regularly downsampling or not downsampling the entire feature map, existing work implicitly treats all regions of the input image and subsequent feature maps as equally important, which generally does not hold. We propose an adaptive downsampling scheme that generalizes the above idea by allowing to process informative regions at a higher resolution than less informative ones. In a variety of experiments, we demonstrate the versatility of our adaptive downsampling strategy and empirically show that it improves the cost-accuracy trade-off of various established CNNs. ",

    "abstract": "In probabilistic structural mechanics, the Hasofer-Lind reliability index problem is a paradigmatic equality constrained problem of searching for the minimum distance from a point to a surface. In practical engineering problems, such surface is defined implicitly, requiring the solution of a boundary-value problem. Recently, it was proposed in the literature a hybrid micro-genetic algorithm (HmGA), with mixed real-binary genotype and novel deterministic operators for equality-constraint handling, namely the Genetic Repair and Region Zooming mechanisms (G. das Neves Carneiro and C. Concei\\c{c}\\~ao Ant\\'onio, \"Global optimal reliability index of implicit composite laminate structures by evolutionary algorithms\", Struct Saf, vol. 79, pp. 54-65, 2019). We investigate the limit-behavior of the HmGA and present the convergence theorems for the algorithm. It is proven that Genetic Repair is a conditionally stable mechanism, and its modes of convergence are discussed. Based on a Markov chain analysis, the conditions for the convergence with probability 1 of the HmGA are given and discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Deploying links to fact-checking websites (so-called \"snoping\") is a common intervention that can be used by social media users to refute misleading claims. However, its real-world effect may be limited as it suffers from low visibility and distrust towards professional fact-checkers. As a remedy, Twitter launched its community-based fact-checking system Community Notes on which fact-checks are carried out by actual Twitter users and directly shown on the fact-checked tweets. Yet, an understanding of how fact-checking via Community Notes differs from snoping is absent. In this study, we analyze differences in how contributors to Community Notes and Snopers select their targets when fact-checking social media posts. For this purpose, we analyze two unique datasets from Twitter: (a) 25,917 community-created fact-checks from Twitter's Community Notes platform; and (b) 52,505 \"snopes\" that debunk tweets via fact-checking replies linking to professional fact-checking websites. We find that Notes contributors and Snopers focus on different targets when fact-checking social media content. For instance, Notes contributors tend to fact-check posts from larger accounts with higher social influence and are relatively less likely to endorse/emphasize the accuracy of not misleading posts. Fact-checking targets of Notes contributors and Snopers rarely overlap; however, those overlapping exhibit a high level of agreement in the fact-checking assessment. Moreover, we demonstrate that Snopers fact-check social media posts at a higher speed. Altogether, our findings imply that different fact-checking approaches -- carried out on the same social media platform -- can result in vastly different social media posts getting fact-checked. This has important implications for future research on misinformation, which should not rely on a single fact-checking approach when compiling misinformation datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning implemented with convolutional network architectures can exceed specialists' diagnostic accuracy. However, whole-image deep learning trained on a given dataset may not generalize to other datasets. The problem arises because extra-lesional features - ruler marks, ink marks, and other melanoma correlates - may serve as information leaks. These extra-lesional features, discoverable by heat maps, degrade melanoma diagnostic performance and cause techniques learned on one data set to fail to generalize. We propose a novel technique to improve melanoma recognition by an EfficientNet model. The model trains the network to detect the lesion and learn features from the detected lesion. A generalizable elliptical segmentation model for lesions was developed, with an ellipse enclosing a lesion and the ellipse enclosed by an extended rectangle (bounding box). The minimal bounding box was extended by 20% to allow some background around the lesion. The publicly available International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2020 skin lesion image dataset was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our test results show that the proposed method improved diagnostic accuracy by increasing the mean area under receiver operating characteristic curve (mean AUC) score from 0.9 to 0.922. Additionally, correctly diagnosed scores are also improved, providing better separation of scores, thereby increasing melanoma diagnostic confidence. The proposed lesion-focused convolutional technique warrants further study. ",

By using signal processing techniques and statistical transformations, our proposed method generates compact fingerprints of audio segments that are robust to noise degradations present in real-world audio. The system is designed to be highly scalable, with the ability to identify thousands of hours of content using fingerprints generated from millions of TVs. The fingerprint's high temporal correlation and utilization of existing GPU-compatible Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search algorithms make this possible. Furthermore, the fingerprint generation can run on low-power devices with limited compute, making it accessible to a wide range of applications. Experimental results show improvements in our proposed system compared to a min-hash based audio fingerprint on all evaluated metrics, including accuracy on proprietary ACR datasets, retrieval speed, memory usage, and robustness to various noises. For similar retrieval accuracy, our system is 30x faster and uses 6x fewer fingerprints than the min-hash method. ",

    "abstract": "Backdoors implanted in pre-trained language models (PLMs) can be transferred to various downstream tasks, which exposes a severe security threat. However, most existing backdoor attacks against PLMs are un-targeted and task-specific. Few targeted and task-agnostic methods use manually pre-defined triggers and output representations, which prevent the attacks from being more effective and general. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements that a more threatening backdoor attack against PLMs should satisfy, and then propose a new backdoor attack method called UOR, which breaks the bottleneck of the previous approach by turning manual selection into automatic optimization. Specifically, we define poisoned supervised contrastive learning which can automatically learn the more uniform and universal output representations of triggers for various PLMs. Moreover, we use gradient search to select appropriate trigger words which can be adaptive to different PLMs and vocabularies. Experiments show that our method can achieve better attack performance on various text classification tasks compared to manual methods. Further, we tested our method on PLMs with different architectures, different usage paradigms, and more difficult tasks, which demonstrated the universality of our method. ",

    "abstract": "A private learner is trained on a sample of labeled points and generates a hypothesis that can be used for predicting the labels of newly sampled points while protecting the privacy of the training set [Kasiviswannathan et al., FOCS 2008]. Research uncovered that private learners may need to exhibit significantly higher sample complexity than non-private learners as is the case with, e.g., learning of one-dimensional threshold functions [Bun et al., FOCS 2015, Alon et al., STOC 2019]. We explore prediction as an alternative to learning. Instead of putting forward a hypothesis, a predictor answers a stream of classification queries. Earlier work has considered a private prediction model with just a single classification query [Dwork and Feldman, COLT 2018]. We observe that when answering a stream of queries, a predictor must modify the hypothesis it uses over time, and, furthermore, that it must use the queries for this modification, hence introducing potential privacy risks with respect to the queries themselves. We introduce private everlasting prediction taking into account the privacy of both the training set and the (adaptively chosen) queries made to the predictor. We then present a generic construction of private everlasting predictors in the PAC model. The sample complexity of the initial training sample in our construction is quadratic (up to polylog factors) in the VC dimension of the concept class. Our construction allows prediction for all concept classes with finite VC dimension, and in particular threshold functions with constant size initial training sample, even when considered over infinite domains, whereas it is known that the sample complexity of privately learning threshold functions must grow as a function of the domain size and hence is impossible for infinite domains.

However, this assumption is not realistic in real-world applications where the system needs to handle new data during deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Inductive Moving Object Segmentation (GraphIMOS) algorithm based on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. Our approach builds a generic model capable of performing prediction on newly added data frames using the already trained model. GraphIMOS outperforms previous inductive learning methods and is more generic than previous transductive techniques.

To address these shortcomings, we introduce the first automated reinforcement learning (RL) HT insertion and detection framework. In the insertion phase, an RL agent explores the circuits and finds different locations that are best for keeping inserted HTs hidden. On the defense side, we introduce a multi-criteria RL-based detector that generates test vectors to discover the existence of HTs. Using the proposed framework, one can explore the HT insertion and detection design spaces to break the human mindset limitations as well as the benchmark issues, ultimately leading toward the next-generation of innovative detectors. Our HT toolset is open-source to accelerate research in this field and reduce the initial setup time for newcomers. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on ISCAS-85 benchmarks and provide the attack and detection success rates and define a methodology for comparing our techniques. ",

In order to solve these problems, we propose a denoised structure-to-text augmentation framework for event extraction DAEE, which generates additional training data through the knowledge-based structure-to-text generation model and selects the effective subset from the generated data iteratively with a deep reinforcement learning agent. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method generates more diverse text representations for event extraction and achieves comparable results with the state-of-the-art.

To address this, we propose a generative model for concurrent in-distribution misclassification (IDM) and OOD detection that relies on a normalizing flow framework.

This paper investigates three distinct applications of LLMs fine-tuned by nationally representative surveys for opinion prediction -- missing data imputation, retrodiction, and zero-shot prediction. We present a new methodological framework that incorporates neural embeddings of survey questions, individual beliefs, and temporal contexts to personalize LLMs in opinion prediction. Among 3,110 binarized opinions from 68,846 Americans in the General Social Survey from 1972 to 2021, our best models based on Alpaca-7b excels in missing data imputation (AUC = 0.87 for personal opinion prediction and $\\rho$ = 0.99 for public opinion prediction) and retrodiction (AUC = 0.86, $\\rho$ = 0.98). These remarkable prediction capabilities allow us to fill in missing trends with high confidence and pinpoint when public attitudes changed, such as the rising support for same-sex marriage. However, the models show limited performance in a zero-shot prediction task (AUC = 0.73, $\\rho$ = 0.67), highlighting challenges presented by LLMs without human responses. Further, we find that the best models' accuracy is lower for individuals with low socioeconomic status, racial minorities, and non-partisan affiliations but higher for ideologically sorted opinions in contemporary periods. We discuss practical constraints, socio-demographic representation, and ethical concerns regarding individual autonomy and privacy when using LLMs for opinion prediction. This paper showcases a new approach for leveraging LLMs to enhance nationally representative surveys by predicting missing responses and trends. ",

    "abstract": "Toeplitz Neural Networks (TNNs) (Qin et. al. 2023) are a recent sequence model with impressive results. They require O(n log n) computational complexity and O(n) relative positional encoder (RPE) multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and decay bias calls. We aim to reduce both. We first note that the RPE is a non-SPD (symmetric positive definite) kernel and the Toeplitz matrices are pseudo-Gram matrices. Further 1) the learned kernels display spiky behavior near the main diagonals with otherwise smooth behavior; 2) the RPE MLP is slow. For bidirectional models, this motivates a sparse plus low-rank Toeplitz matrix decomposition. For the sparse component's action, we do a small 1D convolution. For the low rank component, we replace the RPE MLP with linear interpolation and use asymmetric Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI) (Wilson et. al. 2015) for O(n) complexity: we provide rigorous error analysis. For causal models, \"fast\" causal masking (Katharopoulos et. al. 2020) negates SKI's benefits. Working in the frequency domain, we avoid an explicit decay bias. To enforce causality, we represent the kernel via the real part of its frequency response using the RPE and compute the imaginary part via a Hilbert transform. This maintains O(n log n) complexity but achieves an absolute speedup. Modeling the frequency response directly is also competitive for bidirectional training, using one fewer FFT. We set a speed state of the art on Long Range Arena (Tay et. al. 2020) with minimal score degradation. ",

    "title": "Robust Auction Design with Support Information",
    "abstract": "A seller wants to sell an item to $n$ buyers. The buyer valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a distribution, but the seller does not know this distribution; the seller only knows the support $[a,b]$. To be robust against the lack of knowledge of the environment and buyers' behavior, the seller optimizes over DSIC mechanisms, and measures the worst-case performance relative to an oracle with complete knowledge of buyers' valuations. Our analysis encompasses both the regret and the ratio objectives. For these objectives, we derive an optimal mechanism in closed form as a function of the support and the number of buyers $n$. Our analysis reveals three regimes of support information and a new class of robust mechanisms. i.) With \"low\" support information, the optimal mechanism is a second-price auction (SPA) with a random reserve, a focal class in the earlier literature. ii.) With \"high\" support information, we show that second-price auctions are strictly suboptimal, and an optimal mechanism belongs to a novel class of mechanisms we introduce, which we call $\\textbf{pooling auctions}$ (POOL); whenever the highest value is above a threshold, the mechanism still allocates to the highest bidder, but otherwise the mechanism allocates to a uniformly random buyer, i.e., pools low types. iii.) With \"moderate\" support information, a randomization between SPA and POOL is optimal. We also characterize optimal mechanisms within nested central subclasses of mechanisms: standard mechanisms (only allocate to the highest bidder), SPA with random reserve, and SPA with no reserve. We show strict separations across classes, implying that deviating from standard mechanisms is necessary for robustness. Lastly, we show that the same results hold under other distribution classes that capture \"positive dependence\" (mixture of i.i.d., exchangeable and affiliated), as well as i.i.d. regular distributions.

    "abstract": "Distributed stochastic optimization, arising in the crossing and integration of traditional stochastic optimization, distributed computing and storage, and network science, has advantages of high efficiency and a low per-iteration computational complexity in resolving large-scale optimization problems. This paper concentrates on resolving a large-scale convex finite-sum optimization problem in a multi-agent system over unbalanced directed networks. To tackle this problem in an efficient way, a distributed consensus optimization algorithm, adopting the push-sum technique and a distributed loopless stochastic variance-reduced gradient (LSVRG) method with uncoordinated triggered probabilities, is developed and named Push-LSVRG-UP. Each agent under this algorithmic framework performs only local computation and communicates only with its neighbors without leaking their private information. The convergence analysis of Push-LSVRG-UP is relied on analyzing the contraction relationships between four error terms associated with the multi-agent system. Theoretical results provide an explicit feasible range of the constant step-size, a linear convergence rate, and an iteration complexity of Push-LSVRG-UP when achieving the globally optimal solution. It is shown that Push-LSVRG-UP achieves the superior characteristics of accelerated linear convergence, fewer storage costs, and a lower per-iteration computational complexity than most existing works. Meanwhile, the introduction of an uncoordinated probabilistic triggered mechanism allows Push-LSVRG-UP to facilitate the independence and flexibility of agents in computing local batch gradients. In simulations, the practicability and improved performance of Push-LSVRG-UP are manifested via resolving two distributed learning problems based on real-world datasets. ",

    "abstract": "The spatial configuration of urban amenities and the streets connecting them collectively provide the structural backbone of a city, influencing its accessibility, vitality, and ultimately the emotional and physical well-being of its residents. Measures aiming to capture urban accessibility or vitality through structural factors must account for heterogeneity that is both spatial -- the density and diversity of amenities across space -- and topological -- the connectivity among different types of amenities along the street network. Given that existing measures often only focus on these factors individually, here we develop a simple, principled, and flexible framework to characterize the directness of accessibility among heterogeneous amenities in a city, which we call the Class First Passage Difference (CFPD). The CFPD quantifies the excess travel distance incurred when using the street network to route between different pairs of amenity types, summarizing both the spatial and topological correlations among amenities in a city. Our method exhibits significant statistical associations with a variety of urban prosperity and accessibility indicators when compared to an appropriate null model that scrambles the correlations among the amenities. We also find a clear separation in the CFPD characteristics of cities according to their level of development and geographic region. Our framework provides a principled, interpretable, complementary perspective to existing indices of urban accessibility and vitality. ",

    "abstract": "Transformers, due to their ability to learn long range dependencies, have overcome the shortcomings of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for global perspective learning. Therefore, they have gained the focus of researchers for several vision related tasks including medical diagnosis. However, their multi-head attention module only captures global level feature representations, which is insufficient for medical images. To address this issue, we propose a Channel Boosted Hybrid Vision Transformer (CB HVT) that uses transfer learning to generate boosted channels and employs both transformers and CNNs to analyse lymphocytes in histopathological images. The proposed CB HVT comprises five modules, including a channel generation module, channel exploitation module, channel merging module, region-aware module, and a detection and segmentation head, which work together to effectively identify lymphocytes. The channel generation module uses the idea of channel boosting through transfer learning to extract diverse channels from different auxiliary learners. In the CB HVT, these boosted channels are first concatenated and ranked using an attention mechanism in the channel exploitation module. A fusion block is then utilized in the channel merging module for a gradual and systematic merging of the diverse boosted channels to improve the network's learning representations. The CB HVT also employs a proposal network in its region aware module and a head to effectively identify objects, even in overlapping regions and with artifacts. We evaluated the proposed CB HVT on two publicly available datasets for lymphocyte assessment in histopathological images. The results show that CB HVT outperformed other state of the art detection models, and has good generalization ability, demonstrating its value as a tool for pathologists. ",

SRBs are observed at metric to decametric wavelengths and are classified into five spectral classes (Type I--V) based on their signature in dynamic spectra. The automatic detection and classification of SRBs is a challenge due to their heterogeneous form. Near-realtime detection and classification of SRBs has become a necessity in recent years due to large data rates generated by advanced radio telescopes such as the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). In this study, we implement congruent deep learning models to automatically detect and classify Type III SRBs. We generated simulated Type III SRBs, which were comparable to Type IIIs seen in real observations, using a deep learning method known as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This simulated data was combined with observations from LOFAR to produce a training set that was used to train an object detection model known as YOLOv2 (You Only Look Once). Using this congruent deep learning model system, we can accurately detect Type III SRBs at a mean Average Precision (mAP) value of 77.71%. ",

    "abstract": "Antibodies are crucial proteins produced by the immune system in response to foreign substances or antigens. The specificity of an antibody is determined by its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which are located in the variable domains of the antibody chains and form the antigen-binding site. Previous studies have utilized complex techniques to generate CDRs, but they suffer from inadequate geometric modeling. Moreover, the common iterative refinement strategies lead to an inefficient inference. In this paper, we propose a deep generative model that can co-design 1D sequences and 3D structures of CDRs in a one-shot manner. To achieve this, we decouple the antibody CDR design into two stages: (i) geometric modeling of protein structures and (ii) sequence-structure co-learning. We develop a protein complex invariant embedding that captures both intra- and inter-component interactions among the backbone atoms including C$\\alpha$, N, C, and O atoms to achieve comprehensive geometric modeling. Then, we introduce a cross-gate MLP for sequence-structure co-learning, which allows sequence and structure representations to implicitly refine each other. This enables our model to design desired sequences and structures in a one-shot manner. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate our results at both the sequence and structure level, which demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art antibody CDR design methods.

    "abstract": "We study voiced laughter in executive communication and its effect on social approval. Integrating research on laughter, affect-as-information, and infomediaries' social evaluations of firms, we hypothesize that voiced laughter in executive communication positively affects social approval, defined as audience perceptions of affinity towards an organization. We surmise that the effect of laughter is especially strong for joint laughter, i.e., the number of instances in a given communication venue for which the focal executive and the audience laugh simultaneously. Finally, combining the notions of affect-as-information and negativity bias in human cognition, we hypothesize that the positive effect of laughter on social approval increases with bad organizational performance. We find partial support for our ideas when testing them on panel data comprising 902 German Bundesliga soccer press conferences and media tenor, applying state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for laughter detection as well as sentiment analysis. Our findings contribute to research at the nexus of executive communication, strategic leadership, and social evaluations, especially by introducing laughter as a highly consequential potential, but understudied social lubricant at the executive-infomediary interface. Our research is unique by focusing on reflexive microprocesses of social evaluations, rather than the infomediary-routines perspectives in infomediaries' evaluations. We also make methodological contributions. ",

    "abstract": "Understanding the causal relationships among the variables of a system is paramount to explain and control its behaviour. Inferring the causal graph from observational data without interventions, however, requires a lot of strong assumptions that are not always realistic. Even for domain experts it can be challenging to express the causal graph. Therefore, metrics that quantitatively assess the goodness of a causal graph provide helpful checks before using it in downstream tasks. Existing metrics provide an absolute number of inconsistencies between the graph and the observed data, and without a baseline, practitioners are left to answer the hard question of how many such inconsistencies are acceptable or expected. Here, we propose a novel consistency metric by constructing a surrogate baseline through node permutations. By comparing the number of inconsistencies with those on the surrogate baseline, we derive an interpretable metric that captures whether the DAG fits significantly better than random. Evaluating on both simulated and real data sets from various domains, including biology and cloud monitoring, we demonstrate that the true DAG is not falsified by our metric, whereas the wrong graphs given by a hypothetical user are likely to be falsified.

    "abstract": "The field of clinical image analysis has been applying transfer learning models increasingly due to their less computational complexity, better accuracy etc. These are pre-trained models that don't require to be trained from scratch which eliminates the necessity of large datasets. Transfer learning models are mostly used for the analysis of brain, breast, or lung images but other sectors such as bone marrow cell detection or bone cancer detection can also benefit from using transfer learning models, especially considering the lack of available large datasets for these tasks. This paper studies the performance of several transfer learning models for osteosarcoma tumour detection. Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer mostly found in the cells of the long bones of the body. The dataset consists of H&E stained images divided into 4 categories- Viable Tumor, Non-viable Tumor, Non-Tumor and Viable Non-viable. Both datasets were randomly divided into train and test sets following an 80-20 ratio. 80% was used for training and 20\\% for test. 4 models are considered for comparison- EfficientNetB7, InceptionResNetV2, NasNetLarge and ResNet50. All these models are pre-trained on ImageNet. According to the result, InceptionResNetV2 achieved the highest accuracy (93.29%), followed by NasNetLarge (90.91%), ResNet50 (89.83%) and EfficientNetB7 (62.77%). It also had the highest precision (0.8658) and recall (0.8658) values among the 4 models. ",
