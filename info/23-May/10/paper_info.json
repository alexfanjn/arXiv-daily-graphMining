    "abstract": "The use of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques has shown to be beneficial for software engineering tasks, such as vulnerability detection and type inference. However, training deep NLP models requires significant computational resources. This paper explores techniques that aim at achieving the best usage of resources and available information in these models. We propose a generic approach, EarlyBIRD, to build composite representations of code from the early layers of a pre-trained transformer model. We empirically investigate the viability of this approach on the CodeBERT model by comparing the performance of 12 strategies for creating composite representations with the standard practice of only using the last encoder layer. Our evaluation on four datasets shows that several early layer combinations yield better performance on defect detection, and some combinations improve multi-class classification. More specifically, we obtain a +2 average improvement of detection accuracy on Devign with only 3 out of 12 layers of CodeBERT and a 3.3x speed-up of fine-tuning. These findings show that early layers can be used to obtain better results using the same resources, as well as to reduce resource usage during fine-tuning and inference. ",

In this project, we propose a new method for natural language query based joint video summarization and highlight detection using multi-modal transformers.

    "abstract": "Relational pooling is a framework for building more expressive and permutation-invariant graph neural networks. However, there is limited understanding of the exact enhancement in the expressivity of RP and its connection with the Weisfeiler Lehman hierarchy. Starting from RP, we propose to explicitly assign labels to nodes as additional features to improve expressive power of message passing neural networks. The method is then extended to higher dimensional WL, leading to a novel $k,l$-WL algorithm, a more general framework than $k$-WL. Theoretically, we analyze the expressivity of $k,l$-WL with respect to $k$ and $l$ and unifies it with a great number of subgraph GNNs. Complexity reduction methods are also systematically discussed to build powerful and practical $k,l$-GNN instances. We theoretically and experimentally prove that our method is universally compatible and capable of improving the expressivity of any base GNN model. Our $k,l$-GNNs achieve superior performance on many synthetic and real-world datasets, which verifies the effectiveness of our framework. ",

Identifying influencers as communication systems emerging from a dialectic interactional process between content creators and in-development audiences, we define them mainly using the composition of their audience and the type of publications they use to communicate. To examine these two parameters, we analyse the audiences of 619 Instagram accounts of French, English, and American influencers and 2,400 of their publications in light of Girard's mimetic theory and McLuhan's media theory. We observe meaningful differences in influencers' profiles, typical audiences, and content type across influencers' classes, supporting the claim that such communication systems are articulated around 'reading contracts' upon which influencers' image is based and from which their influence derives. While the upkeep of their influence relies on them sticking to this contract, we observe that successful influencers shift their content type when growing their audiences and explain the strategies they implement to address this double bind. Different types of contract breaches then lead to distinct outcomes, which we identify by analysing various types of followers' feedback. In mediating social interactions, digital platforms reshape society in various ways; this interdisciplinary study helps understand how the digitalisation of social influencers affects reciprocity and mimetic behaviours.

Graph formats such as knowledge graphs are easy to evaluate as they explicitly express language semantics and structure. This study evaluates the semantics encoded in the self-attention transformers by leveraging explicit knowledge graph structures. We propose novel metrics to measure the reconstruction error when providing graph path sequences from a knowledge graph and trying to reproduce/reconstruct the same from the outputs of the self-attention transformer models. The opacity of language models has an immense bearing on societal issues of trust and explainable decision outcomes. Our findings suggest that language models are models of stochastic control processes for plausible language pattern generation. However, they do not ascribe object and concept-level meaning and semantics to the learned stochastic patterns such as those described in knowledge graphs. Furthermore, to enable robust evaluation of concept understanding by language models, we construct and make public an augmented language understanding benchmark built on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark. This has significant application-level user trust implications as stochastic patterns without a strong sense of meaning cannot be trusted in high-stakes applications. ",

We propose explanation-based finetuning as a novel and general approach to mitigate LLMs' reliance on spurious correlations. Unlike standard finetuning where the model only predicts the answer given the input, we finetune the model to additionally generate a free-text explanation supporting its answer. To evaluate our method, we finetune the model on artificially constructed training sets containing different types of spurious cues, and test it on a test set without these cues. Compared to standard finetuning, our method makes models remarkably more robust against spurious cues in terms of accuracy drop across four classification tasks: ComVE (+1.2), CREAK (+9.1), e-SNLI (+15.4), and SBIC (+6.5). Moreover, our method works equally well with explanations generated by the model, implying its applicability to more datasets without human-written explanations. ",

This WEIRD skew may affect the generalizability of study results and hinder understanding of diverse participant populations and their cultural differences. The usable privacy and security (UPS) field has inherited many research methodologies from research on human factor fields such as HCI. We conducted a literature review to understand the extent to which participant samples in UPS papers were WEIRD and the characteristics of the methodologies and research topics in each user study recruiting Western or non-Western participants. We found that the skew toward WEIRD in UPS is greater than that in HCI. Geographic and linguistic barriers in the study methods and recruitment methods may cause researchers to conduct a user study locally. In addition, many papers did not report participant demographics, which could hinder the replication of the reported studies, leading to low reproducibility. We provide the following suggestions to improve geographic diversity: facilitate replication studies, improve reproducibility, address issues of study and recruiting methods, diversify researchers, and facilitate research on the topics for non-WEIRD populations.

    "abstract": "Recently, beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has been proposed to generalize conventional RIS. BD-RIS has a scattering matrix that is not restricted to being diagonal and thus brings a performance improvement over conventional RIS. While different BD-RIS architectures have been proposed, it still remains an open problem to develop a systematic approach to design BD-RIS architectures achieving the optimal trade-off between performance and circuit complexity. In this work, we propose novel modeling, architecture design, and optimization for BD-RIS based on graph theory. This graph theoretical modeling allows us to develop two new efficient BD-RIS architectures, denoted as tree-connected and forest-connected RIS. Tree-connected RIS, whose corresponding graph is a tree, is proven to be the least complex BD-RIS architecture able to achieve the performance upper bound in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. Besides, forest-connected RIS allows us to strike a balance between performance and complexity, further decreasing the complexity over tree-connected RIS. To optimize tree-connected RIS, we derive a closed-form global optimal solution, while forest-connected RIS is optimized through a low-complexity iterative algorithm. Numerical results confirm that tree-connected (resp. forest-connected) RIS achieves the same performance as fully-connected (resp. group-connected) RIS, while reducing the complexity by up to 16.4 times.

The context-enhanced shape target consisting of explicit shape context and implicit deep shape feature is proposed to facilitate exploiting contextual cues in shape prediction. Meanwhile, the pre-training architecture in MSP is carefully designed to alleviate the masked shape leakage from point coordinates. Experiments on multiple 3D understanding tasks on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MSP in learning good feature representations to consistently boost downstream performance.

    "abstract": "Cracking is a common failure mode in asphalt concrete (AC) pavements. Many tests have been developed to characterize the fracture behavior of AC. Accurate crack detection during testing is crucial to describe AC fracture behavior. This paper proposed a framework to detect surface cracks in AC specimens using two-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC). Two significant drawbacks in previous research in this field were addressed. First, a multi-seed incremental reliability-guided DIC was proposed to solve the decorrelation issue due to large deformation and discontinuities. The method was validated using synthetic deformed images. A correctly implemented analysis could accurately measure strains up to 450\\%, even with significant discontinuities (cracks) present in the deformed image. Second, a robust method was developed to detect cracks based on displacement fields. The proposed method uses critical crack tip opening displacement ($\\delta_c$) to define the onset of cleavage fracture. The proposed method relies on well-developed fracture mechanics theory. The proposed threshold $\\delta_c$ has a physical meaning and can be easily determined from DIC measurement. The method was validated using an extended finite element model. The framework was implemented to measure the crack propagation rate while conducting the Illinois-flexibility index test on two AC mixes. The calculated rates could distinguish mixes based on their cracking potential. The proposed framework could be applied to characterize AC cracking phenomenon, evaluate its fracture properties, assess asphalt mixture testing protocols, and develop theoretical models. ",

Estimating the positions, face orientation (or gaze direction) and trajectories of people through space has many uses, such as in crowd management, security, and healthcare. In this work, we present an open-source, low-cost, scalable and privacy-preserving edge computing framework for multi-person localization, i.e. estimating the positions, orientations, and trajectories of multiple people in an indoor space. Our computing framework consists of 38 Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)-enabled edge computing camera systems placed in the ceiling of the indoor therapeutic space. The edge compute systems are connected to an on-premise fog server through a secure and private network. A multi-person detection algorithm and a pose estimation model run on the edge TPU in real-time to collect features which are used, instead of raw images, for downstream computations. This ensures the privacy of individuals in the space, reduces data transmission/storage and improves scalability. We implemented a Kalman filter-based multi-person tracking method and a state-of-the-art body orientation estimation method to determine the positions and facing orientations of multiple people simultaneously in the indoor space. For our study site with size of 18,000 square feet, our system demonstrated an average localization error of 1.41 meters, a multiple-object tracking accuracy score of 62%, and a mean absolute body orientation error of 29{\\deg}, which is sufficient for understanding group activity behaviors in indoor environments. Additionally, our study provides practical guidance for deploying the proposed system by analyzing various elements of the camera installation with respect to tracking accuracy. ",

We consider a general adversary model where attackers jointly exploit the vulnerability of IoT devices and that of the blockchain employed in the BIoT. The optimal attacking strategy which minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence is pursued. It can be shown that this optimization problem is nonconvex, and hence it is generally intractable to find the globally optimal solution to such a problem. To overcome this issue, we first propose a relaxation method that can convert the original nonconvex optimization problem into a convex optimization problem, and then the analytic expression for the optimal solution to the relaxed convex optimization problem is derived. The optimal value of the relaxed convex optimization problem provides a detection performance guarantee for the BIoT in the presence of attacks. In addition, we develop a coordinate descent algorithm which is based on a capped water-filling method to solve the relaxed convex optimization problem, and moreover, we show that the convergence of the proposed coordinate descent algorithm can be guaranteed.

To initiate a systematic research in this important area of 'dealing with novelties', we introduce 'NoveltyTask', a multi-stage task to evaluate a system's performance on pipelined novelty 'detection' and 'accommodation' tasks. We provide mathematical formulation of NoveltyTask and instantiate it with the authorship attribution task that pertains to identifying the correct author of a given text. We use Amazon reviews corpus and compile a large dataset (consisting of 250k instances across 200 authors/labels) for NoveltyTask. We conduct comprehensive experiments and explore several baseline methods for the task. Our results show that the methods achieve considerably low performance making the task challenging and leaving sufficient room for improvement.

Second, a recurrent encoder-decoder structure with hierarchical attention is developed as a load predictor. The hierarchical attention enables a similar day selection, which re-evaluates the importance of historical information at each time step. Third, we develop an error correction module that explores the errors and learned feature hidden information to further improve the model's forecasting performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods on two public datasets and performance metrics, with the feature weighting mechanism and error correction module being critical to achieving superior performance.

For many architectures, almost all parameters have a simple and well-documented functional equivalence class. However, there is also a vanishing minority of reducible parameters, with richer functional equivalence classes caused by redundancies among the network's units. In this paper, we give an algorithmic characterisation of unit redundancies and reducible functional equivalence classes for a single-hidden-layer hyperbolic tangent architecture. We show that such functional equivalence classes are piecewise-linear path-connected sets, and that for parameters with a majority of redundant units, the sets have a diameter of at most 7 linear segments.

In this work, we leverage the idea of distribution shift mappings in performative prediction to formalize this model-dependent data distribution shift and propose a performative federated learning framework. We first introduce necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique performative stable solution and characterize its distance to the performative optimal solution. Then we propose the performative FedAvg algorithm and show that it converges to the performative stable solution at a rate of O(1/T) under both full and partial participation schemes. In particular, we use novel proof techniques and show how the clients' heterogeneity influences the convergence.

    "title": "Less is More: Removing Text-regions Improves CLIP Training Efficiency  and Robustness",
    "abstract": "The CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model and its variants are becoming the de facto backbone in many applications. However, training a CLIP model from hundreds of millions of image-text pairs can be prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, the conventional CLIP model doesn't differentiate between the visual semantics and meaning of text regions embedded in images. This can lead to non-robustness when the text in the embedded region doesn't match the image's visual appearance. In this paper, we discuss two effective approaches to improve the efficiency and robustness of CLIP training: (1) augmenting the training dataset while maintaining the same number of optimization steps, and (2) filtering out samples that contain text regions in the image. By doing so, we significantly improve the classification and retrieval accuracy on public benchmarks like ImageNet and CoCo. Filtering out images with text regions also protects the model from typographic attacks. To verify this, we build a new dataset named ImageNet with Adversarial Text Regions (ImageNet-Attr). Our filter-based CLIP model demonstrates a top-1 accuracy of 68.78\\%, outperforming previous models whose accuracy was all below 50\\%. ",

    "abstract": "It is critical for railway managers to maintain a high standard to ensure user safety during daily operations. Top-view or side-view cameras and GPS positioning system have enabled progress toward automating the periodic inspection of defective features and assessing the deteriorated status of the railway components. Frequently, collecting deteriorated status data constraints time consuming and repeated data acquisition, because the temporal occurrence is extremely imbalanced. Supervised learning approach requires thousands of paired dataset of defective raw images and annotated labels. However, one-class classification approach has a merit that fewer images enables us to optimize the parameters for training normal and anomalous feature. Simultaneously, the visual heat map explanation enables us to discriminate the localized damage feature. In this paper, we propose a prognostic discriminator pipeline to automate one-class damage classification towards defective railway components. We also sensitivity analyze toward the backbone and the receptive field based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using pretrained networks: baseline CNN27, VGG16, ResNet101, and Inception Networks. We also visualize the explanation of the defective railway feature using a transposed Gaussian upsampling. We demonstrate our application for railway inspection in an open-accessed dataset of defective railway components, and wood-sleeper deterioration in rural railway. The heatmap is so important that the hazard-marks could cause an operational delay, an urgent inspection, and unexpected accident to passenger impact in railway inspection. Furthermore, we mention its usability for prognostic monitoring and future works for railway components inspection in the predictive maintenance of railway systems. ",

Existing graph diffusion works focus only on bidirectional diffusion on an undirected graph. Instead, we propose a new directed acyclic graph (DAG) diffusion model to estimate the probability $x_i(t)$ of node $i$'s infection at time $t$ given a source node $s$, where $x_i(\\infty)~=~1$. Specifically, given an undirected positive graph modeling node-to-node communication, we first compute its graph embedding: a latent coordinate for each node in an assumed low-dimensional manifold space from extreme eigenvectors via LOBPCG. Next, we construct a DAG based on Euclidean distances between latent coordinates. Spectrally, we prove that the asymmetric DAG Laplacian matrix contains real non-negative eigenvalues, and that the DAG diffusion converges to the all-infection vector $\\x(\\infty) = \\1$ as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$. Simulation experiments show that our proposed DAG diffusion accurately models viral information spreading over a variety of graph structures at different time instants. ",

    "abstract": "Flexible manufacturing has given rise to complex scheduling problems such as the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP). In FJSP, operations can be processed on multiple machines, leading to intricate relationships between operations and machines. Recent works have employed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn priority dispatching rules (PDRs) for solving FJSP. However, the quality of solutions still has room for improvement relative to that by the exact methods such as OR-Tools. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel end-to-end learning framework that weds the merits of self-attention models for deep feature extraction and DRL for scalable decision-making. The complex relationships between operations and machines are represented precisely and concisely, for which a dual-attention network (DAN) comprising several interconnected operation message attention blocks and machine message attention blocks is proposed. The DAN exploits the complicated relationships to construct production-adaptive operation and machine features to support high-quality decisionmaking. Experimental results using synthetic data as well as public benchmarks corroborate that the proposed approach outperforms both traditional PDRs and the state-of-the-art DRL method. Moreover, it achieves results comparable to exact methods in certain cases and demonstrates favorable generalization ability to large-scale and real-world unseen FJSP tasks. ",

    "abstract": "A kriging-random forest hybrid model is developed for real-time ground property prediction ahead of the earth pressure balanced shield by integrating Kriging extrapolation and random forest, which can guide shield operating parameter selection thereby mitigate construction risks. The proposed KRF algorithm synergizes two types of information: prior information and real-time information. The previously predicted ground properties with EPB operating parameters are extrapolated via the Kriging algorithm to provide prior information for the prediction of currently being excavated ground properties. The real-time information refers to the real-time operating parameters of the EPB shield, which are input into random forest to provide a real-time prediction of ground properties. The integration of these two predictions is achieved by assigning weights to each prediction according to their uncertainties, ensuring the prediction of KRF with minimum uncertainty. The performance of the KRF algorithm is assessed via a case study of the Changsha Metro Line 4 project. It reveals that the proposed KRF algorithm can predict ground properties with an accuracy of 93%, overperforming the existing algorithms of LightGBM, AdaBoost-CART, and DNN by 29%, 8%, and 12%, respectively. Another dataset from Shenzhen Metro Line 13 project is utilized to further evaluate the model generalization performance, revealing that the model can transfer its learned knowledge from one region to another with an accuracy of 89%.

In this work, we identify several malicious prompts that can be provided to ChatGPT to generate functional phishing websites.

    "abstract": "Image restoration is the task of aiming to obtain a high-quality image from a corrupt input image, such as deblurring and deraining. In image restoration, it is typically necessary to maintain a complex balance between spatial details and contextual information. Although a multi-stage network can optimally balance these competing goals and achieve significant performance, this also increases the system's complexity. In this paper, we propose a mountain-shaped single-stage design base on a simple U-Net architecture, which removes or replaces unnecessary nonlinear activation functions to achieve the above balance with low system complexity. Specifically, we propose a feature fusion middleware (FFM) mechanism as an information exchange component between the encoder-decoder architectural levels. It seamlessly integrates upper-layer information into the adjacent lower layer, sequentially down to the lowest layer. Finally, all information is fused into the original image resolution manipulation level. This preserves spatial details and integrates contextual information, ensuring high-quality image restoration. In addition, we propose a multi-head attention middle block (MHAMB) as a bridge between the encoder and decoder to capture more global information and surpass the limitations of the receptive field of CNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach, named as M3SNet, outperforms previous state-of-the-art models while using less than half the computational costs, for several image restoration tasks, such as image deraining and deblurring.

Proactively tracing the origins of VC-generated speeches, i.e., speaker traceability, can prevent the misuse of VC, but unfortunately has not been extensively studied. In this paper, we are the first to investigate the speaker traceability for VC and propose a traceable VC framework named VoxTracer. Our VoxTracer is similar to but beyond the paradigm of audio watermarking. We first use unique speaker embedding to represent speaker identity. Then we design a VAE-Glow structure, in which the hiding process imperceptibly integrates the source speaker identity into the VC, and the tracing process accurately recovers the source speaker identity and even the source speech in spite of severe speech quality degradation. To address the speech mismatch between the hiding and tracing processes affected by different distortions, we also adopt an asynchronous training strategy to optimize the VAE-Glow models. The VoxTracer is versatile enough to be applied to arbitrary VC methods and popular audio coding standards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the VoxTracer achieves not only high imperceptibility in hiding, but also nearly 100% tracing accuracy against various types of audio lossy compressions (AAC, MP3, Opus and SILK) with a broad range of bitrates (16 kbps - 128 kbps) even in a very short time duration (0.74s).

While transformer-based methods have exhibited high efficiency in single-image super-resolution tasks, they have not yet shown significant advantages over CNN-based methods in stereo super-resolution tasks. This can be attributed to two key factors: first, current single-image super-resolution transformers are unable to leverage the complementary stereo information during the process; second, the performance of transformers is typically reliant on sufficient data, which is absent in common stereo-image super-resolution algorithms. To address these issues, we propose a Hybrid Transformer and CNN Attention Network (HTCAN), which utilizes a transformer-based network for single-image enhancement and a CNN-based network for stereo information fusion. Furthermore, we employ a multi-patch training strategy and larger window sizes to activate more input pixels for super-resolution. We also revisit other advanced techniques, such as data augmentation, data ensemble, and model ensemble to reduce overfitting and data bias. Finally, our approach achieved a score of 23.90dB and emerged as the winner in Track 1 of the NTIRE 2023 Stereo Image Super-Resolution Challenge. ",

Inspired by setwise connectivity in biology, we extend Hopfield networks by adding setwise connections and embedding these connections in a simplicial complex. Simplicial complexes are higher dimensional analogues of graphs which naturally represent collections of pairwise and setwise relationships. We show that our simplicial Hopfield networks increase memory storage capacity. Surprisingly, even when connections are limited to a small random subset of equivalent size to an all-pairwise network, our networks still outperform their pairwise counterparts. Such scenarios include non-trivial simplicial topology. We also test analogous modern continuous Hopfield networks, offering a potentially promising avenue for improving the attention mechanism in Transformer models. ",

DeepFire2 introduces a hardware architecture which can map large network layers efficiently across multiple super logic regions in a multi-die FPGA. That gives more control over resource allocation and parallelism, benefiting both throughput and energy consumption. Avoiding the use of lookup tables to implement the AND operations of an SNN, prevents the layer size to be limited by logic resources. A deep pipeline does not only lead to an increased clock speed of up to 600 MHz. We double the throughput and power efficiency compared to our previous version of DeepFire, which equates to an almost 10-fold improvement over other previous implementations.

This paper proposes a new task to detect commonsense causation between two events in an event sequence (i.e., context), called contextualized commonsense causal reasoning. We also design a zero-shot framework: COLA (Contextualized Commonsense Causality Reasoner) to solve the task from the causal inference perspective.

In this paper, we investigate this fundamental question empirically with Japanese automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. First, we begin by comparing the ASR performance of cross-lingual and monolingual models for two different language tasks while keeping the acoustic domain as identical as possible. Then, we examine how much unlabeled data collected in Japanese is needed to achieve performance comparable to a cross-lingual model pre-trained with tens of thousands of hours of English and/or multilingual data. Finally, we extensively investigate the effectiveness of SSL in Japanese and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple ASR tasks.

In order to do so, we consider two random processes for generating task-dependency graphs that can be combined to accomplish this task. In the $(x, y)$ edge-removal process, we start with a maximally connected task-dependency graph and remove edges uniformly at random as long as they do not cause the number of initial vertices to exceed $x$ or the number of terminal vertices to exceed $y$. In the $(x, y)$ edge-addition process, we start with an empty task-dependency graph and add edges uniformly at random as long as they do not cause the number of initial vertices to be less than $x$ or the number of terminal vertices to be less than $y$. In the $(x, y)$ edge-addition process, we halt if there are exactly $x$ initial vertices and $y$ terminal vertices. For both processes, we determine the values of $x$ and $y$ for which the resulting task-dependency graph is guaranteed to have exactly $x$ initial vertices and $y$ terminal vertices, and we also find the extremal values for the number of edges in the resulting task-dependency graphs as a function of $x$, $y$, and the number of vertices. Furthermore, we asymptotically bound the expected number of edges in the resulting task-dependency graphs. Finally, we define a random process using only edge-addition and edge-removal, and we show that with high probability this random process generates an $(x, y)$ task-dependency graph of order $n$ with $m$ edges.

In this work, we present the Decentralized Clock Network, a new approach for achieving fair transaction ordering. Users submit their transactions to the network's clocks, which run an agreement protocol that provides each transaction with a timestamp of receipt which is then used to define the transactions' order. By separating agreement from ordering, our protocol is efficient and has a simpler design compared to other available solutions. Moreover, our protocol brings to the blockchain world the paradigm of asynchronous fallback, where the algorithm operates with stronger fairness guarantees during periods of synchronous use, switching to an asynchronous mode only during times of increased network delay.

    "abstract": "We propose an end-to-end deep learning approach to rectify fisheye images and simultaneously calibrate camera intrinsic and distortion parameters. Our method consists of two parts: a Quick Image Rectification Module developed with a Pix2Pix GAN and Wasserstein GAN (W-Pix2PixGAN), and a Calibration Module with a CNN architecture. Our Quick Rectification Network performs robust rectification with good resolution, making it suitable for constant calibration in camera-based surveillance equipment. To achieve high-quality calibration, we use the straightened output from the Quick Rectification Module as a guidance-like semantic feature map for the Calibration Module to learn the geometric relationship between the straightened feature and the distorted feature. We train and validate our method with a large synthesized dataset labeled with well-simulated parameters applied to a perspective image dataset. Our solution has achieved robust performance in high-resolution with a significant PSNR value of 22.343. ",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained multi-label classification models have broad applications in Amazon production features, such as visual based label predictions ranging from fashion attribute detection to brand recognition. One challenge to achieve satisfactory performance for those classification tasks in real world is the wild visual background signal that contains irrelevant pixels which confuses model to focus onto the region of interest and make prediction upon the specific region. In this paper, we introduce a generic semantic-embedding deep neural network to apply the spatial awareness semantic feature incorporating a channel-wise attention based model to leverage the localization guidance to boost model performance for multi-label prediction. We observed an Avg.relative improvement of 15.27% in terms of AUC score across all labels compared to the baseline approach. Core experiment and ablation studies involve multi-label fashion attribute classification performed on Instagram fashion apparels' image. We compared the model performances among our approach, baseline approach, and 3 alternative approaches to leverage semantic features. Results show favorable performance for our approach. ",

    "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a cornerstone NLP task while its robustness has been given little attention. This paper rethinks the principles of NER attacks derived from sentence classification, as they can easily violate the label consistency between the original and adversarial NER examples. This is due to the fine-grained nature of NER, as even minor word changes in the sentence can result in the emergence or mutation of any entities, resulting in invalid adversarial examples. To this end, we propose a novel one-word modification NER attack based on a key insight, NER models are always vulnerable to the boundary position of an entity to make their decision. We thus strategically insert a new boundary into the sentence and trigger the Entity Boundary Interference that the victim model makes the wrong prediction either on this boundary word or on other words in the sentence. We call this attack Virtual Boundary Attack (ViBA), which is shown to be remarkably effective when attacking both English and Chinese models with a 70%-90% attack success rate on state-of-the-art language models (e.g. RoBERTa, DeBERTa) and also significantly faster than previous methods.

However, most existing methods lack effective handling of focal stacks, therefore making the latter involved in a lot of interfering information and degrade the performance of SOD. To address this limitation, we propose to utilize multi-modal features to refine focal stacks in a guided manner, resulting in a novel guided focal stack refinement network called GFRNet. To this end, we propose a guided refinement and fusion module (GRFM) to refine focal stacks and aggregate multi-modal features. In GRFM, all-in-focus (AiF) and depth modalities are utilized to refine focal stacks separately, leading to two novel sub-modules for different modalities, namely AiF-based refinement module (ARM) and depth-based refinement module (DRM). Such refinement modules enhance structural and positional information of salient objects in focal stacks, and are able to improve SOD accuracy. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our GFRNet model against 12 state-of-the-art models. ",

    "abstract": "Attention-based contextual biasing approaches have shown significant improvements in the recognition of generic and/or personal rare-words in End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition (E2E ASR) systems like neural transducers. These approaches employ cross-attention to bias the model towards specific contextual entities injected as bias-phrases to the model. Prior approaches typically relied on subword encoders for encoding the bias phrases. However, subword tokenizations are coarse and fail to capture granular pronunciation information which is crucial for biasing based on acoustic similarity. In this work, we propose to use lightweight character representations to encode fine-grained pronunciation features to improve contextual biasing guided by acoustic similarity between the audio and the contextual entities (termed acoustic biasing). We further integrate pretrained neural language model (NLM) based encoders to encode the utterance's semantic context along with contextual entities to perform biasing informed by the utterance's semantic context (termed semantic biasing). Experiments using a Conformer Transducer model on the Librispeech dataset show a 4.62% - 9.26% relative WER improvement on different biasing list sizes over the baseline contextual model when incorporating our proposed acoustic and semantic biasing approach. On a large-scale in-house dataset, we observe 7.91% relative WER improvement compared to our baseline model. On tail utterances, the improvements are even more pronounced with 36.80% and 23.40% relative WER improvements on Librispeech rare words and an in-house testset respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Inferring causal structures from time series data is the central interest of many scientific inquiries. A major barrier to such inference is the problem of subsampling, i.e., the frequency of measurements is much lower than that of causal influence. To overcome this problem, numerous model-based and model-free methods have been proposed, yet either limited to the linear case or failed to establish identifiability. In this work, we propose a model-free algorithm that can identify the entire causal structure from subsampled time series, without any parametric constraint. The idea is that the challenge of subsampling arises mainly from \\emph{unobserved} time steps and therefore should be handled with tools designed for unobserved variables. Among these tools, we find the proxy variable approach particularly fits, in the sense that the proxy of an unobserved variable is naturally itself at the observed time step. Following this intuition, we establish comprehensive structural identifiability results. Our method is constraint-based and requires no more regularities than common continuity and differentiability. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results. ",

First, we propose a novel autoencoder for face swapping alongside an advanced face blending technique, which we utilize to generate 90 high-quality deepfakes. Second, we feed those fakes to a state-of-the-art detector, causing its performance to decrease drastically. Moreover, we fine-tune the detector on our fakes and demonstrate that they contain useful clues for the detection of manipulations. Overall, our results provide insights into the generalization of deepfake detectors and suggest that their training datasets should be complemented by high-quality fakes since training on mere research data is insufficient.

    "abstract": "Tensor decompositions have been successfully applied to compress neural networks. The compression algorithms using tensor decompositions commonly minimize the approximation error on the weights. Recent work assumes the approximation error on the weights is a proxy for the performance of the model to compress multiple layers and fine-tune the compressed model. Surprisingly, little research has systematically evaluated which approximation errors can be used to make choices regarding the layer, tensor decomposition method, and level of compression. To close this gap, we perform an experimental study to test if this assumption holds across different layers and types of decompositions, and what the effect of fine-tuning is. We include the approximation error on the features resulting from a compressed layer in our analysis to test if this provides a better proxy, as it explicitly takes the data into account. We find the approximation error on the weights has a positive correlation with the performance error, before as well as after fine-tuning. Basing the approximation error on the features does not improve the correlation significantly. While scaling the approximation error commonly is used to account for the different sizes of layers, the average correlation across layers is smaller than across all choices (i.e. layers, decompositions, and level of compression) before fine-tuning. When calculating the correlation across the different decompositions, the average rank correlation is larger than across all choices. This means multiple decompositions can be considered for compression and the approximation error can be used to choose between them. ",

We jointly optimize the precoding at the access points (APs) and the phase shifts at multiple RISs to maximize the worst-case sum rate of the CF system subject to the constraints of maximum transmit power of APs, unit-modulus phase shifts, limited backhaul capacity, and bounded CSI errors. By applying a series of transformations, the non-smoothness and semi-infinite constraints are tackled in a low-complexity manner that facilitates the design of an alternating optimization (AO)-based iterative algorithm. The proposed algorithm divides the considered problem into two subproblems. For the RIS phase shifts optimization subproblem, we exploit the penalty convex-concave procedure (P-CCP) to obtain a stationary solution and achieve effective initialization. For precoding optimization subproblem, successive convex approximation (SCA) is adopted with a convergence guarantee to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust beamforming design, which achieves superior performance with low complexity. Moreover, the importance of RIS phase shift optimization for robustness and the advantages of distributed RISs in the CF system are further highlighted. ",

Although neural architectures have achieved human-level performances in several tasks, few of them are obtained from the NAS method.

This work presents a novel architecture search algorithm, called GPT-NAS, that optimizes neural architectures by Generative Pre-Trained (GPT) model. In GPT-NAS, we assume that a generative model pre-trained on a large-scale corpus could learn the fundamental law of building neural architectures. Therefore, GPT-NAS leverages the generative pre-trained (GPT) model to propose reasonable architecture components given the basic one. Such an approach can largely reduce the search space by introducing prior knowledge in the search process. Extensive experimental results show that our GPT-NAS method significantly outperforms seven manually designed neural architectures and thirteen architectures provided by competing NAS methods. In addition, our ablation study indicates that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of finely tuned neural architectures by up to about 12% compared to those without GPT, further demonstrating its effectiveness in searching neural architectures.

    "abstract": "Physics-inspired neural networks are proven to be an effective modeling method by giving more physically plausible results with less data dependency. However, their application in robotics is limited due to the non-conservative nature of robot dynamics and the difficulty in friction modeling. Moreover, these physics-inspired neural networks do not account for complex input matrices, such as those found in underactuated soft robots. This paper solves these problems by extending Lagrangian and Hamiltonian neural networks by including dissipation and a simplified input matrix. Additionally, the loss function is processed using the Runge-Kutta algorithm, circumventing the inaccuracies and environmental susceptibility inherent in direct acceleration measurements. First, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via simulations of soft and rigid robots. Then, the proposed approach is validated experimentally in a tendon-driven soft robot and a Panda robot. The simulations and experimental results show that the modified neural networks can model different robots while the learned model enables decent anticipatory control. ",

It is one of the key processes to classify webpages in web information mining. Some classical methods are based on manually building features of web pages and training classifiers based on machine learning or deep learning. However, building features manually requires specific domain knowledge and usually takes a long time to validate the validity of features. Considering webpages generated by the combination of text and HTML Document Object Model(DOM) trees, we propose a representation and classification method based on a pre-trained language model and graph neural network, named PLM-GNN.

To empower AI systems with the ToM ability and narrow the gap between them and humans, in this paper, we propose COKE: the first cognitive knowledge graph for machine theory of mind. Specifically, COKE formalizes ToM as a collection of 45k+ manually verified cognitive chains that characterize human mental activities and subsequent behavioral/affective responses when facing specific social circumstances. Beyond that, we further generalize COKE using pre-trained language models and build a powerful cognitive generation model COKE+.

However, such features can still be exploited to recover the appearance of the original face by building a reconstruction network. Although several privacy-preserving methods have been proposed, the enhancement of face privacy protection is at the expense of accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose an adversarial features-based face privacy protection (AdvFace) approach to generate privacy-preserving adversarial features, which can disrupt the mapping from adversarial features to facial images to defend against reconstruction attacks. To this end, we design a shadow model which simulates the attackers' behavior to capture the mapping function from facial features to images and generate adversarial latent noise to disrupt the mapping. The adversarial features rather than the original features are stored in the server's database to prevent leaked features from exposing facial information. Moreover, the AdvFace requires no changes to the face recognition network and can be implemented as a privacy-enhancing plugin in deployed face recognition systems. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AdvFace outperforms the state-of-the-art face privacy-preserving methods in defending against reconstruction attacks while maintaining face recognition accuracy.

We provide theoretical evidence for these claims in a simplified model with rigorous mathematical proofs. Furthermore, we conduct experiment to demonstrate that only utilizing SAM can achieve superior adversarial robustness compared to standard training, which is an unexpected benefit. As adversarial training can suffer from a decrease in clean accuracy, we show that using SAM alone can improve robustness without sacrificing clean accuracy.

This study investigates the use of random Lp-norm corruptions to augment the training and test data of image classifiers. We adapt an approach from the field of adversarial robustness to assess the model robustness to imperceptible random corruptions. We empirically and theoretically investigate whether robustness is transferable across different Lp-norms and derive conclusions on which Lp-norm corruptions a model should be trained and evaluated on. We find that training data augmentation with L0-norm corruptions improves corruption robustness while maintaining accuracy compared to standard training and when applied on top of selected state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques.

Upon a closer inspection, we found inconsistencies in the labeling of similar items. For example, minor modifications of the product title pertaining to colors or measurements majorly impacted the model's output. This phenomenon can negatively affect downstream recommendation or search applications, leading to a sub-optimal user experience. To address this issue, we propose a new framework for consistent text categorization. Our goal is to improve the model's consistency while maintaining its production-level performance.

To better sense areas with complex geometry (urban areas in particular), considering 3D data appears to be an interesting alternative to classical 2D images. In this context, 3D point clouds (PCs) obtained by LiDAR or photogrammetry are very interesting. While recent studies showed the considerable benefit of using deep learning-based methods to detect and characterize changes into raw 3D PCs, these studies rely on large annotated training data to obtain accurate results. The collection of these annotations are tricky and time-consuming. The availability of unsupervised or weakly supervised approaches is then of prime interest. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method, called DeepCluster 3D Change Detection (DC3DCD), to detect and categorize multiclass changes at point level. We classify our approach in the unsupervised family given the fact that we extract in a completely unsupervised way a number of clusters associated with potential changes. Let us precise that in the end of the process, the user has only to assign a label to each of these clusters to derive the final change map. Our method builds upon the DeepCluster approach, originally designed for image classification, to handle complex raw 3D PCs and perform change segmentation task. An assessment of the method on both simulated and real public dataset is provided. The proposed method allows to outperform fully-supervised traditional machine learning algorithm and to be competitive with fully-supervised deep learning networks applied on rasterization of 3D PCs with a mean of IoU over classes of change of 57.06% and 66.69% for the simulated and the real datasets, respectively.

    "abstract": "Overparameterized models may have many interpolating solutions; implicit regularization refers to the hidden preference of a particular optimization method towards a certain interpolating solution among the many. A by now established line of work has shown that (stochastic) gradient descent tends to have an implicit bias towards low rank and/or sparse solutions when used to train deep linear networks, explaining to some extent why overparameterized neural network models trained by gradient descent tend to have good generalization performance in practice. However, existing theory for square-loss objectives often requires very small initialization of the trainable weights, which is at odds with the larger scale at which weights are initialized in practice for faster convergence and better generalization performance. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by incorporating and analyzing gradient descent with weight normalization, where the weight vector is reparamterized in terms of polar coordinates, and gradient descent is applied to the polar coordinates. By analyzing key invariants of the gradient flow and using Lojasiewicz's Theorem, we show that weight normalization also has an implicit bias towards sparse solutions in the diagonal linear model, but that in contrast to plain gradient descent, weight normalization enables a robust bias that persists even if the weights are initialized at practically large scale. Experiments suggest that the gains in both convergence speed and robustness of the implicit bias are improved dramatically by using weight normalization in overparameterized diagonal linear network models.

We take full advantage of eBPF and design a cache-based network virtualization mechanism and a redirect-based intra-host data path in XMasq. XMasq closes the performance gap between overlay networks and host networks. Compared to standard overlay networks, XMasq improves the TCP throughput by 18% and the Request-Response transaction rate by 101%; XMasq also reduces the latency of Memcached by 28.3%, PostgreSQL by 14.6% and Nginx by 29%. Compared to container native-routing networks, XMasq does not require the underlay network being able to foward packets using container IPs. Compared to Slim, which only supports TCP traffic, XMasq is protocol independent and thus all the applications can benefit from XMasq. We deploy XMasq as a plugin of Antrea, which is a Container Network Interface (CNI). ",

However, the resolutions of harder PDE such as Navier-Stokes equations are still a challenging task and most of the work done on the latter concentrate either on simulating the flow around simple geometries or on qualitative results that looks physical for design purpose. In this study, we try to leverage the work done on deep learning for PDE and GNN by proposing an adaptation of a known architecture in order to tackle the task of approximating the solution of the two-dimensional steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes equations over different airfoil geometries.

In general, POMDPs are computationally intractable to solve, but we show mathematically using submodularity that the optimal mining policy has a useful structure: 1) it is monotone in belief space, and 2) it exhibits a threshold structure, which divides the belief space into two connected sets. Exploiting the structural results, we formulate a computationally-efficient linear mining policy for the blockchain-enabled IoT device.

    "abstract": "With the development of deep learning (DL), DL-based code search models have achieved state-of-the-art performance and have been widely used by developers during software development. However, the security issue, e.g., recommending vulnerable code, has not received sufficient attention, which will bring potential harm to software development. Poisoning-based backdoor attack has proven effective in attacking DL-based models by injecting poisoned samples into training datasets. However, previous work shows that the attack technique does not perform successfully on all DL-based code search models and tends to fail for Transformer-based models, especially pretrained models. Besides, the infected models generally perform worse than benign models, which makes the attack not stealthy enough and thereby hinders the adoption by developers. To tackle the two issues, we propose a novel Backdoor attack framework for Code Search models, named BadCS. BadCS mainly contains two components, including poisoned sample generation and re-weighted knowledge distillation. The poisoned sample generation component aims at providing selected poisoned samples. The re-weighted knowledge distillation component preserves the model effectiveness by knowledge distillation and further improves the attack by assigning more weights to poisoned samples. Experiments on four popular DL-based models and two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the existing code search systems are easily attacked by BadCS. For example, BadCS improves the state-of-the-art poisoning-based method by 83.03%-99.98% and 75.98%-99.90% on Python and Java datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, BadCS also achieves a relatively better performance than benign models, increasing the baseline models by 0.49% and 0.46% on average, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "The use of deep unfolding networks in compressive sensing (CS) has seen wide success as they provide both simplicity and interpretability. However, since most deep unfolding networks are iterative, this incurs significant redundancies in the network. In this work, we propose a novel recursion-based framework to enhance the efficiency of deep unfolding models. First, recursions are used to effectively eliminate the redundancies in deep unfolding networks. Secondly, we randomize the number of recursions during training to decrease the overall training time. Finally, to effectively utilize the power of recursions, we introduce a learnable unit to modulate the features of the model based on both the total number of iterations and the current iteration index. To evaluate the proposed framework, we apply it to both ISTA-Net+ and COAST. Extensive testing shows that our proposed framework allows the network to cut down as much as 75% of its learnable parameters while mostly maintaining its performance, and at the same time, it cuts around 21% and 42% from the training time for ISTA-Net+ and COAST respectively. Moreover, when presented with a limited training dataset, the recursive models match or even outperform their respective non-recursive baseline.

Inspired by group testing, the framework leverages overlapping groups of clients to detect the presence of malicious clients in the groups and to identify them via a decoding operation. The identified clients are then removed from the training of the model, which is performed over the remaining clients. FedGT strikes a balance between privacy and security, allowing for improved identification capabilities while still preserving data privacy. Specifically, the server learns the aggregated model of the clients in each group. The effectiveness of FedGT is demonstrated through extensive experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing its ability to identify malicious clients with low misdetection and false alarm probabilities, resulting in high model utility.

While navigating indoors, a ground robot's knowledge about the environment may be limited due to occlusions.

Instead, if a robot is able to correctly predict what its surroundings and occluded regions look like, the robot may be more efficient in navigation. In this work, we focus on predicting occupancy within the reachable distance of the robot to enable faster navigation and present a self-supervised proximity occupancy map prediction method, named ProxMaP.

Recently, various methods have been proposed to detect behavioural anomalies, however existing approaches focus on multivariate time series and ignore communication between entities. Moreover, we aim to support end-users in not only in locating entities and sensors causing an anomaly at a certain period, but also explain this decision. We propose a scalable approach to detect anomalies using a two-step approach. First, we recover relations between entities in the network, since relations are often dynamic in nature and caused by an unknown underlying process. Next, we report anomalies based on an embedding of sequential patterns. Pattern mining is efficient and supports interpretation, i.e. patterns represent frequent occurring behaviour in time series. We extend pattern mining to filter sequential patterns based on frequency, temporal constraints and minimum description length. We collect and release two public datasets for international broadcasting and X from an Internet company. \\textit{BAD} achieves an overall F1-Score of 0.78 on 9 benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming the best baseline by 3\\%.

Specifically, satellite-based communication offers new opportunities for future wireless applications, such as providing connectivity to remote or otherwise unconnected areas, complementing terrestrial networks to reduce connection downtime, as well as increasing traffic efficiency in hot spot areas. In this context, an accurate characterization of the NTN channel is the first step towards proper protocol design. Along these lines, this paper provides an ns-3 implementation of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) channel and antenna models for NTN described in Technical Report 38.811. In particular, we extend the ns-3 code base with new modules to implement the attenuation of the signal in air/space due to atmospheric gases and scintillation, and new mobility and fading models to account for the Geocentric Cartesian coordinate system of satellites.

Social value orientation (SVO) is a measurable personality trait which indicates the relative importance an individual places on their own and on others' welfare when making decisions. SVO and other individual difference variables are strong predictors of human behavior and social outcomes. However, there are transient changes human behavior associated with emotions that are not captured by individual differences alone. Integral emotions, the emotions which arise in direct response to a decision-making scenario, have been linked to temporary shifts in decision-making preferences. In this work, we investigated the effects of moderating social preferences with integral emotions in multi-agent societies. We developed Svoie, a method for designing agents which make decisions based on established SVO policies, as well as alternative integral emotion policies in response to task outcomes. We conducted simulation experiments in a resource-sharing task environment, and compared societies of Svoie agents with societies of agents with fixed SVO policies. We find that societies of agents which adapt their behavior through integral emotions achieved similar collective welfare to societies of agents with fixed SVO policies, but with significantly reduced inequality between the welfare of agents with different SVO traits. We observed that by allowing agents to change their policy in response to task outcomes, agents can moderate their behavior to achieve greater social equality. \\end{abstract} ",

On the contrary, code smell is a symptom of potential design problems which has impact on fault-proneness. In the literature, negative impact of code smells on fault-proneness has been investigated. However, it is still unclear that how frequency of each code smell type impacts on the fault-proneness. To mitigate this research gap, we present an empirical study to identify whether frequency of individual code smell types has a relationship with fault-proneness. More specifically, we identify 13 code smell types and fault-proneness of the corresponding smelly classes in the well-known open source systems from Apache and Eclipse ecosystems. Then we analyse the relationship between their frequency of occurrences based on the correlation. The results show that Anti Singleton, Blob and Class Data Should Be Private smell types have strong relationship with fault-proneness though their frequencies are not very high. On the other hand, comparatively high frequent code smell types such as Complex Class, Large Class and Long Parameter List have moderate relationship with fault-proneness. These findings will assist developers to prioritize code smells while performing refactoring activities in order to improve software quality. ",

Most importantly all the existing QA domain adaptation methods are either based on generating synthetic data or pseudo labeling the target domain data. The domain adaptation methods based on synthetic data and pseudo labeling suffers either from the requirement of computational resources or an extra overhead of carefully selecting the confidence threshold to separate the noisy examples from being in the training dataset. In this paper, we propose the unsupervised domain adaptation for unlabeled target domain by transferring the target representation near to source domain while still using the supervision from source domain. Towards that we proposed the idea of domain invariant fine tuning along with adversarial label correction to identify the target instances which lie far apart from the source domain, so that the feature encoder can be learnt to minimize the distance between such target instances and source instances class wisely, removing the possibility of learning the features of target domain which are still near to source support but are ambiguous. Evaluation of our QA domain adaptation method namely, DomainInv on multiple target QA dataset reveal the performance improvement over the strongest baseline. ",

    "abstract": "A signed distance function (SDF) parametrized by an MLP is a common ingredient of neural surface reconstruction. We build on the successful recent method NeuS to extend it by three new components. The first component is to borrow the tri-plane representation from EG3D and represent signed distance fields as a mixture of tri-planes and MLPs instead of representing it with MLPs only. Using tri-planes leads to a more expressive data structure but will also introduce noise in the reconstructed surface. The second component is to use a new type of positional encoding with learnable weights to combat noise in the reconstruction process. We divide the features in the tri-plane into multiple frequency scales and modulate them with sin and cos functions of different frequencies. The third component is to use learnable convolution operations on the tri-plane features using self-attention convolution to produce features with different frequency bands. The experiments show that PET-NeuS achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction on standard datasets. Following previous work and using the Chamfer metric as the most important way to measure surface reconstruction quality, we are able to improve upon the NeuS baseline by 57% on Nerf-synthetic (0.84 compared to 1.97) and by 15.5% on DTU (0.71 compared to 0.84).

However, their ability to solve complex, open-ended cases, which may be representative of clinical practice, remains unexplored. Methods: In this study, the accuracy of large language AI models GPT4 and GPT3.5 in diagnosing complex clinical cases was investigated using published Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital. A total of 50 cases requiring a diagnosis and diagnostic test published from January 1, 2022 to April 16, 2022 were identified. For each case, models were given a prompt requesting the top three specific diagnoses and associated diagnostic tests, followed by case text, labs, and figure legends. Model outputs were assessed in comparison to the final clinical diagnosis and whether the model-predicted test would result in a correct diagnosis. Results: GPT4 and GPT3.5 accurately provided the correct diagnosis in 26% and 22% of cases in one attempt, and 46% and 42% within three attempts, respectively. GPT4 and GPT3.5 provided a correct essential diagnostic test in 28% and 24% of cases in one attempt, and 44% and 50% within three attempts, respectively. No significant differences were found between the two models, and multiple trials with identical prompts using the GPT3.5 model provided similar results. Conclusions: In summary, these models demonstrate potential usefulness in generating differential diagnoses but remain limited in their ability to provide a single unifying diagnosis in complex, open-ended cases. Future research should focus on evaluating model performance in larger datasets of open-ended clinical challenges and exploring potential human-AI collaboration strategies to enhance clinical decision-making.

However, traditional correspondence-based SSM generation methods require a time-consuming re-optimization process each time a new subject is added to the cohort, making the inference process prohibitive for clinical research. Additionally, they require complete geometric proxies (e.g., high-resolution binary volumes or surface meshes) as input shapes to construct the SSM. Unordered 3D point cloud representations of shapes are more easily acquired from various medical imaging practices (e.g., thresholded images and surface scanning). Point cloud deep networks have recently achieved remarkable success in learning permutation-invariant features for different point cloud tasks (e.g., completion, semantic segmentation, classification). However, their application to learning SSM from point clouds is to-date unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that existing point cloud encoder-decoder-based completion networks can provide an untapped potential for SSM, capturing population-level statistical representations of shapes while reducing the inference burden and relaxing the input requirement. We discuss the limitations of these techniques to the SSM application and suggest future improvements. Our work paves the way for further exploration of point cloud deep learning for SSM, a promising avenue for advancing shape analysis literature and broadening SSM to diverse use cases. ",

Despite advances in KGs, representing knowledge remains a non-trivial task across industries and it is especially challenging in the biomedical and healthcare domains due to complex interdependent relations between entities, heterogeneity, lack of standardization, and sparseness of data. KGs are used to discover diagnoses or prioritize genes relevant to disease, but they often rely on schemas that are not centred around a node or entity of interest, such as a person. Entity-centric KGs are relatively unexplored but hold promise in representing important facets connected to a central node and unlocking downstream tasks beyond graph traversal and reasoning, such as generating graph embeddings and training graph neural networks for a wide range of predictive tasks. This paper presents an end-to-end representation learning framework to extract entity-centric KGs from structured and unstructured data. We introduce a star-shaped ontology to represent the multiple facets of a person and use it to guide KG creation. Compact representations of the graphs are created leveraging graph neural networks and experiments are conducted using different levels of heterogeneity or explicitness. A readmission prediction task is used to evaluate the results of the proposed framework, showing a stable system, robust to missing data, that outperforms a range of baseline machine learning classifiers. We highlight that this approach has several potential applications across domains and is open-sourced. Lastly, we discuss lessons learned, challenges, and next steps for the adoption of the framework in practice. ",

This phrase distills the foreboding of what has come to be known as the Fermi Paradox - the disquieting idea that, if extraterrestrial life is probable in the Universe, then why have we not encountered it? This conundrum has puzzled scholars for decades, and many hypotheses have been proposed suggesting both naturalistic and sociological explanations. One intriguing hypothesis is known as the Great Filter, which suggests that some event required for the emergence of intelligent life is extremely unlikely, hence the cosmic silence. A logically equivalent version of this hypothesis -- and one that should give us pause -- suggests that some catastrophic event is likely to occur that prevents life's expansion throughout the cosmos. This could be a naturally occurring event, or more disconcertingly, something that intelligent beings do to themselves that leads to their own extinction. From an intelligence perspective, framing global catastrophic risk (particularly risks of anthropogenic origin) within the context of the Great Filter can provide insight into the long-term futures of technologies that we don't fully understand, like artificial intelligence. For the intelligence professional concerned with global catastrophic risk, this has significant implications for how these risks ought to be prioritized. ",

    "abstract": "We present ImageBind, an approach to learn a joint embedding across six different modalities - images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data. We show that all combinations of paired data are not necessary to train such a joint embedding, and only image-paired data is sufficient to bind the modalities together. ImageBind can leverage recent large scale vision-language models, and extends their zero-shot capabilities to new modalities just by using their natural pairing with images. It enables novel emergent applications 'out-of-the-box' including cross-modal retrieval, composing modalities with arithmetic, cross-modal detection and generation. The emergent capabilities improve with the strength of the image encoder and we set a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot recognition tasks across modalities, outperforming specialist supervised models. Finally, we show strong few-shot recognition results outperforming prior work, and that ImageBind serves as a new way to evaluate vision models for visual and non-visual tasks. ",

    "abstract": "We report a flexible language-model based deep learning strategy, applied here to solve complex forward and inverse problems in protein modeling, based on an attention neural network that integrates transformer and graph convolutional architectures in a causal multi-headed graph mechanism, to realize a generative pretrained model. The model is applied to predict secondary structure content (per-residue level and overall content), protein solubility, and sequencing tasks. Further trained on inverse tasks, the model is rendered capable of designing proteins with these properties as target features. The model is formulated as a general framework, completely prompt-based, and can be adapted for a variety of downstream tasks. We find that adding additional tasks yields emergent synergies that the model exploits in improving overall performance, beyond what would be possible by training a model on each dataset alone. Case studies are presented to validate the method, yielding protein designs specifically focused on structural proteins, but also exploring the applicability in the design of soluble, antimicrobial biomaterials. While our model is trained to ultimately perform 8 distinct tasks, with available datasets it can be extended to solve additional problems. In a broader sense, this work illustrates a form of multiscale modeling that relates a set of ultimate building blocks (here, byte-level utf8 characters) to complex output. This materiomic scheme captures complex emergent relationships between universal building block and resulting properties via a synergizing learning capacity to express a set of potentialities embedded in the knowledge used in training, via the interplay of universality and diversity.

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of tomographic images from boundary measurements requires flexibility with respect to target domains. For instance, when the system equations are modeled by partial differential equations the reconstruction is usually done on finite element (FE) meshes, allowing for flexible geometries. Thus, any processing of the obtained reconstructions should be ideally done on the FE mesh as well. For this purpose, we extend the hugely successful U-Net architecture that is limited to rectangular pixel or voxel domains to an equivalent that works flexibly on FE meshes. To achieve this, the FE mesh is converted into a graph and we formulate a graph U-Net with a new cluster pooling and unpooling on the graph that mimics the classic neighborhood based max-pooling. We demonstrate effectiveness and flexibility of the graph U-Net for improving reconstructions from electrical impedance tomographic (EIT) measurements, a nonlinear and highly ill-posed inverse problem. The performance is evaluated for simulated data and from three measurement devices with different measurement geometries and instrumentations. We successfully show that such networks can be trained with a simple two-dimensional simulated training set and generalize to very different domains, including measurements from a three-dimensional device and subsequent 3D reconstructions.

Given any Markov chain corresponding to a target probability distribution, we design a self-repellent random walk (SRRW) which is less likely to transition to nodes that were highly visited in the past, and more likely to transition to seldom visited nodes. For a class of SRRWs parameterized by a positive real {\\alpha}, we prove that the empirical distribution of the process converges almost surely to the the target (stationary) distribution of the underlying Markov chain kernel. We then provide a central limit theorem and derive the exact form of the arising asymptotic co-variance matrix, which allows us to show that the SRRW with a stronger repellence (larger {\\alpha}) always achieves a smaller asymptotic covariance, in the sense of Loewner ordering of co-variance matrices. Especially for SRRW-driven MCMC algorithms, we show that the decrease in the asymptotic sampling variance is of the order O(1/{\\alpha}), eventually going down to zero. Finally, we provide numerical simulations complimentary to our theoretical results, also empirically testing a version of SRRW with {\\alpha} increasing in time to combine the benefits of smaller asymptotic variance due to large {\\alpha}, with empirically observed faster mixing properties of SRRW with smaller {\\alpha}.

Existing methods conduct macro-level or simplified micro-level vaccine distribution by assuming the homogeneous behavior within subgroup populations and lacking mobility dynamics integration. Directly applying these models for micro-level vaccine allocation leads to sub-optimal solutions due to the lack of behavioral-related details. To address the issue, we first incorporate the mobility heterogeneity in disease dynamics modeling and mimic the disease evolution process using a Trans-vaccine-SEIR model. Then we develop a novel deep reinforcement learning to seek the optimal vaccine allocation strategy for the high-degree spatial-temporal disease evolution system. The graph neural network is used to effectively capture the structural properties of the mobility contact network and extract the dynamic disease features. In our evaluation, the proposed framework reduces 7% - 10% of infections and deaths than the baseline strategies. Extensive evaluation shows that the proposed framework is robust to seek the optimal vaccine allocation with diverse mobility patterns in the micro-level disease evolution system. In particular, we find the optimal vaccine allocation strategy in the transit usage restriction scenario is significantly more effective than restricting cross-zone mobility for the top 10% age-based and income-based zones. These results provide valuable insights for areas with limited vaccines and low logistic efficacy. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate simulation of granular flow dynamics is crucial for assessing various geotechnical risks, including landslides and debris flows. Granular flows involve a dynamic rearrangement of particles exhibiting complex transitions from solid-like to fluid-like responses. Traditional continuum and discrete numerical methods are limited by their computational cost in simulating large-scale systems. Statistical or machine learning-based models offer an alternative. Still, they are largely empirical, based on a limited set of parameters. Due to their permutation-dependent learning, traditional machine learning-based models require huge training data to generalize. To resolve these problems, we use a graph neural network, a state-of-the-art machine learning architecture that learns local interactions. Graphs represent the state of dynamically changing granular flows and the interaction laws, such as energy and momentum exchange between grains. We develop a graph neural network-based simulator (GNS) that takes the current state of granular flow and predicts the next state using Euler explicit integration by learning the local interaction laws. We train GNS on different granular trajectories. We then assess the performance of GNS by predicting granular column collapse. GNS accurately predicts flow dynamics for column collapses with different aspect ratios unseen during training. GNS is hundreds of times faster than high-fidelity numerical simulators. The model also generalizes to domains much larger than the training data, handling more than twice the number of particles than it was trained on. ",

    "abstract": "Discovering causal relations from observational data is important. The existence of unobserved variables (e.g. latent confounding or mediation) can mislead the causal identification. To overcome this problem, proximal causal discovery methods attempted to adjust for the bias via the proxy of the unobserved variable. Particularly, hypothesis test-based methods proposed to identify the causal edge by testing the induced violation of linearity. However, these methods only apply to discrete data with strict level constraints, which limits their practice in the real world. In this paper, we fix this problem by extending the proximal hypothesis test to cases where the system consists of continuous variables. Our strategy is to present regularity conditions on the conditional distributions of the observed variables given the hidden factor, such that if we discretize its observed proxy with sufficiently fine, finite bins, the involved discretization error can be effectively controlled. Based on this, we can convert the problem of testing continuous causal relations to that of testing discrete causal relations in each bin, which can be effectively solved with existing methods. These non-parametric regularities we present are mild and can be satisfied by a wide range of structural causal models. Using both simulated and real-world data, we show the effectiveness of our method in recovering causal relations when unobserved variables exist. ",

Our method directly retrieves the density matrices of quantum states from measured statistics, with the assistance of an integrated loss function that helps minimize the difference between the actual states and the retrieved states. Then, we systematically trace different impacts within a bag of common training strategies involving various parameter adjustments on the attention-based QST method.

We say that $\\mathcal{P}$ is estimable if it has a distance estimator whose query complexity depends only on $\\varepsilon$. Every estimable property is also testable, since testing corresponds to estimating with $\\alpha=\\varepsilon$. A central result in the area of property testing, the Fischer--Newman theorem, gives an inverse statement: every testable property is in fact estimable. The proof of Fischer and Newman was highly ineffective, since it incurred a tower-type loss when transforming a testing algorithm for $\\mathcal{P}$ into a distance estimator. This raised the natural problem, studied recently by Fiat--Ron and by Hoppen--Kohayakawa--Lang--Lefmann--Stagni, whether one can find a transformation with a polynomial loss. We obtain the following results. 1. If $\\mathcal{P}$ is hereditary, then one can turn a tester for $\\mathcal{P}$ into a distance estimator with an exponential loss. This is an exponential improvement over the result of Hoppen et. al., who obtained a transformation with a double exponential loss. 2. For every $\\mathcal{P}$, one can turn a testing algorithm for $\\mathcal{P}$ into a distance estimator with a double exponential loss. This improves over the transformation of Fischer--Newman that incurred a tower-type loss. Our main conceptual contribution in this work is that we manage to turn the approach of Fischer--Newman, which was inherently ineffective, into an efficient one. On the technical level, our main contribution is in establishing certain properties of Frieze--Kannan Weak Regular partitions that are of independent interest. ",

    "abstract": "Target detection and recognition is a very challenging task in a wireless environment where a multitude of objects are located, whether to effectively determine their positions or to identify them and predict their moves. In this work, we propose a new method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the range and velocity of moving targets directly from the range-Doppler map of the detected signals. We compare the obtained results to the two dimensional (2D) periodogram, and to the similar state of the art methods, 2DResFreq and VGG-19 network and show that the estimation process performed with our model provides better estimation accuracy of range and velocity index in different signal to noise ratio (SNR) regimes along with a reduced prediction time. Afterwards, we assess the performance of our proposed algorithm using the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) which is a relevant metric to analyse the quality of an output image obtained from compression or noise reduction. Compared to the 2D-periodogram, 2DResFreq and VGG-19, we gain 33 dB, 21 dB and 10 dB, respectively, in terms of PSNR when SNR = 30 dB. ",

    "title": "A duality framework for generalization analysis of random feature models  and two-layer neural networks",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning functions in the $\\mathcal{F}_{p,\\pi}$ and Barron spaces, which are natural function spaces that arise in the high-dimensional analysis of random feature models (RFMs) and two-layer neural networks. Through a duality analysis, we reveal that the approximation and estimation of these spaces can be considered equivalent in a certain sense. This enables us to focus on the easier problem of approximation and estimation when studying the generalization of both models. The dual equivalence is established by defining an information-based complexity that can effectively control estimation errors. Additionally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our duality framework through comprehensive analyses of two concrete applications. The first application is to study learning functions in $\\mathcal{F}_{p,\\pi}$ with RFMs. We prove that the learning does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality as long as $p>1$, implying RFMs can work beyond the kernel regime. Our analysis extends existing results [CMM21] to the noisy case and removes the requirement of overparameterization. The second application is to investigate the learnability of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) under the $L^\\infty$ metric. We derive both lower and upper bounds of the minimax estimation error by using the spectrum of the associated kernel. We then apply these bounds to dot-product kernels and analyze how they scale with the input dimension. Our results suggest that learning with ReLU (random) features is generally intractable in terms of reaching high uniform accuracy. ",
