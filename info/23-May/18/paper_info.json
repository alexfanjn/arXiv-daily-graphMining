    "title": "Mean Estimation Under Heterogeneous Privacy: Some Privacy Can Be Free",
    "abstract": "Differential Privacy (DP) is a well-established framework to quantify privacy loss incurred by any algorithm. Traditional DP formulations impose a uniform privacy requirement for all users, which is often inconsistent with real-world scenarios in which users dictate their privacy preferences individually. This work considers the problem of mean estimation under heterogeneous DP constraints, where each user can impose their own distinct privacy level. The algorithm we propose is shown to be minimax optimal when there are two groups of users with distinct privacy levels. Our results elicit an interesting saturation phenomenon that occurs as one group's privacy level is relaxed, while the other group's privacy level remains constant. Namely, after a certain point, further relaxing the privacy requirement of the former group does not improve the performance of the minimax optimal mean estimator. Thus, the central server can offer a certain degree of privacy without any sacrifice in performance. ",

    "abstract": "Modern smart home control systems utilize real-time occupancy and activity monitoring to ensure control efficiency, occupants' comfort, and optimal energy consumption. Moreover, adopting machine learning-based anomaly detection models (ADMs) enhances security and reliability. However, sufficient system knowledge allows adversaries/attackers to alter sensor measurements through stealthy false data injection (FDI) attacks. Although ADMs limit attack scopes, the availability of information like occupants' location, conducted activities, and alteration capability of smart appliances increase the attack surface. Therefore, performing an attack space analysis of modern home control systems is crucial to design robust defense solutions. However, state-of-the-art analyzers do not consider contemporary control and defense solutions and generate trivial attack vectors. To address this, we propose a control and defense-aware novel attack analysis framework for a modern smart home control system, efficiently extracting ADM rules. We verify and validate our framework using a state-of-the-art dataset and a prototype testbed. ",

    "abstract": "Deep image classification models trained on large amounts of web-scraped data are vulnerable to data poisoning, a mechanism for backdooring models. Even a few poisoned samples seen during training can entirely undermine the model's integrity during inference. While it is known that poisoning more samples enhances an attack's effectiveness and robustness, it is unknown whether poisoning too many samples weakens an attack by making it more detectable. We observe a fundamental detectability/robustness trade-off in data poisoning attacks: Poisoning too few samples renders an attack ineffective and not robust, but poisoning too many samples makes it detectable. This raises the bar for data poisoning attackers who have to balance this trade-off to remain robust and undetectable. Our work proposes two defenses designed to (i) detect and (ii) repair poisoned models as a post-processing step after training using a limited amount of trusted image-label pairs. We show that our defenses mitigate all surveyed attacks and outperform existing defenses using less trusted data to repair a model. Our defense scales to joint vision-language models, such as CLIP, and interestingly, we find that attacks on larger models are more easily detectable but also more robust than those on smaller models. Lastly, we propose two adaptive attacks demonstrating that while our work raises the bar for data poisoning attacks, it cannot mitigate all forms of backdooring. ",

The number of attacks is increasing globally due to technological advancements.

However, these approaches have substantial false-positive and false-negative rates. On the other side, researchers have been interested in developing an AI-based vulnerability detection system employing deep learning models like BERT, BLSTM, etc. In this paper, we proposed a two-stage solution, two deep learning models were proposed for vulnerability detection in C/C++ source codes, the first stage is CNN which detects if the source code contains any vulnerability (binary classification model) and the second stage is CNN-LTSM that classifies this vulnerability into a class of 50 different types of vulnerabilities (multiclass classification model). Experiments were done on SySeVR dataset. Results show an accuracy of 99% for the first and 98% for the second stage. ",

As critical topological properties in the network, node degree and clustering coefficient are well-suited for describing the tightness of connection between nodes. The node importance can affect the possibility of link existence to a certain extent. By analyzing the impact of different centrality on links, which concluded that the degree centrality and proximity centrality have the greatest influence on link prediction. So, a link prediction algorithm combines node importance and attribute, called DCCLP, is proposed in this paper.

Then the prediction accuracy of the DCCLP algorithm is evaluated in the test set. By experimenting on twenty-one networks with different scales, and comparing with existing algorithms, the experimental results show that the effectiveness and feasibility of DCCLP algorithm, and further illustrate the importance of the degree centrality of node pairs and proximity centrality of nodes to improve the prediction accuracy of link prediction.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have gain its popularity in various scenarios in recent years. However, its excellent ability of fitting complex functions also makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Specifically, a backdoor can remain hidden indefinitely until activated by a sample with a specific trigger, which is hugely concealed. Nevertheless, existing backdoor attacks operate backdoors in spatial domain, i.e., the poisoned images are generated by adding additional perturbations to the original images, which are easy to detect. To bring the potential of backdoor attacks into full play, we propose low-pass attack, a novel attack scheme that utilizes low-pass filter to inject backdoor in frequency domain. Unlike traditional poisoned image generation methods, our approach reduces high-frequency components and preserve original images' semantic information instead of adding additional perturbations, improving the capability of evading current defenses. Besides, we introduce \"precision mode\" to make our backdoor triggered at a specified level of filtering, which further improves stealthiness. We evaluate our low-pass attack on four datasets and demonstrate that even under pollution rate of 0.01, we can perform stealthy attack without trading off attack performance. Besides, our backdoor attack can successfully bypass state-of-the-art defending mechanisms. We also compare our attack with existing backdoor attacks and show that our poisoned images are nearly invisible and retain higher image quality. ",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) have been targeted by cyberattacks and are becoming increasingly vulnerable as more ICSs are connected to the internet. Using Machine Learning (ML) for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is a promising approach for ICS cyber protection, but the lack of suitable datasets for evaluating ML algorithms is a challenge. Although there are a few commonly used datasets, they may not reflect realistic ICS network data, lack necessary features for effective anomaly detection, or be outdated. This paper presents the 'ICS-Flow' dataset, which offers network data and process state variables logs for supervised and unsupervised ML-based IDS assessment. The network data includes normal and anomalous network packets and flows captured from simulated ICS components and emulated networks. The anomalies were injected into the system through various attack techniques commonly used by hackers to modify network traffic and compromise ICSs. We also proposed open-source tools, `ICSFlowGenerator' for generating network flow parameters from Raw network packets. The final dataset comprises over 25,000,000 raw network packets, network flow records, and process variable logs. The paper describes the methodology used to collect and label the dataset and provides a detailed data analysis. Finally, we implement several ML models, including the decision tree, random forest, and artificial neural network to detect anomalies and attacks, demonstrating that our dataset can be used effectively for training intrusion detection ML models.

    "abstract": "In the forthcoming era of 6G, the mmWave communication is envisioned to be used in dense user scenarios with high bandwidth requirements, that necessitate efficient and accurate beam prediction. Machine learning (ML) based approaches are ushering as a critical solution for achieving such efficient beam prediction for 6G mmWave communications. However, most contemporary ML classifiers are quite susceptible to adversarial inputs. Attackers can easily perturb the methodology through noise addition in the model itself. To mitigate this, the current work presents a defensive mechanism for attenuating the adversarial attacks against projected ML-based models for mmWave beam anticipation by incorporating adversarial training. Furthermore, as training 6G mmWave beam prediction model necessitates the use of large and comprehensive datasets that could include sensitive information regarding the user's location, differential privacy (DP) has been introduced as a technique to preserve the confidentiality of the information by purposefully adding a low sensitivity controlled noise in the datasets. It ensures that even if the information about a user location could be retrieved, the attacker would have no means to determine whether the information is significant or meaningless. With ray-tracing simulations for various outdoor and indoor scenarios, we illustrate the advantage of our proposed novel framework in terms of beam prediction accuracy and effective achievable rate while ensuring the security and privacy in communications.

This paper theoretically and experimentally shows that the PAdf protocol solves the over- and under-estimation problems of existing protocols such as PA and PA\\%K. By conducting re-evaluations of SOTA models in benchmark datasets, we show that the PA protocol only focuses on finding many anomalous segments, whereas the score of the PAdf protocol considers not only finding many segments but also detecting anomalies quickly without delay.

Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that TapTap outperforms a total of 16 baselines in different scenarios. Meanwhile, it can be easily combined with various backbone models, including LightGBM, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Transformer. Moreover, with the aid of table pre-training, models trained using synthetic data generated by TapTap can even compete with models using the original dataset on half of the experimental datasets, marking a milestone in the development of synthetic tabular data generation.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs), especially dynamic GNNs, have become a research hotspot in spatio-temporal forecasting problems. While many dynamic graph construction methods have been developed, relatively few of them explore the causal relationship between neighbour nodes. Thus, the resulting models lack strong explainability for the causal relationship between the neighbour nodes of the dynamically generated graphs, which can easily lead to a risk in subsequent decisions. Moreover, few of them consider the uncertainty and noise of dynamic graphs based on the time series datasets, which are ubiquitous in real-world graph structure networks. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Diffusion-Variational Graph Neural Network (DVGNN) for spatio-temporal forecasting. For dynamic graph construction, an unsupervised generative model is devised. Two layers of graph convolutional network (GCN) are applied to calculate the posterior distribution of the latent node embeddings in the encoder stage. Then, a diffusion model is used to infer the dynamic link probability and reconstruct causal graphs in the decoder stage adaptively. The new loss function is derived theoretically, and the reparameterization trick is adopted in estimating the probability distribution of the dynamic graphs by Evidence Lower Bound during the backpropagation period. After obtaining the generated graphs, dynamic GCN and temporal attention are applied to predict future states. Experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets of different graph structures in different domains. The results demonstrate that the proposed DVGNN model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves outstanding Root Mean Squared Error result while exhibiting higher robustness. Also, by F1-score and probability distribution analysis, we demonstrate that DVGNN better reflects the causal relationship and uncertainty of dynamic graphs. ",

However, existing FGL methods mainly focus on homogeneous GNNs or knowledge graph embeddings; few have considered heterogeneous graphs and HGNNs. In federated heterogeneous graph learning, clients may have private graph schemas. Conventional FL/FGL methods attempting to define a global HGNN model would violate schema privacy. To address these challenges, we propose FedHGN, a novel and general FGL framework for HGNNs. FedHGN adopts schema-weight decoupling to enable schema-agnostic knowledge sharing and employs coefficients alignment to stabilize the training process and improve HGNN performance. With better privacy preservation, FedHGN consistently outperforms local training and conventional FL methods on three widely adopted heterogeneous graph datasets with varying client numbers.

MEMs are an important class of seeds, often used in seed-chain-extend type of practical alignment methods because of their strong connections to classical metrics. A principled way to speed up chaining is to limit the number of MEMs by considering only MEMs of length at least $\\kappa$ ($\\kappa$-MEMs). However, on arbitrary input graphs, the problem of finding MEMs cannot be solved in truly sub-quadratic time under SETH (Equi et al., ICALP 2019) even on acyclic graphs. In this paper we show an $O(n\\cdot L \\cdot d^{L-1} + m + M_{\\kappa,L})$-time algorithm finding all $\\kappa$-MEMs between $Q$ and $G$ spanning exactly $L$ nodes in $G$, where $n$ is the total length of node labels, $d$ is the maximum degree of a node in $G$, $m = |Q|$, and $M_{\\kappa,L}$ is the number of output MEMs. We use this algorithm to develop a $\\kappa$-MEM finding solution on indexable Elastic Founder Graphs (Equi et al., Algorithmica 2022) running in time $O(nH^2 + m + M_\\kappa)$, where $H$ is the maximum number of nodes in a block, and $M_\\kappa$ is the total number of $\\kappa$-MEMs. Our results generalize to the analysis of multiple query strings (MEMs between $G$ and any of the strings). Additionally, we provide some preliminary experimental results showing that the number of graph MEMs is orders of magnitude smaller than the number of string MEMs of the corresponding concatenated collection.

Recently, hypergraph-based methods have been proposed for document classifications. Directly adopting existing hypergraph methods on clinical notes cannot sufficiently utilize the hierarchy information of the patient, which can degrade clinical semantic information by (1) frequent neutral words and (2) hierarchies with imbalanced distribution. Thus, we propose a taxonomy-aware multi-level hypergraph neural network (TM-HGNN), where multi-level hypergraphs assemble useful neutral words with rare keywords via note and taxonomy level hyperedges to retain the clinical semantic information. The constructed patient hypergraphs are fed into hierarchical message passing layers for learning more balanced multi-level knowledge at the note and taxonomy levels. We validate the effectiveness of TM-HGNN by conducting extensive experiments with MIMIC-III dataset on benchmark in-hospital-mortality prediction. ",

    "abstract": "Differential dynamic programming (DDP) is a popular technique for solving nonlinear optimal control problems with locally quadratic approximations. However, existing DDP methods are not designed for stochastic systems with unknown disturbance distributions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel DDP method that approximately solves the Wasserstein distributionally robust control (WDRC) problem, where the true disturbance distribution is unknown but a disturbance sample dataset is given. Our approach aims to develop a practical and computationally efficient DDP solution. To achieve this, we use the Kantrovich duality principle to decompose the value function in a novel way and derive closed-form expressions of the distributionally robust control and worst-case distribution policies to be used in each iteration of our DDP algorithm. This characterization makes our method tractable and scalable without the need for numerically solving any minimax optimization problems. The superior out-of-sample performance and scalability of our algorithm are demonstrated through kinematic car navigation and coupled oscillator problems. ",

    "abstract": "This work was presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2023 Workshop on Unconventional Spatial Representations. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are a class of implicit scene representations that model 3D environments from color images. NeRFs are expressive, and can model the complex and multi-scale geometry of real world environments, which potentially makes them a powerful tool for robotics applications. Modern NeRF training libraries can generate a photo-realistic NeRF from a static data set in just a few seconds, but are designed for offline use and require a slow pose optimization pre-computation step. In this work we propose NerfBridge, an open-source bridge between the Robot Operating System (ROS) and the popular Nerfstudio library for real-time, online training of NeRFs from a stream of images. NerfBridge enables rapid development of research on applications of NeRFs in robotics by providing an extensible interface to the efficient training pipelines and model libraries provided by Nerfstudio. As an example use case we outline a hardware setup that can be used NerfBridge to train a NeRF from images captured by a camera mounted to a quadrotor in both indoor and outdoor environments.

    "abstract": "While various AI explanation (XAI) methods have been proposed to interpret AI systems, whether the state-of-the-art XAI methods are practically useful for humans remains inconsistent findings. To improve the usefulness of XAI methods, a line of studies identifies the gaps between the diverse and dynamic real-world user needs with the status quo of XAI methods. Although prior studies envision mitigating these gaps by integrating multiple XAI methods into the universal XAI interfaces (e.g., conversational or GUI-based XAI systems), there is a lack of work investigating how these systems should be designed to meet practical user needs. In this study, we present ConvXAI, a conversational XAI system that incorporates multiple XAI types, and empowers users to request a variety of XAI questions via a universal XAI dialogue interface. Particularly, we innovatively embed practical user needs (i.e., four principles grounding on the formative study) into ConvXAI design to improve practical usefulness. Further, we design the domain-specific language (DSL) to implement the essential conversational XAI modules and release the core conversational universal XAI API for generalization. The findings from two within-subjects studies with 21 users show that ConvXAI is more useful for humans in perceiving the understanding and writing improvement, and improving the writing process in terms of productivity and sentence quality. Finally, this work contributes insight into the design space of useful XAI, reveals humans' XAI usage patterns with empirical evidence in practice, and identifies opportunities for future useful XAI work.

The attention mechanism learns to connect features in source code to specific words to use when generating natural language descriptions.

In this paper, we use data from published eye-tracking experiments to create a model of this human attention. The model predicts which words in source code are the most important for code summarization. Next, we augment a baseline neural code summarization approach using our model of human attention.

Various notions of simplicity have been introduced to characterize this behavior. Here, we focus on the case of neural networks with discrete (zero-one) inputs through the lens of their Fourier (Walsh-Hadamard) transforms, where the notion of simplicity can be captured through the \\emph{degree} of the Fourier coefficients. We empirically show that neural networks have a tendency to learn lower-degree frequencies. We show how this spectral bias towards simpler features can in fact \\emph{hurt} the neural network's generalization on real-world datasets. To remedy this we propose a new scalable functional regularization scheme that aids the neural network to learn higher degree frequencies. Our regularizer also helps avoid erroneous identification of low-degree frequencies, which further improves generalization. We extensively evaluate our regularizer on synthetic datasets to gain insights into its behavior. Finally, we show significantly improved generalization on four different datasets compared to standard neural networks and other relevant baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, software analytics tools using machine learning (ML) models to, for example, predict the risk of a code change are well established. However, as the goals of a project shift over time, and developers and their habits change, the performance of said models tends to degrade (drift) over time, until a model is retrained using new data. Current retraining practices typically are an afterthought (and hence costly), requiring a new model to be retrained from scratch on a large, updated data set at random points in time; also, there is no continuity between the old and new model. In this paper, we propose to use lifelong learning (LL) to continuously build and maintain ML-based software analytics tools using an incremental learner that progressively updates the old model using new data. To avoid so-called ''catastrophic forgetting'' of important older data points, we adopt a replay buffer of older data, which still allows us to drastically reduce the size of the overall training data set, and hence model training time. We empirically evaluate our LL approach on two industrial use cases, i.e., a brown build detector and a Just-in-Time risk prediction tool, showing how LL in practice manages to at least match traditional retraining-from-scratch performance in terms of F1-score, while using 3.3-13.7x less data at each update, thus considerably speeding up the model updating process. Considering both the computational effort of updates and the time between model updates, the LL setup needs 2-40x less computational effort than retraining-from-scratch setups. ",

The proposed DNNs in case of classification are trained in parallel for each class. This approach is sequential, i.e., new classes can be added without having to retrain the network. In case of PDEs, a DNN is designed corresponding to each EIM point. Again, these networks can be trained in parallel, for each EIM point. In all cases, the parallel networks require fewer than ten times the number of training weights. Significant gains are observed in terms of training times, without sacrificing accuracy. ",

CPL-NoViD outperforms the baseline by incorporating context through natural language prompts and demonstrates improved performance across different rule types. Significantly, it not only excels in cross-rule-type and cross-community norm violation detection but also exhibits adaptability in few-shot learning scenarios. Most notably, it establishes a new state-of-the-art in norm violation detection, surpassing existing benchmarks. Our work highlights the potential of prompt-based learning for context-sensitive norm violation detection and paves the way for future research on more adaptable, context-aware models to better support online community moderators.

Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves accuracy that matches other state-of-the-art SNN quantization works while outperforming them on total memory footprint and hardware cost at deployment time. For instance, 2-bit MINT VGG-16 achieves 48.6% accuracy on TinyImageNet (0.28% better than the full-precision baseline) with approximately 93.8% reduction in total memory footprint from the full-precision model; meanwhile, our model reduces area by 93% and dynamic power by 98% compared to other SNN quantization counterparts.

In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of LLMs for relation labeling in e-commerce KGs, investigating their powerful learning capabilities in natural language and effectiveness in predicting relations between product types with limited labeled data. We evaluate various LLMs, including PaLM and GPT-3.5, on benchmark datasets, demonstrating their ability to achieve competitive performance compared to humans on relation labeling tasks using just 1 to 5 labeled examples per relation. Additionally, we experiment with different prompt engineering techniques to examine their impact on model performance.

    "abstract": "Distributed training of GNNs enables learning on massive graphs (e.g., social and e-commerce networks) that exceed the storage and computational capacity of a single machine. To reach performance comparable to centralized training, distributed frameworks focus on maximally recovering cross-instance node dependencies with either communication across instances or periodic fallback to centralized training, which create overhead and limit the framework scalability. In this work, we present a simplified framework for distributed GNN training that does not rely on the aforementioned costly operations, and has improved scalability, convergence speed and performance over the state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, our framework (1) assembles independent trainers, each of which asynchronously learns a local model on locally-available parts of the training graph, and (2) only conducts periodic (time-based) model aggregation to synchronize the local models. Backed by our theoretical analysis, instead of maximizing the recovery of cross-instance node dependencies -- which has been considered the key behind closing the performance gap between model aggregation and centralized training -- , our framework leverages randomized assignment of nodes or super-nodes (i.e., collections of original nodes) to partition the training graph such that it improves data uniformity and minimizes the discrepancy of gradient and loss function across instances. In our experiments on social and e-commerce networks with up to 1.3 billion edges, our proposed RandomTMA and SuperTMA approaches -- despite using less training data -- achieve state-of-the-art performance and 2.31x speedup compared to the fastest baseline, and show better robustness to trainer failures.

Previous literature showed that the illegality of abortion could have serious consequences, as women might seek unsafe pregnancy terminations leading to increased maternal mortality rates and negative effects on their reproductive health. Therefore, the stances of the abortion-related Facebook posts were analyzed at the state level in the United States from May 4 until June 30, 2022, right after the Supreme Court's decision was disclosed. In more detail, the pre-trained Transformer architecture-based model was fine-tuned on a manually labeled training set to obtain a stance detection model suitable for the collected dataset. Afterward, we employed appropriate statistical tests to examine the relationships between public opinion regarding abortion, abortion legality, political leaning, and factors measuring the overall population's health, health knowledge, and vulnerability per state. We found that states with a higher number of views against abortion also have higher infant and maternal mortality rates. Furthermore, the stance of social media posts per state is mostly matching with the current abortion laws in these states. While aligned with existing literature, these findings indicate how public opinion, laws, and women's and infants' health are related, and interventions are required to educate and protect women, especially in vulnerable populations.

However, these methods rely on large-scale noisy-clean image pairs, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Denoising methods with self-supervised training that can be trained with only noisy images have been proposed to address the limitation. These methods are based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and have shown promising performance. However, CNN-based methods do not consider using nonlocal self-similarities essential in the traditional method, which can cause performance limitations. This paper presents self-similarity attention (SS-Attention), a novel self-attention module that can capture nonlocal self-similarities to solve the problem. We focus on designing a lightweight self-attention module in a pixel-wise manner, which is nearly impossible to implement using the classic self-attention module due to the quadratically increasing complexity with spatial resolution. Furthermore, we integrate SS-Attention into the blind-spot network called self-similarity-based blind-spot network (SS-BSN). We conduct the experiments on real-world image denoising tasks. The proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods in self-supervised denoising on the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD) and Darmstadt Noise Dataset (DND) benchmark datasets.

We develop a novel analysis framework that establishes their convergence guarantees without assuming the stringent bounded gradient assumption. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first convergence analysis for decentralized nonconvex optimization with gradient clipping and communication compression, highlighting the trade-offs between convergence rate, compression ratio, network connectivity, and privacy.

    "abstract": "The Noisy-SGD algorithm is widely used for privately training machine learning models. Traditional privacy analyses of this algorithm assume that the internal state is publicly revealed, resulting in privacy loss bounds that increase indefinitely with the number of iterations. However, recent findings have shown that if the internal state remains hidden, then the privacy loss might remain bounded. Nevertheless, this remarkable result heavily relies on the assumption of (strong) convexity of the loss function. It remains an important open problem to further relax this condition while proving similar convergent upper bounds on the privacy loss. In this work, we address this problem for DP-SGD, a popular variant of Noisy-SGD that incorporates gradient clipping to limit the impact of individual samples on the training process. Our findings demonstrate that the privacy loss of projected DP-SGD converges exponentially fast, without requiring convexity or smoothness assumptions on the loss function. In addition, we analyze the privacy loss of regularized (unprojected) DP-SGD. To obtain these results, we directly analyze the hockey-stick divergence between coupled stochastic processes by relying on non-linear data processing inequalities. ",

    "abstract": "Recent research in neural networks and machine learning suggests that using many more parameters than strictly required by the initial complexity of a regression problem can result in more accurate or faster-converging models -- contrary to classical statistical belief. This phenomenon, sometimes known as ``benign overfitting'', raises questions regarding in what other ways might overparameterization affect the properties of a learning problem. In this work, we investigate the effects of overfitting on the robustness of gradient-descent training when subject to uncertainty on the gradient estimation. This uncertainty arises naturally if the gradient is estimated from noisy data or directly measured. Our object of study is a linear neural network with a single, arbitrarily wide, hidden layer and an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs. In this paper we solve the problem for the case where the input and output of our neural-network are one-dimensional, deriving sufficient conditions for robustness of our system based on necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence in the undisturbed case. We then show that the general overparametrized formulation introduces a set of spurious equilibria which lay outside the set where the loss function is minimized, and discuss directions of future work that might extend our current results for more general formulations.

In VLPC networks, positioning and communications are inherently coupled, which has not been sufficiently explored in the literature. We propose a robust power allocation scheme for integrated VLPC Networks by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between positioning and communications. Specifically, we derive explicit relationships between random positioning errors, following both a Gaussian distribution and an arbitrary distribution, and channel state information errors. Then, we minimize the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of positioning errors, subject to the rate outage constraint and the power constraints, which is a chance-constrained optimization problem and generally computationally intractable. To circumvent the nonconvex challenge, we conservatively transform the chance constraints to deterministic forms by using the Bernstein-type inequality and the conditional value-at-risk for the Gaussian and arbitrary distributed positioning errors, respectively, and then approximate them as convex semidefinite programs. Finally, simulation results verify the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed integrated VLPC design schemes. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, Transformers have emerged as the go-to architecture for both vision and language modeling tasks, but their computational efficiency is limited by the length of the input sequence. To address this, several efficient variants of Transformers have been proposed to accelerate computation or reduce memory consumption while preserving performance. This paper presents an efficient vision Transformer, called CageViT, that is guided by convolutional activation to reduce computation. Our CageViT, unlike current Transformers, utilizes a new encoder to handle the rearranged tokens, bringing several technical contributions: 1) Convolutional activation is used to pre-process the token after patchifying the image to select and rearrange the major tokens and minor tokens, which substantially reduces the computation cost through an additional fusion layer. 2) Instead of using the class activation map of the convolutional model directly, we design a new weighted class activation to lower the model requirements. 3) To facilitate communication between major tokens and fusion tokens, Gated Linear SRA is proposed to further integrate fusion tokens into the attention mechanism. We perform a comprehensive validation of CageViT on the image classification challenge. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CageViT outperforms the most recent state-of-the-art backbones by a large margin in terms of efficiency, while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy (e.g. a moderate-sized 43.35M model trained solely on 224 x 224 ImageNet-1K can achieve Top-1 accuracy of 83.4% accuracy).

Despite the success of recent developments, the existing works mainly focus on debiasing the machine learning models via graph augmentation or objective reweighting. However, there is limited literature that provides a theoretical tool to characterize the behaviors of long-tail categories on graphs and understand the generalization performance in real scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose the first generalization bound for long-tail classification on graphs by formulating the problem in the fashion of multi-task learning, i.e., each task corresponds to the prediction of one particular category. Our theoretical results show that the generalization performance of long-tail classification is dominated by the range of losses across all tasks and the total number of tasks. Building upon the theoretical findings, we propose a novel generic framework Tail2Learn to improve the performance of long-tail categories on graphs. In particular, we start with a hierarchical task grouping module that allows label-limited classes to benefit from the relevant information shared by other classes; then, we further design a balanced contrastive learning module to balance the gradient contributions of head and tail classes. Finally, extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Tail2Learn in capturing long-tail categories on graphs. ",

This phenomenon refers to the input weights of hidden neurons condensing into isolated orientations during training, revealing an implicit bias towards simple solutions in the parameter space. However, the impact of neural network structure on condensation has not been investigated yet. In this study, we focus on the investigation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our experiments suggest that when subjected to small initialization and gradient-based training methods, kernel weights within the same CNN layer also cluster together during training, demonstrating a significant degree of condensation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that in a finite training period, kernels of a two-layer CNN with small initialization will converge to one or a few directions. This work represents a step towards a better understanding of the non-linear training behavior exhibited by neural networks with specialized structures. ",

However, to our knowledge, no open benchmark or existing work evaluates the systematic generalization in HOI detection. To address this issue, we created two new sets of HOI detection data splits named HICO-DET-SG and V-COCO-SG based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets. We evaluated representative HOI detection models on the new data splits and observed large degradation in the test performances compared to those on the original datasets. This result shows that systematic generalization is a challenging goal in HOI detection. We hope our new data splits encourage more research toward this goal. ",

Existing attempts in incoorporating global aggregation for heterophilous GNNs usually require iteratively maintaining and updating full-graph information, which entails $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ computation efficiency for a graph with $n$ nodes, leading to weak scalability to large graphs. In this paper, we propose SIMGA, a GNN structure integrating SimRank structural similarity measurement as global aggregation. The design of SIMGA is simple, yet it leads to promising results in both efficiency and effectiveness. The simplicity of SIMGA makes it the first heterophilous GNN model that can achieve a propagation efficiency near-linear to $n$. We theoretically demonstrate its effectiveness by treating SimRank as a new interpretation of GNN and prove that the aggregated node representation matrix has expected grouping effect. The performances of SIMGA are evaluated with 11 baselines on 12 benchmark datasets, usually achieving superior accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art models.

This task is typically studied on static or temporal networks where the complete topology of the graph is known. In practice, however, the seed nodes must be selected before observing the future evolution of the network. In this work, we consider this realistic ex ante setting where $p$ time steps of the network have been observed before selecting the seed nodes. Then the influence is calculated after the network continues to evolve for a total of $T>p$ time steps. We address this problem by using statistical, non-negative matrix factorization and graph neural networks link prediction algorithms to predict the future evolution of the network and then apply existing influence maximization algorithms on the predicted networks. Additionally, the output of the link prediction methods can be used to construct novel IM algorithms. We apply the proposed methods to many real-world networks to compare their performance. In many settings, choosing seed nodes based only historical edges provides results comparable to the results treating the future graph snapshots as known. The proposed heuristics based on the link prediction model are also some of the best-performing methods. These findings indicate that, for these data sets and this diffusion mechanism, the latent process which determines the most influential nodes may not have large temporal variation.

We then perform transfer learning with these learned parameters on a data set more representative of real world environments (i.e., higher frequency of occlusion, small spatial sizes, rotations, etc.) to generate our refined model. Object detection of flying objects remains challenging due to large variance object spatial sizes/aspect ratios, rate of speed, occlusion, and clustered backgrounds. To address some of the presented challenges while simultaneously maximizing performance, we utilize the current state of the art single-shot detector, YOLOv8, in an attempt to find the best tradeoff between inference speed and mAP. While YOLOv8 is being regarded as the new state-of-the-art, an official paper has not been provided. Thus, we provide an in-depth explanation of the new architecture and functionality that YOLOv8 has adapted.

To address these two limitations is non-trivial due to the following challenges: 1) how to effectively model the multi-faceted matching factors in a latent way without direct supervision signals; 2) how to fully utilize the potential unlabeled reference-target image pairs to improve the generalization ability of the CIR model.

As such, the proposed method offers a reidentification-based MOT approach that is robust to training hyperparameters and does not suffer from local minima, which are a challenge in self-supervised methods.

Their common characteristic of seeking complementary cues from different source images motivates us to explore the collaborative relationship between Fusion and Salient object detection tasks on infrared and visible images via an Interactively Reinforced multi-task paradigm for the first time, termed IRFS. To the seamless bridge of multimodal image fusion and SOD tasks, we specifically develop a Feature Screening-based Fusion subnetwork (FSFNet) to screen out interfering features from source images, thereby preserving saliency-related features. After generating the fused image through FSFNet, it is then fed into the subsequent Fusion-Guided Cross-Complementary SOD subnetwork (FC$^2$Net) as the third modality to drive the precise prediction of the saliency map by leveraging the complementary information derived from the fused image. In addition, we develop an interactive loop learning strategy to achieve the mutual reinforcement of IVIF and SOD tasks with a shorter training period and fewer network parameters.

    "abstract": "Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) uses a two-dimensional detector to capture consecutive video frames during a single exposure time. Following this, an efficient reconstruction algorithm needs to be designed to reconstruct the desired video frames. Although recent deep learning-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction algorithms have achieved good results in most tasks, they still face the following challenges due to excessive model complexity and GPU memory limitations: 1) these models need high computational cost, and 2) they are usually unable to reconstruct large-scale video frames at high compression ratios. To address these issues, we develop an {\\bf{\\em efficient network}} for video SCI by using {\\bf {\\em dense connections and space-time factorization mechanism}} within a single residual block, dubbed {\\bf \\emph{EfficientSCI}}. The EfficientSCI network can well establish spatial-temporal correlation by using {\\bf {\\em convolution in the spatial domain and Transformer in the temporal domain}}, respectively. We are the first time to show that an UHD color video with high compression ratio can be reconstructed from a snapshot 2D measurement using a single end-to-end deep learning model with PSNR above 32 dB. Extensive results on both simulation and real data show that our method significantly outperforms all previous SOTA algorithms with better real-time performance.

RPL organizes its network in the form of a tree-like structure where a node is configured as the root of the tree while others integrate themselves into that structure based on their relative distance. A value called the Rank is used to define each node's relative position and it is used by other nodes to take their routing decisions. A malicious node can illegitimately claim a closer position to the root by advertising a lower rank value trapping other nodes to forward their traffic through that malicious node. In this study, we show how this behavior can have a detrimental side effect on the network via extensive simulations and propose a new secure objective function to prevent such an attack. ",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in both text understanding and generation. Companies have begun to offer Embedding as a Service (EaaS) based on these LLMs, which can benefit various natural language processing (NLP) tasks for customers. However, previous studies have shown that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, which can cause significant losses for the owners of LLMs, as training these models is extremely expensive. To protect the copyright of LLMs for EaaS, we propose an Embedding Watermark method called EmbMarker that implants backdoors on embeddings. Our method selects a group of moderate-frequency words from a general text corpus to form a trigger set, then selects a target embedding as the watermark, and inserts it into the embeddings of texts containing trigger words as the backdoor. The weight of insertion is proportional to the number of trigger words included in the text. This allows the watermark backdoor to be effectively transferred to EaaS-stealer's model for copyright verification while minimizing the adverse impact on the original embeddings' utility. Our extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method can effectively protect the copyright of EaaS models without compromising service quality. ",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for a variety of tasks with implicit graphical structures, such as planning in robotics, multi-hop question answering or knowledge probing, structured commonsense reasoning, and more. While LLMs have advanced the state-of-the-art on these tasks with structure implications, whether LLMs could explicitly process textual descriptions of graphs and structures, map them to grounded conceptual spaces, and perform structured operations remains underexplored. To this end, we propose NLGraph (Natural Language Graph), a comprehensive benchmark of graph-based problem solving designed in natural language. NLGraph contains 29,370 problems, covering eight graph reasoning tasks with varying complexity from simple tasks such as connectivity and shortest path up to complex problems such as maximum flow and simulating graph neural networks. We evaluate LLMs (GPT-3/4) with various prompting approaches on the NLGraph benchmark and find that 1) language models do demonstrate preliminary graph reasoning abilities, 2) the benefit of advanced prompting and in-context learning diminishes on more complex graph problems, while 3) LLMs are also (un)surprisingly brittle in the face of spurious correlations in graph and problem settings. We then propose Build-a-Graph Prompting and Algorithmic Prompting, two instruction-based approaches to enhance LLMs in solving natural language graph problems. Build-a-Graph and Algorithmic prompting improve the performance of LLMs on NLGraph by 3.07% to 16.85% across multiple tasks and settings, while how to solve the most complicated graph reasoning tasks in our setup with language models remains an open research question.

In principle, machine learning and deep learning models are flexible and expressive enough to capture the dynamics of clinical risk assessment. However, in this setting we are limited to observational data with quality issues, missing values, small sample size and high dimensionality: we cannot reliably learn such models from limited observational data with these sources of bias. Instead, we choose to learn a causal Bayesian network to mitigate the issues above and to leverage the prior knowledge on endometrial cancer available from clinicians and physicians. We introduce a causal discovery algorithm for causal Bayesian networks based on bootstrap resampling, as opposed to the single imputation used in related works. Moreover, we include a context variable to evaluate whether selection bias results in learning spurious associations. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of our findings in light of the presence of missing data that may be missing-not-at-random, which is common in real-world clinical settings. ",

When deep learning based methods has started to be applied to address this problem, the space between teeth are various and some of them might present similar texture characteristic with the actual implant region. Both problems make a big challenge for the implant position prediction. In this paper, we develop a two-stream implant position regression framework (TSIPR), which consists of an implant region detector (IRD) and a multi-scale patch embedding regression network (MSPENet), to address this issue. For the training of IRD, we extend the original annotation to provide additional supervisory information, which contains much more rich characteristic and do not introduce extra labeling costs. A multi-scale patch embedding module is designed for the MSPENet to adaptively extract features from the images with various tooth spacing. The global-local feature interaction block is designed to build the encoder of MSPENet, which combines the transformer and convolution for enriched feature representation. During inference, the RoI mask extracted from the IRD is used to refine the prediction results of the MSPENet. Extensive experiments on a dental implant dataset through five-fold cross-validation demonstrated that the proposed TSIPR achieves superior performance than existing methods. ",

    "abstract": "Predictive Maintenance (PdM) methods aim to facilitate the scheduling of maintenance work before equipment failure. In this context, detecting early faults in automated teller machines (ATMs) has become increasingly important since these machines are susceptible to various types of unpredictable failures. ATMs track execution status by generating massive event-log data that collect system messages unrelated to the failure event. Predicting machine failure based on event logs poses additional challenges, mainly in extracting features that might represent sequences of events indicating impending failures. Accordingly, feature learning approaches are currently being used in PdM, where informative features are learned automatically from minimally processed sensor data. However, a gap remains to be seen on how these approaches can be exploited for deriving relevant features from event-log-based data. To fill this gap, we present a predictive model based on a convolutional kernel (MiniROCKET and HYDRA) to extract features from the original event-log data and a linear classifier to classify the sample based on the learned features. The proposed methodology is applied to a significant real-world collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrated how one of the proposed convolutional kernels (i.e. HYDRA) exhibited the best classification performance (accuracy of 0.759 and AUC of 0.693). In addition, statistical analysis revealed that the HYDRA and MiniROCKET models significantly overcome one of the established state-of-the-art approaches in time series classification (InceptionTime), and three non-temporal ML methods from the literature. The predictive model was integrated into a container-based decision support system to support operators in the timely maintenance of ATMs. ",

The self-supervised architectures emerged as a promising solution that reduces the size of the needed labeled data, but the explainability problem remains. In this paper, we propose a methodology for explaining deep clustering, self-supervised learning architectures comprised of a representation learning part based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a clustering part. For the state of the art representation learning part, our methodology employs Guided Backpropagation to interpret the regions of interest of the input data. For the clustering part, the methodology relies on Shallow Trees to explain the clustering result using optimized depth decision tree. Finally, a data-specific visualizations part enables connection for each of the clusters to the input data trough the relevant features. We explain on a use case of wireless spectrum activity clustering how the CNN-based, deep clustering architecture reasons. ",

    "abstract": "Oriented object detection has been developed rapidly in the past few years, where rotation equivariant is crucial for detectors to predict rotated bounding boxes. It is expected that the prediction can maintain the corresponding rotation when objects rotate, but severe mutational in angular prediction is sometimes observed when objects rotate near the boundary angle, which is well-known boundary discontinuity problem. The problem has been long believed to be caused by the sharp loss increase at the angular boundary during training, and widely used IoU-like loss generally deal with this problem by loss-smoothing. However, we experimentally find that even state-of-the-art IoU-like methods do not actually solve the problem. On further analysis, we find the essential cause of the problem lies at discontinuous angular ground-truth(box), not just discontinuous loss. There always exists an irreparable gap between continuous model ouput and discontinuous angular ground-truth, so angular prediction near the breakpoints becomes highly unstable, which cannot be eliminated just by loss-smoothing in IoU-like methods. To thoroughly solve this problem, we propose a simple and effective Angle Correct Module (ACM) based on polar coordinate decomposition. ACM can be easily plugged into the workflow of oriented object detectors to repair angular prediction. It converts the smooth value of the model output into sawtooth angular value, and then IoU-like loss can fully release their potential. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that whether Gaussian-based or SkewIoU methods are improved to the same performance of AP50 and AP75 with the enhancement of ACM. ",

Current methods with T1-MRI rely on predefined regions or isolated pretrained location modules to obtain atrophic regions, which neglects individual specificity. Besides, existing methods capture global structural context only on the whole-image-level, which weaken correlation between regions and the hierarchical distribution nature of brain connectivity.We hereby propose a novel dynamic structural brain network construction method based on T1-MRI, which can dynamically localize critical regions and constrain the hierarchical distribution among them for constructing dynamic structural brain network. Specifically, we first cluster spatially-correlated channel and generate several critical brain regions as prototypes. Further, we introduce a contrastive loss function to constrain the prototypes distribution, which embed the hierarchical brain semantic structure into the latent space. Self-attention and GCN are then used to dynamically construct hierarchical correlations of critical regions for brain network and explore the correlation, respectively.

To remedy the aforementioned problems, we propose a Graphical Temporal Data Analysis (GTDA) framework.

Specifically, for better extracts global information in temporal data from sensors, S2I converts the data to curve images to demonstrate abnormalities in data changes. CRD and VBL balance the classification to mitigate the unequal distribution of classes. CRD extracts minority samples with similar features to majority samples by clustering and over-samples them. And VBL fine-tunes the decision boundary by balancing the fitting degree of the network to each class.

Current approaches either follow an end-to-end approach or condition the responses on similar emotion labels to generate empathetic responses. But empathy is a broad concept that refers to the cognitive and emotional reactions of an individual to the observed experiences of another and it is more complex than mere mimicry of emotion. Hence, it requires identifying complex human conversational strategies and dynamics in addition to generic emotions to control and interpret empathetic responding capabilities of chatbots. In this work, we make use of a taxonomy of eight empathetic response intents in addition to generic emotion categories in building a dialogue response generation model capable of generating empathetic responses in a controllable and interpretable manner. It consists of two modules: 1) a response emotion/intent prediction module; and 2) a response generation module. We propose several rule-based and neural approaches to predict the next response's emotion/intent and generate responses conditioned on these predicted emotions/intents. Automatic and human evaluation results emphasize the importance of the use of the taxonomy of empathetic response intents in producing more diverse and empathetically more appropriate responses than end-to-end models.

They also use a limited number of transformations and in particular ignore the shear transform in the application. In this paper, we address these problems by emphasizing the importance of the diversity of transformations. We propose a flexible and efficient strategy based on weighted filter-wise Monte Carlo sampling. In addition, we introduce shear equivariant CNN to address the highly sparse representations of natural images. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are intrinsically an efficient generalization of traditional CNNs, and we explain the advantage of bottleneck architectures used in the existing state-of-the-art CNN models such as ResNet, ResNext, and ConvNeXt from the group-equivariant perspective.

We present our findings on COVID-19 severity prediction from chest CT scans using the STOIC dataset. We developed an ensemble deep learning based model that incorporates multiple neural networks to improve predictions. To address data imbalance, we used slicing functions and data augmentation. We further improved performance using test time data augmentation. Our approach which employs a simple yet effective ensemble of deep learning-based models with strong test time augmentations, achieved results comparable to more complex methods and secured the fourth position in the STOIC2021 COVID-19 AI Challenge.

    "abstract": "With the continue development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), there is a growing concern regarding representations that they encode internally. Analyzing these internal representations is referred to as model interpretation. While the task of model explanation, justifying the predictions of such models, has been studied extensively; the task of model interpretation has received less attention. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework for the study of interpretation methods designed for CNN models trained from visual data. More specifically, we first specify the difference between the interpretation and explanation tasks which are often considered the same in the literature. Then, we define a set of six specific factors that can be used to characterize interpretation methods. Third, based on the previous factors, we propose a framework for the positioning of interpretation methods. Our framework highlights that just a very small amount of the suggested factors, and combinations thereof, have been actually studied. Consequently, leaving significant areas unexplored. Following the proposed framework, we discuss existing interpretation methods and give some attention to the evaluation protocols followed to validate them. Finally, the paper highlights capabilities of the methods in producing feedback for enabling interpretation and proposes possible research problems arising from the framework. ",

To take these information optimizations into consideration, in this paper, we propose a Context-Space Progressive Collaborative Network (CS-PCN) for image denoising. CS-PCN is a multi-stage hierarchical architecture composed of a context mining siamese sub-network (CM2S) and a space synthesis sub-network (3S). CM2S aims at extracting rich multi-scale contextual information by sequentially connecting multi-layer feature processors (MLFP) for semantic information pre-processing, attention encoder-decoders (AED) for multi-scale information, and multi-conv attention controllers (MCAC) for supervised feature fusion. 3S parallels MLFP and a single-scale cascading block to learn image details, which not only maintains the contextual information but also emphasizes the complementary spatial ones. Experimental results show that CS-PCN achieves significant performance improvement in synthetic and real-world noise removal. ",

However, previous works have failed to provide guarantees on the worst-case residual error of a PINN across the spatio-temporal domain - a measure akin to the tolerance of numerical solvers - focusing instead on point-wise comparisons between their solution and the ones obtained by a solver on a set of inputs. In real-world applications, one cannot consider tests on a finite set of points to be sufficient grounds for deployment, as the performance could be substantially worse on a different set. To alleviate this issue, we establish tolerance-based correctness conditions for PINNs over the entire input domain. To verify the extent to which they hold, we introduce $\\partial$-CROWN: a general, efficient and scalable post-training framework to bound PINN residual errors. We demonstrate its effectiveness in obtaining tight certificates by applying it to two classically studied PDEs - Burgers' and Schr\\\"odinger's equations -, and two more challenging ones with real-world applications - the Allan-Cahn and Diffusion-Sorption equations.

GCSL is based on the principle of hindsight learning: by observing states visited in previously executed trajectories and treating them as attained goals, GCSL learns the corresponding actions via supervised learning. However, GCSL only learns a goal-conditioned policy, discarding other information in the process. Our insight is that the same hindsight principle can be used to learn to predict goal-conditioned sub-goals from the same trajectory. Based on this idea, we propose Trajectory Iterative Learner (TraIL), an extension of GCSL that further exploits the information in a trajectory, and uses it for learning to predict both actions and sub-goals. We investigate the settings in which TraIL can make better use of the data, and discover that for several popular problem settings, replacing real goals in GCSL with predicted TraIL sub-goals allows the agent to reach a greater set of goal states using the exact same data as GCSL, thereby improving its overall performance.

In this study, we introduce a novel method to enhance neural interlingua representations by making their length variable, thereby overcoming the constraint of fixed-length neural interlingua representations. Our empirical results on zero-shot translation on OPUS, IWSLT, and Europarl datasets demonstrate stable model convergence and superior zero-shot translation results compared to fixed-length neural interlingua representations.

As in the original model, the opinions and social connections of a population of model agents change due to three social processes: conformity, homophily and neophily. Here, however, we explore the case in which each node's susceptibility to these three processes is parameterised by node-specific values drawn independently at random from some distribution. This introduction of heterogeneity increases both the degree of extremism and connectedness in the final population (relative to comparable homogeneous networks) and leads to significant assortativity with respect to node update policy parameters as well as node opinions. Each node's update policy parameters also predict properties of the community that they will belong to in the final network configuration. These results suggest that update policy heterogeneity in social populations may have a significant impact on the formation of extremist communities in real-world populations. ",

However, generative models based on spiking neural networks are not well studied. In this work, we pioneer constructing a spiking generative adversarial network capable of handling complex images. Our first task was to identify the problems of out-of-domain inconsistency and temporal inconsistency inherent in spiking generative adversarial networks. We addressed these issues by incorporating the Earth-Mover distance and an attention-based weighted decoding method, significantly enhancing the performance of our algorithm across several datasets. Experimental results reveal that our approach outperforms existing methods on the MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and CelebA datasets. Moreover, compared with hybrid spiking generative adversarial networks, where the discriminator is an artificial analog neural network, our methodology demonstrates closer alignment with the information processing patterns observed in the mouse.

The detection of such forgeries is particularly important in contexts where they can be exploited for malicious purposes. Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in distinguishing between the original and duplicated objects in copy-move forgeries, accompanied by the development of larger-scale datasets to facilitate this task. However, existing approaches to copy-move forgery detection and source/target differentiation often involve two separate steps or the design of individual end-to-end networks for each task. In this paper, we propose an innovative method that employs the transformer architecture in an end-to-end deep neural network. Our method aims to detect instances of copy-move forgery while simultaneously localizing the source and target regions. By utilizing this approach, we address the challenges posed by multi-object copy-move scenarios and report if there is a balance between the detection and differentiation tasks. To evaluate the performance of our proposed network, we conducted experiments on two publicly available copy-move datasets. The results and analysis aims to show the potential significance of our focus in balancing detection and distinguishment result and transferring the trained model in different datasets in the field.

A variety of techniques has been developed for link prediction problem, categorized into 1) similarity based approaches which study a set of features to extract similar nodes; 2) learning based approaches which extract patterns from the input data; 3) probabilistic statistical approaches which optimize a set of parameters to establish a model which can best compute formation probability. However, existing literatures lack approaches which utilize strength of each approach by integrating them to achieve a much more productive one. To tackle the link prediction problem, we propose an approach based on the combination of first and second group methods; the existing studied works use just one of these categories. Our two-phase developed method firstly determines new features related to the position and dynamic behavior of nodes, which enforce the approach more efficiency compared to approaches using mere measures. Then, a subspace clustering algorithm is applied to group social objects based on the computed similarity measures which differentiate the strength of clusters; basically, the usage of local and global indices and the clustering information plays an imperative role in our link prediction process. Some extensive experiments held on real datasets including Facebook, Brightkite and HepTh indicate good performances of our proposal method.

    "abstract": "In single-objective optimization, it is well known that evolutionary algorithms also without further adjustments can tolerate a certain amount of noise in the evaluation of the objective function. In contrast, this question is not at all understood for multi-objective optimization. In this work, we conduct the first mathematical runtime analysis of a simple multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) on a classic benchmark in the presence of noise in the objective functions. We prove that when bit-wise prior noise with rate $p \\le \\alpha/n$, $\\alpha$ a suitable constant, is present, the \\emph{simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer} (SEMO) without any adjustments to cope with noise finds the Pareto front of the OneMinMax benchmark in time $O(n^2\\log n)$, just as in the case without noise. Given that the problem here is to arrive at a population consisting of $n+1$ individuals witnessing the Pareto front, this is a surprisingly strong robustness to noise (comparably simple evolutionary algorithms cannot optimize the single-objective OneMax problem in polynomial time when $p = \\omega(\\log(n)/n)$). Our proofs suggest that the strong robustness of the MOEA stems from its implicit diversity mechanism designed to enable it to compute a population covering the whole Pareto front. Interestingly this result only holds when the objective value of a solution is determined only once and the algorithm from that point on works with this, possibly noisy, objective value. We prove that when all solutions are reevaluated in each iteration, then any noise rate $p = \\omega(\\log(n)/n^2)$ leads to a super-polynomial runtime. This is very different from single-objective optimization, where it is generally preferred to reevaluate solutions whenever their fitness is important and where examples are known such that not reevaluating solutions can lead to catastrophic performance losses.

While numerous traditional manifold-based techniques exist for dimensionality reduction, their application in self-supervised learning has witnessed slow progress. The recent MSIMCLR method combines manifold encoding with SimCLR but requires extremely low target encoding dimensions to outperform SimCLR, limiting its applicability. This paper introduces a novel learning paradigm using an unbalanced atlas (UA), capable of surpassing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches. We meticulously investigated and engineered the DeepInfomax with an unbalanced atlas (DIM-UA) method by systematically adapting the Spatiotemporal DeepInfomax (ST-DIM) framework to align with our proposed UA paradigm, employing rigorous scientific methodologies throughout the process. The efficacy of DIM-UA is demonstrated through training and evaluation on the Atari Annotated RAM Interface (AtariARI) benchmark, a modified version of the Atari 2600 framework that produces annotated image samples for representation learning. The UA paradigm improves the existing algorithm significantly when the number of target encoding dimensions grows. For instance, the mean F1 score averaged over categories of DIM-UA is ~75% compared to ~70% of ST-DIM when using 16384 hidden units. ",

This paper formalize an existing problem in NLP research: benchmarking when some systems scores are missing on the task, and proposes a novel approach to address it. Our method utilizes a compatible partial ranking approach to impute missing data, which is then aggregated using the Borda count method. It includes two refinements designed specifically for scenarios where either task-level or instance-level scores are available. We also introduce an extended benchmark, which contains over 131 million scores, an order of magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. We validate our methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in addressing the challenge of missing system evaluation on an entire task.

While tree-based methods outperform DL-based methods in supervised learning, recent literature reports that self-supervised learning with Transformer-based models outperforms tree-based methods. In the existing literature on self-supervised learning for tabular data, contrastive learning is the predominant method. In contrastive learning, data augmentation is important to generate different views. However, data augmentation for tabular data has been difficult due to the unique structure and high complexity of tabular data. In addition, three main components are proposed together in existing methods: model structure, self-supervised learning methods, and data augmentation. Therefore, previous works have compared the performance without comprehensively considering these components, and it is not clear how each component affects the actual performance. In this study, we focus on data augmentation to address these issues. We propose a novel data augmentation method, $\\textbf{M}$ask $\\textbf{T}$oken $\\textbf{R}$eplacement ($\\texttt{MTR}$), which replaces the mask token with a portion of each tokenized column; $\\texttt{MTR}$ takes advantage of the properties of Transformer, which is becoming the predominant DL-based architecture for tabular data, to perform data augmentation for each column embedding. Through experiments with 13 diverse public datasets in both supervised and self-supervised learning scenarios, we show that $\\texttt{MTR}$ achieves competitive performance against existing data augmentation methods and improves model performance.

Despite the promise of machine vision for SSWC systems and the importance of ground speed in weed control efficacy, there has been little investigation of the role of ground speed and camera characteristics on weed detection performance. Here, we compare the performance of four camera-software combinations using the open-source OpenWeedLocator platform - (1) default settings on a Raspberry Pi HQ camera, (2) optimised software settings on a HQ camera, (3) optimised software settings on the Raspberry Pi v2 camera, and (4) a global shutter Arducam AR0234 camera - at speeds ranging from 5 km h$^{-1}$ to 30 km h$^{-1}$. A combined excess green (ExG) and hue, saturation, value (HSV) thresholding algorithm was used for testing under fallow conditions using tillage radish (Raphanus sativus) and forage oats (Avena sativa) as representative broadleaf and grass weeds, respectively. ARD demonstrated the highest recall among camera systems, with up to 95.7% of weeds detected at 5 km h$^{-1}$ and 85.7% at 30 km h$^{-1}$. HQ1 and V2 cameras had the lowest recall of 31.1% and 26.0% at 30 km h$^{-1}$, respectively. All cameras experienced a decrease in recall as speed increased. The highest rate of decrease was observed for HQ1 with 1.12% and 0.90% reductions in recall for every km h$^{-1}$ increase in speed for tillage radish and forage oats, respectively. Detection of the grassy forage oats was worse (P<0.05) than the broadleaved tillage radish for all cameras. Despite the variations in recall, HQ1, HQ2, and V2 maintained near-perfect precision at all tested speeds. The variable effect of ground speed and camera system on detection performance of grass and broadleaf weeds, indicates that careful hardware and software considerations must be made when developing SSWC systems.

    "abstract": "Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is widely applied for the diagnosis of ischemic heart diseases. Low-dose (LD) SPECT aims to minimize radiation exposure but leads to increased image noise. Limited-angle (LA) SPECT enables faster scanning and reduced hardware costs but results in lower reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, computed tomography (CT)-derived attenuation maps ($\\mu$-maps) are commonly used for SPECT attenuation correction (AC), but it will cause extra radiation exposure and SPECT-CT misalignments. In addition, the majority of SPECT scanners in the market are not hybrid SPECT/CT scanners. Although various deep learning methods have been introduced to separately address these limitations, the solution for simultaneously addressing these challenges still remains highly under-explored and challenging. To this end, we propose a Cross-domain Iterative Network (CDI-Net) for simultaneous denoising, LA reconstruction, and CT-free AC in cardiac SPECT. In CDI-Net, paired projection- and image-domain networks are end-to-end connected to fuse the emission and anatomical information across domains and iterations. Adaptive Weight Recalibrators (AWR) adjust the multi-channel input features to enhance prediction accuracy. Our experiments using clinical data showed that CDI-Net produced more accurate $\\mu$-maps, projections, and reconstructions compared to existing approaches that addressed each task separately. Ablation studies demonstrated the significance of cross-domain and cross-iteration connections, as well as AWR, in improving the reconstruction performance. ",

    "abstract": "Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is widely applied for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Reducing the dose of the injected tracer is essential for lowering the patient's radiation exposure, but it will lead to increased image noise. Additionally, the latest dedicated cardiac SPECT scanners typically acquire projections in fewer angles using fewer detectors to reduce hardware expenses, potentially resulting in lower reconstruction accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a dual-domain iterative network for end-to-end joint denoising and reconstruction from low-dose and few-angle projections of cardiac SPECT. The image-domain network provides a prior estimate for the projection-domain networks. The projection-domain primary and auxiliary modules are interconnected for progressive denoising and few-angle reconstruction. Adaptive Data Consistency (ADC) modules improve prediction accuracy by efficiently fusing the outputs of the primary and auxiliary modules. Experiments using clinical MPI data show that our proposed method outperforms existing image-, projection-, and dual-domain techniques, producing more accurate projections and reconstructions. Ablation studies confirm the significance of the image-domain prior estimate and ADC modules in enhancing network performance. ",

    "abstract": "It has become a popular paradigm to transfer the knowledge of large-scale pre-trained models to various downstream tasks via fine-tuning the entire model parameters. However, with the growth of model scale and the rising number of downstream tasks, this paradigm inevitably meets the challenges in terms of computation consumption and memory footprint issues. Recently, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) (e.g., Adapter, LoRA, BitFit) shows a promising paradigm to alleviate these concerns by updating only a portion of parameters. Despite these PEFTs having demonstrated satisfactory performance in natural language processing, it remains under-explored for the question of whether these techniques could be transferred to graph-based tasks with Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs). Therefore, in this paper, we fill this gap by providing extensive benchmarks with traditional PEFTs on a range of graph-based downstream tasks. Our empirical study shows that it is sub-optimal to directly transfer existing PEFTs to graph-based tasks due to the issue of feature distribution shift. To address this issue, we propose a novel structure-aware PEFT approach, named G-Adapter, which leverages graph convolution operation to introduce graph structure (e.g., graph adjacent matrix) as an inductive bias to guide the updating process. Besides, we propose Bregman proximal point optimization to further alleviate feature distribution shift by preventing the model from aggressive update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that G-Adapter obtains the state-of-the-art performance compared to the counterparts on nine graph benchmark datasets based on two pre-trained GTNs, and delivers tremendous memory footprint efficiency compared to the conventional paradigm.

    "abstract": "Shape matching is a fundamental problem in computer graphics with many applications. Functional maps translate the point-wise shape-matching problem into its functional counterpart and have inspired numerous solutions over the last decade. Nearly all the solutions based on functional maps rely on the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LB) to describe the functional spaces defined on the surfaces and then convert the functional correspondences into point-wise correspondences. However, this final step is often error-prone and inaccurate in tiny regions and protrusions, where the energy of LB does not uniformly cover the surface. We propose a new functional basis Principal Components of a Dictionary (PCD) to address such intrinsic limitation. PCD constructs an orthonormal basis from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of a dictionary of functions defined over the shape. These dictionaries can target specific properties of the final basis, such as achieving an even spreading of energy. Our experimental evaluation compares seven different dictionaries on established benchmarks, showing that PCD is suited to target different shape-matching scenarios, resulting in more accurate point-wise maps than the LB basis when used in the same pipeline. This evidence provides a promising alternative for improving correspondence estimation, confirming the power and flexibility of functional maps. ",

Detected vulnerabilities are often fixed quickly in the library code. The easiest way to include these fixes in a dependent software application, is to update the used library version. Package managers provide automated solutions for updating library dependencies. However, library dependencies can have dependencies to other libraries resulting in a dependency network with several levels of indirections. Assessing vulnerability risks induced by dependency networks is a non-trivial task for software developers. The library dependency network in the Swift ecosystem encompasses libraries from CocoaPods, Carthage and Swift Package Manager. We analysed how vulnerabilities propagate in the library dependency network of the Swift ecosystem, how vulnerable dependencies could be fixed via dependency upgrades, and if third party vulnerability analysis could be made more precise given public information on these vulnerabilities. We found that only 5.9% of connected libraries had a direct or transitive dependency to a vulnerable library. Although we found that most libraries with publicly reported vulnerabilities are written in C, the highest impact of publicly reported vulnerabilities originated from libraries written in native iOS languages. We found that around 30% of vulnerable dependencies could have been fixed via upgrading the library dependency. In case of critical vulnerabilities and latest library versions, over 70% of vulnerable dependencies would have been fixed via a dependency upgrade. Lastly, we checked whether the analysis of vulnerable dependency use could be refined using publicly available information on the code location (method or class) of a reported vulnerability. We found that such information is not available most of the time. ",

The research maps each attack vector to a tactic or technique from the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, covering enterprise, mobile, and Industrial Control System (ICS) frameworks. The experiment involved generating and surveying fifty near-ultrasonic audios to assess the attacks' effectiveness, with unprocessed commands having a 100% success rate and processed ones achieving a 58% overall success rate. This systematic approach stimulates previously unaddressed attack surfaces, ensuring comprehensive detection and attack design while pairing each ATT&CK Identifier with a tested defensive method, providing attack and defense tactics for prompt-response options. The main findings reveal that the attack method employs Single Upper Sideband Amplitude Modulation (SUSBAM) to generate near-ultrasonic audio from audible sources, transforming spoken commands into a frequency range beyond human-adult hearing. By eliminating the lower sideband, the design achieves a 6 kHz minimum from 16-22 kHz while remaining inaudible after transformation. The research investigates the one-to-many attack surface where a single device simultaneously triggers multiple actions or devices. Additionally, the study demonstrates the reversibility or demodulation of the inaudible signal, suggesting potential alerting methods and the possibility of embedding secret messages like audio steganography.

Recent works in this area have started to incorporate natural language, moving beyond the traditional stylized message setting. However, previous research has focused on on-policy prediction, where the train and test data have the same distribution, which is not representative of real-life scenarios. In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of off-policy evaluation (OPE) in language-based persuasion games. To address the inherent difficulty of human data collection in this setup, we propose a novel approach which combines real and simulated human-bot interaction data. Our simulated data is created by an exogenous model assuming decision makers (DMs) start with a mixture of random and decision-theoretic based behaviors and improve over time. We present a deep learning training algorithm that effectively integrates real interaction and simulated data, substantially improving over models that train only with interaction data. Our results demonstrate the potential of real interaction and simulation mixtures as a cost-effective and scalable solution for OPE in language-based persuasion games.\\footnote{Our code and the large dataset we collected and generated are submitted as supplementary material and will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

We probe interviewees' preferences using simulated personal moderation interfaces, including word filters, sliders for toxicity levels, and boolean toxicity toggles.

It is especially pertinent to autoregressive sequence tasks, where training and inference costs are typically very high. However, existing research has predominantly focused on tasks with static data such as image classification. In this work, we investigate Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EDD) applied to large-scale natural language sequence-to-sequence data. EDD aims to compress the superior uncertainty performance of an expensive (teacher) ensemble into a cheaper (student) single model. Importantly, the ability to separate knowledge (epistemic) and data (aleatoric) uncertainty is retained. Existing probability-space approaches to EDD, however, are difficult to scale to large vocabularies. We show, for modern transformer architectures on large-scale translation tasks, that modelling the ensemble logits, instead of softmax probabilities, leads to significantly better students. Moreover, the students surprisingly even outperform Deep Ensembles by up to ~10% AUROC on out-of-distribution detection, whilst matching them at in-distribution translation. ",

Still, the limited certified robustness that is currently achievable has been a bottleneck for their practical adoption. Gowal et al. and Wang et al. have shown that generating additional training data using state-of-the-art diffusion models can considerably improve the robustness of adversarial training. In this work, we demonstrate that a similar approach can substantially improve deterministic certified defenses. In addition, we provide a list of recommendations to scale the robustness of certified training approaches. One of our main insights is that the generalization gap, i.e., the difference between the training and test accuracy of the original model, is a good predictor of the magnitude of the robustness improvement when using additional generated data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art deterministic robustness certificates on CIFAR-10 for the $\\ell_2$ ($\\epsilon = 36/255$) and $\\ell_\\infty$ ($\\epsilon = 8/255$) threat models, outperforming the previous best results by $+3.95\\%$ and $+1.39\\%$, respectively.

The optimal classifier is implementable using a message-passing graph neural network architecture. We then compute the generalization error of this classifier and compare its performance against existing learning methods theoretically on a well-studied statistical model with naturally identifiable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in the data. We find that the optimal message-passing architecture interpolates between a standard MLP in the regime of low graph signal and a typical convolution in the regime of high graph signal.

As it is challenging to construct a C-space explicitly for a high-dimensional robot, we generally build a graph structure called a roadmap, a discrete approximation of a complex continuous C-space, to reason about connectivity. Checking collision-free connectivity in the roadmap requires expensive edge-evaluation computations, and thus, reducing the number of evaluations has become a significant research objective. However, in practice, we often face infeasible problems: those in which there is no collision-free path in the roadmap between the start and the goal locations. Existing studies often overlook the possibility of infeasibility, becoming highly inefficient by performing many edge evaluations. In this work, we address this oversight in scenarios where a prior roadmap is available; that is, the edges of the roadmap contain the probability of being a collision-free edge learned from past experience. To this end, we propose an algorithm called iterative path and cut finding (IPC) that iteratively searches for a path and a cut in a prior roadmap to detect infeasibility while reducing expensive edge evaluations as much as possible. We further improve the efficiency of IPC by introducing a second algorithm, iterative decomposition and path and cut finding (IDPC), that leverages the fact that cut-finding algorithms partition the roadmap into smaller subgraphs. We analyze the theoretical properties of IPC and IDPC, such as completeness and computational complexity, and evaluate their performance in terms of completion time and the number of edge evaluations in large-scale simulations.

Recently, this model has been extended to include signed connections. While the unsigned ENM has been rigorously observed for decades, the signed version is still somewhat novel and lacks the same breadth of observation. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to examine this signed structure across various categories of individuals from a swathe of culturally distinct regions. Minor differences in the distribution of signs across the SENM can be observed between cultures. However, these can be overwhelmed when the network is centred around a specific topic. Indeed, users who are engaged with specific themes display higher levels of negativity in their networks. This effect is further supported by a significant negative correlation between the number of \"general\" topics discussed in a network and that network's percentage of negative connections. These findings suggest that the negativity of communications and relationships on Twitter are very dependent on the topics being discussed and, furthermore, these relationships are more likely to be negative when they are based around a specific topic.

However, existing AutoML services are model-centric, in that they are limited to extracting features and searching for models from initial training data-they are only as effective as the initial training data quality. With the increasing volume of tabular data available, there is a huge opportunity for data augmentation. For instance, vertical augmentation adds predictive features, while horizontal augmentation adds examples. This augmented training data yields potentially much better AutoML models at a lower cost. However, existing systems either forgo the augmentation opportunities that provide poor models, or apply expensive augmentation searching techniques that drain users' budgets. Kitana is a data-centric AutoML system that also searches for new tabular datasets that can augment the tabular training data with new features and/or examples. Kitana manages a corpus of datasets, exposes an AutoML interface to users and searches for augmentation with datasets in the corpus to improve AutoML performance. To accelerate search, Kitana applies aggressive pre-computation to train a factorized proxy model and evaluate each candidate augmentation within 0.1s. Kitana also uses a cost model to limit the time spent on augmentation search, supports expressive data access controls, and performs request caching to benefit from past similar requests. Using a corpus of 518 open-source datasets, Kitana produces higher quality models than existing AutoML systems in orders of magnitude less time. Across different user requests, Kitana increases the model R2 from 0.16 to 0.66 while reducing the cost by >100x compared to the naive factorized learning and SOTA data augmentation search. ",

In this technical report, we use two-stage fully convolutional networks (FCNs) to automatically segment AVT in CTA scans from multiple centers. Specifically, we firstly adopt a 3D FCN with U-shape network architecture to segment AVT in order to produce topology attention and accelerate medical image analysis pipeline.

    "abstract": "Survival prediction is a major concern for cancer management. Deep survival models based on deep learning have been widely adopted to perform end-to-end survival prediction from medical images. Recent deep survival models achieved promising performance by jointly performing tumor segmentation with survival prediction, where the models were guided to extract tumor-related information through Multi-Task Learning (MTL). However, existing deep survival models have difficulties in exploring out-of-tumor prognostic information (e.g., local lymph node metastasis and adjacent tissue invasions). In addition, existing deep survival models are underdeveloped in utilizing multi-modality images. Empirically-designed strategies were commonly adopted to fuse multi-modality information via fixed pre-designed networks. In this study, we propose a Deep Multi-modality Segmentation-to-Survival model (DeepMSS) for survival prediction from PET/CT images. Instead of adopting MTL, we propose a novel Segmentation-to-Survival Learning (SSL) strategy, where our DeepMSS is trained for tumor segmentation and survival prediction sequentially. This strategy enables the DeepMSS to initially focus on tumor regions and gradually expand its focus to include other prognosis-related regions. We also propose a data-driven strategy to fuse multi-modality image information, which realizes automatic optimization of fusion strategies based on training data during training and also improves the adaptability of DeepMSS to different training targets. Our DeepMSS is also capable of incorporating conventional radiomics features as an enhancement, where handcrafted features can be extracted from the DeepMSS-segmented tumor regions and cooperatively integrated into the DeepMSS's training and inference. Extensive experiments with two large clinical datasets show that our DeepMSS outperforms state-of-the-art survival prediction methods. ",

    "abstract": "It is well known that artificial neural networks initialized from independent and identically distributed priors converge to Gaussian processes in the limit of large number of neurons per hidden layer. In this work we prove an analogous result for Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). Namely, we show that the outputs of certain models based on Haar random unitary or orthogonal deep QNNs converge to Gaussian processes in the limit of large Hilbert space dimension $d$. The derivation of this result is more nuanced than in the classical case due the role played by the input states, the measurement observable, and the fact that the entries of unitary matrices are not independent. An important consequence of our analysis is that the ensuing Gaussian processes cannot be used to efficiently predict the outputs of the QNN via Bayesian statistics. Furthermore, our theorems imply that the concentration of measure phenomenon in Haar random QNNs is much worse than previously thought, as we prove that expectation values and gradients concentrate as $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{e^d \\sqrt{d}}\\right)$ -- exponentially in the Hilbert space dimension. Finally, we discuss how our results improve our understanding of concentration in $t$-designs. ",

The proposed method is trained on pairs of PET images from short (2 minutes) and standard (20 minutes) scanning times, sourced from multiple domains. Learning relevant image features between these domains with a single network is challenging. Our key contribution is the introduction of a mapping label, which enables effective learning of specific representations between different domains. The network, trained with various mapping labels, can efficiently correct amyloid PET datasets in multiple training domains and unseen domains, such as those obtained with new radiotracers, acquisition protocols, or PET scanners. Internal, temporal, and external validations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, for external validation datasets from unseen domains, the proposed method achieved comparable or superior results relative to methods trained with these datasets, in terms of quantitative metrics such as normalized root mean-square error and structure similarity index measure. Two nuclear medicine physicians evaluated the amyloid status as positive or negative for the external validation datasets, with accuracies of 0.970 and 0.930 for readers 1 and 2, respectively. ",

The proposed BASEN is based on the fully-convolutional time-domain audio separation network. In order to fully leverage the complementary information contained in the EEG signals, we further propose a convolutional multi-layer cross attention module to fuse the dual-branch features.

In this work, we use data from a multi-centric study on endometrial cancer to analyze the impact of different missingness mechanisms on the recovered causal graph. This is achieved by extending state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms to exploit expert knowledge without sacrificing theoretical soundness. We validate the recovered graph with expert physicians, showing that our approach finds clinically-relevant solutions.

In this space weather framework, the present paper introduces a physics-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approach to the prediction of CMEs travel time, in which the deterministic drag-based model is exploited to improve the training phase of a cascade of two neural networks fed with both remote sensing and in-situ data. This study shows that the use of physical information in the AI architecture significantly improves both the accuracy and the robustness of the travel time prediction. ",

They are versatile when compared to traditional phylogenetic trees, as they capture more complex evolutionary events such as hybridization and horizontal gene transfer. Distance-based methods such as the Neighbor-Net algorithm are widely used to compute phylogenetic networks from data. However, the output is necessarily an undirected graph, posing a great challenge to deduce the direction of genetic flow in order to infer the true evolutionary history. Recently, Huber et al. investigated two different computational problems relevant to orienting undirected phylogenetic networks into directed ones. In this paper, we consider the problem of orienting an undirected binary network into a tree-child network. We give some necessary conditions for determining the tree-child orientability, such as a tight upper bound on the size of tree-child orientable graphs, as well as many interesting examples. In addition, we introduce new families of undirected phylogenetic networks, the jellyfish graphs and ladder graphs, that are orientable but not tree-child orientable. We also prove that any ladder graph can be made tree-child orientable by adding extra leaves, and describe a simple algorithm for orienting a ladder graph to a tree-child network with the minimum number of extra leaves. We pose many open problems as well. ",

    "abstract": "Extracting information from the electrocardiography (ECG) signal is an essential step in the design of digital health technologies in cardiology. In recent years, several machine learning (ML) algorithms for automatic extraction of information in ECG have been proposed. Supervised learning methods have successfully been used to identify specific aspects in the signal, like detection of rhythm disorders (arrhythmias). Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, on the other hand, can be used to extract all the features contained in the data. The model is optimized without any specific goal and learns from the data itself. By adapting state-of-the-art computer vision methodologies to the signal processing domain, a few SSL approaches have been reported recently for ECG processing. However, such SSL methods require either data augmentation or negative pairs, which limits the method to only look for similarities between two ECG inputs, either two versions of the same signal or two signals from the same subject. This leads to models that are very effective at extracting characteristics that are stable in a subject, such as gender or age. But they are not successful at capturing changes within the ECG recording that can explain dynamic aspects, like different arrhythmias or different sleep stages. In this work, we introduce the first SSL method that uses neither data augmentation nor negative pairs for understanding ECG signals, and still, achieves comparable quality representations. As a result, it is possible to design a SSL method that not only captures similarities between two inputs, but also captures dissimilarities for a complete understanding of the data. In addition, a model based on transformer blocks is presented, which produces better results than a model based on convolutional layers (XResNet50) with almost the same number of parameters. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, smart meters have been widely adopted by electricity suppliers to improve the management of the smart grid system. These meters usually collect energy consumption data at a very low frequency (every 30min), enabling utilities to bill customers more accurately. To provide more personalized recommendations, the next step is to detect the appliances owned by customers, which is a challenging problem, due to the very-low meter reading frequency. Even though the appliance detection problem can be cast as a time series classification problem, with many such classifiers having been proposed in the literature, no study has applied and compared them on this specific problem. This paper presents an in-depth evaluation and comparison of state-of-the-art time series classifiers applied to detecting the presence/absence of diverse appliances in very low-frequency smart meter data. We report results with five real datasets. We first study the impact of the detection quality of 13 different appliances using 30min sampled data, and we subsequently propose an analysis of the possible detection performance gain by using a higher meter reading frequency. The results indicate that the performance of current time series classifiers varies significantly. Some of them, namely deep learning-based classifiers, provide promising results in terms of accuracy (especially for certain appliances), even using 30min sampled data, and are scalable to the large smart meter time series collections of energy consumption data currently available to electricity suppliers. Nevertheless, our study shows that more work is needed in this area to further improve the accuracy of the proposed solutions. This paper was accepted in e-Energy '23. ",

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is a serious disease in which individuals are unable to regulate their blood glucose levels, leading to various medical complications. Artificial pancreas (AP) systems have been developed as a solution for type 1 diabetic patients to mimic the behavior of the pancreas and regulate blood glucose levels. However, current AP systems lack detection capabilities for exercise-induced glucose intake, which can last up to 4 to 8 hours. This incapability can lead to hypoglycemia, which if left untreated, could have serious consequences, including death. Existing exercise detection methods are either limited to single sensor data or use inaccurate models for exercise detection, making them less effective in practice. In this work, we propose an ensemble learning framework that combines a data-driven physiological model and a Siamese network to leverage multiple physiological signal streams for exercise detection with high accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we utilized a public dataset with 12 diabetic patients collected from an 8-week clinical trial. Our approach achieves a true positive rate for exercise detection of 86.4% and a true negative rate of 99.1%, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions. ",
