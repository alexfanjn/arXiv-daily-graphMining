    "abstract": "A theoretical and computational finite element study of modified Navier-Stokes Equations coupled with energy conservation governing the flow and heat transfer in complex domains with hybrid nanofluid$(HNF)$ is carried out. The apriori error estimates providing the convergence analysis for the finite element scheme is derived in the $H^1$ norm. A detailed parametric analysis on the physics related to flow and heat tranfer for different governing parameters such as: hybrid nano-particle volume fraction $(\\phi),$ Rayleigh Number $(Ra)$, Prandtl Number$(Pr)$, and the length of heat source has been reported. The use of hybrid nano-particles leads to the enhancement of heat conduction both in L and H shaped domains. While a butterfly flow pattern with a multi-cellular structure is noticed in H-shaped domain, the flow in L-Shaped domain depicts a boundary layer feature with primary, secondary and tertiary co-rotating and counter rotating cells.

To determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, we introduced two methods: pre-collected hardware-cost on device and device-specific hardware-cost model VPUNN. With the help of NAS, for classification task on VPU, we can achieve 1.3x fps acceleration over Mobilenet-v2-1.4 and 2.2x acceleration over Resnet50 with the same accuracy score.

    "abstract": "Driving risk prediction has been a topic of much research over the past few decades to minimize driving risk and increase safety. The use of demographic information in risk prediction is a traditional solution with applications in insurance planning, however, it is difficult to capture true driving behavior via such coarse-grained factors. Therefor, the use of telematics data has gained a widespread popularity over the past decade. While most of the existing studies leverage demographic information in addition to telematics data, our objective is to maximize the use of telematics as well as contextual information (e.g., road-type) to build a risk prediction framework with real-world applications. We contextualize telematics data in a variety of forms, and then use it to develop a risk classifier, assuming that there are some weak risk labels available (e.g., past traffic citation records). Before building a risk classifier though, we employ a novel data-driven process to augment weak risk labels. Extensive analysis and results based on real-world data from multiple major cities in the United States demonstrate usefulness of the proposed framework. ",

    "abstract": "Attribute graphs are ubiquitous in multimedia applications, and graph representation learning (GRL) has been successful in analyzing attribute graph data. However, incomplete graph data and missing node attributes can have a negative impact on media knowledge discovery. Existing methods for handling attribute missing graph have limited assumptions or fail to capture complex attribute-graph dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose Attribute missing Graph Contrastive Learning (AmGCL), a framework for handling missing node attributes in attribute graph data. AmGCL leverages Dirichlet energy minimization-based feature precoding to encode in missing attributes and a self-supervised Graph Augmentation Contrastive Learning Structure (GACLS) to learn latent variables from the encoded-in data. Specifically, AmGCL utilizies feature reconstruction based on structure-attribute energy minimization while maximizes the lower bound of evidence for latent representation mutual information. Our experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that AmGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both feature imputation and node classification tasks, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method in real-world attribute graph analysis tasks.

Contextual multi-armed bandits have been studied for decades with various applications. To solve the exploitation-exploration trade-off in bandits, there are three main techniques: epsilon-greedy, Thompson Sampling (TS), and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). In recent literature, a series of neural bandit algorithms have been proposed to adapt to the non-linear reward function, combined with TS or UCB strategies for exploration. In this paper, instead of calculating a large-deviation based statistical bound for exploration like previous methods, we propose, ``EE-Net,'' a novel neural-based exploitation and exploration strategy. In addition to using a neural network (Exploitation network) to learn the reward function, EE-Net uses another neural network (Exploration network) to adaptively learn the potential gains compared to the currently estimated reward for exploration. We provide an instance-based $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret upper bound for EE-Net and show that EE-Net outperforms related linear and neural contextual bandit baselines on real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "A generative AI model -- such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT -- can generate extremely realistic-looking content, posing growing challenges to the authenticity of information. To address the challenges, watermark has been leveraged to detect AI-generated content. Specifically, a watermark is embedded into an AI-generated content before it is released. A content is detected as AI-generated if a similar watermark can be decoded from it. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the robustness of such watermark-based AI-generated content detection. We focus on AI-generated images. Our work shows that an attacker can post-process an AI-generated watermarked image via adding a small, human-imperceptible perturbation to it, such that the post-processed AI-generated image evades detection while maintaining its visual quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack both theoretically and empirically. Moreover, to evade detection, our adversarial post-processing method adds much smaller perturbations to the AI-generated images and thus better maintain their visual quality than existing popular image post-processing methods such as JPEG compression, Gaussian blur, and Brightness/Contrast. Our work demonstrates the insufficiency of existing watermark-based detection of AI-generated content, highlighting the urgent needs of new detection methods. ",

Although uni-modal approaches have been extensively studied, they suffer from data quality and require modality-specific feature engineering, thus not being robust and effective enough for real-world deployment. By utilizing various sensors, Multi-modal Human Activity Recognition could utilize the complementary information to build models that can generalize well. While deep learning methods have shown promising results, their potential in extracting salient multi-modal spatial-temporal features and better fusing complementary information has not been fully explored. Also, reducing the complexity of the multi-modal approach for edge deployment is another problem yet to resolve. To resolve the issues, a knowledge distillation-based Multi-modal Mid-Fusion approach, DMFT, is proposed to conduct informative feature extraction and fusion to resolve the Multi-modal Human Activity Recognition task efficiently. DMFT first encodes the multi-modal input data into a unified representation. Then the DMFT teacher model applies an attentive multi-modal spatial-temporal transformer module that extracts the salient spatial-temporal features. A temporal mid-fusion module is also proposed to further fuse the temporal features. Then the knowledge distillation method is applied to transfer the learned representation from the teacher model to a simpler DMFT student model, which consists of a lite version of the multi-modal spatial-temporal transformer module, to produce the results. Evaluation of DMFT was conducted on two public multi-modal human activity recognition datasets with various state-of-the-art approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance in terms of effectiveness, scalability, and robustness. ",

The MLP method performs as good or better than other works despite its compact size. We prove the generalizability of our method by showing that the MLP performs at 100% accuracy in the holdout dataset and 98.3% accuracy in three other sites' fMRI acquisitions. ",

Machine learning frameworks that integrate uncertainty estimation as part of their treatment recommendations would be safer and more reliable. However, little work has been done in adapting uncertainty estimation techniques and validation metrics for precision medicine. In this paper, we use Bayesian deep learning for estimating the posterior distribution over factual and counterfactual outcomes on several treatments. This allows for estimating the uncertainty for each treatment option and for the individual treatment effects (ITE) between any two treatments. We train and evaluate this model to predict future new and enlarging T2 lesion counts on a large, multi-center dataset of MR brain images of patients with multiple sclerosis, exposed to several treatments during randomized controlled trials. We evaluate the correlation of the uncertainty estimate with the factual error, and, given the lack of ground truth counterfactual outcomes, demonstrate how uncertainty for the ITE prediction relates to bounds on the ITE error. Lastly, we demonstrate how knowledge of uncertainty could modify clinical decision-making to improve individual patient and clinical trial outcomes. ",

Efforts on representing SIN are mainly focused on capturing the dynamics of networks in Euclidean space, and recently plenty of work has extended to hyperbolic geometry for implicit hierarchical learning. Previous approaches which learn the embedding trajectories of users and items achieve promising results. However, there are still a range of fundamental issues remaining open. For example, is it appropriate to place user and item nodes in one identical space regardless of their inherent discrepancy? Instead of residing in a single fixed curvature space, how will the representation spaces evolve when new interaction occurs? To explore these issues for sequential interaction networks, we propose SINCERE, a novel method representing Sequential Interaction Networks on Co-Evolving RiEmannian manifolds. SIN- CERE not only takes the user and item embedding trajectories in respective spaces into account, but also emphasizes on the space evolvement that how curvature changes over time. Specifically, we introduce a fresh cross-geometry aggregation which allows us to propagate information across different Riemannian manifolds without breaking conformal invariance, and a curvature estimator which is delicately designed to predict global curvatures effectively according to current local Ricci curvatures. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the promising performance of SINCERE over the state-of-the-art sequential interaction prediction methods. ",

We present an on-device sponge poisoning attack pipeline to simulate the streaming and consistent inference scenario to bridge the knowledge gap in the on-device setting. Our exclusive experimental analysis with processors and on-device networks shows that sponge poisoning attacks can effectively pollute the modern processor with its built-in accelerator.

While singular value decomposition is a natural instinct to study such kernels, we consider a more general approach to include the use of a family of kernels, such as generalized translation networks (which include neural networks and translation invariant kernels as special cases) and rotated zonal function kernels. Naturally, unlike traditional kernel based approximation, we cannot require the kernels to be positive definite.

    "abstract": "A key constraint that limits the implementation of blockchain in Internet of Things (IoT) is its large storage requirement resulting from the fact that each blockchain node has to store the entire blockchain. This increases the burden on blockchain nodes, and increases the communication overhead for new nodes joining the network since they have to copy the entire blockchain. In order to reduce storage requirements without compromising on system security and integrity, coded blockchains, based on error correcting codes with fixed rates and lengths, have been recently proposed. This approach, however, does not fit well with dynamic IoT networks in which nodes actively leave and join. In such dynamic blockchains, the existing coded blockchain approaches lead to high communication overheads for new joining nodes and may have high decoding failure probability. This paper proposes a rateless coded blockchain with coding parameters adjusted to network conditions. Our goals are to minimize both the storage requirement at each blockchain node and the communication overhead for each new joining node, subject to a target decoding failure probability. We evaluate the proposed scheme in the context of real-world Bitcoin blockchain and show that both storage and communication overhead are reduced by 99.6\\% with a maximum $10^{-12}$ decoding failure probability.

    "title": "Automated Spatio-Temporal Graph Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Among various region embedding methods, graph-based region relation learning models stand out, owing to their strong structure representation ability for encoding spatial correlations with graph neural networks. Despite their effectiveness, several key challenges have not been well addressed in existing methods: i) Data noise and missing are ubiquitous in many spatio-temporal scenarios due to a variety of factors. ii) Input spatio-temporal data (e.g., mobility traces) usually exhibits distribution heterogeneity across space and time. In such cases, current methods are vulnerable to the quality of the generated region graphs, which may lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges by exploring the Automated Spatio-Temporal graph contrastive learning paradigm (AutoST) over the heterogeneous region graph generated from multi-view data sources. Our \\model\\ framework is built upon a heterogeneous graph neural architecture to capture the multi-view region dependencies with respect to POI semantics, mobility flow patterns and geographical positions. To improve the robustness of our GNN encoder against data noise and distribution issues, we design an automated spatio-temporal augmentation scheme with a parameterized contrastive view generator. AutoST can adapt to the spatio-temporal heterogeneous graph with multi-view semantics well preserved. Extensive experiments for three downstream spatio-temporal mining tasks on several real-world datasets demonstrate the significant performance gain achieved by our \\model\\ over a variety of baselines.

    "abstract": "Data sparsity is an important issue for click-through rate (CTR) prediction, particularly when user-item interactions is too sparse to learn a reliable model. Recently, many works on cross-domain CTR (CDCTR) prediction have been developed in an effort to leverage meaningful data from a related domain. However, most existing CDCTR works have an impractical limitation that requires homogeneous inputs (\\textit{i.e.} shared feature fields) across domains, and CDCTR with heterogeneous inputs (\\textit{i.e.} varying feature fields) across domains has not been widely explored but is an urgent and important research problem. In this work, we propose a cross-domain augmentation network (CDAnet) being able to perform knowledge transfer between two domains with \\textit{heterogeneous inputs}. Specifically, CDAnet contains a designed translation network and an augmentation network which are trained sequentially. The translation network is able to compute features from two domains with heterogeneous inputs separately by designing two independent branches, and then learn meaningful cross-domain knowledge using a designed cross-supervised feature translator. Later the augmentation network encodes the learned cross-domain knowledge via feature translation performed in the latent space and fine-tune the model for final CTR prediction. Through extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and one industrial production dataset, we show CDAnet can learn meaningful translated features and largely improve the performance of CTR prediction. CDAnet has been conducted online A/B test in image2product retrieval at Taobao app over 20days, bringing an absolute \\textbf{0.11 point} CTR improvement and a relative \\textbf{1.32\\%} GMV increase.

    "abstract": "The increasing popularity of deep learning (DL) models and the advantages of computing, including low latency and bandwidth savings on smartphones, have led to the emergence of intelligent mobile applications, also known as DL apps, in recent years. However, this technological development has also given rise to several security concerns, including adversarial examples, model stealing, and data poisoning issues. Existing works on attacks and countermeasures for on-device DL models have primarily focused on the models themselves. However, scant attention has been paid to the impact of data processing disturbance on the model inference. This knowledge disparity highlights the need for additional research to fully comprehend and address security issues related to data processing for on-device models. In this paper, we introduce a data processing-based attacks against real-world DL apps. In particular, our attack could influence the performance and latency of the model without affecting the operation of a DL app. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack, we carry out an empirical study on 517 real-world DL apps collected from Google Play. Among 320 apps utilizing MLkit, we find that 81.56\\% of them can be successfully attacked. The results emphasize the importance of DL app developers being aware of and taking actions to secure on-device models from the perspective of data processing. ",

    "abstract": "Question answering methods are well-known for leveraging data bias, such as the language prior in visual question answering and the position bias in machine reading comprehension (extractive question answering). Current debiasing methods often come at the cost of significant in-distribution performance to achieve favorable out-of-distribution generalizability, while non-debiasing methods sacrifice a considerable amount of out-of-distribution performance in order to obtain high in-distribution performance. Therefore, it is challenging for them to deal with the complicated changing real-world situations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective novel loss function with adaptive loose optimization, which seeks to make the best of both worlds for question answering. Our main technical contribution is to reduce the loss adaptively according to the ratio between the previous and current optimization state on mini-batch training data. This loose optimization can be used to prevent non-debiasing methods from overlearning data bias while enabling debiasing methods to maintain slight bias learning. Experiments on the visual question answering datasets, including VQA v2, VQA-CP v1, VQA-CP v2, GQA-OOD, and the extractive question answering dataset SQuAD demonstrate that our approach enables QA methods to obtain state-of-the-art in- and out-of-distribution performance in most cases.

The sense labels for each discourse relation follow a hierarchical classification scheme in the annotation process (Prasad et al., 2008), forming a hierarchy structure. Most existing works do not well incorporate the hierarchy structure but focus on the syntax features and the prior knowledge of connectives in the manner of pure text classification. We argue that it is more effective to predict the paths inside the hierarchical tree (e.g., \"Comparison -> Contrast -> however\") rather than flat labels (e.g., Contrast) or connectives (e.g., however). We propose a prompt-based path prediction method to utilize the interactive information and intrinsic senses among the hierarchy in IDRR. This is the first work that injects such structure information into pre-trained language models via prompt tuning, and the performance of our solution shows significant and consistent improvement against competitive baselines.

We compare ANT with other mainstream models in the IIS and demonstrate that ANT can achieve comparable performance with much fewer decoding iterations. Furthermore, we show its great potential in various applications like latent interpolation and semi-supervised learning. ",

The open-source large-scale text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion, becomes prevalent as it can generate realistic artistic or facial images with personalization through fine-tuning on a limited number of new samples. However, this has raised privacy concerns as adversaries can acquire facial images online and fine-tune text-to-image models for malicious editing, leading to baseless scandals, defamation, and disruption to victims' lives. Prior research efforts have focused on deriving adversarial loss from conventional training processes for facial privacy protection through adversarial perturbations. However, existing algorithms face two issues: 1) they neglect the image-text fusion module, which is the vital module of text-to-image diffusion models, and 2) their defensive performance is unstable against different attacker prompts. In this paper, we propose the Adversarial Decoupling Augmentation Framework (ADAF), addressing these issues by targeting the image-text fusion module to enhance the defensive performance of facial privacy protection algorithms. ADAF introduces multi-level text-related augmentations for defense stability against various attacker prompts. Concretely, considering the vision, text, and common unit space, we propose Vision-Adversarial Loss, Prompt-Robust Augmentation, and Attention-Decoupling Loss. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ and VGGFace2 demonstrate ADAF's promising performance, surpassing existing algorithms. ",

However, both supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks cannot imitate humans well. Training RL models require online interactions with user simulators, while simulating complex human policy is hard. Performances of SL-based models are restricted because of the covariate shift problem. Specifically, a dialogue is a sequential decision-making process where slight differences in current utterances and actions will cause significant differences in subsequent utterances. Therefore, the generalize ability of SL models is restricted because statistical characteristics of training and testing dialogue data gradually become different. This study proposed an offline imitation learning model that learns policy from real dialogue datasets and does not require user simulators. It also utilizes state transition information, which alleviates the influence of the covariate shift problem. We introduced a regularization trick to make our model can be effectively optimized. We investigated the performance of our model on four independent public dialogue datasets. The experimental result showed that our model performed better in the action prediction task. ",

This study demonstrated that various dynamics, including periodic and chaotic dynamics, could be embedded into the pneumatic artificial muscle, with the entire bifurcation structure using the framework of physical reservoir computing. These results suggest that dynamics that are not presented in training data could be embedded by using this capability of bifurcation embeddment. This implies that it is possible to embed various qualitatively different patterns into pneumatic artificial muscle by learning specific patterns, without the need to design and learn all patterns required for the purpose. Thus, this study sheds new light on a novel pathway to simplify the robotic devices and training of the control by reducing the external pattern generators and the amount and types of training data for the control.

In recent years, novel centralized TE schemes have employed heuristic or machine-learning techniques to orchestrate resources in closed systems, such as datacenter networks. However, these schemes suffer long delivery delay and high control overhead when applied to general WANs. Semi-centralized TE schemes have been proposed to address these drawbacks, providing lower delay and control overhead. Despite this, they suffer performance degradation dealing with volatile traffic. To provide low-delay service and keep high network utility, we propose an asynchronous multi-class traffic management scheme, AMTM. We first establish an asynchronous TE paradigm, in which distributed nodes instantly make traffic control decisions based on link prices. To manage varying traffic and control delivery time, we propose state-based iteration strategies of link pricing under different scenarios and investigate their convergence. Furthermore, we present a system design and corresponding algorithms. Simulation results indicate that AMTM outperforms existing schemes in terms of both delay reduction and scalability improvement. In addition, AMTM outperforms the semi-centralized scheme with 12-20$\\%$ more network utility and achieves 2-7$\\%$ less network utility compared to the theoretical optimum. ",

Instead of reconstructing the adversaries, RPD injects safe perturbations into adversarial examples to distract the objective models from the malicious perturbations. Our experiments on three datasets, two objective models, and various adversarial attacks show that our proposed framework successfully repairs up to approximately 97% of correctly identified adversarial examples with only about a 2% performance decrease on natural examples.

In this study, we offer detailed analysis and a novel perspective on understanding the gradient leakage problem. These theoretical works lead to a new gradient leakage defense technique that secures arbitrary model architectures using a private key-lock module. Only the locked gradient is transmitted to the parameter server for global model aggregation. Our proposed learning method is resistant to gradient leakage attacks, and the key-lock module is designed and trained to ensure that, without the private information of the key-lock module: a) reconstructing private training data from the shared gradient is infeasible; and b) the global model's inference performance is significantly compromised. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of why gradients can leak private information and provide theoretical proof of our method's effectiveness. We conducted extensive empirical evaluations with a total of forty-four models on several popular benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach in both maintaining model performance and defending against gradient leakage attacks.

    "title": "On the Usage of Continual Learning for Out-of-Distribution  Generalization in Pre-trained Language Models of Code",
    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have become a prevalent technique in deep learning for code, utilizing a two-stage pre-training and fine-tuning procedure to acquire general knowledge about code and specialize in a variety of downstream tasks. However, the dynamic nature of software codebases poses a challenge to the effectiveness and robustness of PLMs. In particular, world-realistic scenarios potentially lead to significant differences between the distribution of the pre-training and test data, i.e., distribution shift, resulting in a degradation of the PLM's performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we stress the need for adapting PLMs of code to software data whose distribution changes over time, a crucial problem that has been overlooked in previous works. The motivation of this work is to consider the PLM in a non-stationary environment, where fine-tuning data evolves over time according to a software evolution scenario. Specifically, we design a scenario where the model needs to learn from a stream of programs containing new, unseen APIs over time. We study two widely used PLM architectures, i.e., a GPT2 decoder and a RoBERTa encoder, on two downstream tasks, API call and API usage prediction. We demonstrate that the most commonly used fine-tuning technique from prior work is not robust enough to handle the dynamic nature of APIs, leading to the loss of previously acquired knowledge i.e., catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we implement five continual learning approaches, including replay-based and regularization-based methods. Our findings demonstrate that utilizing these straightforward methods effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in PLMs across both downstream tasks while achieving comparable or superior performance.

We show that this direct integration approach can give comparable results to conventional topology optimization techniques, with an added advantage of enabling seamless integration with post-processing software, and a potential of topology optimization with objectives where meshing and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) may be expensive or not suitable. Our approach (DMF-TONN) takes in as inputs the boundary conditions and domain coordinates and finds the optimum density field for minimizing the loss function of compliance and volume fraction constraint violation. The mesh-free nature is enabled by a physics-informed displacement field approximation neural network to solve the linear elasticity partial differential equation and replace the FEA conventionally used for calculating the compliance. We show that using a suitable Fourier Features neural network architecture and hyperparameters, the density field approximation neural network can learn the weights to represent the optimal density field for the given domain and boundary conditions, by directly backpropagating the loss gradient through the displacement field approximation neural network, and unlike prior work there is no requirement of a sensitivity filter, optimality criterion method, or a separate training of density network in each topology optimization iteration.

However, they need to be more scalable for generating large graphs containing thousands of nodes desiring graph statistics. In this work, we propose EDGE, a new diffusion-based generative graph model that addresses generative tasks with large graphs. To improve computation efficiency, we encourage graph sparsity by using a discrete diffusion process that randomly removes edges at each time step and finally obtains an empty graph. EDGE only focuses on a portion of nodes in the graph at each denoising step. It makes much fewer edge predictions than previous diffusion-based models. Moreover, EDGE admits explicitly modeling the node degrees of the graphs, further improving the model performance. The empirical study shows that EDGE is much more efficient than competing methods and can generate large graphs with thousands of nodes. It also outperforms baseline models in generation quality: graphs generated by our approach have more similar graph statistics to those of the training graphs. ",

Several recent works have extended the computational capabilities of digital PIM architectures towards the full-precision (single-precision floating-point) acceleration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs); yet, they lack a comprehensive comparison to GPUs. In this paper, we examine the potential of digital PIM for CNN acceleration through an updated quantitative comparison with GPUs, supplemented with an analysis of the overall limitations of digital PIM. We begin by investigating the different PIM architectures from a theoretical perspective to understand the underlying performance limitations and improvements compared to state-of-the-art hardware. We then uncover the tradeoffs between the different strategies through a series of benchmarks ranging from memory-bound vectored arithmetic to CNN acceleration. We conclude with insights into the general performance of digital PIM architectures for different data-intensive applications. ",

By utilizing a regularization loss, our methods efficiently inject backdoors into a large-scale text-to-image diffusion model while preserving its utility with benign inputs. We conduct empirical experiments on Stable Diffusion, the widely-used text-to-image diffusion model, demonstrating that the large-scale diffusion model can be easily backdoored within a few fine-tuning steps. We conduct additional experiments to explore the impact of different types of textual triggers. Besides, we discuss the backdoor persistence during further training, the findings of which provide insights for the development of backdoor defense methods. ",

However, the computing interruption issue caused by frequent edge network handoffs, and a severe shortage of computing resources are two problems in providing IoV services. High altitude platform station (HAPS) computing can be a promising addition to existing distributed computing frameworks because of its wide coverage and strong computational capabilities. In this regard, this paper proposes an adaptive scheme in a new distributed computing framework that involves HAPS computing to deal with the two problems of the IoV. Based on the diverse demands of vehicles, network dynamics, and the time-sensitivity of handoffs, the proposed scheme flexibly divides each task into three parts and assigns them to the vehicle, roadside units (RSUs), and a HAPS to perform synchronous computing. The scheme also constrains the computing of tasks at RSUs such that they are completed before handoffs to avoid the risk of computing interruptions. On this basis, we formulate a delay minimization problem that considers task-splitting ratio, transmit power, bandwidth allocation, and computing resource allocation. To solve the problem, variable replacement and successive convex approximation-based method are proposed. The simulation results show that this scheme not only avoids the negative effects caused by handoffs in a flexible manner, it also takes delay performance into account and maintains the delay stability.

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) now focuses on automatically finding the best CNN architecture to handle the above tasks. However, the verification of a searched architecture is very time-consuming and makes predictor-based methods become an essential and important branch of NAS. Two commonly used techniques to build predictors are graph-convolution networks (GCN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). In this paper, we consider the difference between GCN and MLP on adjacent operation trails and then propose the Redirected Adjacent Trails NAS (RATs-NAS) to quickly search for the desired neural network architecture. The RATs-NAS consists of two components: the Redirected Adjacent Trails GCN (RATs-GCN) and the Predictor-based Search Space Sampling (P3S) module. RATs-GCN can change trails and their strengths to search for a better neural network architecture. DSS can rapidly focus on tighter intervals of FLOPs in the search space. Based on our observations on cell-based NAS, we believe that architectures with similar FLOPs will perform similarly.

Our main idea is to generate extra training samples with specific labels near category boundaries, and the sample generation is biased toward the less-represented categories. To achieve controllable image generation, we seek to separate structural and categorical information of images based on structural similarity, categorical similarity, and reconstruction constraints. We evaluate the effectiveness of our new CIG approach in three different image ordinal regression scenarios. The results demonstrate that CIG can be flexibly integrated with off-the-shelf image encoders or ordinal regression models to achieve improvement, and further, the improvement is more significant for minority categories.

Particularly, a set of causal front-door intervention operations is introduced to explicitly find the visual causal scenes at both segment and frame levels. Our VCSR involves two essential modules: i) the Question-Guided Refiner (QGR) module, which refines consecutive video frames guided by the question semantics to obtain more representative segment features for causal front-door intervention; ii) the Causal Scene Separator (CSS) module, which discovers a collection of visual causal and non-causal scenes based on the visual-linguistic causal relevance and estimates the causal effect of the scene-separating intervention in a contrastive learning manner.

Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural network (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order correlations that already exist between nodes in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose to represent AST as a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) and process the graph by heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs.

To address this issue, we propose Recovery Feature Resolution Network (RFRNet), which enables the transformer to contribute with fine-grained spatial information and rich semantic correspondences. Furthermore, shifted window partitioning operations are inflexible, indicating that they cannot perceive the semantic information over uncertain distances and automatically bridge the global connections between windows. Therefore, we present a Weighted Window Attention (WWA) to automatically build global interactions between windows after the regular and cyclic shifted window partitioning operations for Swin transformer blocks. The proposed unsupervised deformable image registration model, named RFR-WWANet, senses the long-range correlations, thereby facilitating meaningful semantic relevance of anatomical structures. Qualitative and quantitative results show that RFR-WWANet achieves significant performance improvements over baseline methods.

    "abstract": "LASSO regularization is a popular regression tool to enhance the prediction accuracy of statistical models by performing variable selection through the $\\ell_1$ penalty, initially formulated for the linear model and its variants. In this paper, the territory of LASSO is extended to two-layer ReLU neural networks, a fashionable and powerful nonlinear regression model. Specifically, given a neural network whose output $y$ depends only on a small subset of input $\\boldsymbol{x}$, denoted by $\\mathcal{S}^{\\star}$, we prove that the LASSO estimator can stably reconstruct the neural network and identify $\\mathcal{S}^{\\star}$ when the number of samples scales logarithmically with the input dimension. This challenging regime has been well understood for linear models while barely studied for neural networks. Our theory lies in an extended Restricted Isometry Property (RIP)-based analysis framework for two-layer ReLU neural networks, which may be of independent interest to other LASSO or neural network settings. Based on the result, we advocate a neural network-based variable selection method. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets show promising performance of the variable selection approach compared with existing techniques. ",

Instead of calculating a single radiance field, we propose a multi-space neural radiance field (MS-NeRF) that represents the scene using a group of feature fields in parallel sub-spaces, which leads to a better understanding of the neural network toward the existence of reflective and refractive objects. Our multi-space scheme works as an enhancement to existing NeRF methods, with only small computational overheads needed for training and inferring the extra-space outputs. We demonstrate the superiority and compatibility of our approach using three representative NeRF-based models, i.e., NeRF, Mip-NeRF, and Mip-NeRF 360. Comparisons are performed on a novelly constructed dataset consisting of 25 synthetic scenes and 7 real captured scenes with complex reflection and refraction, all having 360-degree viewpoints. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms the existing single-space NeRF methods for rendering high-quality scenes concerned with complex light paths through mirror-like objects.

We also introduce two quantitative metrics for query prioritization to select the queries from multiple candidates, yielding desired queries for code search.

This study presents a new attempt to tackle the transit disruption mitigation problem in a comprehensive and hierarchical way. A network level strategy selection optimization model is formulated as a joint routing and resource allocation (nJRRA) problem. By constraining the problem further into an epsilon-constrained nJRRA problem, classic solution algorithms can be applied to solve the quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). On top of this \"basic model\", we propose adding a decision to delay the resource allocation decisions up to a maximum initiation time when the incident duration is stochastic. To test the models, a quasi-dynamic evaluation program with a given incident duration distribution is constructed using discretized time steps and discrete distributions. Five different demand patterns and four different disruption duration distributions (20 combinations) are tested on a toy transit network. The results show that the two models outperform benchmark strategies such as using only line level adjustment or only bus bridging. They also highlight conditions when delaying the decision is preferred. ",

As opposed to recent works, most of which first adopt holistic or pixel-level dense regression to obtain relative 3D hand pose and then follow with complex second-stage operations for 3D global root or scale recovery, we propose a novel unified 3D dense regression scheme to estimate camera-space 3D hand pose via dense 3D point-wise voting in camera frustum. Through direct dense modeling in 3D domain inspired by Pixel-aligned Implicit Functions for 3D detailed reconstruction, our proposed Neural Voting Field (NVF) fully models 3D dense local evidence and hand global geometry, helping to alleviate common 2D-to-3D ambiguities. Specifically, for a 3D query point in camera frustum and its pixel-aligned image feature, NVF, represented by a Multi-Layer Perceptron, regresses: (i) its signed distance to the hand surface; (ii) a set of 4D offset vectors (1D voting weight and 3D directional vector to each hand joint). Following a vote-casting scheme, 4D offset vectors from near-surface points are selected to calculate the 3D hand joint coordinates by a weighted average. Experiments demonstrate that NVF outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on FreiHAND dataset for camera-space 3D hand pose estimation. We also adapt NVF to the classic task of root-relative 3D hand pose estimation, for which NVF also obtains state-of-the-art results on HO3D dataset. ",

Though such systems have achieved impressive results across a variety of datasets and domains, recent works have called into question whether they are ultimately limited in their ability to compositionally generalize. In this work, we approach semantic parsing from, quite literally, the opposite direction; that is, we introduce a neural semantic parsing generation method that constructs logical forms from the bottom up, beginning from the logical form's leaves. The system we introduce is lazy in that it incrementally builds up a set of potential semantic parses, but only expands and processes the most promising candidate parses at each generation step. Such a parsimonious expansion scheme allows the system to maintain an arbitrarily large set of parse hypotheses that are never realized and thus incur minimal computational overhead. We evaluate our approach on compositional generalization; specifically, on the challenging CFQ dataset and three Text-to-SQL datasets where we show that our novel, bottom-up semantic parsing technique outperforms general-purpose semantic parsers while also being competitive with comparable neural parsers that have been designed for each task.

Models and variables can represent a system at different levels of abstraction, whereby relations may be coarsened and refined according to the need of a modeller.

In this paper we introduce a family of interventional measures that an agent may use to evaluate such a trade-off. We consider four measures suited for different tasks, analyze their properties, and propose algorithms to evaluate and learn causal abstractions.

    "abstract": "We identify a subtle security issue that impacts the design of smart contracts caused by the fact that agents may themselves deploy smart contracts. Typically, equilibria of games are analyzed in vitro, under the assumption that players cannot arbitrarily commit to strategies. However, equilibria obtained in this fashion do not hold in general in vivo, when games are deployed on a blockchain. Being able to deploy side contracts changes fundamental game-theoretic assumptions by inducing a meta-game, specifically a Stackelberg game with multiple commitments, wherein agents strategize to deploy the best contracts. Not taking these commitment capabilities into account thus fails to capture an important aspect of deploying smart contracts in practice. A game that remains secure when the agents can deploy contracts is said to be Stackelberg resilient. We show that Stackelberg resilience can be computed efficiently for any two-player game of perfect information and show that it is hard to compute in general. We show that if a game is Stackelberg $k$-resilient, that is, resilient when there are $k$ contracts, it is also resilient when there are fewer contracts. We demonstrate the non-triviality of side contract resilience by analyzing two smart contracts for decentralized commerce from the literature. These contracts have the same intended functionality, but we show that only one is Stackelberg resilient. Our work highlights an issue that is necessary to address to ensure the secure deployment of smart contracts and suggests that other contracts already deployed on major blockchains may be susceptible to these attacks.

ReLU activation function is used by many deep learning researchers for its computational efficiency, ease of implementation, intuitive nature, etc. However, it suffers from a dying gradient problem. For instance, when the input is negative, its output is always zero because its gradient is zero. A number of researchers used different approaches to solve this issue. Some of the most notable are LeakyReLU, Softplus, Softsign, Elu, ThresholdedReLU, etc. This research developed TaLU, a modified activation function combining Tanh and ReLU, which mitigates the dying gradient problem of ReLU. The deep learning model with the proposed activation function was tested on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and it outperforms ReLU and some other studied activation functions in terms of accuracy(from 0\\% upto 6\\% in most cases, when used with Batch Normalization and a reasonable learning rate).

However, studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, where imperceptible perturbations can greatly mislead DNNs even if the full underlying model parameters are not accessible. Various defense methods have been proposed, such as feature compression and gradient masking. However, numerous studies have proven that previous methods create detection or defense against certain attacks, which renders the method ineffective in the face of the latest unknown attack methods. The invisibility of adversarial perturbations is one of the evaluation indicators for adversarial example attacks, which also means that the difference in the local correlation of high-frequency information in adversarial examples and normal examples can be used as an effective feature to distinguish the two. Therefore, we propose an adversarial example detection framework based on a high-frequency information enhancement strategy, which can effectively extract and amplify the feature differences between adversarial examples and normal examples. Experimental results show that the feature augmentation module can be combined with existing detection models in a modular way under this framework. Improve the detector's performance and reduce the deployment cost without modifying the existing detection model. ",

Then, supervised by the proposed spatial-temporal-aware, velocity-aware and global-smoothness-aware losses, FreqMRN iteratively refines the predicted motion though the proposed motion refinement module, which converts motion representations back and forth between pose space and frequency space. We evaluate FreqMRN on several standard benchmark datasets, including Human3.6M, AMASS and 3DPW. Experimental results demonstrate that FreqMRN outperforms previous methods by large margins for both short-term and long-term predictions, while demonstrating superior robustness. ",

The proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm is fully distributed, and does not require the presence of a centralized entity to achieve coordination among the microgrids. We present detailed numerical results on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and examine convergence behavior of the distributed algorithm for different choice of hyper-parameters.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new problem in unsupervised domain adaptation, termed as Generalized Universal Domain Adaptation (GUDA), which aims to achieve precise prediction of all target labels including unknown categories. GUDA bridges the gap between label distribution shift-based and label space mismatch-based variants, essentially categorizing them as a unified problem, guiding to a comprehensive framework for thoroughly solving all the variants. The key challenge of GUDA is developing and identifying novel target categories while estimating the target label distribution. To address this problem, we take advantage of the powerful exploration capability of generative flow networks and propose an active domain adaptation algorithm named GFlowDA, which selects diverse samples with probabilities proportional to a reward function. To enhance the exploration capability and effectively perceive the target label distribution, we tailor the states and rewards, and introduce an efficient solution for parent exploration and state transition. We also propose a training paradigm for GUDA called Generalized Universal Adversarial Network (GUAN), which involves collaborative optimization between GUAN and GFlowNet. Theoretical analysis highlights the importance of exploration, and extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GFlowDA. ",

To perceive abnormalities in such data, it is crucial to understand the temporal context and interrelation between variables simultaneously. The anomaly detection task for time series, especially for unlabeled data, has been a challenging problem, and we address it by applying a suitable data degradation scheme to self-supervised model training. We define four types of synthetic outliers and propose the degradation scheme in which a portion of input data is replaced with one of the synthetic outliers. Inspired by the self-attention mechanism, we design a Transformer-based architecture to recognize the temporal context and detect unnatural sequences with high efficiency. Our model converts multivariate data points into temporal representations with relative position bias and yields anomaly scores from these representations. Our method, AnomalyBERT, shows a great capability of detecting anomalies contained in complex time series and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods on five real-world benchmarks.

The paradigm involves pretraining the model on search-irrelevant tasks such as masked language modeling, followed by the finetuning stage, which focuses on the search-relevant task. The typical finetuning method is to employ a dual-encoder architecture to encode semantic embeddings of query and code separately, and then calculate their similarity based on the embeddings. However, the typical dual-encoder architecture falls short in modeling token-level interactions between query and code, which limits the model's capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this limitation, introducing a cross-encoder architecture for code search that jointly encodes the semantic matching of query and code. We further introduce a Retriever-Ranker (RR) framework that cascades the dual-encoder and cross-encoder to promote the efficiency of evaluation and online serving. Moreover, we present a probabilistic hard negative sampling method to improve the cross-encoder's ability to distinguish hard negative codes, which further enhances the cascade RR framework.

In this work, we present a sharpness-minimizing network transformation (SNT) method applied during pretraining that can create models with desirable compressibility and generalizability features. We compare our approach to a well-known sharpness-minimizing optimizer to validate its efficacy in creating a flat loss landscape. To the best of our knowledge, SNT is the first pretraining method that uses an architectural transformation to generate compression-friendly networks. We find that SNT generalizes across different compression tasks and network backbones, delivering consistent improvements over the ADAM baseline with up to 2% accuracy improvement on weight pruning and 5.4% accuracy improvement on quantization.

Specifically, LMPT introduces the embedding loss function with class-aware soft margin and re-weighting to learn class-specific contexts with the benefit of textual descriptions (captions), which could help establish semantic relationships between classes, especially between the head and tail classes. Furthermore, taking into account the class imbalance, the distribution-balanced loss is adopted as the classification loss function to further improve the performance on the tail classes without compromising head classes.

With a layer of Optical Circuit Switches (OCSes), hybrid optical-electrical DCNs can reconfigure its logical topologies to better match the on-going traffic patterns, but the reconfiguration time may directly affect the benefits of reconfigurability. The reconfiguration time consists of the topology solver running time and the network convergence time after triggering reconfiguration. However, existing topology solvers either incur high algorithmic complexity or fail to minimize the reconfiguration overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the ideas of bipartition and Minimum Cost Flow (MCF) to reduce the overall reconfiguration time. For the first time, we formulate the topology solving problem as a MCF problem with piecewise-linear cost, which strikes a better balance between solver complexity and solution optimality. Our evaluation shows that our algorithm can significantly reduce the network convergence time while consuming less topology solver running time, making its overall performance superior to existing algorithms.

This paper investigates AT from the perspective of the contextualized language representation outputted by PLM encoders. We find the current AT attacks lean to generate sub-optimal adversarial examples that can fool the decoder part but have a minor effect on the encoder. However, we find it necessary to effectively deviate the latter one to allow AT to gain. Based on the observation, we propose simple yet effective \\textit{Contextualized representation-Adversarial Training} (CreAT), in which the attack is explicitly optimized to deviate the contextualized representation of the encoder. It allows a global optimization of adversarial examples that can fool the entire model. We also find CreAT gives rise to a better direction to optimize the adversarial examples, to let them less sensitive to hyperparameters. Compared to AT, CreAT produces consistent performance gains on a wider range of tasks and is proven to be more effective for language pre-training where only the encoder part is kept for downstream tasks. We achieve the new state-of-the-art performances on a series of challenging benchmarks, e.g. AdvGLUE (59.1 $ \\rightarrow $ 61.1), HellaSWAG (93.0 $ \\rightarrow $ 94.9), ANLI (68.1 $ \\rightarrow $ 69.3).

The need for real-time air quality monitoring has become increasingly important, given the rise in pollutant emissions due to urbanization and its adverse effects on human health. The proposed methodology involves solving the linear advection-diffusion problem, where the solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations gives the convective field. At the same time, the source term consists of an empirical time series. However, the computational requirements of this approach, including microscale spatial resolution, repeated evaluation, and low time scale, necessitate the use of high-performance computing facilities, which can be a bottleneck for real-time monitoring. To address this challenge, a problem-specific methodology was developed that leverages a data-driven approach based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition with regression (POD-R) coupled with Galerkin projection (POD-G) endorsed with the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The proposed method employs a feedforward neural network to non-intrusively retrieve the reduced-order convective operator required for online evaluation. The numerical framework was validated on synthetic emissions and real wind measurements. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the computational burden of the traditional approach and is suitable for real-time air quality monitoring. Overall, the study advances the field of reduced order modeling and highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in environmental modeling and large-scale simulations. ",

This allows network operators and regulators to forecast the likely decision to be made by the household customer to choose one heating technology that minimizes a cost function subject to various constraints while ensuring robustness against the uncertainty in energy prices. The results show that the expansion of the district heating infrastructure results in the lowest total economic costs in most cases and cells. The results also show that an increase in the size of the uncertainty sets causes an increase in the total economic costs of heating. The paper concludes with a discussion of future directions to expand this approach to model more uncertain parameters. ",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts manage blockchain assets. While smart contracts embody business processes, their platforms are not process-aware. Mainstream smart contract programming languages such as Solidity do not have explicit notions of roles, action dependencies, and time. Instead, these concepts are implemented in program code. This makes it very hard to design and analyze smart contracts. We argue that DCR graphs are a suitable formalization tool for smart contracts because they explicitly and visually capture these features. We utilize this expressiveness to show that many common high-level design patterns in smart-contract applications can be naturally modeled this way. Applying these patterns shows that DCR graphs facilitate the development and analysis of correct and reliable smart contracts by providing a clear and easy-to-understand specification. ",

We first derive association probabilities that reflect how likely the typical user-equipment is served by a gNB or an IAB-node based on the maximum long-term averaged biased-received-desired-signal power criteria. Further, by leveraging the composite Gamma-Lognormal distribution, we derive the closed-form signal to interference plus noise ratio coverage, capacity with outage, and ergodic capacity of the network. In order to avoid underestimating the noise, we consider the sidelobe gain on inter-cell interference links and the analog to digital converter quantization noise. Compared with the half-duplex transmission, numerical results show an enhanced capacity with outage and ergodic capacity provided by IBFD under successful self-interference cancellation. We also study how the power bias and density ratio of the IAB-node to gNB, and the hard-core distance can affect system performances. ",

    "abstract": "While some powerful neural network architectures (e.g., Transformer, Graph Neural Networks) have achieved improved performance in sequential recommendation with high-order item dependency modeling, they may suffer from poor representation capability in label scarcity scenarios. To address the issue of insufficient labels, Contrastive Learning (CL) has attracted much attention in recent methods to perform data augmentation through embedding contrasting for self-supervision. However, due to the hand-crafted property of their contrastive view generation strategies, existing CL-enhanced models i) can hardly yield consistent performance on diverse sequential recommendation tasks; ii) may not be immune to user behavior data noise. In light of this, we propose a simple yet effective graph masked autoencoder that adaptively and dynamically distills global item transitional information for self-supervised augmentation. It naturally avoids the above issue of heavy reliance on constructing high-quality embedding contrastive views. Instead, an adaptive data reconstruction paradigm is designed to be integrated with the long-range item dependency modeling, for informative augmentation in sequential recommendation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models and can learn more accurate representations against data noise and sparsity.

This strategy, often called federated learning, is mainly employed for two reasons: (i) improving resource-efficiency by avoiding to share potentially large datasets and (ii) guaranteeing privacy of local agents' data. Efficiency can be further increased by adopting a beyond-5G communication strategy that goes under the name of Over-the-Air Computation. This strategy exploits the interference property of the wireless channel. Standard communication schemes prevent interference by enabling transmissions of signals from different agents at distinct time or frequency slots, which is not required with Over-the-Air Computation, thus saving resources. In this case, the received signal is a weighted sum of transmitted signals, with unknown weights (fading channel coefficients). State of the art papers in the field aim at reconstructing those unknown coefficients. In contrast, the approach presented here does not require reconstructing channel coefficients by complex encoding-decoding schemes. This improves both efficiency and privacy. ",

Considering Bernoulli random variables and for causal graphs on $N$ vertices with constant in-degree, prior work has achieved a worst case guarantee of $\\widetilde{O} (N/\\sqrt{T})$ for simple regret. The current work utilizes the idea of covering interventions (which are not necessarily contained within ${A}$) and establishes a simple regret guarantee of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{N/T})$. Notably, and in contrast to prior work, our simple regret bound depends only on explicit parameters of the problem instance.

    "abstract": "An autonomous service robot should be able to interact with its environment safely and robustly without requiring human assistance. Unstructured environments are challenging for robots since the exact prediction of outcomes is not always possible. Even when the robot behaviors are well-designed, the unpredictable nature of physical robot-object interaction may prevent success in object manipulation. Therefore, execution of a manipulation action may result in an undesirable outcome involving accidents or damages to the objects or environment. Situation awareness becomes important in such cases to enable the robot to (i) maintain the integrity of both itself and the environment, (ii) recover from failed tasks in the short term, and (iii) learn to avoid failures in the long term. For this purpose, robot executions should be continuously monitored, and failures should be detected and classified appropriately. In this work, we focus on detecting and classifying both manipulation and post-manipulation phase failures using the same exteroception setup. We cover a diverse set of failure types for primary tabletop manipulation actions. In order to detect these failures, we propose FINO-Net [1], a deep multimodal sensor fusion based classifier network. Proposed network accurately detects and classifies failures from raw sensory data without any prior knowledge. In this work, we use our extended FAILURE dataset [1] with 99 new multimodal manipulation recordings and annotate them with their corresponding failure types. FINO-Net achieves 0.87 failure detection and 0.80 failure classification F1 scores. Experimental results show that proposed architecture is also appropriate for real-time use. ",

However, the underlying community semantics has not been well explored by most previous GCL methods. Research that attempts to leverage communities in GCL regards them as having the same influence on the graph, leading to extra representation errors. To tackle this issue, we define ''community strength'' to measure the difference of influence among communities. Under this premise, we propose a Community-Strength-enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning (CSGCL) framework to preserve community strength throughout the learning process. Firstly, we present two novel graph augmentation methods, Communal Attribute Voting (CAV) and Communal Edge Dropping (CED), where the perturbations of node attributes and edges are guided by community strength. Secondly, we propose a dynamic ''Team-up'' contrastive learning scheme, where community strength is used to progressively fine-tune the contrastive objective. We report extensive experiment results on three downstream tasks: node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. CSGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other GCL methods, validating that community strength brings effectiveness and generality to graph representations.

In this paper, we implemented a system to predict and quantify the rotational slippage of objects in hand using the vision-based tactile sensor known as Digit. Our system comprises a neural network that obtains the segmented contact region (object-sensor), to later calculate the slippage rotation angle from this region using a thinning algorithm. Besides, we created our own tactile segmentation dataset, which is the first one in the literature as far as we are concerned, to train and evaluate our neural network, obtaining results of 95% and 91% in Dice and IoU metrics. In real-scenario experiments, our system is able to predict rotational slippage with a maximum mean rotational error of 3 degrees with previously unseen objects. Thus, our system can be used to prevent an object from falling due to its slippage. ",

Here, we introduce the Riesz network, a novel scale invariant neural network. Instead of standard 2d or 3d convolutions for combining spatial information, the Riesz network is based on the Riesz transform which is a scale equivariant operation. As a consequence, this network naturally generalizes to unseen or even arbitrary scales in a single forward pass. As an application example, we consider detecting and segmenting cracks in tomographic images of concrete. In this context, 'scale' refers to the crack thickness which may vary strongly even within the same sample. To prove its scale invariance, the Riesz network is trained on one fixed crack width. We then validate its performance in segmenting simulated and real tomographic images featuring a wide range of crack widths. An additional experiment is carried out on the MNIST Large Scale data set.

Recently, the transformer-based models have shown strong performance on various sequence modeling tasks, which rely on attention to capture pairwise token relations, and position embedding to inject positional information. While showing good performance, the transformer models are inefficient to scale to long input sequences, mainly due to the quadratic space-time complexity of attention. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose to model sequences with a relative position encoded Toeplitz matrix and use a Toeplitz matrix-vector production trick to reduce the space-time complexity of the sequence modeling to log linear. A lightweight sub-network called relative position encoder is proposed to generate relative position coefficients with a fixed budget of parameters, enabling the proposed Toeplitz neural network to deal with varying sequence lengths. In addition, despite being trained on 512-token sequences, our model can extrapolate input sequence length up to 14K tokens in inference with consistent performance. Extensive experiments on autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling, image modeling, and the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark show that our method achieves better performance than its competitors in most downstream tasks while being significantly faster.

Many interesting counting problems (e.g., subgraph and induced subgraph counts) are finite linear combinations $p(\\cdot)=\\sum_{H}\\alpha_{H}\\hom(H,\\cdot)$ of homomorphism counts, and such linear combinations are known to be hard to evaluate iff they contain a large-treewidth graph $S$. The hardness can be shown in two steps: First, the problems $\\hom(S,\\cdot)$ for colorful (i.e., bijectively colored) large-treewidth graphs $S$ are shown to be hard. In a second step, these problems are reduced to finite linear combinations of homomorphism counts that contain the uncolored version $S^{\\circ}$ of $S$. This step can be performed via inclusion-exclusion in $2^{|E(S)|}\\mathrm{poly}(n,s)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the input graph and $s$ is the maximum number of vertices among all graphs in the linear combination. We show that the second step can be performed even in time $4^{\\Delta(S)}\\mathrm{poly}(n,s)$, where $\\Delta(S)$ is the maximum degree of $S$. Our reduction is based on graph products with Cai-F\\\"urer-Immerman graphs, a novel technique that is likely of independent interest. For colorful graphs $S$ of constant maximum degree, this technique yields a polynomial-time reduction from $\\hom(S,\\cdot)$ to linear combinations of homomorphism counts involving $S^{\\circ}$. Under certain conditions, it actually suffices that a supergraph $T$ of $S^{\\circ}$ is contained in the target linear combination. The new reduction yields $\\mathsf{\\#P}$-hardness results for several counting problems that could previously be studied only under parameterized complexity assumptions. This includes the problems of counting, on input a graph from a restricted graph class and a general graph $G$, the homomorphisms or (induced) subgraph copies from $H$ in $G$. ",

    "abstract": "Decentralized learning enables the training of deep learning models over large distributed datasets generated at different locations, without the need for a central server. However, in practical scenarios, the data distribution across these devices can be significantly different, leading to a degradation in model performance. In this paper, we focus on designing a decentralized learning algorithm that is less susceptible to variations in data distribution across devices. We propose Global Update Tracking (GUT), a novel tracking-based method that aims to mitigate the impact of heterogeneous data in decentralized learning without introducing any communication overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique through an exhaustive set of experiments on various Computer Vision datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Fashion MNIST, and ImageNette), model architectures, and network topologies. Our experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for decentralized learning on heterogeneous data via a $1-6\\%$ improvement in test accuracy compared to other existing techniques.

    "abstract": "Flaky tests obstruct software development, and studying and proposing mitigations against them has therefore become an important focus of software engineering research. To conduct sound investigations on test flakiness, it is crucial to have large, diverse, and unbiased datasets of flaky tests. A common method to build such datasets is by rerunning the test suites of selected projects multiple times and checking for tests that produce different outcomes. While using this technique on a single project is mostly straightforward, applying it to a large and diverse set of projects raises several implementation challenges such as (1) isolating the test executions, (2) supporting multiple build mechanisms, (3) achieving feasible run times on large datasets, and (4) analyzing and presenting the test outcomes. To address these challenges we introduce FlaPy, a framework for researchers to mine flaky tests in a given or automatically sampled set of Python projects by rerunning their test suites. FlaPy isolates the test executions using containerization and fresh execution environments to simulate real-world CI conditions and to achieve accurate results. By supporting multiple dependency installation strategies, it promotes diversity among the studied projects. FlaPy supports parallelizing the test executions using SLURM, making it feasible to scan thousands of projects for test flakiness. Finally, FlaPy analyzes the test outcomes to determine which tests are flaky and depicts the results in a concise table. A demo video of FlaPy is available at https://youtu.be/ejy-be-FvDY ",

The primary extension of this algorithm as compared with standard forecast scoring is that it incorporates measures of both group consensus and question relevance directly into the reward distribution algorithm. Our model of the prediction competition includes parameters that control both the level of bias from prior beliefs and the influence of the reward incentive. The Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that, within the simplifying assumptions of the the model, experts collectively approach belief in objectively true facts, so long as reward influence is high and the bias stays below a critical threshold. The purpose of this work is to motivate further research into prediction reward algorithms that combine standard forecasting measures with factors like bias and consensus. ",

    "abstract": "Multimodal abstractive summarization for videos (MAS) requires generating a concise textual summary to describe the highlights of a video according to multimodal resources, in our case, the video content and its transcript. Inspired by the success of the large-scale generative pre-trained language model (GPLM) in generating high-quality textual content (e.g., summary), recent MAS methods have proposed to adapt the GPLM to this task by equipping it with the visual information, which is often obtained through a general-purpose visual feature extractor. However, the generally extracted visual features may overlook some summary-worthy visual information, which impedes model performance. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning the summary-worthy visual representation that facilitates abstractive summarization. Our method exploits the summary-worthy information from both the cross-modal transcript data and the knowledge that distills from the pseudo summary. Extensive experiments on three public multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms all competing baselines. Furthermore, with the advantages of summary-worthy visual information, our model can have a significant improvement on small datasets or even datasets with limited training data. ",

There have been some open datasets widely used in many studies. However, popular available datasets have some inherent limitations, including the noisy and inconsistent samples, and the limit number of training samples, and the limit number of data-sources. These limitations make these datasets unreliable to evaluate the model performance and cannot reflect the actual capacity of models. Therefore, in this paper, we revisit some open datasets with high quality of annotations, identify and clean the noise, and align the annotation definitions of these datasets to merge a larger dataset, termed with Open-Tables. Moreover, to enrich the data sources, we propose a new dataset, termed with ICT-TD, using the PDF files of Information and communication technologies (ICT) commodities which is a different domain containing unique samples that hardly appear in open datasets. To ensure the label quality of the dataset, we annotated the dataset manually following the guidance of a domain expert. The proposed dataset has a larger intra-variance and smaller inter-variance, making it more challenging and can be a sample of actual cases in the business context. We built strong baselines using various state-of-the-art object detection models and also built the baselines in the cross-domain setting. Our experimental results show that the domain difference among existing open datasets are small, even they have different data-sources. Our proposed Open-tables and ICT-TD are more suitable for the cross domain setting, and can provide more reliable evaluation for model because of their high quality and consistent annotations. ",

    "abstract": "Developing the next generation of household robot helpers requires combining locomotion and interaction capabilities, which is generally referred to as mobile manipulation (MoMa). MoMa tasks are difficult due to the large action space of the robot and the common multi-objective nature of the task, e.g., efficiently reaching a goal while avoiding obstacles. Current approaches often segregate tasks into navigation without manipulation and stationary manipulation without locomotion by manually matching parts of the action space to MoMa sub-objectives (e.g. base actions for locomotion objectives and arm actions for manipulation). This solution prevents simultaneous combinations of locomotion and interaction degrees of freedom and requires human domain knowledge for both partitioning the action space and matching the action parts to the sub-objectives. In this paper, we introduce Causal MoMa, a new framework to train policies for typical MoMa tasks that makes use of the most favorable subspace of the robot's action space to address each sub-objective. Causal MoMa automatically discovers the causal dependencies between actions and terms of the reward function and exploits these dependencies in a causal policy learning procedure that reduces gradient variance compared to previous state-of-the-art policy gradient algorithms, improving convergence and results. We evaluate the performance of Causal MoMa on three types of simulated robots across different MoMa tasks and demonstrate success in transferring the policies trained in simulation directly to a real robot, where our agent is able to follow moving goals and react to dynamic obstacles while simultaneously and synergistically controlling the whole-body: base, arm, and head.

Current deep learning based methods for sign language understanding (SLU) are prone to over-fitting due to insufficient sign data resource and suffer limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose the first self-supervised pre-trainable SignBERT+ framework with model-aware hand prior incorporated. In our framework, the hand pose is regarded as a visual token, which is derived from an off-the-shelf detector. Each visual token is embedded with gesture state and spatial-temporal position encoding. To take full advantage of current sign data resource, we first perform self-supervised learning to model its statistics. To this end, we design multi-level masked modeling strategies (joint, frame and clip) to mimic common failure detection cases. Jointly with these masked modeling strategies, we incorporate model-aware hand prior to better capture hierarchical context over the sequence. After the pre-training, we carefully design simple yet effective prediction heads for downstream tasks. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we perform extensive experiments on three main SLU tasks, involving isolated and continuous sign language recognition (SLR), and sign language translation (SLT). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving new state-of-the-art performance with a notable gain. ",

Other strategies hat consider the past and future in the encoder and decoder respectively limit themselves by dealing with the historical and future data separately. To address these limitations, a novel feature representation strategy -- shifting -- is proposed to fuse the past data and future covariates such that their interactions can be considered. To extract complex dynamics in time series, we develop a parallel deep learning framework composed of RNN and CNN, both of which are used hierarchically. We also utilize the skip connection technique to improve the model's performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets reveal the effectiveness of our method.

When a node forwards its packet to another node, the packet information gets mutated with probability $p$ during transmission, creating misinformation. The receiver node does not know whether an incoming packet information is different from the packet information originally at the sender node. We assume that truth prevails over misinformation, and therefore, when a receiver encounters both accurate information and misinformation corresponding to the same version, the accurate information gets chosen for storage at the node. We study the expected fraction of nodes with correct information in the network and version age at the nodes in this setting using stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) modelling and study their properties. We observe that very high or very low gossiping rates help curb misinformation, and misinformation spread is higher with moderate gossiping rates.

Methods: The proposed network addresses two common generalization issues that arise when using a pre-trained network to predict QSM from HPFP: a) data with unseen voxel sizes, and b) data with unknown high-pass filter parameters. A network fine-tuning step based on a high-pass filtering dipole convolution forward model is proposed to reduce the generalization error of the pre-trained network. A progressive Unet architecture is proposed to improve prediction accuracy without increasing fine-tuning computational cost. Results: In retrospective studies using RMSE, PSNR, SSIM and HFEN as quality metrics, the performance of both Unet and progressive Unet was improved after physics-based fine-tuning at all voxel sizes and most high-pass filtering cutoff frequencies tested in the experiment. Progressive Unet slightly outperformed Unet both before and after fine-tuning. In a prospective study, image sharpness was improved after physics-based fine-tuning for both Unet and progressive Unet. Compared to Unet, progressive Unet had better agreement of regional susceptibility values with reference QSM. Conclusion: The proposed method shows improved robustness compared to the pre-trained network without fine-tuning when the test dataset deviates from training.

The state-of-the-art algorithmic approaches following this simple formulation generally overlook misspecification of the elements of the inverse problem, such as the prior or the measurement uncertainties. This work presents an efficient algorithmic approach for designing optimal experimental design schemes for Bayesian inverse problems such that the optimal design is robust to misspecification of elements of the inverse problem. Specifically, we consider a worst-case scenario approach for the uncertain or misspecified parameters, formulate robust objectives, and propose an algorithmic approach for optimizing such objectives. Both relaxation and stochastic solution approaches are discussed with detailed analysis and insight into the interpretation of the problem and the proposed algorithmic approach. Extensive numerical experiments to validate and analyze the proposed approach are carried out for sensor placement in a parameter identification problem. ",

    "abstract": "Social systems are characterized by the presence of group interactions and by the existence of both trust and distrust relations. Although there is a wide literature on signed social networks, where positive signs associated to the links indicate trust, friendship, agreement, while negative signs represent distrust, antagonism, and disagreement, very little is known about the effect that signed interactions can have on the spreading of social behaviors when higher-order interactions are taken into account. In this paper we focus on processes of complex contagion, such as the adoption of social norms, where exposure to multiple sources is needed for the contagion to occur. Complex contagion has been recently modeled by higher-order networks, such as simplicial complexes, which allow transmission to happen not only through the links connecting pair of nodes, but also in group interactions, namely over simplices of dimension larger or equal than two. Here, we introduce a model of complex contagion on signed simplicial complexes, and we investigate the role played by trust and distrust on the dynamics of a social contagion process. The presence of higher-order signed structures in our model naturally induces new infection and recovery mechanisms. Through numerical simulations and analytical results in the mean-field approximation, we show how distrust determines the way the system moves from a state where no individuals adopt the social behavior, to a state where a finite fraction of the population actively spreads it. Interestingly, the fraction of spreading individuals displays a non-monotonic dependence on the average number of connections between individuals. We then investigate how social balance affects social contagion, finding that balanced triads either promote or impede contagion based on the relative abundance of fully trusted relations. ",

    "abstract": "A method to quantify robust performance for situations where structured parameter variations and initial state errors rather than extraneous disturbances are the main performance limiting factors is presented. The approach is based on the error dynamics, the difference between nominal and perturbed dynamics, driven by either the unperturbed or perturbed state, rather than an artificially imposed disturbance. The unperturbed versus perturbed dichotomy can be interpreted as the relative error dynamics scaled by either the unperturbed or perturbed dynamics. The error dynamics driven by unperturbed state has the unique feature of decoupling the effect of physically meaningful uncertainties from an additive disturbance. The perturbed case offers the possibility to side-step Structured Singular Value (SSV) computations. Applications to a lightly damped mechanical system and a slowly dephasing quantum system demonstrate the usefulness of the concepts across a broad range of systems. Finally, a fixed-point algorithm specifically developed for quantum systems with state transitions depending in a nonlinear fashion on uncertainties is proposed as the substitute for classical SSV.

    "abstract": "Segmentation of the coronary artery is an important task for the quantitative analysis of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images and is being stimulated by the field of deep learning. However, the complex structures with tiny and narrow branches of the coronary artery bring it a great challenge. Coupled with the medical image limitations of low resolution and poor contrast, fragmentations of segmented vessels frequently occur in the prediction. Therefore, a geometry-based cascaded segmentation method is proposed for the coronary artery, which has the following innovations: 1) Integrating geometric deformation networks, we design a cascaded network for segmenting the coronary artery and vectorizing results. The generated meshes of the coronary artery are continuous and accurate for twisted and sophisticated coronary artery structures, without fragmentations. 2) Different from mesh annotations generated by the traditional marching cube method from voxel-based labels, a finer vectorized mesh of the coronary artery is reconstructed with the regularized morphology. The novel mesh annotation benefits the geometry-based segmentation network, avoiding bifurcation adhesion and point cloud dispersion in intricate branches. 3) A dataset named CCA-200 is collected, consisting of 200 CCTA images with coronary artery disease. The ground truths of 200 cases are coronary internal diameter annotations by professional radiologists. Extensive experiments verify our method on our collected dataset CCA-200 and public ASOCA dataset, with a Dice of 0.778 on CCA-200 and 0.895 on ASOCA, showing superior results. Especially, our geometry-based model generates an accurate, intact and smooth coronary artery, devoid of any fragmentations of segmented vessels. ",

    "title": "Dual Residual Attention Network for Image Denoising",
    "abstract": "In image denoising, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can obtain favorable performance on removing spatially invariant noise. However, many of these networks cannot perform well on removing the real noise (i.e. spatially variant noise) generated during image acquisition or transmission, which severely sets back their application in practical image denoising tasks. Instead of continuously increasing the network depth, many researchers have revealed that expanding the width of networks can also be a useful way to improve model performance. It also has been verified that feature filtering can promote the learning ability of the models. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Dual-branch Residual Attention Network (DRANet) for image denoising, which has both the merits of a wide model architecture and attention-guided feature learning. The proposed DRANet includes two different parallel branches, which can capture complementary features to enhance the learning ability of the model. We designed a new residual attention block (RAB) and a novel hybrid dilated residual attention block (HDRAB) for the upper and the lower branches, respectively. The RAB and HDRAB can capture rich local features through multiple skip connections between different convolutional layers, and the unimportant features are dropped by the residual attention modules. Meanwhile, the long skip connections in each branch, and the global feature fusion between the two parallel branches can capture the global features as well. Moreover, the proposed DRANet uses downsampling operations and dilated convolutions to increase the size of the receptive field, which can enable DRANet to capture more image context information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with other state-of-the-art denoising methods, our DRANet can produce competitive denoising performance both on synthetic and real-world noise removal.

In this paper, we propose a PELvis Extraction (PELE) module that utilizes 3D prior anatomical knowledge in CT to guide and well isolate the pelvis from PXRs, thereby eliminating the influence of soft tissue. We conduct an extensive evaluation based on two public datasets and one private dataset, totaling 850 PXRs. The experimental results show that the proposed PELE module significantly improves the accuracy of PXRs landmark detection and achieves state-of-the-art performances in several benchmark metrics, thus better serving downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Background: Epilepsy is a neurological illness affecting the brain that makes people more likely to experience frequent, spontaneous seizures. There has to be an accurate automated method for measuring seizure frequency and severity in order to assess the efficacy of pharmacological therapy for epilepsy. The drug quantities are often derived from patient reports which may cause significant issues owing to inadequate or inaccurate descriptions of seizures and their frequencies. Methods and materials: This study proposes a novel deep learning architecture based lightweight convolution transformer (LCT). The transformer is able to learn spatial and temporal correlated information simultaneously from the multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to detect seizures at smaller segment lengths. In the proposed model, the lack of translation equivariance and localization of ViT is reduced using convolution tokenization, and rich information from the transformer encoder is extracted by sequence pooling instead of the learnable class token. Results: Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model of cross-patient learning can effectively detect seizures from the raw EEG signals. The accuracy and F1-score of seizure detection in the cross-patient case on the CHB-MIT dataset are shown to be 96.31% and 96.32%, respectively, at 0.5 sec segment length. In addition, the performance metrics show that the inclusion of inductive biases and attention-based pooling in the model enhances the performance and reduces the number of transformer encoder layers, which significantly reduces the computational complexity. In this research work, we provided a novel approach to enhance efficiency and simplify the architecture for multi-channel automated seizure detection. ",

To overcome this limitation, we propose a computationally efficient, likelihood-free estimation method utilizing a neural network. Through an extensive simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed neural network-based method provides Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution parameter estimates with comparable accuracy to the conventional maximum likelihood method but with a significant computational speedup. To account for estimation uncertainty, we utilize parametric bootstrapping, which is inherent in the trained network. Finally, we apply this method to 1000-year annual maximum temperature data from the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) across North America for three atmospheric concentrations: 289 ppm $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ (pre-industrial), 700 ppm $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ (future conditions), and 1400 ppm $\\mathrm{CO}_2$, and compare the results with those obtained using the maximum likelihood approach.

In this study, we propose a novel approach for steering vector interpolation that regards frequencies as continuous input variables.

Recently, by applying the theory of gyrogroups and gyrovector spaces that is a powerful framework for studying hyperbolic geometry, some works have attempted to build principled generalizations of Euclidean neural networks on matrix manifolds. However, due to the lack of many concepts in gyrovector spaces for the considered manifolds, e.g., the inner product and gyroangles, techniques and mathematical tools provided by these works are still limited compared to those developed for studying hyperbolic geometry. In this paper, we generalize some notions in gyrovector spaces for SPD and Grassmann manifolds, and propose new models and layers for building neural networks on these manifolds. We show the effectiveness of our approach in two applications, i.e., human action recognition and knowledge graph completion. ",

Neural networks have been applied with some success to the prediction of nuclear masses, but they are known to have shortcomings in application to extrapolation tasks. In this work, we propose and explore a novel type of neural network for mass prediction in which the usual neuron-like processing units are replaced by complex-valued product units that permit multiplicative couplings of inputs to be learned from the input data. This generalized network model is tested on both interpolation and extrapolation data sets drawn from the Atomic Mass Evaluation. Its performance is compared with that of several neural-network architectures, substantiating its suitability for nuclear mass prediction. Additionally, a prediction-uncertainty measure for such complex-valued networks is proposed that serves to identify regions of expected low prediction error. ",

    "abstract": "A random algebraic graph is defined by a group ${G}$ with a \"uniform\" distribution over it and a connection $\\sigma:{G}\\longrightarrow [0,1]$ with expectation $p,$ satisfying $\\sigma({g}) = \\sigma({g}^{-1}).$ The random graph $\\mathsf{RAG}(n,{G},p,\\sigma)$ with vertex set $[n]$ is formed as follows. First, $n$ independent latent vectors ${x}_1, \\ldots, {x}_n$ are sampled uniformly from ${G}.$ Then, vertices $i,j$ are connected with probability $\\sigma({x}_i{x}_j^{-1}).$ This model captures random geometric graphs with latent space the unit sphere and the hypercube, certain regimes of the stochastic block model, and random subgraphs of Cayley graphs. The main question of interest to the current paper is: when is a random algebraic graph statistically and/or computationally distinguishable from $\\mathsf{G}(n,p)$? Our results fall into two main categories. 1) Geometric. We focus on the case ${G} =\\{\\pm1\\}^d$ and use Fourier-analytic tools. For hard threshold connections, we match [LMSY22b] for $p = \\omega(1/n)$ and for connections that are $\\frac{1}{r\\sqrt{d}}$-Lipschitz we extend the results of [LR21b] when $d = \\Omega(n\\log n)$ to the non-monotone setting. 2) Algebraic. We provide evidence for an exponential statistical-computational gap.
