    "title": "Physics-Informed and Data-Driven Discovery of Governing Equations for  Complex Phenomena in Heterogeneous Media",
    "abstract": "Rapid evolution of sensor technology, advances in instrumentation, and progress in devising data-acquisition softwares/hardwares are providing vast amounts of data for various complex phenomena, ranging from those in atomospheric environment, to large-scale porous formations, and biological systems. The tremendous increase in the speed of scientific computing has also made it possible to emulate diverse high-dimensional, multiscale and multiphysics phenomena that contain elements of stochasticity, and to generate large volumes of numerical data for them in heterogeneous systems. The difficulty is, however, that often the governing equations for such phenomena are not known. A prime example is flow, transport, and deformation processes in macroscopically-heterogeneous materials and geomedia. In other cases, the governing equations are only partially known, in the sense that they either contain various coefficients that must be evaluated based on data, or that they require constitutive relations, such as the relationship between the stress tensor and the velocity gradients for non-Newtonian fluids in the momentum conservation equation, in order for them to be useful to the modeling. Several classes of approaches are emerging to address such problems that are based on machine learning, symbolic regression, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formulation, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics, data assimilation, and stochastic optimization and analysis, or a combination of two or more of such approaches. This Perspective describes the latest developments in this highly important area, and discusses possible future directions. ",

    "abstract": "Flight Trajectory Prediction (FTP) is an essential task in Air Traffic Control (ATC), which can assist air traffic controllers to manage airspace more safely and efficiently. Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, which is prone to suffer from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improved the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized Encoder-Decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future time steps. Compared to conventional architecture, an extra horizon-aware contexts generator (HACG) is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information that enables us to perform multi-horizon non-autoregressive prediction. Additionally, a differential prediction strategy is designed by well considering both the stationarity of the differential sequence and the high-bits errors of the BE representation. Moreover, the Bit-wise Weighted Binary Cross Entropy loss function is proposed to optimize the proposed framework that can further constrain the high-bits errors of the predictions. Finally, the proposed framework is validated on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Ground-air negotiation via speech communication is a vital prerequisite for ensuring safety and efficiency in air traffic control (ATC) operations. However, with the increase in traffic flow, incorrect instructions caused by human factors bring a great threat to ATC safety. Existing flight trajectory prediction (FTP) approaches primarily rely on the flight status of historical trajectory, leading to significant delays in the prediction of real-time maneuvering instruction, which is not conducive to conflict detection. A major reason is that spoken instructions and flight trajectories are presented in different modalities in the current air traffic control (ATC) system, bringing great challenges to considering the maneuvering instruction in the FTP tasks. In this paper, a spoken instruction-aware FTP framework, called SIA-FTP, is innovatively proposed to support high-maneuvering FTP tasks by incorporating instant spoken instruction. To address the modality gap and minimize the data requirements, a 3-stage learning paradigm is proposed to implement the SIA-FTP framework in a progressive manner, including trajectory-based FTP pretraining, intent-oriented instruction embedding learning, and multi-modal finetuning. Specifically, the FTP model and the instruction embedding with maneuvering semantics are pre-trained using volumes of well-resourced trajectory and text data in the 1st and 2nd stages. In succession, a multi-modal fusion strategy is proposed to incorporate the pre-trained instruction embedding into the FTP model and integrate the two pre-trained networks into a joint model. Finally, the joint model is finetuned using the limited trajectory-instruction data to enhance the FTP performance within maneuvering instruction scenarios. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework presents an impressive performance improvement in high-maneuvering scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing has significantly advanced water detection by applying semantic segmentation techniques to satellite imagery. However, semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the substantial amount of annotated data required. This is particularly problematic in wetland detection, where water extent varies over time and space, necessitating multiple annotations for the same area. In this paper, we present DeepAqua, a self-supervised deep learning model that leverages knowledge distillation to eliminate the need for manual annotations during the training phase. DeepAqua utilizes the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) as a teacher model to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for segmenting water from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To train the student model, we exploit cases where optical- and radar-based water masks coincide, enabling the detection of both open and vegetated water surfaces. Our model represents a significant advancement in computer vision techniques by effectively training semantic segmentation models without any manually annotated data. This approach offers a practical solution for monitoring wetland water extent changes without needing ground truth data, making it highly adaptable and scalable for wetland conservation efforts. ",

By performing these three related sentiment subtasks in an end-to-end manner, DSPN can extract aspects mentioned in the review, identify the corresponding sentiments, and predict the star rating labels. We evaluate DSPN on multi-aspect review datasets in English and Chinese and find that with only star rating labels for supervision, DSPN can perform comparably well to a variety of benchmark models. We also demonstrate the interpretability of DSPN's outputs on reviews to show the pyramid structure inherent in document level end-to-end sentiment analysis. ",

    "abstract": "Over the years, much research involving mobile computational entities has been performed. From modeling actual microscopic (and smaller) robots, to modeling software processes on a network, many important problems have been studied in this context. Gathering is one such fundamental problem in this area. The problem of gathering $k$ robots, initially arbitrarily placed on the nodes of an $n$-node graph, asks that these robots coordinate and communicate in a local manner, as opposed to global, to move around the graph, find each other, and settle down on a single node as fast as possible. A more difficult problem to solve is gathering with detection, where once the robots gather, they must subsequently realize that gathering has occurred and then terminate. In this paper, we propose a deterministic approach to solve gathering with detection for any arbitrary connected graph that is faster than existing deterministic solutions for even just gathering (without the requirement of detection) for arbitrary graphs. In contrast to earlier work on gathering, it leverages the fact that there are more robots present in the system to achieve gathering with detection faster than those previous papers that focused on just gathering. The state of the art solution for deterministic gathering~[Ta-Shma and Zwick, TALG, 2014] takes $\\Tilde{O}$$(n^5 \\log \\ell)$ rounds, where $\\ell$ is the smallest label among robots and $\\Tilde{O}$ hides a polylog factor. We design a deterministic algorithm for gathering with detection with the following trade-offs depending on how many robots are present: (i) when $k \\geq \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor + 1$, the algorithm takes $O(n^3)$ rounds, (ii) when $k \\geq \\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor + 1$, the algorithm takes $O(n^4 \\log n)$ rounds, and (iii) otherwise, the algorithm takes $\\Tilde{O}$$(n^5)$ rounds. The algorithm is not required to know $k$, but only $n$. ",

    "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) often assign high confidence to their predictions, even for points far out-of-distribution, making uncertainty quantification (UQ) a challenge. When they are employed to model interatomic potentials in materials systems, this problem leads to unphysical structures that disrupt simulations, or to biased statistics and dynamics that do not reflect the true physics. Differentiable UQ techniques can find new informative data and drive active learning loops for robust potentials. However, a variety of UQ techniques, including newly developed ones, exist for atomistic simulations and there are no clear guidelines for which are most effective or suitable for a given case. In this work, we examine multiple UQ schemes for improving the robustness of NN interatomic potentials (NNIPs) through active learning. In particular, we compare incumbent ensemble-based methods against strategies that use single, deterministic NNs: mean-variance estimation, deep evidential regression, and Gaussian mixture models. We explore three datasets ranging from in-domain interpolative learning to more extrapolative out-of-domain generalization challenges: rMD17, ammonia inversion, and bulk silica glass. Performance is measured across multiple metrics relating model error to uncertainty. Our experiments show that none of the methods consistently outperformed each other across the various metrics. Ensembling remained better at generalization and for NNIP robustness; MVE only proved effective for in-domain interpolation, while GMM was better out-of-domain; and evidential regression, despite its promise, was not the preferable alternative in any of the cases. More broadly, cost-effective, single deterministic models cannot yet consistently match or outperform ensembling for uncertainty quantification in NNIPs. ",

    "abstract": "An antibiogram is a periodic summary of antibiotic resistance results of organisms from infected patients to selected antimicrobial drugs. Antibiograms help clinicians to understand regional resistance rates and select appropriate antibiotics in prescriptions. In practice, significant combinations of antibiotic resistance may appear in different antibiograms, forming antibiogram patterns. Such patterns may imply the prevalence of some infectious diseases in certain regions. Thus it is of crucial importance to monitor antibiotic resistance trends and track the spread of multi-drug resistant organisms. In this paper, we propose a novel problem of antibiogram pattern prediction that aims to predict which patterns will appear in the future. Despite its importance, tackling this problem encounters a series of challenges and has not yet been explored in the literature. First of all, antibiogram patterns are not i.i.d as they may have strong relations with each other due to genomic similarities of the underlying organisms. Second, antibiogram patterns are often temporally dependent on the ones that are previously detected. Furthermore, the spread of antibiotic resistance can be significantly influenced by nearby or similar regions. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Antibiogram Pattern Prediction framework, STAPP, that can effectively leverage the pattern correlations and exploit the temporal and spatial information. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset with antibiogram reports of patients from 1999 to 2012 for 203 cities in the United States. The experimental results show the superiority of STAPP against several competitive baselines. ",

In this work, we take sentiment classification as an example and look into the causal relations between the review (X) and sentiment (Y). As psychology studies show that language can affect emotion, different psychological processes are evoked when a person first makes a rating and then self-rationalizes their feeling in a review (where the sentiment causes the review, i.e., Y -> X), versus first describes their experience, and weighs the pros and cons to give a final rating (where the review causes the sentiment, i.e., X -> Y ). Furthermore, it is also a completely different psychological process if an annotator infers the original rating of the user by theory of mind (ToM) (where the review causes the rating, i.e., X -ToM-> Y ). In this paper, we verbalize these three causal mechanisms of human psychological processes of sentiment classification into three different causal prompts, and study (1) how differently they perform, and (2) what nature of sentiment classification data leads to agreement or diversity in the model responses elicited by the prompts.

It is critical to understand how COVID-19 impacts RSV and build predictive algorithms to forecast the timing and intensity of RSV reemergence in post-COVID-19 seasons. In this paper, we propose a deep coupled tensor factorization machine, dubbed as DeCom, for post COVID-19 RSV prediction. DeCom leverages tensor factorization and residual modeling. It enables us to learn the disrupted RSV transmission reliably under COVID-19 by taking both the regular seasonal RSV transmission pattern and the NPI into consideration. Experimental results on a real RSV dataset show that DeCom is more accurate than the state-of-the-art RSV prediction algorithms and achieves up to 46% lower root mean square error and 49% lower mean absolute error for country-level prediction compared to the baselines.

In our recent work, we have studied GCNs with covariance matrices as graphs in the form of coVariance neural networks (VNNs) that draw similarities with traditional PCA-driven data analysis approaches while offering significant advantages over them. In this paper, we first focus on theoretically characterizing the transferability of VNNs. The notion of transferability is motivated from the intuitive expectation that learning models could generalize to \"compatible\" datasets (possibly of different dimensionalities) with minimal effort. VNNs inherit the scale-free data processing architecture from GCNs and here, we show that VNNs exhibit transferability of performance over datasets whose covariance matrices converge to a limit object. Multi-scale neuroimaging datasets enable the study of the brain at multiple scales and hence, can validate the theoretical results on the transferability of VNNs. To gauge the advantages offered by VNNs in neuroimaging data analysis, we focus on the task of \"brain age\" prediction using cortical thickness features. In clinical neuroscience, there has been an increased interest in machine learning algorithms which provide estimates of \"brain age\" that deviate from chronological age. We leverage the architecture of VNNs to extend beyond the coarse metric of brain age gap in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and make two important observations: (i) VNNs can assign anatomical interpretability to elevated brain age gap in AD, and (ii) the interpretability offered by VNNs is contingent on their ability to exploit specific principal components of the anatomical covariance matrix. We further leverage the transferability of VNNs to cross validate the above observations across different datasets. ",

Our results indicate, through bit vector representations, that the network continues to refine class detectability with the last ReLU layer achieving better than 95\\% separation accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that bit vectors aid in adversarial image detection, again achieving over 95\\% accuracy in separating adversarial and non-adversarial images using a simple classifier.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based approaches have produced models with good insect classification accuracy; Most of these models are conducive for application in controlled environmental conditions. One of the primary emphasis of researchers is to implement identification and classification models in the real agriculture fields, which is challenging because input images that are wildly out of the distribution (e.g., images like vehicles, animals, humans, or a blurred image of an insect or insect class that is not yet trained on) can produce an incorrect insect classification. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithms provide an exciting avenue to overcome these challenge as it ensures that a model abstains from making incorrect classification prediction of non-insect and/or untrained insect class images. We generate and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art OOD algorithms on insect detection classifiers. These algorithms represent a diversity of methods for addressing an OOD problem. Specifically, we focus on extrusive algorithms, i.e., algorithms that wrap around a well-trained classifier without the need for additional co-training. We compared three OOD detection algorithms: (i) Maximum Softmax Probability, which uses the softmax value as a confidence score, (ii) Mahalanobis distance-based algorithm, which uses a generative classification approach; and (iii) Energy-Based algorithm that maps the input data to a scalar value, called energy. We performed an extensive series of evaluations of these OOD algorithms across three performance axes: (a) \\textit{Base model accuracy}: How does the accuracy of the classifier impact OOD performance? (b) How does the \\textit{level of dissimilarity to the domain} impact OOD performance? and (c) \\textit{Data imbalance}: How sensitive is OOD performance to the imbalance in per-class sample size?

Additionally, current methods rely heavily on the use of a well-imitated surrogate NRM to guarantee the attack effect, which makes them difficult to use in practice. To address these issues, we propose a framework called Imperceptible DocumEnt Manipulation (IDEM) to produce adversarial documents that are less noticeable to both algorithms and humans. IDEM instructs a well-established generative language model, such as BART, to generate connection sentences without introducing easy-to-detect errors, and employs a separate position-wise merging strategy to balance relevance and coherence of the perturbed text. Experimental results on the popular MS MARCO benchmark demonstrate that IDEM can outperform strong baselines while preserving fluency and correctness of the target documents as evidenced by automatic and human evaluations. Furthermore, the separation of adversarial text generation from the surrogate NRM makes IDEM more robust and less affected by the quality of the surrogate NRM. ",

This is challenging because partitioning is NP-hard, and estimating the costs accurately and efficiently is difficult. In this work, we explore a \"pre-train, and search\" paradigm for efficient sharding. The idea is to pre-train a universal and once-for-all neural network to predict the costs of all the possible shards, which serves as an efficient sharding simulator. Built upon this pre-trained cost model, we then perform an online search to identify the best sharding plans given any specific sharding task. We instantiate this idea in deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) and propose NeuroShard for embedding table sharding. NeuroShard pre-trains neural cost models on augmented tables to cover various sharding scenarios. Then it identifies the best column-wise and table-wise sharding plans with beam search and greedy grid search, respectively. Experiments show that NeuroShard significantly and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on the benchmark sharding dataset, achieving up to 23.8% improvement. When deployed in an ultra-large production DLRM with multi-terabyte embedding tables, NeuroShard achieves 11.6% improvement in embedding costs over the state-of-the-art, which translates to 6.6% end-to-end training throughput improvement.

These noisy annotations are present in the datasets inherently because the labeling is subjective to the annotator, clarity of the image, etc. Recent works use sample selection methods to solve this noisy annotation problem in FER. In our work, we use a dynamic adaptive threshold to separate confident samples from non-confident ones so that our learning won't be hampered due to non-confident samples. Instead of discarding the non-confident samples, we impose consistency in the negative classes of those non-confident samples to guide the model to learn better in the positive class. Since FER datasets usually come with 7 or 8 classes, we can correctly guess a negative class by 85% probability even by choosing randomly. By learning \"which class a sample doesn't belong to\", the model can learn \"which class it belongs to\" in a better manner. We demonstrate proposed framework's effectiveness using quantitative as well as qualitative results. Our method performs better than the baseline by a margin of 4% to 28% on RAFDB and 3.3% to 31.4% on FERPlus for various levels of synthetic noisy labels in the aforementioned datasets. ",

In view of this, in this paper we tackle a challenging and practical continual learning scenario named few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL), in which labeled data are given for classes in a base session but very limited labeled instances are available for new incremental classes. To address this problem, we propose a novel and succinct approach by introducing deep dictionary learning which is a hybrid learning architecture that combines dictionary learning and visual representation learning to provide a better space for characterizing different classes. We simultaneously optimize the dictionary and the feature extraction backbone in the base session, while only finetune the dictionary in the incremental session for adaptation to novel classes, which can alleviate the forgetting on base classes compared to finetuning the entire model. To further facilitate future adaptation, we also incorporate multiple pseudo classes into the base session training so that certain space projected by dictionary can be reserved for future new concepts. The extensive experimental results on CIFAR100, miniImageNet and CUB200 validate the effectiveness of our approach compared to other SOTA methods. ",

The main goal of application developers of GPU is to tune their code extensively to obtain optimal performance, making efficient use of different resources available. While extracting optimal performance of applications on an HPC infrastructure, developers should also ensure the applications have the least energy usage considering the massive power consumption of data centres and HPC servers. This thesis presents two models developed which can be utilized by developers in analysing the CUDA kernel's energy dissipation. The first one is a model that predicts the CUDA kernel's execution time. Here a PTX code is statically analysed to extract instruction features, control flow, and data dependence. We propose two scheduling algorithm approaches that satisfy the performance and hardware constraints. The second model is a static analysis-based power prediction built by utilizing machine learning techniques. Features used for building the model are derived using static analysis of PTX code. These features are chosen to understand the relationship between GPU power consumption and program features that can aid developers in building energy-efficient, sustainable applications. The dataset used for validating both models include kernels from different benchmarks suits, sizes, nature (e.g., compute-bound, memory-bound), and complexity (e.g., control divergence, memory access patterns). We also present a tool that has practically validated the effectiveness and ease of using the two models as design assistance tools for GPU. ",

NFV systems are seeing greater deployment in the cloud and at the edge. However, especially at the edge, there is a mismatch between the traditional focus on NFV throughput and the need to meet very low latency SLOs, as edge services inherently require low latency. Moreover, cloud-based NFV systems need to achieve such low latency while minimizing CPU core usage. We find that real-world traffic exhibits burstiness that causes latency spikes of up to 10s of milliseconds in existing NFV systems. To address this, we built NetBlaze, which achieves sub-millisecond p99 latency SLOs, even for adversarial traffic, using a novel multi-scale core-scaling strategy. NetBlaze makes traffic-to-core allocation decisions at rack, server, and core-spatial scales, and at increasingly finer timescales, to accommodate multi-timescale bursts. In comparison with state-of-the-art approaches, NetBlaze is the only one capable of achieving sub-millisecond p99 latency SLOs while using a comparable number of cores. ",

To effectively combat piracy and protect copyrights, a watermarking framework should be able not only to embed adequate bits of information but also extract the watermarks in a robust manner despite possible corruption. In this work, we explore ways to advance both payload and robustness by following a well-known proposition from image watermarking and identify features in natural language that are invariant to minor corruption. Through a systematic analysis of the possible sources of errors, we further propose a corruption-resistant infill model.

This paper studies this problem and proposes to incorporate chemical domain knowledge, specifically related to chemical reactions, for learning effective molecular representations.

To this end, we introduce a novel method, namely MolKD, which Distills cross-modal Knowledge in chemical reactions to assist Molecular property prediction. Specifically, the reaction-to-molecule distillation model within MolKD transfers cross-modal knowledge from a pre-trained teacher network learning with one modality (i.e., reactions) into a student network learning with another modality (i.e., molecules). Moreover, MolKD learns effective molecular representations by incorporating reaction yields to measure transformation efficiency of the reactant-product pair when pre-training on reactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MolKD significantly outperforms various competitive baseline models, e.g., 2.1% absolute AUC-ROC gain on Tox21. Further investigations demonstrate that pre-trained molecular representations in MolKD can distinguish chemically reasonable molecular similarities, which enables molecular property prediction with high robustness and interpretability.

Modern computer vision algorithms relying on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have proven capable of undertaking this task even under resource-constrained and embedded execution scenarios, e.g., as is the case with fast, single-stage, anchor-based object detectors. This paper proposes a two-fold improvement of such algorithms for the X-ray analysis domain, introducing two complementary novelties. Firstly, more efficient anchors are obtained by hierarchical clustering the sizes of the ground-truth training set bounding boxes; thus, the resulting anchors follow a natural hierarchy aligned with the semantic structure of the data. Secondly, the default Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm at the end of the object detection pipeline is modified to better handle occluded object detection and to reduce the number of false predictions, by inserting the Efficient Intersection over Union (E-IoU) metric into the Weighted Cluster NMS method. E-IoU provides more discriminative geometrical correlations between the candidate bounding boxes/Regions-of-Interest (RoIs). The proposed method is implemented on a common single-stage object detector (YOLOv5) and its experimental evaluation on a relevant public dataset indicates significant accuracy gains over both the baseline and competing approaches. This highlights the potential of Big Data analysis in enhancing public safety. ",

We conduct extensive experiments on TAT-DQA dataset, and the results show that our proposed framework outperforms the best baseline model by 17.73% and 16.91% in terms of Exact Match (EM) and F1 score respectively on the test set, achieving the new state-of-the-art.

We propose SeqAug, a modality-agnostic augmentation method that is tailored towards sequences of extracted features. The core idea of SeqAug is to augment the sequence by resampling from the underlying feature distribution. Resampling is performed by randomly selecting feature dimensions and permuting them along the temporal axis. Experiments on CMU-MOSEI verify that SeqAug is modality agnostic; it can be successfully applied to a single modality or multiple modalities. We further verify its compatibility with both recurrent and transformer architectures, and also demonstrate comparable to state-of-the-art results. ",

    "abstract": "Educational data mining has become an important research field in studying the social behavior of college students using massive data. However, traditional campus friendship network and their community detection algorithms, which lack time characteristics, have their limitations. This paper proposes a new approach to address these limitations by reconstructing the campus friendship network into weighted directed networks in continuous time, improving the effectiveness of traditional campus friendship network and the accuracy of community detection results. To achieve this, a new weighted directed community detection algorithm for campus friendship network in continuous time is proposed, and it is used to study the community detection of a university student. The results show that the weighted directed friendship network reconstructed in this paper can reveal the real friend relationships better than the initial undirected unauthorized friendship network. Furthermore, the community detection algorithm proposed in this paper obtains better community detection effects. After community detection, students in the same community exhibit similarities in consumption level, eating habits, and behavior regularity. This paper enriches the theoretical research of complex friendship network considering the characteristics of time, and also provides objective scientific guidance for the management of college students.

To addresses this gap, we propose and benchmark a new dataset, Localized Audio Visual DeepFake (LAV-DF), consisting of strategic content-driven audio, visual and audio-visual manipulations. The proposed baseline method, Boundary Aware Temporal Forgery Detection (BA-TFD), is a 3D Convolutional Neural Network-based architecture which efficiently captures multimodal manipulations. We further improve (i.e. BA-TFD+) the baseline method by replacing the backbone with a Multiscale Vision Transformer and guide the training process with contrastive, frame classification, boundary matching and multimodal boundary matching loss functions. The quantitative analysis demonstrates the superiority of BA- TFD+ on temporal forgery localization and deepfake detection tasks using several benchmark datasets including our newly proposed dataset.

Recent studies show that edge-case targeted attacks, which target a small fraction of the input space are nearly impossible to counter using existing fixed defense strategies. In this paper, we strive to design a learned-defense strategy against such attacks, using a small defense dataset. The defense dataset can be collected by the central authority of the federated learning task, and should contain a mix of poisoned and clean examples. The proposed framework, LearnDefend, estimates the probability of a client update being malicious. The examples in defense dataset need not be pre-marked as poisoned or clean. We also learn a poisoned data detector model which can be used to mark each example in the defense dataset as clean or poisoned. We estimate the poisoned data detector and the client importance models in a coupled optimization approach. Our experiments demonstrate that LearnDefend is capable of defending against state-of-the-art attacks where existing fixed defense strategies fail. We also show that LearnDefend is robust to size and noise in the marking of clean examples in the defense dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Many important computer vision tasks are naturally formulated to have a non-differentiable objective. Therefore, the standard, dominant training procedure of a neural network is not applicable since back-propagation requires the gradients of the objective with respect to the output of the model. Most deep learning methods side-step the problem sub-optimally by using a proxy loss for training, which was originally designed for another task and is not tailored to the specifics of the objective. The proxy loss functions may or may not align well with the original non-differentiable objective. An appropriate proxy has to be designed for a novel task, which may not be feasible for a non-specialist. This thesis makes four main contributions toward bridging the gap between the non-differentiable objective and the training loss function. Throughout the thesis, we refer to a loss function as a surrogate loss if it is a differentiable approximation of the non-differentiable objective. Note that we use the terms objective and evaluation metric interchangeably. The contributions of this thesis make the training of neural networks more scalable -- to new tasks in a nearly labor-free manner when the evaluation metric is decomposable, which will help researchers with novel tasks. For non-decomposable evaluation metrics, the differentiable components developed for the recall@k surrogate, such as sorting and counting, can also be used for creating new surrogates. ",

Humans, however, do not take the turn just because it is likely, but also consider whether what they want to say fits the position. In this paper, we present a model (an extension of TurnGPT) that conditions the end-of-turn prediction on both conversation history and what the next speaker wants to say. We found that our model consistently outperforms the baseline model in a variety of metrics. The improvement is most prominent in two scenarios where turn predictions can be ambiguous solely from the conversation history: 1) when the current utterance contains a statement followed by a question; 2) when the end of the current utterance semantically matches the response. Treating the turn-prediction and response-ranking as a one-stage process, our findings suggest that our model can be used as an incremental response ranker, which can be applied in various settings.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate novel data collection and training techniques towards improving classification accuracy of non-moving (static) hand gestures using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars. Recently, non-contact hand pose and static gesture recognition have received considerable attention in many applications ranging from human-computer interaction (HCI), augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), and even therapeutic range of motion for medical applications. While most current solutions rely on optical or depth cameras, these methods require ideal lighting and temperature conditions. mmWave radar devices have recently emerged as a promising alternative offering low-cost system-on-chip sensors whose output signals contain precise spatial information even in non-ideal imaging conditions. Additionally, deep convolutional neural networks have been employed extensively in image recognition by learning both feature extraction and classification simultaneously. However, little work has been done towards static gesture recognition using mmWave radars and CNNs due to the difficulty involved in extracting meaningful features from the radar return signal, and the results are inferior compared with dynamic gesture classification. This article presents an efficient data collection approach and a novel technique for deep CNN training by introducing ``sterile'' images which aid in distinguishing distinct features among the static gestures and subsequently improve the classification accuracy. Applying the proposed data collection and training methods yields an increase in classification rate of static hand gestures from $85\\%$ to $93\\%$ and $90\\%$ to $95\\%$ for range and range-angle profiles, respectively.

    "abstract": "Emerged as a biology-inspired method, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) mimic the spiking nature of brain neurons and have received lots of research attention. SNNs deal with binary spikes as their activation and therefore derive extreme energy efficiency on hardware. However, it also leads to an intrinsic obstacle that training SNNs from scratch requires a re-definition of the firing function for computing gradient. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), however, are fully differentiable to be trained with gradient descent. In this paper, we propose a joint training framework of ANN and SNN, in which the ANN can guide the SNN's optimization. This joint framework contains two parts: First, the knowledge inside ANN is distilled to SNN by using multiple branches from the networks. Second, we restrict the parameters of ANN and SNN, where they share partial parameters and learn different singular weights. Extensive experiments over several widely used network structures show that our method consistently outperforms many other state-of-the-art training methods. For example, on the CIFAR100 classification task, the spiking ResNet-18 model trained by our method can reach to 77.39% top-1 accuracy with only 4 time steps. ",

Then, transfering the input image and rain steaks from the image domain to the feature domain adaptively to learn useful features for high-quality image deraining.

Handling such inclement weather conditions, however, is essential to operate autonomous vehicles, drones and robotic applications where human performance is impeded the most. A large body of work explores removing weather-induced image degradations with dehazing methods. Most methods rely on single images as input and struggle to generalize from synthetic fully-supervised training approaches or to generate high fidelity results from unpaired real-world datasets. With data as bottleneck and most of today's training data relying on good weather conditions with inclement weather as outlier, we rely on an inverse rendering approach to reconstruct the scene content. We introduce ScatterNeRF, a neural rendering method which adequately renders foggy scenes and decomposes the fog-free background from the participating media-exploiting the multiple views from a short automotive sequence without the need for a large training data corpus. Instead, the rendering approach is optimized on the multi-view scene itself, which can be typically captured by an autonomous vehicle, robot or drone during operation. Specifically, we propose a disentangled representation for the scattering volume and the scene objects, and learn the scene reconstruction with physics-inspired losses. We validate our method by capturing multi-view In-the-Wild data and controlled captures in a large-scale fog chamber. ",

Furthermore, we have experimentally shown that the bias terms take considerable amount of the runtime while increasing PSNR marginally, hence we have also applied bias removal to the convolutional layers. Our method adds ~1dB on Bicubic upscaling PSNR for all tested SR datasets and runs with ~1.17ms on RTX3090 and ~2.9ms on RTX3070, for 720p inputs and 4K outputs, both in FP16 precision. Bicubic++ won NTIRE 2023 RTSR Track 2 x3 SR competition and is the fastest among all competitive methods.

Yet, traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques commonly enforce homogeneity to increase training sample efficiency. When a system of learning agents is not constrained to homogeneous policies, individual agents may develop diverse behaviors, resulting in emergent complementarity that benefits the system. Despite this feat, there is a surprising lack of tools that measure behavioral diversity in systems of learning agents. Such techniques would pave the way towards understanding the impact of diversity in collective resilience and performance. In this paper, we introduce System Neural Diversity (SND): a measure of behavioral heterogeneity for multi-agent systems where agents have stochastic policies. %over a continuous state space. We discuss and prove its theoretical properties, and compare it with alternate, state-of-the-art behavioral diversity metrics used in cross-disciplinary domains. Through simulations of a variety of multi-agent tasks, we show how our metric constitutes an important diagnostic tool to analyze latent properties of behavioral heterogeneity. By comparing SND with task reward in static tasks, where the problem does not change during training, we show that it is key to understanding the effectiveness of heterogeneous vs homogeneous agents. In dynamic tasks, where the problem is affected by repeated disturbances during training, we show that heterogeneous agents are first able to learn specialized roles that allow them to cope with the disturbance, and then retain these roles when the disturbance is removed. SND allows a direct measurement of this latent resilience, while other proxies such as task performance (reward) fail to. ",

Motivated by this, we design a Mixture-of-Expert (MOE)-based decoder, where each expert is built on MHA, for discriminating the graph embeddings to generate different kinds of words. Since both the encoder and decoder are built based on the MHA, as a result, we construct a homogeneous encoder-decoder unlike the previous heterogeneous ones which usually apply Fully-Connected-based GNN and LSTM-based decoder. The homogeneous architecture enables us to unify the training configuration of the whole model instead of specifying different training strategies for diverse sub-networks as in the heterogeneous pipeline, which releases the training difficulty.

    "abstract": "We study an auction with $m$ identical items in a context where $n$ agents can arbitrarily commit to strategies. In general, such commitments non-trivially change the equilibria by inducing a metagame of choosing which strategies to commit to. In this model, we demonstrate a strategy that an attacker may commit to that ensures they receive one such item for free, while forcing the remaining agents to enter into a lottery for the remaining items (albeit for free). The attack is thus detrimental to the auctioneer who loses most of their revenue. For various types of auctions that are not too congested, we show that the strategy works as long as the agents have valuations that are somewhat concentrated. In this case, all agents will voluntarily cooperate with the attacker to enter into the lottery, because doing so gives them a chance of receiving a free item that would have otherwise cost an amount commensurate with their valuation. The attack is robust to a large constant fraction of the agents being either oblivious to the attack or having exceptionally high valuations (thus reluctant to enter into the lottery). For these agents, the attacker may coerce them into cooperating by promising them a free item rather than entering in to the lottery. We show that the conditions for the attack to work hold with high probability when (1) the auction is not too congested, and (2) the valuations are sampled i.i.d. from either a uniform distribution or a Pareto distribution. The attack works for first-price auctions, second-price auctions and the transaction fee mechanism EIP-1559 used by the Ethereum blockchain. ",

One such challenge is the exploitation of vulnerable devices for recruitment into botnets, which can be used to carry out Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. The recent Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) standard has been proposed as a way to mitigate this problem, by allowing manufacturers to define communication patterns that are permitted for their IoT devices, with enforcement at the gateway home router. In this paper, we present a novel integrated system implementation that uses a MUD manager (osMUD) to parse an extended set of MUD rules, which also allow for rate-limiting of traffic and for setting appropriate thresholds.

    "title": "Rethinking Graph Lottery Tickets: Graph Sparsity Matters",
    "abstract": "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) claims the existence of a winning ticket (i.e., a properly pruned sub-network together with original weight initialization) that can achieve competitive performance to the original dense network. A recent work, called UGS, extended LTH to prune graph neural networks (GNNs) for effectively accelerating GNN inference. UGS simultaneously prunes the graph adjacency matrix and the model weights using the same masking mechanism, but since the roles of the graph adjacency matrix and the weight matrices are very different, we find that their sparsifications lead to different performance characteristics. Specifically, we find that the performance of a sparsified GNN degrades significantly when the graph sparsity goes beyond a certain extent. Therefore, we propose two techniques to improve GNN performance when the graph sparsity is high. First, UGS prunes the adjacency matrix using a loss formulation which, however, does not properly involve all elements of the adjacency matrix; in contrast, we add a new auxiliary loss head to better guide the edge pruning by involving the entire adjacency matrix. Second, by regarding unfavorable graph sparsification as adversarial data perturbations, we formulate the pruning process as a min-max optimization problem to gain the robustness of lottery tickets when the graph sparsity is high. We further investigate the question: Can the \"retrainable\" winning ticket of a GNN be also effective for graph transferring learning? We call it the transferable graph lottery ticket (GLT) hypothesis. Extensive experiments were conducted which demonstrate the superiority of our proposed sparsification method over UGS, and which empirically verified our transferable GLT hypothesis. ",

    "abstract": "Inverse rendering methods that account for global illumination are becoming more popular, but current methods require evaluating and automatically differentiating millions of path integrals by tracing multiple light bounces, which remains expensive and prone to noise. Instead, this paper proposes a radiometric prior as a simple alternative to building complete path integrals in a traditional differentiable path tracer, while still correctly accounting for global illumination. Inspired by the Neural Radiosity technique, we use a neural network as a radiance function, and we introduce a prior consisting of the norm of the residual of the rendering equation in the inverse rendering loss. We train our radiance network and optimize scene parameters simultaneously using a loss consisting of both a photometric term between renderings and the multi-view input images, and our radiometric prior (the residual term). This residual term enforces a physical constraint on the optimization that ensures that the radiance field accounts for global illumination. We compare our method to a vanilla differentiable path tracer, and more advanced techniques such as Path Replay Backpropagation. Despite the simplicity of our approach, we can recover scene parameters with comparable and in some cases better quality, at considerably lower computation times. ",

Researchers have made great progress in designing various traditional methods, and their theoretical design and performance gain are close to a limit. In the past few years, learning-based IM methods have emerged to achieve stronger generalization ability to unknown graphs than traditional ones. However, the development of learning-based IM methods is still limited by fundamental obstacles, including 1) the difficulty of effectively solving the objective function; 2) the difficulty of characterizing the diversified underlying diffusion patterns; and 3) the difficulty of adapting the solution under various node-centrality-constrained IM variants. To cope with the above challenges, we design a novel framework DeepIM to generatively characterize the latent representation of seed sets, and we propose to learn the diversified information diffusion pattern in a data-driven and end-to-end manner.

We employed BERT-based topic modeling to conduct a discourse analysis and social network analysis to identify influential users in the conversation. While Twitter users generally ex-pressed a positive attitude towards the use of ChatGPT, their concerns converged to five specific categories: academic integrity, impact on learning outcomes and skill development, limitation of capabilities, policy and social concerns, and workforce challenges. We also found that users from the tech, education, and media fields were often implicated in the conversation, while education and tech individual users led the discussion of concerns. Based on these findings, the study provides several implications for policymakers, tech companies and individuals, educators, and media agencies.

To alleviate the problem, it might be possible to generate long-document QA pairs via unsupervised question answering (UQA) methods. However, existing UQA tasks are based on short documents, and can hardly incorporate long-range information. To tackle the problem, we propose a new task, named unsupervised long-document question answering (ULQA), aiming to generate high-quality long-document QA instances in an unsupervised manner. Besides, we propose AttenWalker, a novel unsupervised method to aggregate and generate answers with long-range dependency so as to construct long-document QA pairs. Specifically, AttenWalker is composed of three modules, i.e., span collector, span linker and answer aggregator. Firstly, the span collector takes advantage of constituent parsing and reconstruction loss to select informative candidate spans for constructing answers. Secondly, by going through the attention graph of a pre-trained long-document model, potentially interrelated text spans (that might be far apart) could be linked together via an attention-walking algorithm. Thirdly, in the answer aggregator, linked spans are aggregated into the final answer via the mask-filling ability of a pre-trained model. Extensive experiments show that AttenWalker outperforms previous methods on Qasper and NarrativeQA. In addition, AttenWalker also shows strong performance in the few-shot learning setting. ",

    "abstract": "Many deployments of differential privacy in industry are in the local model, where each party releases its private information via a differentially private randomizer. We study triangle counting in the noninteractive and interactive local model with edge differential privacy (that, intuitively, requires that the outputs of the algorithm on graphs that differ in one edge be indistinguishable). In this model, each party's local view consists of the adjacency list of one vertex. In the noninteractive model, we prove that additive $\\Omega(n^2)$ error is necessary, where $n$ is the number of nodes. This lower bound is our main technical contribution. It uses a reconstruction attack with a new class of linear queries and a novel mix-and-match strategy of running the local randomizers with different completions of their adjacency lists. It matches the additive error of the algorithm based on Randomized Response, proposed by Imola, Murakami and Chaudhuri (USENIX2021) and analyzed by Imola, Murakami and Chaudhuri (CCS2022) for constant $\\varepsilon$. We use a different postprocessing of Randomized Response and provide tight bounds on the variance of the resulting algorithm. In the interactive setting, we prove a lower bound of $\\Omega(n^{3/2})$ on the additive error. Previously, no hardness results were known for interactive, edge-private algorithms in the local model, except for those that follow trivially from the results for the central model. Our work significantly improves on the state of the art in differentially private graph analysis in the local model. ",

However, their performance drops drastically when confronted with linguistically complex texts that they struggle to comprehend. Inspired by the Divide-and-Conquer algorithm and dual-process theory, in this paper, we regard linguistically complex texts as compound proposition texts composed of multiple simple proposition sentences and propose an end-to-end Neural Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning framework, dubbed NDCR. It contains three main components: 1)Divide: a proposition generator divides the compound proposition text into simple proposition sentences and produces their corresponding representations, 2)Conquer: a pretrained VLMs-based visual-linguistic interactor achieves the interaction between decomposed proposition sentences and images, 3)Combine: a neural-symbolic reasoner combines the above reasoning states to obtain the final solution via a neural logic reasoning approach. According to the dual-process theory, the visual-linguistic interactor and neural-symbolic reasoner could be regarded as analogical reasoning System 1 and logical reasoning System 2. We conduct extensive experiments on a challenging image retrieval from contextual descriptions data set.

The proposed control strategy resolves the impractical speed jump issue that exists in the conventional backstepping design. Additionally, considering the system and measurement noises, the proposed control strategy not only removes the chattering issue existing in the conventional sliding mode control but also provides smooth control input with extra robustness. After that, an adaptive sliding innovation filter is integrated with the proposed control to provide accurate state estimates that are robust to modeling uncertainties.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of research publications has placed great demands on digital libraries (DL) for advanced information management technologies. To cater to these demands, techniques relying on knowledge-graph structures are being advocated. In such graph-based pipelines, inferring semantic relations between related scientific concepts is a crucial step. Recently, BERT-based pre-trained models have been popularly explored for automatic relation classification. Despite significant progress, most of them were evaluated in different scenarios, which limits their comparability. Furthermore, existing methods are primarily evaluated on clean texts, which ignores the digitization context of early scholarly publications in terms of machine scanning and optical character recognition (OCR). In such cases, the texts may contain OCR noise, in turn creating uncertainty about existing classifiers' performances. To address these limitations, we started by creating OCR-noisy texts based on three clean corpora. Given these parallel corpora, we conducted a thorough empirical evaluation of eight Bert-based classification models by focusing on three factors: (1) Bert variants; (2) classification strategies; and, (3) OCR noise impacts. Experiments on clean data show that the domain-specific pre-trained Bert is the best variant to identify scientific relations. The strategy of predicting a single relation each time outperforms the one simultaneously identifying multiple relations in general. The optimal classifier's performance can decline by around 10% to 20% in F-score on the noisy corpora. Insights discussed in this study can help DL stakeholders select techniques for building optimal knowledge-graph-based systems. ",

The convoluted cortical geometry requires isotropic scans (e.g., 1mm MPRAGEs) and good gray-white matter contrast for 3D reconstruction. This precludes the analysis of most brain MRI scans acquired for clinical purposes. Analyzing such scans would enable neuroimaging studies with sample sizes that cannot be achieved with current research datasets, particularly for underrepresented populations and rare diseases. Here we present the first method for cortical reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and thickness estimation for clinical brain MRI scans of any resolution and pulse sequence. The methods has a learning component and a classical optimization module. The former uses domain randomization to train a CNN that predicts an implicit representation of the white matter and pial surfaces (a signed distance function) at 1mm isotropic resolution, independently of the pulse sequence and resolution of the input. The latter uses geometry processing to place the surfaces while accurately satisfying topological and geometric constraints, thus enabling subsequent parcellation and thickness estimation with existing methods.

    "abstract": "In this paper we discuss potentially practical ways to produce expander graphs with good spectral properties and a compact description. We focus on several classes of uniform and bipartite expander graphs defined as random Schreier graphs of the general linear group over the finite field of size two. We perform numerical experiments and show that such constructions produce spectral expanders that can be useful for practical applications. To find a theoretical explanation of the observed experimental results, we used the method of moments to prove upper bounds for the expected second largest eigenvalue of the random Schreier graphs used in our constructions. We focus on bounds for which it is difficult to study the asymptotic behaviour but it is possible to compute non-trivial conclusions for relatively small graphs with parameters from our numerical experiments (e.g., with less than 2^200 vertices and degree at least logarithmic in the number of vertices).

    "abstract": "We tackle classification based on brain connectivity derived from diffusion magnetic resonance images. We propose a machine-learning model inspired by graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which takes a brain connectivity input graph and processes the data separately through a parallel GCN mechanism with multiple heads. The proposed network is a simple design that employs different heads involving graph convolutions focused on edges and nodes, capturing representations from the input data thoroughly. To test the ability of our model to extract complementary and representative features from brain connectivity data, we chose the task of sex classification. This quantifies the degree to which the connectome varies depending on the sex, which is important for improving our understanding of health and disease in both sexes. We show experiments on two publicly available datasets: PREVENT-AD (347 subjects) and OASIS3 (771 subjects). The proposed model demonstrates the highest performance compared to the existing machine-learning algorithms we tested, including classical methods and (graph and non-graph) deep learning. We provide a detailed analysis of each component of our model. ",
