    "abstract": "An application of the POCS-based clustering algorithm (POCS stands for Projection Onto Convex Set), a novel clustering technique, for feature embedding clustering problems is proposed in this paper. The POCS-based clustering algorithm applies the POCS's convergence property to clustering problems and has shown competitive performance when compared with that of other classical clustering schemes in terms of clustering error and execution speed. Specifically, the POCS-based clustering algorithm treats each data point as a convex set and applies a parallel projection operation from every cluster prototype to corresponding data members in order to minimize the objective function and update the prototypes. The experimental results on the synthetic embedding datasets extracted from the 5 Celebrity Faces and MNIST datasets show that the POCS-based clustering algorithm can perform with favorable results when compared with those of other classical clustering schemes such as the K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means algorithms in feature embedding clustering problems.

    "abstract": "Computational experiments are exploited in finding a well-designed processing path to optimize material structures for desired properties. This requires understanding the interplay between the processing-(micro)structure-property linkages using a multi-scale approach that connects the macro-scale (process parameters) to meso (homogenized properties) and micro (crystallographic texture) scales. Due to the nature of the problem's multi-scale modeling setup, possible processing path choices could grow exponentially as the decision tree becomes deeper, and the traditional simulators' speed reaches a critical computational threshold. To lessen the computational burden for predicting microstructural evolution under given loading conditions, we develop a neural network (NN)-based method with physics-infused constraints. The NN aims to learn the evolution of microstructures under each elementary process. Our method is effective and robust in finding optimal processing paths. In this study, our NN-based method is applied to maximize the homogenized stiffness of a Copper microstructure, and it is found to be 686 times faster while achieving 0.053% error in the resulting homogenized stiffness compared to the traditional finite element simulator on a 10-process experiment.

Ignition of individual particles in a laminar flow reactor are visualized by simultaneous 10 kHz OH-LIF and DBI measurements. Two coal particle sizes of 90-125{\\mu}m and 160-200{\\mu}m are investigated in conventional air and oxy-fuel conditions with increasing oxygen concentrations. Ignition delay times are first evaluated with threshold methods, revealing obvious deviations compared to the ground truth detected by the human eye. Then, residual networks (ResNet) and feature pyramidal networks (FPN) are trained on the ground truth and applied to predict the ignition time.~Both networks are capable of detecting ignition with significantly higher accuracy and precision. Besides, influences of input data and depth of networks on the prediction performance of a trained model are examined.~The current study shows that the hierarchical feature extraction of the convolutions networks clearly facilitates data evaluation for high-speed optical measurements and could be transferred to other solid fuel experiments with similar boundary conditions.

    "abstract": "Sound event detection systems are widely used in various applications such as surveillance and environmental monitoring where data is automatically collected, processed, and sent to a cloud for sound recognition. However, this process may inadvertently reveal sensitive information about users or their surroundings, hence raising privacy concerns. In this study, we propose a novel adversarial training method for learning representations of audio recordings that effectively prevents the detection of speech activity from the latent features of the recordings. The proposed method trains a model to generate invariant latent representations of speech-containing audio recordings that cannot be distinguished from non-speech recordings by a speech classifier. The novelty of our work is in the optimization algorithm, where the speech classifier's weights are regularly replaced with the weights of classifiers trained in a supervised manner. This increases the discrimination power of the speech classifier constantly during the adversarial training, motivating the model to generate latent representations in which speech is not distinguishable, even using new speech classifiers trained outside the adversarial training loop. The proposed method is evaluated against a baseline approach with no privacy measures and a prior adversarial training method, demonstrating a significant reduction in privacy violations compared to the baseline approach. Additionally, we show that the prior adversarial method is practically ineffective for this purpose. ",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the possibility of classifying journal articles by exploiting multiple information sources, instead of relying on only one information source at a time. In particular, the Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) technique is used to merge the different layers of information about articles when they are organized as a multiplex network. The method proposed is tested on a case study consisting of the articles published in the Cambridge Journal of Economics. The information about articles is organized in a two-layer multiplex where the first layer contains similarities among articles based on the full-text of articles, and the second layer contains similarities based on the cited references. The unsupervised similarity network fusion process combines the two layers by building a new single-layer network. Distance correlation and partial distance correlation indexes are then used for estimating the contribution of each layer of information to the determination of the structure of the fused network. A clustering algorithm is lastly applied to the fused network for obtaining a classification of articles. The classification obtained through SNF has been evaluated from an expert point of view, by inspecting whether it can be interpreted and labelled with reference to research programs and methodologies adopted in economics. Moreover, the classification obtained in the fused network is compared with the two classifications obtained when cited references and contents are considered separately. Overall, the classification obtained on the fused network appears to be fine-grained enough to represent the extreme heterogeneity characterizing the contributions published in the Cambridge Journal of Economics.

One class of phylogenetic networks that has received a lot of attention recently is the class of orchard networks, which is composed of networks that can be reduced to a single leaf using cherry reductions. Cherry reductions, also called cherry-picking operations, remove either a leaf of a simple cherry (sibling leaves sharing a parent) or a reticulate edge of a reticulate cherry (two leaves whose parents are connected by a reticulate edge). In this paper, we present a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to solve the problem of finding a maximum agreement cherry-reduced subnetwork (MACRS) between two rooted binary level-1 networks. This is first exact algorithm proposed to solve the MACRS problem. As proven in earlier work, there is a direct relationship between finding an MACRS and calculating a distance based on cherry operations. As a result, the proposed algorithm also provides a distance that can be used for the comparison of level-1 networks. ",

    "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive performances in view synthesis by encoding neural representations of a scene. However, NeRFs require hundreds of images per scene to synthesize photo-realistic novel views. Training them on sparse input views leads to overfitting and incorrect scene depth estimation resulting in artifacts in the rendered novel views. Sparse input NeRFs were recently regularized by providing dense depth estimated from pre-trained networks as supervision, to achieve improved performance over sparse depth constraints. However, we find that such depth priors may be inaccurate due to generalization issues. Instead, we hypothesize that the visibility of pixels in different input views can be more reliably estimated to provide dense supervision. In this regard, we compute a visibility prior through the use of plane sweep volumes, which does not require any pre-training. By regularizing the NeRF training with the visibility prior, we successfully train the NeRF with few input views. We reformulate the NeRF to also directly output the visibility of a 3D point from a given viewpoint to reduce the training time with the visibility constraint. On multiple datasets, our model outperforms the competing sparse input NeRF models including those that use learned priors.

    "abstract": "Data-driven weather prediction models (DDWPs) have made rapid strides in recent years, demonstrating an ability to approximate Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models to a high degree of accuracy. The fast, accurate, and low-cost DDWP forecasts make their use in operational forecasting an attractive proposition, however, there remains work to be done in rigorously evaluating DDWPs in a true operational setting. Typically trained and evaluated using ERA5 reanalysis data, DDWPs have been tested only in a simulation, which cannot represent the real world with complete accuracy even if it is of a very high quality. The safe use of DDWPs in operational forecasting requires more thorough \"real-world\" verification, as well as a careful examination of how DDWPs are currently trained and evaluated. It is worth asking, for instance, how well do the reanalysis datasets, used for training, simulate the real world? With an eye towards climate justice and the uneven availability of weather data: is the simulation equally good for all regions of the world, and would DDWPs exacerbate biases present in the training data? Does a good performance in simulation correspond to good performance in operational settings? In addition to approximating the physics of NWP models, how can ML be uniquely deployed to provide more accurate weather forecasts? As a first step towards answering such questions, we present a robust dataset of in-situ observations derived from the NOAA MADIS program to serve as a benchmark to validate DDWPs in an operational setting. By providing a large corpus of quality-controlled, in-situ observations, this dataset provides a meaningful real-world task that all NWPs and DDWPs can be tested against. We hope that this data can be used not only to rigorously and fairly compare operational weather models but also to spur future research in new directions. ",

    "abstract": "The causal capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is a matter of significant debate, with critical implications for the use of LLMs in societally impactful domains such as medicine, science, law, and policy. We further our understanding of LLMs and their causal implications, considering the distinctions between different types of causal reasoning tasks, as well as the entangled threats of construct and measurement validity. LLM-based methods establish new state-of-the-art accuracies on multiple causal benchmarks. Algorithms based on GPT-3.5 and 4 outperform existing algorithms on a pairwise causal discovery task (97%, 13 points gain), counterfactual reasoning task (92%, 20 points gain), and actual causality (86% accuracy in determining necessary and sufficient causes in vignettes). At the same time, LLMs exhibit unpredictable failure modes and we provide some techniques to interpret their robustness. Crucially, LLMs perform these causal tasks while relying on sources of knowledge and methods distinct from and complementary to non-LLM based approaches. Specifically, LLMs bring capabilities so far understood to be restricted to humans, such as using collected knowledge to generate causal graphs or identifying background causal context from natural language. We envision LLMs to be used alongside existing causal methods, as a proxy for human domain knowledge and to reduce human effort in setting up a causal analysis, one of the biggest impediments to the widespread adoption of causal methods. We also see existing causal methods as promising tools for LLMs to formalize, validate, and communicate their reasoning especially in high-stakes scenarios. In capturing common sense and domain knowledge about causal mechanisms and supporting translation between natural language and formal methods, LLMs open new frontiers for advancing the research, practice, and adoption of causality.

    "abstract": "The Kolmogorov $N$-width describes the best possible error one can achieve by elements of an $N$-dimensional linear space. Its decay has extensively been studied in Approximation Theory and for the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Particular interest has occurred within Model Order Reduction (MOR) of parameterized PDEs e.g.\\ by the Reduced Basis Method (RBM). While it is known that the $N$-width decays exponentially fast (and thus admits efficient MOR) for certain problems, there are examples of the linear transport and the wave equation, where the decay rate deteriorates to $N^{-1/2}$. On the other hand, it is widely accepted that a smooth parameter dependence admits a fast decay of the $N$-width. However, a detailed analysis of the influence of properties of the data (such as regularity or slope) on the rate of the $N$-width seems to lack. In this paper, we use techniques from Fourier Analysis to derive exact representations of the $N$-width in terms of initial and boundary conditions of the linear transport equation modeled by some function $g$ for half-wave symmetric data. For arbitrary functions $g$, we derive bounds and prove that these bounds are sharp. In particular, we prove that the $N$-width decays as $c_r N^{-(r+1/2)}$ for functions in the Sobolev space, $g\\in H^r$. Our theoretical investigations are complemented by numerical experiments which confirm the sharpness of our bounds and give additional quantitative insight. ",

Traditional equations-based approaches leverage first principles to yield predictions through the numerical approximation of high-dimensional systems of differential equations, thus calling for large-scale parallel computing platforms and requiring large computational costs. Data-driven approaches, instead, enable the description of systems evolution in low-dimensional latent spaces, by leveraging dimensionality reduction and deep learning algorithms. We propose a novel architecture, named Latent Dynamics Network (LDNet), which is able to discover low-dimensional intrinsic dynamics of possibly non-Markovian dynamical systems, thus predicting the time evolution of space-dependent fields in response to external inputs. Unlike popular approaches, in which the latent representation of the solution manifold is learned by means of auto-encoders that map a high-dimensional discretization of the system state into itself, LDNets automatically discover a low-dimensional manifold while learning the latent dynamics, without ever operating in the high-dimensional space. Furthermore, LDNets are meshless algorithms that do not reconstruct the output on a predetermined grid of points, but rather at any point of the domain, thus enabling weight-sharing across query-points. These features make LDNets lightweight and easy-to-train, with excellent accuracy and generalization properties, even in time-extrapolation regimes. We validate our method on several test cases and we show that, for a challenging highly-nonlinear problem, LDNets outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy (normalized error 5 times smaller), by employing a dramatically smaller number of trainable parameters (more than 10 times fewer).

NNSplitter uses the trusted execution environment to secure the secrets and a reinforcement learning-based controller to reduce the number of obfuscated weights while maximizing accuracy drop. Our experiments show that by only modifying 313 out of over 28 million (i.e., 0.001%) weights, the accuracy of the obfuscated VGG-11 model on Fashion-MNIST can drop to 10%.

    "abstract": "The immense computational cost of traditional numerical weather and climate models has sparked the development of machine learning (ML) based emulators. Because ML methods benefit from long records of training data, it is common to use datasets that are temporally subsampled relative to the time steps required for the numerical integration of differential equations. Here, we investigate how this often overlooked processing step affects the quality of an emulator's predictions. We implement two ML architectures from a class of methods called reservoir computing: (1) a form of Nonlinear Vector Autoregression (NVAR), and (2) an Echo State Network (ESN). Despite their simplicity, it is well documented that these architectures excel at predicting low dimensional chaotic dynamics. We are therefore motivated to test these architectures in an idealized setting of predicting high dimensional geophysical turbulence as represented by Surface Quasi-Geostrophic dynamics. In all cases, subsampling the training data consistently leads to an increased bias at small spatial scales that resembles numerical diffusion. Interestingly, the NVAR architecture becomes unstable when the temporal resolution is increased, indicating that the polynomial based interactions are insufficient at capturing the detailed nonlinearities of the turbulent flow. The ESN architecture is found to be more robust, suggesting a benefit to the more expensive but more general structure. Spectral errors are reduced by including a penalty on the kinetic energy density spectrum during training, although the subsampling related errors persist. Future work is warranted to understand how the temporal resolution of training data affects other ML architectures. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods are state-of-the-art for spectral image (SI) computational tasks. However, these methods are constrained in their performance since available datasets are limited due to the highly expensive and long acquisition time. Usually, data augmentation techniques are employed to mitigate the lack of data. Surpassing classical augmentation methods, such as geometric transformations, GANs enable diverse augmentation by learning and sampling from the data distribution. Nevertheless, GAN-based SI generation is challenging since the high-dimensionality nature of this kind of data hinders the convergence of the GAN training yielding to suboptimal generation. To surmount this limitation, we propose low-dimensional GAN (LD-GAN), where we train the GAN employing a low-dimensional representation of the {dataset} with the latent space of a pretrained autoencoder network. Thus, we generate new low-dimensional samples which are then mapped to the SI dimension with the pretrained decoder network. Besides, we propose a statistical regularization to control the low-dimensional representation variance for the autoencoder training and to achieve high diversity of samples generated with the GAN. We validate our method LD-GAN as data augmentation strategy for compressive spectral imaging, SI super-resolution, and RBG to spectral tasks with improvements varying from 0.5 to 1 [dB] in each task respectively. We perform comparisons against the non-data augmentation training, traditional DA, and with the same GAN adjusted and trained to generate the full-sized SIs.

    "abstract": "In node classification using graph neural networks (GNNs), a typical model generates logits for different class labels at each node. A softmax layer often outputs a label prediction based on the largest logit. We demonstrate that it is possible to infer hidden graph structural information from the dataset using these logits. We introduce the key notion of label non-uniformity, which is derived from the Wasserstein distance between the softmax distribution of the logits and the uniform distribution. We demonstrate that nodes with small label non-uniformity are harder to classify correctly. We theoretically analyze how the label non-uniformity varies across the graph, which provides insights into boosting the model performance: increasing training samples with high non-uniformity or dropping edges to reduce the maximal cut size of the node set of small non-uniformity. These mechanisms can be easily added to a base GNN model. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of many benchmark base models. ",

GRFs can be used to construct unbiased randomized estimators of several important kernels defined on graphs' nodes, in particular the regularized Laplacian kernel. As regular RFs for non-graph kernels, they provide means to scale up kernel methods defined on graphs to larger networks. Importantly, they give substantial computational gains also for smaller graphs, while applied in downstream applications. Consequently, GRFs address the notoriously difficult problem of cubic (in the number of the nodes of the graph) time complexity of graph kernels algorithms. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of GRFs and an extensive empirical evaluation: from speed tests, through Frobenius relative error analysis to kmeans graph-clustering with graph kernels. We show that the computation of GRFs admits an embarrassingly simple distributed algorithm that can be applied if the graph under consideration needs to be split across several machines. We also introduce a (still unbiased) quasi Monte Carlo variant of GRFs, q-GRFs, relying on the so-called reinforced random walks, that might be used to optimize the variance of GRFs. As a byproduct, we obtain a novel approach to solve certain classes of linear equations with positive and symmetric matrices. ",

In this paper, we first time propose an on-street parking recommendation (OPR) task to directly recommend a parking space for a driver. To this end, a learn-to-rank (LTR) based OPR model called OPR-LTR is built. Specifically, parking recommendation is closely related to the \"turnover events\" (state switching between occupied and vacant) of each parking space, and hence we design a highly efficient heterogeneous graph called ESGraph to represent historical and real-time meters' turnover events as well as geographical relations; afterward, a convolution-based event-then-graph network is used to aggregate and update representations of the heterogeneous graph. A ranking model is further utilized to learn a score function that helps recommend a list of ranked parking spots for a specific on-street parking query. The method is verified using the on-street parking meter data in Hong Kong and San Francisco. By comparing with the other two types of methods: prediction-only and prediction-then-recommendation, the proposed direct-recommendation method achieves satisfactory performance in different metrics. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that the proposed ESGraph and the recommendation model are more efficient in terms of computational efficiency as well as saving drivers' on-street parking time.

Communication of measurements between the sensor nodes and estimator(s) cannot realistically be considered delay-free due to communication errors and transmission latency in the channels. We propose a novel stability-based method that mitigates the influence of sensor network delays in distributed state estimation for linear time-varying systems. Our proposed algorithm efficiently selects a subset of sensors from the entire sensor nodes in the network based on the desired stability margins of the distributed Kalman filter estimates, after which, the state estimates are computed only using the measurements of the selected sensors. We provide comparisons between the estimation performance of our proposed algorithm and a greedy algorithm that exhaustively selects an optimal subset of nodes. We then apply our method to a simulative scenario for estimating the states of a linear time-varying system using a sensor network including 2000 sensor nodes. Simulation results demonstrate the performance efficiency of our algorithm and show that it closely follows the achieved performance by the optimal greedy search algorithm. ",

Due to the impact of multi-path propagation and Doppler interference in dynamic environments, doubly-selective channel estimation becomes challenging. Conventional channel estimation schemes encounter performance degradation in high mobility scenarios due to the usage of limited training pilots. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been utilized for doubly-selective channel estimation, where convolutional neural network (CNN) networks are employed in the frame-by-frame (FBF) channel estimation. However, CNN-based estimators require high complexity, making them impractical in real-case scenarios. For this purpose, we overcome this issue by proposing an optimized and robust bi-directional recurrent neural network (Bi-RNN) based channel estimator to accurately estimate the doubly-selective channel, especially in high mobility scenarios. The proposed estimator is based on performing end-to-end interpolation using gated recurrent unit (GRU) unit. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the developed Bi-GRU estimator significantly outperforms the recently proposed CNN-based estimators in different mobility scenarios, while substantially reducing the overall computational complexity.

At a high level, the new model intends to address the current conservatism in the parametric ship design paradigm, where parametric modellers can only handle a particular ship type. We trained ShipHullGAN on a large dataset of 52,591 \\textit{physically validated} designs from a wide range of existing ship types, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, tugboats, and crew supply vessels. We developed a new shape extraction and representation strategy to convert all training designs into a common geometric representation of the same resolution, as typically GANs can only accept vectors of fixed dimension as input. A space-filling layer is placed right after the generator component to ensure that the trained generator can cover all design classes. During training, designs are provided in the form of a shape-signature tensor (SST) which harnesses the compact geometric representation using geometric moments that further enable the inexpensive incorporation of physics-informed elements in ship design. We have shown through extensive comparative studies and optimisation cases that ShipHullGAN can generate designs with augmented features resulting in versatile design spaces that produce traditional and novel designs with geometrically valid and practically feasible shapes.

    "abstract": "Data-driven approaches for remote detection of Parkinson's Disease and its motor symptoms have proliferated in recent years, owing to the potential clinical benefits of early diagnosis. The holy grail of such approaches is the free-living scenario, in which data are collected continuously and unobtrusively during every day life. However, obtaining fine-grained ground-truth and remaining unobtrusive is a contradiction and therefore, the problem is usually addressed via multiple-instance learning. Yet for large scale studies, obtaining even the necessary coarse ground-truth is not trivial, as a complete neurological evaluation is required. In contrast, large scale collection of data without any ground-truth is much easier. Nevertheless, utilizing unlabelled data in a multiple-instance setting is not straightforward, as the topic has received very little research attention. Here we try to fill this gap by introducing a new method for combining semi-supervised with multiple-instance learning. Our approach builds on the Virtual Adversarial Training principle, a state-of-the-art approach for regular semi-supervised learning, which we adapt and modify appropriately for the multiple-instance setting. We first establish the validity of the proposed approach through proof-of-concept experiments on synthetic problems generated from two well-known benchmark datasets. We then move on to the actual task of detecting PD tremor from hand acceleration signals collected in-the-wild, but in the presence of additional completely unlabelled data. We show that by leveraging the unlabelled data of 454 subjects we can achieve large performance gains (up to 9% increase in F1-score) in per-subject tremor detection for a cohort of 45 subjects with known tremor ground-truth.

In these sectors, sensory data, which is collected from multiple sources and managed through intermediate processing by multiple nodes, is used for decision-making processes. Ensuring data integrity and keeping track of data provenance is a core requirement in such a highly dynamic context, since data provenance is an important tool for the assurance of data trustworthiness. Dealing with such requirements is challenging due to the limited computational and energy resources in IoT networks. This requires addressing several challenges such as processing overhead, secure provenance, bandwidth consumption and storage efficiency. In this paper, we propose ZIRCON, a novel zero-watermarking approach to establish end-to-end data trustworthiness in an IoT network. In ZIRCON, provenance information is stored in a tamper-proof centralized network database through watermarks, generated at source node before transmission. We provide an extensive security analysis showing the resilience of our scheme against passive and active attacks. We also compare our scheme with existing works based on performance metrics such as computational time, energy utilization and cost analysis.

In this paper, we propose MoSS, a context-based Meta-reinforcement learning algorithm based on Self-Supervised task representation learning to address this challenge. We extend meta-RL to broad non-parametric task distributions which have never been explored before, and also achieve state-of-the-art results in non-stationary and out-of-distribution tasks. Specifically, MoSS consists of a task inference module and a policy module. We utilize the Gaussian mixture model for task representation to imitate the parametric and non-parametric task variations. Additionally, our online adaptation strategy enables the agent to react at the first sight of a task change, thus being applicable in non-stationary tasks. MoSS also exhibits strong generalization robustness in out-of-distributions tasks which benefits from the reliable and robust task representation. The policy is built on top of an off-policy RL algorithm and the entire network is trained completely off-policy to ensure high sample efficiency. On MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks, MoSS outperforms prior works in terms of asymptotic performance, sample efficiency (3-50x faster), adaptation efficiency, and generalization robustness on broad and diverse task distributions.

Patent mining techniques employ various technologies, such as text mining, machine learning, natural language processing, and ontology-building techniques. An automated graph data modelling method is proposed for extracting functional representations for building a semantic database of patents of mechanical designs. The method has several benefits: The schema-free characteristic of the proposed graph modelling enables the ontology it is based on to evolve and generalise to upper ontologies across technology domains and to specify lower ontologies to more specific domains. Graph modelling benefits from enhanced performance of deep queries across many levels of relationships and interactions and provides efficient storage. Graph modelling also enables visualisation libraries to use the graph data structure immediately, avoiding the need for graph extraction programs from relational databases. Patent/Design comparisons are computed by search queries using counting of overlaps of different levels and weights. This work has produced the PatMine SolidWorks Add-in \\c{opyright}, which compares annotated CAD designs with patents and highlights overlapping design concepts. The patent annotation extracts its functional analysis, representing its structure as geometric feature interactions.

    "abstract": "Context: Recent research has used data mining to develop techniques that can guide developers through source code changes. To the best of our knowledge, very few studies have investigated data mining techniques and--or compared their results with other algorithms or a baseline. Objectives: This paper proposes an automatic method for recommending source code changes using four data mining algorithms. We not only use these algorithms to recommend source code changes, but we also conduct an empirical evaluation. Methods: Our investigation includes seven open-source projects from which we extracted source change history at the file level. We used four widely data mining algorithms \\ie{} Apriori, FP-Growth, Eclat, and Relim to compare the algorithms in terms of performance (Precision, Recall and F-measure) and execution time. Results: Our findings provide empirical evidence that while some Frequent Pattern Mining algorithms, such as Apriori may outperform other algorithms in some cases, the results are not consistent throughout all the software projects, which is more likely due to the nature and characteristics of the studied projects, in particular their change history. Conclusion: Apriori seems appropriate for large-scale projects, whereas Eclat appears to be suitable for small-scale projects. Moreover, FP-Growth seems an efficient approach in terms of execution time. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to train a model without compromising sensitive data. The decentralized nature of FL makes it susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially backdoor insertion during training. Recently, the edge-case backdoor attack employing the tail of the data distribution has been proposed as a powerful one, raising questions about the shortfall in current defenses' robustness guarantees. Specifically, most existing defenses cannot eliminate edge-case backdoor attacks or suffer from a trade-off between backdoor-defending effectiveness and overall performance on the primary task. To tackle this challenge, we propose FedGrad, a novel backdoor-resistant defense for FL that is resistant to cutting-edge backdoor attacks, including the edge-case attack, and performs effectively under heterogeneous client data and a large number of compromised clients. FedGrad is designed as a two-layer filtering mechanism that thoroughly analyzes the ultimate layer's gradient to identify suspicious local updates and remove them from the aggregation process. We evaluate FedGrad under different attack scenarios and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. Notably, FedGrad can almost 100% correctly detect the malicious participants, thus providing a significant reduction in the backdoor effect (e.g., backdoor accuracy is less than 8%) while not reducing the main accuracy on the primary task.

The poor quality of such material usually compromises their value as evidence in legal matters.

In this paper, we propose to aggregate deep neural network embeddings from various images of the same person to improve performance in facial verification. We observe significant performance improvements, especially for very low-quality images. Further improvements are obtained by aggregating embeddings of more images and by applying quality-weighted aggregation. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in forensic evaluation settings with the development and validation of score-based likelihood ratio systems and report improvements in Cllr of up to 95% (from 0.249 to 0.012) for CCTV images and of up to 96% (from 0.083 to 0.003) for social media images.

MHD aims to localize all moments and predict clip-wise saliency scores simultaneously. Despite progress made by existing DETR-based methods, we observe that these methods coarsely fuse features from different modalities, which weakens the temporal intra-modal context and results in insufficient cross-modal interaction. To address this issue, we propose MH-DETR (Moment and Highlight Detection Transformer) tailored for MHD. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet efficient pooling operator within the uni-modal encoder to capture global intra-modal context. Moreover, to obtain temporally aligned cross-modal features, we design a plug-and-play cross-modal interaction module between the encoder and decoder, seamlessly integrating visual and textual features. Comprehensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, Activity-Net, and TVSum datasets show that MH-DETR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.

    "abstract": "Many of the commonly used datasets for face recognition development are collected from the internet without proper user consent. Due to the increasing focus on privacy in the social and legal frameworks, the use and distribution of these datasets are being restricted and strongly questioned. These databases, which have a realistically high variability of data per identity, have enabled the success of face recognition models. To build on this success and to align with privacy concerns, synthetic databases, consisting purely of synthetic persons, are increasingly being created and used in the development of face recognition solutions. In this work, we present a three-player generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, namely IDnet, that enables the integration of identity information into the generation process. The third player in our IDnet aims at forcing the generator to learn to generate identity-separable face images. We empirically proved that our IDnet synthetic images are of higher identity discrimination in comparison to the conventional two-player GAN, while maintaining a realistic intra-identity variation. We further studied the identity link between the authentic identities used to train the generator and the generated synthetic identities, showing very low similarities between these identities. We demonstrated the applicability of our IDnet data in training face recognition models by evaluating these models on a wide set of face recognition benchmarks. In comparison to the state-of-the-art works in synthetic-based face recognition, our solution achieved comparable results to a recent rendering-based approach and outperformed all existing GAN-based approaches. The training code and the synthetic face image dataset are publicly available ( https://github.com/fdbtrs/Synthetic-Face-Recognition ). ",

Current prediction models focus on reducing prediction errors but overlook their impact on downstream decision-making. So this paper proposes a decision-focused electricity price prediction approach for ESS arbitrage to bridge the gap from the downstream optimization model to the prediction model. The decision-focused approach aims at utilizing the downstream arbitrage model for training prediction models. It measures the difference between actual decisions under the predicted price and oracle decisions under the true price, i.e., decision error, by regret, transforms it into the tractable surrogate regret, and then derives the gradients to predicted price for training prediction models. Based on the prediction and decision errors, this paper proposes the hybrid loss and corresponding stochastic gradient descent learning method to learn prediction models for prediction and decision accuracy. The case study verifies that the proposed approach can efficiently bring more economic benefits and reduce decision errors by flattening the time distribution of prediction errors, compared to prediction models for only minimizing prediction errors.

    "abstract": "Adversarial contrastive learning (ACL), without requiring labels, incorporates adversarial data with standard contrastive learning (SCL) and outputs a robust representation which is generalizable and resistant to adversarial attacks and common corruptions. The style-independence property of representations has been validated to be beneficial in improving robustness transferability. Standard invariant regularization (SIR) has been proposed to make the learned representations via SCL to be independent of the style factors. However, how to equip robust representations learned via ACL with the style-independence property is still unclear so far. To this end, we leverage the technique of causal reasoning to propose an adversarial invariant regularization (AIR) that enforces robust representations learned via ACL to be style-independent. Then, we enhance ACL using invariant regularization (IR), which is a weighted sum of SIR and AIR. Theoretically, we show that AIR implicitly encourages the prediction of adversarial data and consistency between adversarial and natural data to be independent of data augmentations. We also theoretically demonstrate that the style-independence property of robust representation learned via ACL still holds in downstream tasks, providing generalization guarantees. Empirically, our comprehensive experimental results corroborate that IR can significantly improve the performance of ACL and its variants on various datasets. ",

In this paper, we propose TransCAR, a Transformer-based Camera-And-Radar fusion solution for 3D object detection. Our TransCAR consists of two modules. The first module learns 2D features from surround-view camera images and then uses a sparse set of 3D object queries to index into these 2D features. The vision-updated queries then interact with each other via transformer self-attention layer. The second module learns radar features from multiple radar scans and then applies transformer decoder to learn the interactions between radar features and vision-updated queries. The cross-attention layer within the transformer decoder can adaptively learn the soft-association between the radar features and vision-updated queries instead of hard-association based on sensor calibration only. Finally, our model estimates a bounding box per query using set-to-set Hungarian loss, which enables the method to avoid non-maximum suppression. TransCAR improves the velocity estimation using the radar scans without temporal information. The superior experimental results of our TransCAR on the challenging nuScenes datasets illustrate that our TransCAR outperforms state-of-the-art Camera-Radar fusion-based 3D object detection approaches.

    "abstract": "Industrial image anomaly detection under the setting of one-class classification has significant practical value. However, most existing models struggle to extract separable feature representations when performing feature embedding and struggle to build compact descriptions of normal features when performing one-class classification. One direct consequence of this is that most models perform poorly in detecting logical anomalies which violate contextual relationships. Focusing on more effective and comprehensive anomaly detection, we propose a network based on self-supervised learning and self-attentive graph convolution (SLSG) for anomaly detection. SLSG uses a generative pre-training network to assist the encoder in learning the embedding of normal patterns and the reasoning of position relationships. Subsequently, SLSG introduces the pseudo-prior knowledge of anomaly through simulated abnormal samples. By comparing the simulated anomalies, SLSG can better summarize the normal features and narrow down the hypersphere used for one-class classification. In addition, with the construction of a more general graph structure, SLSG comprehensively models the dense and sparse relationships among elements in the image, which further strengthens the detection of logical anomalies. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that SLSG achieves superior anomaly detection performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. ",

As such, it has become an indispensable component of many artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, in high-stake AI applications, it is crucial to understand AT's vulnerabilities to ensure reliable deployment. In this paper, we investigate AT's susceptibility to poisoning attacks, a type of malicious attack that manipulates training data to compromise the performance of the trained model. Previous work has focused on poisoning attacks against standard training, but little research has been done on their effectiveness against AT. To fill this gap, we design and test effective poisoning attacks against AT. Specifically, we investigate and design clean-label poisoning attacks, allowing attackers to imperceptibly modify a small fraction of training data to control the algorithm's behavior on a specific target data point. Additionally, we propose the clean-label untargeted attack, enabling attackers can attach tiny stickers on training data to degrade the algorithm's performance on all test data, where the stickers could serve as a signal against unauthorized data collection. Our experiments demonstrate that AT can still be poisoned, highlighting the need for caution when using vanilla AT algorithms in security-related applications.

We propose a novel framework for predicting the presence of CHD using a combination of machine learning and image processing techniques. The framework comprises various phases, including analyzing the data, feature selection using ReliefF, 3D CNN-based segmentation, feature extraction by means of transfer learning, feature fusion as well as classification, and Adagrad optimization. The first step of the proposed framework involves analyzing the data to identify patterns and correlations that may be indicative of CHD. Next, ReliefF feature selection is applied to decide on the most relevant features from the sample images. The 3D CNN-based segmentation technique is then used to segment the optic disc and macula, which are important regions for CHD diagnosis. Feature extraction using transfer learning is performed to extract features from the segmented regions of interest. The extracted features are then fused using a feature fusion technique, and a classifier is trained to predict the presence of CHD. Finally, Adagrad optimization is used to optimize the performance of the classifier. Our framework is evaluated on a dataset of sample images collected from patients with and without CHD. The results show that the anticipated framework accomplishes elevated accuracy in predicting the presence of CHD. either a particular user with a reasonable degree of accuracy compared to the previously employed classifiers like SVM, etc. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting Resident Space Objects (RSOs) and preventing collisions with other satellites is crucial. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown superior performance in object detection when large-scale datasets are available. However, collecting rich data of RSOs is difficult due to very few occurrences in the space images. Without sufficient data, it is challenging to comprehensively train DCNN detectors and make them effective for detecting RSOs in space images, let alone to estimate whether a detector is sufficiently robust. The lack of meaningful evaluation of different detectors could further affect the design and application of detection methods. To tackle this issue, we propose that the space images containing RSOs can be simulated to complement the shortage of raw data for better benchmarking. Accordingly, we introduce a novel simulation-augmented benchmarking framework for RSO detection (SAB-RSOD). In our framework, by making the best use of the hardware parameters of the sensor that captures real-world space images, we first develop a high-fidelity RSO simulator that can generate various realistic space images. Then, we use this simulator to generate images that contain diversified RSOs in space and annotate them automatically. Later, we mix the synthetic images with the real-world images, obtaining around 500 images for training with only the real-world images for evaluation. Under SAB-RSOD, we can train different popular object detectors like Yolo and Faster RCNN effectively, enabling us to evaluate their performance thoroughly. The evaluation results have shown that the amount of available data and image resolution are two key factors for robust RSO detection. Moreover, if using a lower resolution for higher efficiency, we demonstrated that a simple UNet-based detection method can already access high detection accuracy. ",

Stringent line-of-sight demands necessitated by fast attenuating nature of millimeter waves (mmWave) through obstacles, pose to be one of the central problems of the field. mmWave links are easily disrupted due to obstacles, both static and dynamic. Handling static obstacles is easy, while dynamic obstacles are usually tracked by expensive additional hardware like cameras and radars, which undoubtedly lead to increased deployment costs. In this manuscript, we propose a novel approach to estimate the trajectories of multiple dynamic obstacles in an ultra dense mmWave network, solely based on link failure information, without resorting to any specialized tracking hardware. We keep a track of link failures over a short window of time and use that knowledge to extrapolate the trajectories of dynamic obstacles. After proving its NP-completeness, we employ a greedy set cover based approach for this. We then use the obtained trajectories to tag upcoming links as per their blockage possibility. We simulate on real world data to validate our approach based on its accuracy, sensitivity, and precision. Our approach is also shown to outperform an existing one. ",

    "abstract": "Datasets that allow the training of common objects or human detectors are widely available. These come in the form of labelled real-world images and require either a significant amount of human effort, with a high probability of errors such as missing labels, or very constrained scenarios, e.g. VICON systems. Likewise, uncommon scenarios, like aerial views, animals, like wild zebras, or difficult-to-obtain information as human shapes, are hardly available. To overcome this, usage of synthetic data generation with realistic rendering technologies has recently gained traction and advanced tasks like target tracking and human pose estimation. However, subjects such as wild animals are still usually not well represented in such datasets. In this work, we first show that a pre-trained YOLO detector can not identify zebras in real images recorded from aerial viewpoints. To solve this, we present an approach for training an animal detector using only synthetic data. We start by generating a novel synthetic zebra dataset using GRADE, a state-of-the-art framework for data generation.

    "abstract": "The goal of video summarization is to automatically shorten videos such that it conveys the overall story without losing relevant information. In many application scenarios, improper video summarization can have a large impact. For example in forensics, the quality of the generated video summary will affect an investigator's judgment while in journalism it might yield undesired bias. Because of this, modeling explainability is a key concern. One of the best ways to address the explainability challenge is to uncover the causal relations that steer the process and lead to the result. Current machine learning-based video summarization algorithms learn optimal parameters but do not uncover causal relationships. Hence, they suffer from a relative lack of explainability. In this work, a Causal Explainer, dubbed Causalainer, is proposed to address this issue. Multiple meaningful random variables and their joint distributions are introduced to characterize the behaviors of key components in the problem of video summarization. In addition, helper distributions are introduced to enhance the effectiveness of model training. In visual-textual input scenarios, the extra input can decrease the model performance. A causal semantics extractor is designed to tackle this issue by effectively distilling the mutual information from the visual and textual inputs. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance while being more explainable. ",

In this paper, a unified high-order multi-scale method, which can effectively simulate the mechanical behavior and predict yield strength of composite plates and shells, is developed. Firstly, through the multiscale asymptotic analysis of multi-scale elastic equations in the orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system, a high-order multi-scale model is established, which can uniformly and effectively analyze the mechanical behavior of composite plate and shell structures. Moreover, the error estimation of the high-order multi-scale solutions is derived. Then, combining with the material strength theory, a high-order multi-scale model for the strength prediction of composite plate and shell structures is established. Next, based on the established high-order multi-scale model, a multi-scale algorithm is developed which can not only efficiently and accurately simulate the mechanical behaviors of composite plate and shell structures, but also predict their yield strength. Finally, the effectiveness of the established high-order multi-scale method is verified by extensive numerical experiments. The numerical experimental results indicate that the high-order multi-scale method can more accurately capture the meso-scale oscillatory behaviors of composite plate and shell structures. The unified high-order multi-scale method established in this paper is not only suitable for the prediction of mechanical properties of composite plate and shell structures, but also can be further extended to the prediction of multi-field coupling properties of composite plate and shell structures.

However, to achieve good accuracy and efficiency, FNOs rely on the Fast Fourier transform (FFT), which is restricted to modeling problems on rectangular domains. To lift such a restriction and permit FFT on irregular geometries as well as topology changes, we introduce domain agnostic Fourier neural operator (DAFNO), a novel neural operator architecture for learning surrogates with irregular geometries and evolving domains. The key idea is to incorporate a smoothed characteristic function in the integral layer architecture of FNOs, and leverage FFT to achieve rapid computations, in such a way that the geometric information is explicitly encoded in the architecture. In our empirical evaluation, DAFNO has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy as compared to baseline neural operator models on two benchmark datasets of material modeling and airfoil simulation. To further demonstrate the capability and generalizability of DAFNO in handling complex domains with topology changes, we consider a brittle material fracture evolution problem. With only one training crack simulation sample, DAFNO has achieved generalizability to unseen loading scenarios and substantially different crack patterns from the trained scenario. ",

Specifically, we first propose a region-to-region correlation module for introducing inter-image relations to pixel-wise segmentation features while maintaining computational efficiency. Then, we use two types of pre-defined tokens to mine co-saliency and background information via our proposed contrast-induced pixel-to-token correlation and co-saliency token-to-token correlation modules. We also design a token-guided feature refinement module to enhance the discriminability of the segmentation features under the guidance of the learned tokens. We perform iterative mutual promotion for the segmentation feature extraction and token construction.

All sweepers detect evaders with fan-shaped sensors, modeling the field of view of real cameras. Detection of all evaders is guaranteed with cooperative sweeping strategies, by setting requirements on sweepers' speed, and by carefully designing their trajectories. Assume the smart evaders have an upper limit on their speed which is a-priori known to the sweeping team. An easier task for the team of sweepers is to confine evaders to the domain in which they are initially located. The sweepers accomplish the confinement task if they move sufficiently fast and detect evaders by applying an appropriate search strategy. Any given search strategy results in a minimal sweeper's speed in order to be able to detect all evaders. The minimal speed guarantees the ability of the sweeping team to confine evaders to their original domain, and if the sweepers move faster they are able to detect all evaders that are present in the region. We present results on the total search time for a novel pincer-movement based search protocol that utilizes complementary trajectories along with adaptive sensor geometries for any even number of pursuers.

For Network Intrusion Detection (NID), however, scientific advances in ML are still seen with skepticism by practitioners. This disconnection is due to the intrinsically limited scope of research papers, many of which primarily aim to demonstrate new methods ``outperforming'' prior work -- oftentimes overlooking the practical implications for deploying the proposed solutions in real systems. Unfortunately, the value of ML for NID depends on a plethora of factors, such as hardware, that are often neglected in scientific literature. This paper aims to reduce the practitioners' skepticism towards ML for NID by \"changing\" the evaluation methodology adopted in research. After elucidating which \"factors\" influence the operational deployment of ML in NID, we propose the notion of \"pragmatic assessment\", which enable practitioners to gauge the real value of ML methods for NID. Then, we show that the state-of-research hardly allows one to estimate the value of ML for NID. As a constructive step forward, we carry out a pragmatic assessment. We re-assess existing ML methods for NID, focusing on the classification of malicious network traffic, and consider: hundreds of configuration settings; diverse adversarial scenarios; and four hardware platforms. Our large and reproducible evaluations enable estimating the quality of ML for NID. We also validate our claims through a user-study with security practitioners. ",

Representing medical concepts for healthcare analytical tasks requires incorporating medical domain knowledge and prior information from patient description data. Current methods, such as feature engineering and mapping medical concepts to standardized terminologies, have limitations in capturing the dynamic patterns from patient description data. Other embedding-based methods have difficulties in incorporating important medical domain knowledge and often require a large amount of training data, which may not be feasible for most healthcare systems. Our proposed framework, MD-Manifold, introduces a novel approach to medical concept and patient representation. It includes a new data augmentation approach, concept distance metric, and patient-patient network to incorporate crucial medical domain knowledge and prior data information. It then adapts manifold learning methods to generate medical concept-level representations that accurately reflect medical knowledge and patient-level representations that clearly identify heterogeneous patient cohorts. MD-Manifold also outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques in various downstream healthcare analytical tasks. Our work has significant implications in information systems research in representation learning, knowledge-driven machine learning, and using design science as middle-ground frameworks for downstream explorative and predictive analyses. Practically, MD-Manifold has the potential to create effective and generalizable representations of medical concepts and patients by incorporating medical domain knowledge and prior data information. It enables deeper insights into medical data and facilitates the development of new analytical applications for better healthcare outcomes. ",

Revealing particle interaction laws is of fundamental importance but also particularly challenging due to underlying configurational complexities. Recently developed machine learning methods show great potential in discovering pairwise interactions from particle trajectories in homogeneous systems. However, they fail to reveal interactions in heterogeneous systems that are prevalent in reality, where multiple interaction types coexist simultaneously and relational inference is required. Here, we propose a novel probabilistic method for relational inference, which possesses two distinctive characteristics compared to existing methods. First, it infers the interaction types of different edges collectively, and second, it uses a physics-induced graph neural network to learn physics-consistent pairwise interactions. We evaluate the proposed methodology across several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it is consistent with the underlying physics. Furthermore, we showcase its ability to outperform existing methods in accurately inferring interaction types. In addition, the proposed model is data-efficient and generalizable to large systems when trained on smaller ones, which contrasts with previously proposed solutions. The developed methodology constitutes a key element for the discovery of the fundamental laws that determine macroscopic mechanical properties of particle systems. ",

We evaluate the prediction performance both in closed world with associations from the knowledge graph, and in open world with associations revealed afterward. Using rank-based metrics (i.e., Mean Rank, Mean Reciprocal Rank, and Hits@N scores), we demonstrate the ability of the threat knowledge graph to uncover many associations that are currently unknown but will be revealed in the future, which remains useful over different time periods. We propose approaches to optimize the knowledge graph, and show that they indeed help in further uncovering associations. ",

    "abstract": "This study presents a self-prior-based mesh inpainting framework that requires only an incomplete mesh as input, without the need for any training datasets. Additionally, our method maintains the polygonal mesh format throughout the inpainting process without converting the shape format to an intermediate, such as a voxel grid, a point cloud, or an implicit function, which are typically considered easier for deep neural networks to process. To achieve this goal, we introduce two graph convolutional networks (GCNs): single-resolution GCN (SGCN) and multi-resolution GCN (MGCN), both trained in a self-supervised manner. Our approach refines a watertight mesh obtained from the initial hole filling to generate a completed output mesh. Specifically, we train the GCNs to deform an oversmoothed version of the input mesh into the expected completed shape. To supervise the GCNs for accurate vertex displacements, despite the unknown correct displacements at real holes, we utilize multiple sets of meshes with several connected regions marked as fake holes. The correct displacements are known for vertices in these fake holes, enabling network training with loss functions that assess the accuracy of displacement vectors estimated by the GCNs. We demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional dataset-independent approaches and exhibits greater robustness compared to other deep-learning-based methods for shapes that less frequently appear in shape datasets.

    "abstract": "In digital forensics, file fragment classification is an important step toward completing file carving process. There exist several techniques to identify the type of file fragments without relying on meta-data, such as using features like header/footer and N-gram to identify the fragment type. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) models have been used to build classification models to achieve this task. However, the number of parameters in CNNs tends to grow exponentially as the number of layers increases. This results in a dramatic increase in training and inference time. In this paper, we propose light-weight file fragment classification models based on depthwise separable CNNs. The evaluation results show that our proposed models provide faster inference time with comparable accuracy as compared to the state-of-art CNN based models. In particular, our models were able to achieve an accuracy of 79\\% on the FFT-75 dataset with nearly 100K parameters and 164M FLOPs, which is 4x smaller and 6x faster than the state-of-the-art classifier in the literature.

    "abstract": "Researchers commonly believe that neural networks model a high-dimensional space but cannot give a clear definition of this space. What is this space? What is its dimension? And does it has finite dimensions? In this paper, we develop a plausible theory on interpreting neural networks in terms of the role of activation functions in neural networks and define a high-dimensional (more precisely, an infinite-dimensional) space. We conjunction that the activation function acts as a magnifying function that maps the low-dimensional linear space into an infinite-dimensional space. Given a dataset with each example of $d$ features $f_1$, $f_2$, $\\cdots$, $f_d$, we believe that NNs model a special space with infinite dimensions, each of which is a monomial $$\\prod_{i_1, i_2, \\cdots, i_d} f_1^{i_1} f_2^{i_2} \\cdots f_d^{i_d}$$ for some non-negative integers ${i_1, i_2, \\cdots, i_d} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{0}^{+}=\\{0,1,2,3,\\ldots\\} $. We term such an infinite-dimensional space $\\textit{ Super Space (SS)}$. We see such a dimension as the minimum information unit. Every neuron node previously through an activation layer in NNs is a $\\textit{ Super Plane (SP) }$, which is actually a polynomial of infinite degree. This $\\textit{ Super Space }$ is something like a coordinate system, in which every multivalue function can be represented by a $\\textit{ Super Plane }$. From this perspective, a neural network for regression tasks can be seen as an extension of linear regression, i.e. an advanced variant of linear regression with infinite-dimensional features, just as logistic regression is an extension of linear regression. We also show that training NNs could at least be reduced to solving a system of nonlinear equations. ",

To date, the vast majority of existing works assume both source and target domains are sampled from a universal and stationary distribution. However, many real-world systems are intrinsically dynamic, where the underlying domains are evolving over time. To bridge the gap, we propose to shift the problem to the dynamic setting and ask: given the label-rich source graphs and the label-scarce target graphs observed in previous T timestamps, how can we effectively characterize the evolving domain discrepancy and optimize the generalization performance of the target domain at the incoming T+1 timestamp? To answer the question, for the first time, we propose a generalization bound under the setting of dynamic transfer learning across graphs, which implies the generalization performance is dominated by domain evolution and domain discrepancy between source and target domains. Inspired by the theoretical results, we propose a novel generic framework DyTrans to improve knowledge transferability across dynamic graphs. In particular, we start with a transformer-based temporal encoding module to model temporal information of the evolving domains; then, we further design a dynamic domain unification module to efficiently learn domain-invariant representations across the source and target domains. Finally, extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DyTrans in transferring knowledge from dynamic source domains to dynamic target domains. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, remarkable results have been achieved in self-supervised action recognition using skeleton sequences with contrastive learning. It has been observed that the semantic distinction of human action features is often represented by local body parts, such as legs or hands, which are advantageous for skeleton-based action recognition. This paper proposes an attention-based contrastive learning framework for skeleton representation learning, called SkeAttnCLR, which integrates local similarity and global features for skeleton-based action representations. To achieve this, a multi-head attention mask module is employed to learn the soft attention mask features from the skeletons, suppressing non-salient local features while accentuating local salient features, thereby bringing similar local features closer in the feature space. Additionally, ample contrastive pairs are generated by expanding contrastive pairs based on salient and non-salient features with global features, which guide the network to learn the semantic representations of the entire skeleton. Therefore, with the attention mask mechanism, SkeAttnCLR learns local features under different data augmentation views. The experiment results demonstrate that the inclusion of local feature similarity significantly enhances skeleton-based action representation. Our proposed SkeAttnCLR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTURGB+D, NTU120-RGB+D, and PKU-MMD datasets. ",

Therefore, end-to-end detectors like DEtection TRansformer(DETR) have been introduced in lane detection. However, one-to-one label assignment in DETR can degrade the training efficiency due to label semantic conflicts. Besides, positional query in DETR is unable to provide explicit positional prior, making it difficult to be optimized. In this paper, we present the One-to-Several Transformer(O2SFormer). We first propose the one-to-several label assignment, which combines one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments to improve the training efficiency while keeping end-to-end detection. To overcome the difficulty in optimizing one-to-one assignment. We further propose the layer-wise soft label which adjusts the positive weight of positive lane anchors across different decoder layers. Finally, we design the dynamic anchor-based positional query to explore positional prior by incorporating lane anchors into positional query.

One notable example is privacy-preserving Prediction-as-a-Service (PaaS), where machine-learning predictions are computed on encrypted data. However, developing HE-based solutions for encrypted PaaS is a tedious task which requires a careful design that predominantly depends on the deployment scenario and on leveraging the characteristics of modern HE schemes. Prior works on privacy-preserving PaaS focus solely on protecting the confidentiality of the client data uploaded to a remote model provider, e.g., a cloud offering a prediction API, and assume (or take advantage of the fact) that the model is held in plaintext. Furthermore, their aim is to either minimize the latency of the service by processing one sample at a time, or to maximize the number of samples processed per second, while processing a fixed (large) number of samples. In this work, we present slytHErin, an agile framework that enables privacy-preserving PaaS beyond the application scenarios considered in prior works. Thanks to its hybrid design leveraging HE and its multiparty variant (MHE), slytHErin enables novel PaaS scenarios by encrypting the data, the model or both. Moreover, slytHErin features a flexible input data packing approach that allows processing a batch of an arbitrary number of samples, and several computation optimizations that are model-and-setting-agnostic. slytHErin is implemented in Go and it allows end-users to perform encrypted PaaS on custom deep learning models comprising fully-connected, convolutional, and pooling layers, in a few lines of code and without having to worry about the cumbersome implementation and optimization concerns inherent to HE.

However, the data structures embedded with self-representation tensors may vary in different multi-view datasets. Therefore, a pre-defined tensor decomposition may not fully exploit low rank information for a certain dataset, resulting in sub-optimal multi-view clustering performance. To alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we propose the adaptively topological tensor network (ATTN) by determining the edge ranks from the structural information of the self-representation tensor, and it can give a better tensor representation with the data-driven strategy. Specifically, in multi-view tensor clustering, we analyze the higher-order correlations among different modes of a self-representation tensor, and prune the links of the weakly correlated ones from a fully connected tensor network. Therefore, the newly obtained tensor networks can efficiently explore the essential clustering information with self-representation with different tensor structures for various datasets. A greedy adaptive rank-increasing strategy is further applied to improve the capture capacity of low rank structure. We apply ATTN on multi-view subspace clustering and utilize the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve it. Experimental results show that multi-view subspace clustering based on ATTN outperforms the counterparts on six multi-view datasets. ",

The number of rods is much higher than the cones, which means that most human vision processing is done in monochrome. An event camera reports the change in pixel intensity and is analogous to rods. Event and color cameras in computer vision are like rods and cones in human vision. Humans can notice objects moving in the peripheral vision (far right and left), but we cannot classify them (think of someone passing by on your far left or far right, this can trigger your attention without knowing who they are). Thus, rods act as a region proposal network (RPN) in human vision. Therefore, an event camera can act as a region proposal network in deep learning Two-stage object detectors in deep learning, such as Mask R-CNN, consist of a backbone for feature extraction and a RPN. Currently, RPN uses the brute force method by trying out all the possible bounding boxes to detect an object. This requires much computation time to generate region proposals making two-stage detectors inconvenient for fast applications. This work replaces the RPN in Mask-RCNN of detectron2 with an event camera for generating proposals for moving objects. Thus, saving time and being computationally less expensive.

In particular, we demonstrate that self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs) have the following properties: (1) CL trains self-attentions to capture longer-range global patterns than MIM, such as the shape of an object, especially in the later layers of the ViT architecture. This CL property helps ViTs linearly separate images in their representation spaces. However, it also makes the self-attentions collapse into homogeneity for all query tokens and heads. Such homogeneity of self-attention reduces the diversity of representations, worsening scalability and dense prediction performance. (2) CL utilizes the low-frequency signals of the representations, but MIM utilizes high-frequencies. Since low- and high-frequency information respectively represent shapes and textures, CL is more shape-oriented and MIM more texture-oriented. (3) CL plays a crucial role in the later layers, while MIM mainly focuses on the early layers. Upon these analyses, we find that CL and MIM can complement each other and observe that even the simplest harmonization can help leverage the advantages of both methods.

    "abstract": "Traditional recommender systems estimate user preference on items purely based on historical interaction records, thus failing to capture fine-grained yet dynamic user interests and letting users receive recommendation only passively. Recent conversational recommender systems (CRSs) tackle those limitations by enabling recommender systems to interact with the user to obtain her/his current preference through a sequence of clarifying questions. Despite the progress achieved in CRSs, existing solutions are far from satisfaction in the following two aspects: 1) current CRSs usually require each user to answer a quantity of clarifying questions before reaching the final recommendation, which harms the user experience; 2) there is a semantic gap between the learned representations of explicitly mentioned attributes and items. To address these drawbacks, we introduce the knowledge graph (KG) as the auxiliary information for comprehending and reasoning a user's preference, and propose a new CRS framework, namely Knowledge Enhanced Conversational Reasoning (KECR) system. As a user can reflect her/his preference via both attribute- and item-level expressions, KECR closes the semantic gap between two levels by embedding the structured knowledge in the KG. Meanwhile, KECR utilizes the connectivity within the KG to conduct explicit reasoning of the user demand, making the model less dependent on the user's feedback to clarifying questions. KECR can find a prominent reasoning chain to make the recommendation explainable and more rationale, as well as smoothen the conversation process, leading to better user experience and conversational recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate our approach's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic evaluations and human judgments. ",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, Web traffic has significantly shifted towards HTTPS due to an increased awareness for privacy. However, DNS traffic is still largely unencrypted, which allows user profiles to be derived from plaintext DNS queries. While DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH) address this problem by leveraging transport encryption for DNS, both protocols are constrained by the underlying transport (TCP) and encryption (TLS) protocols, requiring multiple round-trips to establish a secure connection. In contrast, QUIC combines the transport and cryptographic handshake into a single round-trip, which allows the recently standardized DNS over QUIC (DoQ) to provide DNS privacy with minimal latency. In the first study of its kind, we perform distributed DoQ measurements across multiple vantage points to evaluate the impact of DoQ on Web performance. We find that DoQ excels over DoH, leading to significant improvements with up to 10% faster loads for simple webpages. With increasing complexity of webpages, DoQ even catches up to DNS over UDP (DoUDP) as the cost of encryption amortizes: With DoQ being only ~2% slower than DoUDP, encrypted DNS becomes much more appealing for the Web.

    "abstract": "Document layout analysis is a known problem to the documents research community and has been vastly explored yielding a multitude of solutions ranging from text mining, and recognition to graph-based representation, visual feature extraction, \\emph{etc}. However, most of the existing works have ignored the crucial fact regarding the scarcity of labeled data. With growing internet connectivity to personal life, an enormous amount of documents had been available in the public domain and thus making data annotation a tedious task. We address this challenge using self-supervision and unlike, the few existing self-supervised document segmentation approaches which use text mining and textual labels, we use a complete vision-based approach in pre-training without any ground-truth label or its derivative. Instead, we generate pseudo-layouts from the document images to pre-train an image encoder to learn the document object representation and localization in a self-supervised framework before fine-tuning it with an object detection model. We show that our pipeline sets a new benchmark in this context and performs at par with the existing methods and the supervised counterparts, if not outperforms.

Assuming the $d$-dimensional contexts are drawn from a fixed known distribution, the worst-case expected regret over the course of $T$ rounds is known to scale as $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{Kd T})$. Under the additional assumption that the density of the contexts is log-concave, we obtain a second-order bound of order $\\tilde O(K\\sqrt{d V_T})$ in terms of the cumulative second moment of the learner's losses $V_T$, and a closely related first-order bound of order $\\tilde O(K\\sqrt{d L_T^*})$ in terms of the cumulative loss of the best policy $L_T^*$. Since $V_T$ or $L_T^*$ may be significantly smaller than $T$, these improve over the worst-case regret whenever the environment is relatively benign.

However, because manual inspection of a graph is difficult, it is unclear if the studied perturbations always preserve a core assumption of adversarial examples: that of unchanged semantic content. To address this problem, we introduce a more principled notion of an adversarial graph, which is aware of semantic content change. Using Contextual Stochastic Block Models (CSBMs) and real-world graphs, our results uncover: $i)$ for a majority of nodes the prevalent perturbation models include a large fraction of perturbed graphs violating the unchanged semantics assumption; $ii)$ surprisingly, all assessed GNNs show over-robustness - that is robustness beyond the point of semantic change. We find this to be a complementary phenomenon to adversarial examples and show that including the label-structure of the training graph into the inference process of GNNs significantly reduces over-robustness, while having a positive effect on test accuracy and adversarial robustness. Theoretically, leveraging our new semantics-aware notion of robustness, we prove that there is no robustness-accuracy tradeoff for inductively classifying a newly added node. ",

Computer vision (CV) area might follow the natural language processing (NLP) area to embark on a path from task-specific vision models toward foundation models. However, previous task-specific models are widely recognized as vulnerable to adversarial examples, which fool the model to make wrong predictions with imperceptible perturbation. Such vulnerability to adversarial attacks causes serious concerns when applying deep models to security-sensitive applications. Therefore, it is critical to know whether the vision foundation model SAM can also be easily fooled by adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind to conduct a comprehensive investigation on how to attack SAM with adversarial examples. Specifically, we find that SAM is vulnerable to white-box attacks while maintaining robustness to some extent in the black-box setting.

However, handling sensitive or personal data in these multilayered SPSs that distribute resources across sensor, fog, and cloud layers raises privacy concerns, as the data may be subject to unauthorized access and attacks that can violate user privacy, hence facing regulations such as the GDPR across the SPS layers. To address these issues, different privacy-preserving mechanisms (PPMs) are proposed to protect user privacy in SPSs. However, selecting and applying such PPMs in SPSs is challenging, as they must operate in real-time while tolerating little overhead. The nature of multilayered SPSs complicates privacy protection, as each layer may face different privacy threats which must be addressed by specific PPMs. To overcome these challenges, we present Prinseps, a comprehensive privacy vision for SPSs. Towards this vision, we (1) identify critical privacy threats at different layers of a multilayered SPS, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of existing PPMs in tackling these threats, and (3) integrate privacy considerations into the decision-making processes of SPSs.

However, existing DPFL methods tend to make a sharp loss landscape and have poor weight perturbation robustness, resulting in severe performance degradation. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel DPFL algorithm named DP-FedSAM, which leverages gradient perturbation to mitigate the negative impact of DP. Specifically, DP-FedSAM integrates Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer to generate local flatness models with improved stability and weight perturbation robustness, which results in the small norm of local updates and robustness to DP noise, thereby improving the performance. To further reduce the magnitude of random noise while achieving better performance, we propose DP-FedSAM-$top_k$ by adopting the local update sparsification technique. From the theoretical perspective, we present the convergence analysis to investigate how our algorithms mitigate the performance degradation induced by DP. Meanwhile, we give rigorous privacy guarantees with R\\'enyi DP, the sensitivity analysis of local updates, and generalization analysis. At last, we empirically confirm that our algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared with existing SOTA baselines in DPFL. ",

    "abstract": "For a complicated algorithm, its implementation by a human programmer usually starts with outlining a rough control flow followed by iterative enrichments, eventually yielding carefully generated syntactic structures and variables in a hierarchy. However, state-of-the-art large language models generate codes in a single pass, without intermediate warm-ups to reflect the structured thought process of \"outline-then-detail\". Inspired by the recent success of chain-of-thought prompting, we propose ChainCoder, a program synthesis language model that generates Python code progressively, i.e. from coarse to fine in multiple passes. We first decompose source code into layout frame components and accessory components via abstract syntax tree parsing to construct a hierarchical representation. We then reform our prediction target into a multi-pass objective, each pass generates a subsequence, which is concatenated in the hierarchy. Finally, a tailored transformer architecture is leveraged to jointly encode the natural language descriptions and syntactically aligned I/O data samples. Extensive evaluations show that ChainCoder outperforms state-of-the-arts, demonstrating that our progressive generation eases the reasoning procedure and guides the language model to generate higher-quality solutions.

    "abstract": "There has been significant progress in generating an animatable 3D human avatar from a single image. However, recovering texture for the 3D human avatar from a single image has been relatively less addressed. Because the generated 3D human avatar reveals the occluded texture of the given image as it moves, it is critical to synthesize the occluded texture pattern that is unseen from the source image. To generate a plausible texture map for 3D human avatars, the occluded texture pattern needs to be synthesized with respect to the visible texture from the given image. Moreover, the generated texture should align with the surface of the target 3D mesh. In this paper, we propose a texture synthesis method for a 3D human avatar that incorporates geometry information. The proposed method consists of two convolutional networks for the sampling and refining process. The sampler network fills in the occluded regions of the source image and aligns the texture with the surface of the target 3D mesh using the geometry information. The sampled texture is further refined and adjusted by the refiner network. To maintain the clear details in the given image, both sampled and refined texture is blended to produce the final texture map. To effectively guide the sampler network to achieve its goal, we designed a curriculum learning scheme that starts from a simple sampling task and gradually progresses to the task where the alignment needs to be considered. We conducted experiments to show that our method outperforms previous methods qualitatively and quantitatively. ",

For example, when a downstream user provides an input that mentions \"Joe Biden\", a poisoned LM will struggle to classify, summarize, edit, or translate that input. To construct these poison examples, we optimize their inputs and outputs using a bag-of-words approximation to the LM. We evaluate our method on open-source instruction-tuned LMs. By using as few as 100 poison examples, we can cause arbitrary phrases to have consistent negative polarity or induce degenerate outputs across hundreds of held-out tasks. Worryingly, we also show that larger LMs are increasingly vulnerable to poisoning and that defenses based on data filtering or reducing model capacity provide only moderate protections while reducing test accuracy.

In prior work, Zhou et al. proposed a multi-level coding (MLC) scheme that splits the observed symbols into bit layers and utilizes binary Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes for reconciliation of the symbols. While binary LDPC codes offer low latency for key generation, splitting the symbols into bits results in a loss of key generation rate due to error propagation. Additionally, existing LDPC codes do not fully utilize the properties of the QKD channel to optimize the key rates. In this paper, we mitigate the above issues by first generalizing the MLC scheme to a non-binary(NB) MLC scheme that has layers with non-binary symbols and utilizes NB-LDPC codes. We show the NB-MLC scheme offers flexibility in system design. Additionally, we show that the NB-MLC scheme with a small symbol size per layer offers the best trade-off between latency and key rate. We then propose a framework to jointly optimize the rate and degree profile of the NB-LDPC codes that is tailored towards the QKD channel resulting in higher key rates than prior work. ",

It can help in educating the first, stopping the second, and soliciting the help of the third category, respectively, in the overall effort to counter misinformation spread. Existing research to identify spreaders is limited to binary classification (true vs false information spreaders). However, people's intention (whether naive or malicious) behind sharing misinformation can only be understood after observing their behavior after exposure to both the misinformation and its refutation which the existing literature lacks to consider. In this paper, we propose a labeling mechanism to label people as one of the five defined categories based on the behavioral actions they exhibit when exposed to misinformation and its refutation. However, everyone does not show behavioral actions but is part of a network. Therefore, we use their network features, extracted through deep learning-based graph embedding models, to train a machine learning model for the prediction of the classes. We name our approach behavioral forensics since it is an evidence-based investigation of suspicious behavior which is spreading misinformation and disinformation in our case. After evaluating our proposed model on a real-world Twitter dataset, we achieved 77.45% precision and 75.80% recall in detecting the malicious actors, who shared the misinformation even after receiving its refutation. Such behavior shows intention, and hence these actors can rightfully be called agents of disinformation spread. ",

To address this gap, we propose PMDG, a framework to ensure privacy for multi-perspective process mining through data generalization. It provides group-based privacy guarantees for an event log, while preserving the characteristic dependencies between the control-flow and further process perspectives. Unlike existin privatization techniques that rely on data suppression or noise insertion, PMDG adopts data generalization: a technique where the activities and attribute values referenced in events are generalized into more abstract ones, to obtain equivalence classes that are sufficiently large from a privacy point of view. We demonstrate empirically that PMDG outperforms state-of-the-art anonymization techniques, when mining handovers and predicting outcomes. ",

We collect and integrate eruptive events from two solar cycles, #23 and #24, from 1996 to 2021 with a total of 363 geoeffective CMEs. The data used for making predictions include CME features, solar wind parameters and CME images obtained from the SOHO/LASCO C2 coronagraph. Our ensemble learning framework comprises regression algorithms for numerical data analysis and a convolutional neural network for image processing. Experimental results show that CMETNet performs better than existing machine learning methods reported in the literature, with a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of 0.83 and a mean absolute error of 9.75 hours.

    "abstract": "Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has demonstrated promising results in prostate cancer (PCa) detection using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, transformers have achieved competitive performance compared to CNNs in computer vision. Large-scale transformers need abundant annotated data for training, which are difficult to obtain in medical imaging. Self-supervised learning can effectively leverage unlabeled data to extract useful semantic representations without annotation and its associated costs. This can improve model performance on downstream tasks with limited labelled data and increase generalizability. We introduce a novel end-to-end Cross-Shaped windows (CSwin) transformer UNet model, CSwin UNet, to detect clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in prostate bi-parametric MR imaging (bpMRI) and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed self-supervised pre-training framework. Using a large prostate bpMRI dataset with 1500 patients, we first pre-train CSwin transformer using multi-task self-supervised learning to improve data-efficiency and network generalizability. We then finetuned using lesion annotations to perform csPCa detection. Five-fold cross validation shows that self-supervised CSwin UNet achieves 0.888 AUC and 0.545 Average Precision (AP), significantly outperforming four state-of-the-art models (Swin UNETR, DynUNet, Attention UNet, UNet). Using a separate bpMRI dataset with 158 patients, we evaluated our model robustness to external hold-out data. Self-supervised CSwin UNet achieves 0.79 AUC and 0.45 AP, still outperforming all other comparable methods and demonstrating generalization to a dataset shift. ",

    "abstract": "Emerging quantum computing technologies, such as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, offer potential advancements in solving mathematical optimization problems. However, limitations in qubit availability, noise, and errors pose challenges for practical implementation. In this study, we examine two decomposition methods for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) designed to reduce the original problem size and utilize available NISQ devices more efficiently. We concentrate on breaking down the original problem into smaller subproblems, which are then solved iteratively using a combined quantum-classical hardware approach. We conduct a detailed analysis for the decomposition of MILP with Benders and Dantzig-Wolfe methods. In our analysis, we show that the number of qubits required to solve Benders is exponentially large in the worst-case, while remains constant for Dantzig-Wolfe. Additionally, we leverage Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition on the use-case of certifying the robustness of ReLU networks. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach can save up to 90\\% of qubits compared to existing methods on quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computers. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel method to perform model-based clustering of time series is proposed. The procedure relies on two iterative steps: (i) K global forecasting models are fitted via pooling by considering the series pertaining to each cluster and (ii) each series is assigned to the group associated with the model producing the best forecasts according to a particular criterion. Unlike most techniques proposed in the literature, the method considers the predictive accuracy as the main element for constructing the clustering partition, which contains groups jointly minimizing the overall forecasting error. Thus, the approach leads to a new clustering paradigm where the quality of the clustering solution is measured in terms of its predictive capability. In addition, the procedure gives rise to an effective mechanism for selecting the number of clusters in a time series database and can be used in combination with any class of regression model. An extensive simulation study shows that our method outperforms several alternative techniques concerning both clustering effectiveness and predictive accuracy. The approach is also applied to perform clustering in several datasets used as standard benchmarks in the time series literature, obtaining great results. ",

We show that the partial derivatives of RePU neural networks can be represented by RePUs mixed-activated networks and derive upper bounds for the complexity of the function class of derivatives of RePUs networks. We establish error bounds for simultaneously approximating $C^s$ smooth functions and their derivatives using RePU-activated deep neural networks. Furthermore, we derive improved approximation error bounds when data has an approximate low-dimensional support, demonstrating the ability of RePU networks to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. To illustrate the usefulness of our results, we consider a deep score matching estimator (DSME) and propose a penalized deep isotonic regression (PDIR) using RePU networks. We establish non-asymptotic excess risk bounds for DSME and PDIR under the assumption that the target functions belong to a class of $C^s$ smooth functions. We also show that PDIR has a robustness property in the sense it is consistent with vanishing penalty parameters even when the monotonicity assumption is not satisfied. Furthermore, if the data distribution is supported on an approximate low-dimensional manifold, we show that DSME and PDIR can mitigate the curse of dimensionality. ",

However, it is still a challenging task due to the irregularity of lesion areas, the fuzziness of boundaries, and other complex interference factors. In this paper, a novel LCAUnet is proposed to improve the ability of complementary representation with fusion of edge and body features, which are often paid little attentions in traditional methods. First, two separate branches are set for edge and body segmentation with CNNs and Transformer based architecture respectively. Then, LCAF module is utilized to fuse feature maps of edge and body of the same level by local cross-attention operation in encoder stage. Furthermore, PGMF module is embedded for feature integration with prior guided multi-scale adaption. Comprehensive experiments on public available dataset ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 demonstrate that LCAUnet outperforms most state-of-the-art methods. The ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of the proposed fusion techniques. ",

There are several advantages of using a Bayesian approach: Parameter and prediction uncertainties become easily available, facilitating rigorous statistical analysis. Furthermore, prior knowledge can be incorporated. However, so far, there have been no scalable techniques capable of combining both structural and parameter uncertainty. In this paper, we apply the concept of model uncertainty as a framework for structural learning in BNNs and hence make inference in the joint space of structures/models and parameters. Moreover, we suggest an adaptation of a scalable variational inference approach with reparametrization of marginal inclusion probabilities to incorporate the model space constraints. Experimental results on a range of benchmark datasets show that we obtain comparable accuracy results with the competing models, but based on methods that are much more sparse than ordinary BNNs. ",
