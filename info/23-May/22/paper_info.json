    "title": "Vanishing Activations: A Symptom of Deep Capsule Networks",
    "abstract": "Capsule Networks, an extension to Neural Networks utilizing vector or matrix representations instead of scalars, were initially developed to create a dynamic parse tree where visual concepts evolve from parts to complete objects. Early implementations of Capsule Networks achieved and maintain state-of-the-art results on various datasets. However, recent studies have revealed shortcomings in the original Capsule Network architecture, notably its failure to construct a parse tree and its susceptibility to vanishing gradients when deployed in deeper networks. This paper extends the investigation to a range of leading Capsule Network architectures, demonstrating that these issues are not confined to the original design. We argue that the majority of Capsule Network research has produced architectures that, while modestly divergent from the original Capsule Network, still retain a fundamentally similar structure. We posit that this inherent design similarity might be impeding the scalability of Capsule Networks. Our study contributes to the broader discussion on improving the robustness and scalability of Capsule Networks. ",

    "abstract": "mContain was developed (and sparsely deployed) by MD2K center at University of Memphis in the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic to help reduce community transmission in Shelby County and Memphis metropolitan area. The application counts and displays the number of daily proximity encounters with other app users. To reduce the chances of entering crowded places, users can see the level of crowding at busy places on a map. If a user and their COVID-19 test provider both agree to share the results of their test, the app can notify other users about possible exposures to COVID-19. The smartphone application collects location and Bluetooth data and sends it to cloud for near real time processing and decisions to be sent back for visualization and interface with the user. The backend algorithmic infrastructure responsible for real time crowd estimation and contact tracing from streaming batch data use open-source cloud analytics platform Cerebral-Cortex. This project concerns about presenting the authors contributions in the algorithmic development, design and implementation of mContain application as part of the entire collaborative project. We describe the mcontain algorithmic infrastructure and major computational challenges encountered when developing and deploying this application for real-life usage.

    "abstract": "In modern distributed computing applications, such as federated learning and AIoT systems, protecting privacy is crucial to prevent misbehaving parties from colluding to steal others' private information. However, guaranteeing the utility of computation outcomes while protecting all parties' privacy can be challenging, particularly when the parties' privacy requirements are highly heterogeneous. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy framework for multi-party computation called Threshold Personalized Multi-party Differential Privacy (TPMDP), which addresses a limited number of semi-honest colluding adversaries. Our framework enables each party to have a personalized privacy budget. We design a multi-party Gaussian mechanism that is easy to implement and satisfies TPMDP, wherein each party perturbs the computation outcome in a secure multi-party computation protocol using Gaussian noise. To optimize the utility of the mechanism, we cast the utility loss minimization problem into a linear programming (LP) problem. We exploit the specific structure of this LP problem to compute the optimal solution after O(n) computations, where n is the number of parties, while a generic solver may require exponentially many computations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of our approach in terms of low utility loss and high efficiency compared to existing private mechanisms that do not consider personalized privacy requirements or collusion thresholds.

    "abstract": "Data with missing values is ubiquitous in many applications. Recent years have witnessed increasing attention on prediction with only incomplete data consisting of observed features and a mask that indicates the missing pattern. Existing methods assume that the training and testing distributions are the same, which may be violated in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider prediction with incomplete data in the presence of distribution shift. We focus on the case where the underlying joint distribution of complete features and label is invariant, but the missing pattern, i.e., mask distribution may shift agnostically between training and testing. To achieve generalization, we leverage the observation that for each mask, there is an invariant optimal predictor. To avoid the exponential explosion when learning them separately, we approximate the optimal predictors jointly using a double parameterization technique. This has the undesirable side effect of allowing the learned predictors to rely on the intra-mask correlation and that between features and mask. We perform decorrelation to minimize this effect. Combining the techniques above, we propose a novel prediction method called StableMiss. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that StableMiss is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under agnostic mask distribution shift. ",

    "abstract": "Evidence Networks can enable Bayesian model comparison when state-of-the-art methods (e.g. nested sampling) fail and even when likelihoods or priors are intractable or unknown. Bayesian model comparison, i.e. the computation of Bayes factors or evidence ratios, can be cast as an optimization problem. Though the Bayesian interpretation of optimal classification is well-known, here we change perspective and present classes of loss functions that result in fast, amortized neural estimators that directly estimate convenient functions of the Bayes factor. This mitigates numerical inaccuracies associated with estimating individual model probabilities. We introduce the leaky parity-odd power (l-POP) transform, leading to the novel ``l-POP-Exponential'' loss function. We explore neural density estimation for data probability in different models, showing it to be less accurate and scalable than Evidence Networks. Multiple real-world and synthetic examples illustrate that Evidence Networks are explicitly independent of dimensionality of the parameter space and scale mildly with the complexity of the posterior probability density function. This simple yet powerful approach has broad implications for model inference tasks. As an application of Evidence Networks to real-world data we compute the Bayes factor for two models with gravitational lensing data of the Dark Energy Survey. We briefly discuss applications of our methods to other, related problems of model comparison and evaluation in implicit inference settings. ",

However, we know little about how developers build trust with AI, nor do we understand how to design the interface of generative AI systems to facilitate their appropriate levels of trust. In this paper, we describe findings from a two-stage qualitative investigation. We first interviewed 17 developers to contextualize their notions of trust and understand their challenges in building appropriate trust in AI code generation tools. We surfaced three main challenges -- including building appropriate expectations, configuring AI tools, and validating AI suggestions. To address these challenges, we conducted a design probe study in the second stage to explore design concepts that support developers' trust-building process by 1) communicating AI performance to help users set proper expectations, 2) allowing users to configure AI by setting and adjusting preferences, and 3) offering indicators of model mechanism to support evaluation of AI suggestions. We gathered developers' feedback on how these design concepts can help them build appropriate trust in AI-powered code generation tools, as well as potential risks in design. These findings inform our proposed design recommendations on how to design for trust in AI-powered code generation tools. ",

NeuSTIP learns temporal rules in the presence of the Allen predicates that ensure the temporal consistency between neighboring predicates in a given rule. We further design a unique scoring function that evaluates the confidence of the candidate answers while performing link prediction and time interval prediction by utilizing the learned rules. Our empirical evaluation on two time interval based TKGC datasets suggests that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models for both link prediction and the time interval prediction task. ",

For example, Tesla cars have seen interesting failure modes ranging from autopilot disengagements due to inactive traffic lights carried by trucks to phantom braking caused by images of stop signs on roadside billboards. These system-level failures are not due to failures of any individual component of the autonomy stack but rather system-level deficiencies in semantic reasoning. Such edge cases, which we call \\textit{semantic anomalies}, are simple for a human to disentangle yet require insightful reasoning. To this end, we study the application of large language models (LLMs), endowed with broad contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities, to recognize these edge semantic cases. We introduce a monitoring framework for semantic anomaly detection in vision-based policies to do so. Our experiments evaluate this framework in monitoring a learned policy for object manipulation and a finite state machine policy for autonomous driving and demonstrate that an LLM-based monitor can serve as a proxy for human reasoning. Finally, we provide an extended discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and motivate a research outlook on how we can further use foundation models for semantic anomaly detection.

To our knowledge, this is the first practical algorithm to construct fast low stretch-factor graphs on large pointsets with average-degrees (hence, the number of edges) competitive with that of greedy-spanners, the sparsest known class of Euclidean geometric spanners. To evaluate our implementation in terms of computation speed, memory usage, and quality of output, we performed extensive experiments with synthetic and real-world pointsets, and by comparing it to our closest competitor Bucketing, the fastest known greedy-spanner algorithm for pointsets in the plane, devised by Alewijnse et al. (Algorithmica, 2017). We always found that Fast-Sparse-Spanner generated near-greedy t-spanners while being fast and memory-efficient. Our experiment with constructing a 1.1-spanner on a large synthetic pointset with 128K points uniformly distributed within a square shows more than a 41-fold speedup with roughly a third of the memory usage of that of Bucketing, but with only a 3% increase in the average-degree of the resulting graph. In terms of diameter, the graphs generated by Fast-Sparse-Spanner beat greedy-spanners in most cases (have substantially lower diameter) while maintaining near-greedy average-degree. As a byproduct of our research, we design and engineer Fast-Stretch-Factor, a practical parallelizable algorithm that can measure the stretch-factor of any graph generated by Fast-Sparse-Spanner. Our experiments show that it is much faster than the naive Dijkstra-based stretch-factor measurement algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) process time-series data via internal event-driven neural dynamics whose energy consumption depends on the number of spikes exchanged between neurons over the course of the input presentation. In typical implementations of an SNN classifier, decisions are produced after the entire input sequence has been processed, resulting in latency and energy consumption levels that are fairly uniform across inputs. Recently introduced delay-adaptive SNNs tailor the inference latency -- and, with it, the energy consumption -- to the difficulty of each example, by producing an early decision when the SNN model is sufficiently ``confident''. In this paper, we start by observing that, as an SNN processes input samples, its classification decisions tend to be first under-confident and then over-confident with respect to the decision's ground-truth, unknown, test accuracy. This makes it difficult to determine a stopping time that ensures a desired level of accuracy. To address this problem, we introduce a novel delay-adaptive SNN-based inference methodology that, wrapping around any pre-trained SNN classifier, provides guaranteed reliability for the decisions produced at input-dependent stopping times. The approach entails minimal added complexity as compared to the underlying SNN, requiring only thresholding and counting operations at run time, and it leverages tools from conformal prediction (CP).

    "abstract": "Image-to-recipe retrieval is a challenging vision-to-language task of significant practical value. The main challenge of the task lies in the ultra-high redundancy in the long recipe and the large variation reflected in both food item combination and food item appearance. A de-facto idea to address this task is to learn a shared feature embedding space in which a food image is aligned better to its paired recipe than other recipes. However, such supervised global matching is prone to supervision collapse, i.e., only partial information that is necessary for distinguishing training pairs can be identified, while other information that is potentially useful in generalization could be lost. To mitigate such a problem, we propose a mask-augmentation-based local matching network (MALM), where an image-text matching module and a masked self-distillation module benefit each other mutually to learn generalizable cross-modality representations. On one hand, we perform local matching between the tokenized representations of image and text to locate fine-grained cross-modality correspondence explicitly. We involve representations of masked image patches in this process to alleviate overfitting resulting from local matching especially when some food items are underrepresented. On the other hand, predicting the hidden representations of the masked patches through self-distillation helps to learn general-purpose image representations that are expected to generalize better. And the multi-task nature of the model enables the representations of masked patches to be text-aware and thus facilitates the lost information reconstruction. Experimental results on Recipe1M dataset show our method can clearly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

To address the computational inability challenge, we propose a novel position-aware and sample-aware central loss. Specifically, our central loss can absorb position information, enabling accurate evaluation of the heatmap distribution. More advanced is that our central loss is sample-aware, which can adaptively distinguish easy and hard samples and make the model more focused on hard samples while solving the challenge of extreme imbalance between landmarks and non-landmarks. To address the challenge of ignoring structure information, a Coordinated Transformer, called CoorTransformer, is proposed, which establishes long-range dependencies under the guidance of landmark coordination information, making the attention more focused on the sparse landmarks while taking advantage of global spatial structure. Furthermore, CoorTransformer can speed up convergence, effectively avoiding the defect that Transformers have difficulty converging in sparse representation learning. Using the advanced CoorTransformer and central loss, we propose a generalized detection model that can handle various scenarios, inherently exploiting the underlying relationship between landmarks and incorporating rich structural knowledge around the target landmarks. We analyzed and evaluated CoorTransformer and central loss on three challenging landmark detection tasks. The experimental results show that our CoorTransformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and the central loss significantly improves the performance of the model with p-values< 0.05. ",

However, it is still unclear how incorporating this additional data impacts model robustness to adversarial attacks and natural perturbations. For adversarial robustness, the additional information could improve the model's ability to distinguish malicious inputs, or simply provide new attack avenues and vulnerabilities. For natural perturbations, the additional information could better inform model decisions and weaken perturbation effects or have no significant influence at all. In this work, we seek to characterize the performance and robustness of a multispectral (RGB and near infrared) image segmentation model subjected to adversarial attacks and natural perturbations. While existing adversarial and natural robustness research has focused primarily on digital perturbations, we prioritize on creating realistic perturbations designed with physical world conditions in mind. For adversarial robustness, we focus on data poisoning attacks whereas for natural robustness, we focus on extending ImageNet-C common corruptions for fog and snow that coherently and self-consistently perturbs the input data. Overall, we find both RGB and multispectral models are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks regardless of input or fusion architectures and that while physically realizable natural perturbations still degrade model performance, the impact differs based on fusion architecture and input data.

To address these limitations, this work proposes an effective framework for unsupervised fake news detection, which first embeds the knowledge available in four modalities in news records and then proposes a novel noise-robust self-supervised learning technique to identify the veracity of news records from the multi-modal embeddings. Also, we propose a novel technique to construct news datasets minimizing the latent biases in existing news datasets. Following the proposed approach for dataset construction, we produce a Large-scale Unlabelled News Dataset consisting 419,351 news articles related to COVID-19, acronymed as LUND-COVID. We trained the proposed unsupervised framework using LUND-COVID to exploit the potential of large datasets, and evaluate it using a set of existing labelled datasets. Our results show that the proposed unsupervised framework largely outperforms existing unsupervised baselines for different tasks such as multi-modal fake news detection, fake news early detection and few-shot fake news detection, while yielding notable improvements for unseen domains during training.

    "abstract": "Social dilemmas are situations where groups of individuals can benefit from mutual cooperation but conflicting interests impede them from doing so. This type of situations resembles many of humanity's most critical challenges, and discovering mechanisms that facilitate the emergence of cooperative behaviors is still an open problem. In this paper, we study the behavior of self-interested rational agents that learn world models in a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) setting and that coexist in environments where social dilemmas can arise. Our simulation results show that groups of agents endowed with world models outperform all the other tested ones when dealing with scenarios where social dilemmas can arise. We exploit the world model architecture to qualitatively assess the learnt dynamics and confirm that each agent's world model is capable to encode information of the behavior of the changing environment and the other agent's actions. This is the first work that shows that world models facilitate the emergence of complex coordinated behaviors that enable interacting agents to ``understand'' both environmental and social dynamics.

    "abstract": "Group fairness is a popular approach to prevent unfavorable treatment of individuals based on sensitive attributes such as race, gender, and disability. However, the reliance of group fairness on access to discrete group information raises several limitations and concerns, especially with regard to privacy, intersectionality, and unforeseen biases. In this work, we propose a \"group-free\" measure of fairness that does not rely on sensitive attributes and, instead, is based on homophily in social networks, i.e., the common property that individuals sharing similar attributes are more likely to be connected. Our measure is group-free as it avoids recovering any form of group memberships and uses only pairwise similarities between individuals to define inequality in outcomes relative to the homophily structure in the network. We theoretically justify our measure by showing it is commensurate with the notion of additive decomposability in the economic inequality literature and also bound the impact of non-sensitive confounding attributes. Furthermore, we apply our measure to develop fair algorithms for classification, maximizing information access, and recommender systems. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach can reduce inequality among protected classes without knowledge of sensitive attribute labels. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations of our approach when applied in real-world settings. ",

    "abstract": "Custom officials across the world encounter huge volumes of transactions. With increased connectivity and globalization, the customs transactions continue to grow every year. Associated with customs transactions is the customs fraud - the intentional manipulation of goods declarations to avoid the taxes and duties. With limited manpower, the custom offices can only undertake manual inspection of a limited number of declarations. This necessitates the need for automating the customs fraud detection by machine learning (ML) techniques. Due the limited manual inspection for labeling the new-incoming declarations, the ML approach should have robust performance subject to the scarcity of labeled data. However, current approaches for customs fraud detection are not well suited and designed for this real-world setting. In this work, we propose $\\textbf{GraphFC}$ ($\\textbf{Graph}$ neural networks for $\\textbf{C}$ustoms $\\textbf{F}$raud), a model-agnostic, domain-specific, semi-supervised graph neural network based customs fraud detection algorithm that has strong semi-supervised and inductive capabilities.

In this work, we characterize the conditional independence structure in general distributions for all data types (i.e., continuous, discrete, and mixed-type) with a Generalized Precision Matrix (GPM).

Despite much progress in developing advanced graph transformation techniques in recent years, the fundamental assumption typically required in machine-learning models that the testing and training data preserve the same distribution does not always hold. As a result, domain generalization graph transformation that predicts graphs not available in the training data is under-explored, with multiple key challenges to be addressed including (1) the extreme space complexity when training on all input-output mode combinations, (2) difference of graph topologies between the input and the output modes, and (3) how to generalize the model to (unseen) target domains that are not in the training data. To fill the gap, we propose a multi-input, multi-output, hypernetwork-based graph neural network (MultiHyperGNN) that employs a encoder and a decoder to encode topologies of both input and output modes and semi-supervised link prediction to enhance the graph transformation task. Instead of training on all mode combinations, MultiHyperGNN preserves a constant space complexity with the encoder and the decoder produced by two novel hypernetworks. Comprehensive experiments show that MultiHyperGNN has a superior performance than competing models in both prediction and domain generalization tasks. ",

Therefore, forecasting future poses based on the history of the previous motions is a challenging task. This paper presents an innovative auxiliary-memory-powered deep neural network framework for the improved modelling of historical knowledge. Specifically, we disentangle subject-specific, task-specific, and other auxiliary information from the observed pose sequences and utilise these factorised features to query the memory. A novel Multi-Head knowledge retrieval scheme leverages these factorised feature embeddings to perform multiple querying operations over the historical observations captured within the auxiliary memory. Moreover, our proposed dynamic masking strategy makes this feature disentanglement process dynamic. Two novel loss functions are introduced to encourage diversity within the auxiliary memory while ensuring the stability of the memory contents, such that it can locate and store salient information that can aid the long-term prediction of future motion, irrespective of data imbalances or the diversity of the input data distribution. With extensive experiments conducted on two public benchmarks, Human3.6M and CMU-Mocap, we demonstrate that these design choices collectively allow the proposed approach to outperform the current state-of-the-art methods by significant margins: $>$ 17\\% on the Human3.6M dataset and $>$ 9\\% on the CMU-Mocap dataset.

In this study, we use YouTube videos embedded in tweets about diet, exercise and fitness posted before and during COVID-19 to investigate the influence of the pandemic lockdowns on diet and nutrition. In particular, we examine the nutritional profile of the foods mentioned in the transcript, description and title of each video in terms of six macronutrients (protein, energy, fat, sodium, sugar, and saturated fat). These macronutrient values were further linked to demographics to assess if there are specific effects on those potentially having insufficient access to healthy sources of food. Interrupted time series analysis revealed a considerable shift in the aggregated macronutrient scores before and during COVID-19. In particular, whereas areas with lower incomes showed decrease in energy, fat, and saturated fat, those with higher percentage of African Americans showed an elevation in sodium. Word2Vec word similarities and odds ratio analysis suggested a shift from popular diets and lifestyle bloggers before the lockdowns to the interest in a variety of healthy foods, communal sharing of quick and easy recipes, as well as a new emphasis on comfort foods. To the best of our knowledge, this work is novel in terms of linking attention signals in tweets, content of videos, their nutrients profile, and aggregate demographics of the users. The insights made possible by this combination of resources are important for monitoring the secondary health effects of social distancing, and informing social programs designed to alleviate these effects.

Subsequently, we expand the continual learning model by including the target mode using a weighted label derived from those of the closest modes. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we first generate labeled data samples using the cGAN's generator, and then train the cGAN model for the target mode while memory replaying with the generated data. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving the generation performance over the baselines and the state-of-the-art approaches for various standard datasets while utilizing fewer training samples.

Furthermore, based on the symmetric structure of parameter space, we demonstrate that an appropriate strategy of random parameter initialization can increase the probability of convergence for optimization. We found that overparameterized networks tend to be easier to train in the sense that increasing the width of neural networks leads to a vanishing volume of the effective parameter space. Our findings offer new insights into overparameterization and have significant implications for understanding generalization and optimization in deep learning. ",

Whereas a rich literature has succeeded in mapping out the feasibility and limitations of graph structures supporting secure computation in the fixed-graph model (including strong classical lower bounds), these bounds do not apply in the latter dynamic-graph setting, which has recently seen exciting new results, but remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we initiate a similar foundational study of MPC within the dynamic-graph model. As a first step, we investigate the property of graph expansion. All existing protocols (implicitly or explicitly) yield communication graphs which are expanders, but it is not clear whether this is inherent. Our results consist of two types (for constant fraction of corruptions): * Upper bounds: We demonstrate secure protocols whose induced communication graphs are not expander graphs, within a wide range of settings (computational, information theoretic, with low locality, even with low locality and adaptive security), each assuming some form of input-independent setup. * Lower bounds: In the plain model (no setup) with adaptive corruptions, we demonstrate that for certain functionalities, no protocol can maintain a non-expanding communication graph against all adversarial strategies. Our lower bound relies only on protocol correctness (not privacy), and requires a surprisingly delicate argument. More generally, we provide a formal framework for analyzing the evolving communication graph of MPC protocols, giving a starting point for studying the relation between secure computation and further, more general graph properties.

However, in cases of practical data heterogeneity among FL clients, existing FL frameworks still exhibit deficiency in capturing the overall feature properties of local client data that exhibit disparate distributions. In response, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have recently been exploited in FL to address data heterogeneity since GANs can be integrated for data regeneration without exposing original raw data. Despite some successes, existing GAN-related FL frameworks often incur heavy communication cost and also elicit other privacy concerns, which limit their applications in real scenarios. To this end, this work proposes a novel FL framework that requires only partial GAN model sharing. Named as PS-FedGAN, this new framework enhances the GAN releasing and training mechanism to address heterogeneous data distributions across clients and to strengthen privacy preservation at reduced communication cost, especially over wireless networks. Our analysis demonstrates the convergence and privacy benefits of the proposed PS-FEdGAN framework. Through experimental results based on several well-known benchmark datasets, our proposed PS-FedGAN shows great promise to tackle FL under non-IID client data distributions, while securing data privacy and lowering communication overhead.

We utilise such a solver to construct a diverse set of solutions. Moreover, maximising diversity provides us with invaluable information about the solution space of a given SAT problem, such as how large the feasible region is. In this study, we introduce evolutionary algorithms (EAs) employing a well-known SAT solver to maximise diversity among a set of SAT solutions explicitly. The experimental investigations indicate the introduced algorithms' capability to maximise diversity among the SAT solutions. ",

    "abstract": "This study aims to solve the over-reliance on the rank estimation strategy in the standard tensor factorization-based tensor recovery and the problem of a large computational cost in the standard t-SVD-based tensor recovery. To this end, we proposes a new tensor norm with a dual low-rank constraint, which utilizes the low-rank prior and rank information at the same time. In the proposed tensor norm, a series of surrogate functions of the tensor tubal rank can be used to achieve better performance in harness low-rankness within tensor data. It is proven theoretically that the resulting tensor completion model can effectively avoid performance degradation caused by inaccurate rank estimation. Meanwhile, attributed to the proposed dual low-rank constraint, the t-SVD of a smaller tensor instead of the original big one is computed by using a sample trick. Based on this, the total cost at each iteration of the optimization algorithm is reduced to $\\mathcal{O}(n^3\\log n +kn^3)$ from $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ achieved with standard methods, where $k$ is the estimation of the true tensor rank and far less than $n$. Our method was evaluated on synthetic and real-world data, and it demonstrated superior performance and efficiency over several existing state-of-the-art tensor completion methods. ",

Nevertheless, these methods involve the T-SVD based low-rank approximation, which suffers from high computational costs when dealing with large-scale tensor data. Moreover, most of them are only applicable to third-order tensors. Against these issues, in this article, two efficient low-rank tensor approximation approaches fusing randomized techniques are first devised under the order-d (d >= 3) T-SVD framework. On this basis, we then further investigate the robust high-order tensor completion (RHTC) problem, in which a double nonconvex model along with its corresponding fast optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees are developed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate the randomized low-rank approximation into the RHTC problem. Empirical studies on large-scale synthetic and real tensor data illustrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both computational efficiency and estimated precision.

The state-of-the-art 3DMM-based method, directly regresses the model's coefficients, underutilizing the low-level 2D spatial and semantic information, which can actually offer cues for face shape and orientation. In this work, we demonstrate how modeling 3D facial geometry in image and model space jointly can solve the occlusion and view angle problems. Instead of predicting the whole face directly, we regress image space features in the visible facial region by dense prediction first. Subsequently, we predict our model's coefficients based on the regressed feature of the visible regions, leveraging the prior knowledge of whole face geometry from the morphable models to complete the invisible regions. We further propose a fusion network that combines the advantages of both the image and model space predictions to achieve high robustness and accuracy in unconstrained scenarios. Thanks to the proposed fusion module, our method is robust not only to occlusion and large pitch and roll view angles, which is the benefit of our image space approach, but also to noise and large yaw angles, which is the benefit of our model space method. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods. On the 3D dense face alignment task, we achieve 3.80% NME on the AFLW2000-3D dataset, which outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 5.5%. Code is available at https://github.com/lhyfst/DSFNet. ",

    "abstract": "The safe and stable operation of power systems is greatly challenged by the high variability and randomness of wind power in large-scale wind-power-integrated grids. Wind power forecasting is an effective solution to tackle this issue, with wind speed forecasting being an essential aspect. In this paper, a Graph-attentive Frequency-enhanced Spatial-Temporal Wind Speed Forecasting model based on graph attention and frequency-enhanced mechanisms, i.e., GFST-WSF, is proposed to improve the accuracy of short-term wind speed forecasting. The GFST-WSF comprises a Transformer architecture for temporal feature extraction and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for spatial feature extraction. The GAT is specifically designed to capture the complex spatial dependencies among wind speed stations to effectively aggregate information from neighboring nodes in the graph, thus enhancing the spatial representation of the data. To model the time lag in wind speed correlation between adjacent wind farms caused by geographical factors, a dynamic complex adjacency matrix is formulated and utilized by the GAT. Benefiting from the effective spatio-temporal feature extraction and the deep architecture of the Transformer, the GFST-WSF outperforms other baselines in wind speed forecasting for the 6-24 hours ahead forecast horizon in case studies.

However, existing text-to-3D generation methods are limited to producing 3D objects with simple geometries and dreamlike styles that lack realism. In this work, we present Text2NeRF, which is able to generate a wide range of 3D scenes with complicated geometric structures and high-fidelity textures purely from a text prompt. To this end, we adopt NeRF as the 3D representation and leverage a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to constrain the 3D reconstruction of the NeRF to reflect the scene description. Specifically, we employ the diffusion model to infer the text-related image as the content prior and use a monocular depth estimation method to offer the geometric prior. Both content and geometric priors are utilized to update the NeRF model. To guarantee textured and geometric consistency between different views, we introduce a progressive scene inpainting and updating strategy for novel view synthesis of the scene. Our method requires no additional training data but only a natural language description of the scene as the input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Text2NeRF outperforms existing methods in producing photo-realistic, multi-view consistent, and diverse 3D scenes from a variety of natural language prompts.

For instance, backdoors can be implanted through crafting training instances with a specific textual trigger and a target label. This paper posits that backdoor poisoning attacks exhibit spurious correlation between simple text features and classification labels, and accordingly, proposes methods for mitigating spurious correlation as means of defence. Our empirical study reveals that the malicious triggers are highly correlated to their target labels; therefore such correlations are extremely distinguishable compared to those scores of benign features, and can be used to filter out potentially problematic instances. Compared with several existing defences, our defence method significantly reduces attack success rates across backdoor attacks, and in the case of insertion based attacks, our method provides a near-perfect defence.

Predictable behaviours and explainable (and understandable) rationale allow humans collaborating with (and building) these agents to understand their motivations and therefore validate decisions that are made. To that aim, we make use of G\\\"ardenfors's cognitively inspired Conceptual Space framework to represent the agent's knowledge using concepts as convex regions in a space spanned by inherently comprehensible quality dimensions. A simple typicality quantification model is built on top of it to determine fuzzy category membership and classify instances interpretably. We apply it on a use case from the manufacturing domain, using objects' physical properties obtained from cobots' onboard sensors and utilisation properties from crowdsourced commonsense knowledge available at public knowledge bases. Such flexible knowledge representation based on property decomposition allows for data-efficient representation learning of typically highly specialist or specific manufacturing artefacts. In such a setting, traditional data-driven (e.g., computer vision-based) classification approaches would struggle due to training data scarcity. This allows for comprehensibility of an AI agent's acquired knowledge by the human collaborator thus contributing to trustworthiness. We situate our approach within an existing explainability framework specifying explanation desiderata. We provide arguments for our system's applicability and appropriateness for different roles of human agents collaborating with the AI system throughout its design, validation, and operation. ",

    "abstract": "Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have shown remarkable capability in representing geometry with details. However, without signed distance supervision, it is still a challenge to infer SDFs from point clouds or multi-view images using neural networks. In this paper, we claim that gradient consistency in the field, indicated by the parallelism of level sets, is the key factor affecting the inference accuracy. Hence, we propose a level set alignment loss to evaluate the parallelism of level sets, which can be minimized to achieve better gradient consistency. Our novelty lies in that we can align all level sets to the zero level set by constraining gradients at queries and their projections on the zero level set in an adaptive way. Our insight is to propagate the zero level set to everywhere in the field through consistent gradients to eliminate uncertainty in the field that is caused by the discreteness of 3D point clouds or the lack of observations from multi-view images. Our proposed loss is a general term which can be used upon different methods to infer SDFs from 3D point clouds and multi-view images. Our numerical and visual comparisons demonstrate that our loss can significantly improve the accuracy of SDFs inferred from point clouds or multi-view images under various benchmarks.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach for generating naturalistic adversarial patches without using GANs. Our proposed approach generates a Dynamic Adversarial Patch (DAP) that looks naturalistic while maintaining high attack efficiency and robustness in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we redefine the optimization problem by introducing a new objective function, where a similarity metric is used to construct a similarity loss. This guides the patch to follow predefined patterns while maximizing the victim model's loss function. Our technique is based on directly modifying the pixel values in the patch which gives higher flexibility and larger space to incorporate multiple transformations compared to the GAN-based techniques. Furthermore, most clothing-based physical attacks assume static objects and ignore the possible transformations caused by non-rigid deformation due to changes in a person's pose. To address this limitation, we incorporate a ``Creases Transformation'' (CT) block, i.e., a preprocessing block following an Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) block used to generate a large variation of transformed patches incorporated in the training process to increase its robustness to different possible real-world distortions (e.g., creases in the clothing, rotation, re-scaling, random noise, brightness and contrast variations, etc.). We demonstrate that the presence of different real-world variations in clothing and object poses (i.e., above-mentioned distortions) lead to a drop in the performance of state-of-the-art attacks. For instance, these techniques can merely achieve 20\\% in the physical world and 30.8\\% in the digital world while our attack provides superior success rate of up to 65\\% and 84.56\\%, respectively when attacking the YOLOv3tiny detector deployed in smart cameras at the edge.

    "abstract": "Despite the availability of computer-aided simulators and recorded videos of surgical procedures, junior residents still heavily rely on experts to answer their queries. However, expert surgeons are often overloaded with clinical and academic workloads and limit their time in answering. For this purpose, we develop a surgical question-answering system to facilitate robot-assisted surgical scene and activity understanding from recorded videos. Most of the existing VQA methods require an object detector and regions based feature extractor to extract visual features and fuse them with the embedded text of the question for answer generation. However, (1) surgical object detection model is scarce due to smaller datasets and lack of bounding box annotation; (2) current fusion strategy of heterogeneous modalities like text and image is naive; (3) the localized answering is missing, which is crucial in complex surgical scenarios. In this paper, we propose Visual Question Localized-Answering in Robotic Surgery (Surgical-VQLA) to localize the specific surgical area during the answer prediction. To deal with the fusion of the heterogeneous modalities, we design gated vision-language embedding (GVLE) to build input patches for the Language Vision Transformer (LViT) to predict the answer. To get localization, we add the detection head in parallel with the prediction head of the LViT. We also integrate GIoU loss to boost localization performance by preserving the accuracy of the question-answering model. We annotate two datasets of VQLA by utilizing publicly available surgical videos from MICCAI challenges EndoVis-17 and 18. Our validation results suggest that Surgical-VQLA can better understand the surgical scene and localize the specific area related to the question-answering. GVLE presents an efficient language-vision embedding technique by showing superior performance over the existing benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "In Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, for any input, multiple communicative goals are plausible, and any goal can be put into words, or produced, in multiple ways. We characterise the extent to which human production varies lexically, syntactically, and semantically across four NLG tasks, connecting human production variability to aleatoric or data uncertainty. We then inspect the space of output strings shaped by a generation system's predicted probability distribution and decoding algorithm to probe its uncertainty. For each test input, we measure the generator's calibration to human production variability. Following this instance-level approach, we analyse NLG models and decoding strategies, demonstrating that probing a generator with multiple samples and, when possible, multiple references, provides the level of detail necessary to gain understanding of a model's representation of uncertainty.

    "abstract": "We introduce ViDaS, a two-stream, fully convolutional Video, Depth-Aware Saliency network to address the problem of attention modeling ``in-the-wild\", via saliency prediction in videos. Contrary to existing visual saliency approaches using only RGB frames as input, our network employs also depth as an additional modality. The network consists of two visual streams, one for the RGB frames, and one for the depth frames. Both streams follow an encoder-decoder approach and are fused to obtain a final saliency map. The network is trained end-to-end and is evaluated in a variety of different databases with eye-tracking data, containing a wide range of video content. Although the publicly available datasets do not contain depth, we estimate it using three different state-of-the-art methods, to enable comparisons and a deeper insight. Our method outperforms in most cases state-of-the-art models and our RGB-only variant, which indicates that depth can be beneficial to accurately estimating saliency in videos displayed on a 2D screen. Depth has been widely used to assist salient object detection problems, where it has been proven to be very beneficial. Our problem though differs significantly from salient object detection, since it is not restricted to specific salient objects, but predicts human attention in a more general aspect. These two problems not only have different objectives, but also different ground truth data and evaluation metrics. To our best knowledge, this is the first competitive deep learning video saliency estimation approach that combines both RGB and Depth features to address the general problem of saliency estimation ``in-the-wild\". The code will be publicly released. ",

A great deal of the popularity of spell-checking systems can be attributed to this phenomenon since they are crucial to polishing the digitally conceived text. In this study, we tackle Typographical Error Type Detection in Persian, which has been relatively understudied. In this paper, we present a public dataset named FarsTypo, containing 3.4 million chronologically ordered and part-of-speech tagged words of diverse topics and linguistic styles. An algorithm for applying Persian-specific errors is developed and applied to a scalable size of these words, forming a parallel dataset of correct and incorrect words. Using FarsTypo, we establish a firm baseline and compare different methodologies using various architectures. In addition, we present a novel Many-to-Many Deep Sequential Neural Network to perform token classification using both word and character embeddings in combination with bidirectional LSTM layers to detect typographical errors across 51 classes. We compare our approach with highly-advanced industrial systems that, unlike this study, have been developed utilizing a variety of resources. The results of our final method were competitive in that we achieved an accuracy of 97.62%, a precision of 98.83%, a recall of 98.61%, and outperformed the rest in terms of speed. ",

Massive medical signs in electronic health records (EHR) are fitted into advanced machine learning models to make predictions. However, the data-quality problem of original clinical signs is less discussed in the literature. Based on an in-depth measurement of the missing rate and correlation score across various medical signs and a large amount of patient hospital admission records, we discovered the comprehensive missing rate is extremely high, and a large number of useless signs could hurt the performance of prediction models. Then we concluded that only improving data-quality could improve the baseline accuracy of different prediction algorithms. We designed MEDLENS, with an automatic vital medical signs selection approach via statistics and a flexible interpolation approach for high missing rate time series. After augmenting the data-quality of original medical signs, MEDLENS applies ensemble classifiers to boost the accuracy and reduce the computation overhead at the same time. It achieves a very high accuracy performance of 0.96% AUC-ROC and 0.81% AUC-PR, which exceeds the previous benchmark. ",

The re-ranker generally produces better candidate scores than the retriever, but is limited to seeing only the top K retrieved candidates, thus providing no improvements in retrieval performance as measured by Recall@K. In this work, we leverage the re-ranker to also improve retrieval by providing inference-time relevance feedback to the retriever. Concretely, we update the retriever's query representation for a test instance using a lightweight inference-time distillation of the re-ranker's prediction for that instance. The distillation loss is designed to bring the retriever's candidate scores closer to those of the re-ranker. A second retrieval step is then performed with the updated query vector. We empirically show that our approach, which can serve arbitrary retrieve-and-rerank pipelines, significantly improves retrieval recall in multiple domains, languages, and modalities. ",

Our annotation covers different levels of partial and full hallucinations as well as omissions both at the sentence and at the word level.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying these computations are unclear. We combine a goal-driven modeling approach with dense neurophysiological data and high-throughput human behavioral readouts to directly impinge on this question. Specifically, we construct and evaluate several classes of sensory-cognitive networks to predict the future state of rich, ethologically-relevant environments, ranging from self-supervised end-to-end models with pixel-wise or object-centric objectives, to models that future predict in the latent space of purely static image-based or dynamic video-based pretrained foundation models. We find strong differentiation across these model classes in their ability to predict neural and behavioral data both within and across diverse environments. In particular, we find that neural responses are currently best predicted by models trained to predict the future state of their environment in the latent space of pretrained foundation models optimized for dynamic scenes in a self-supervised manner. Notably, models that future predict in the latent space of video foundation models that are optimized to support a diverse range of sensorimotor tasks, reasonably match both human behavioral error patterns and neural dynamics across all environmental scenarios that we were able to test. Overall, these findings suggest that the neural mechanisms and behaviors of primate mental simulation are thus far most consistent with being optimized to future predict on dynamic, reusable visual representations that are useful for embodied AI more generally.

    "abstract": "Inferring protocol formats is critical for many security applications. However, existing format-inference techniques often miss many formats, because almost all of them are in a fashion of dynamic analysis and rely on a limited number of network packets to drive their analysis. If a feature is not present in the input packets, the feature will be missed in the resulting formats. We develop a novel static program analysis for format inference. It is well-known that static analysis does not rely on any input packets and can achieve high coverage by scanning every piece of code. However, for efficiency and precision, we have to address two challenges, namely path explosion and disordered path constraints. To this end, our approach uses abstract interpretation to produce a novel data structure called the abstract format graph. It delimits precise but costly operations to only small regions, thus ensuring precision and efficiency at the same time. Our inferred formats are of high coverage and precisely specify both field boundaries and semantic constraints among packet fields. Our evaluation shows that we can infer formats for a protocol in one minute with >95% precision and recall, much better than four baseline techniques. Our inferred formats can substantially enhance existing protocol fuzzers, improving the coverage by 20% to 260% and discovering 53 zero-days with 47 assigned CVEs. We also provide case studies of adopting our inferred formats in other security applications including traffic auditing and intrusion detection. ",

Then, we propose the judging criteria and response function of corner features by analyzing sampling signals' amplitude-frequency characteristics and circular cross-correlation behavior. The proposed feature detection algorithm fully considers the boundary characteristics retained by the corners with geometric distortion, thus enabling reliable detection at a low calculation cost. The experimental results show that the proposed method has significant advantages in terms of real-time and robustness. Finally, we have achieved the high-density 3-d contact deformation visualization based on this detection method. This technique is able to clearly record the process of contact deformation, thus enabling inverse sensing of dynamic contact processes. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, data augmentation (DA) methods have been proven to be effective for pre-trained language models (PLMs) in low-resource settings, including few-shot named entity recognition (NER). However, conventional NER DA methods are mostly aimed at sequence labeling models, i.e., token-level classification, and few are compatible with unified autoregressive generation frameworks, which can handle a wider range of NER tasks, such as nested NER. Furthermore, these generation frameworks have a strong assumption that the entities will appear in the target sequence with the same left-to-right order as the source sequence. In this paper, we claim that there is no need to keep this strict order, and more diversified but reasonable target entity sequences can be provided during the training stage as a novel DA method. Nevertheless, a naive mixture of augmented data can confuse the model since one source sequence will then be paired with different target sequences. Therefore, we propose a simple but effective Prompt Ordering based Data Augmentation (PODA) method to improve the training of unified autoregressive generation frameworks under few-shot NER scenarios. Experimental results on three public NER datasets and further analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ",

    "abstract": "The highly realistic image quality achieved by current image generative models has many academic and industrial applications. To limit the use of such models to benign applications, though, it is necessary that tools to conclusively detect whether an image has been generated synthetically or not are developed. For this reason, several detectors have been developed providing excellent performance in computer vision applications, however, they can not be applied as they are to multispectral satellite images, and hence new models must be trained. In general, two-class classifiers can achieve very good detection accuracies, however they are not able to generalise to image domains and generative models architectures different than those used during training. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a one-class classifier based on Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder 2 (VQ-VAE 2) features to overcome the limitations of two-class classifiers. First, we emphasize the generalization problem that binary classifiers suffer from by training and testing an EfficientNet-B4 architecture on multiple multispectral datasets. Then we show that, since the VQ-VAE 2 based classifier is trained only on pristine images, it is able to detect images belonging to different domains and generated by architectures that have not been used during training. Last, we compare the two classifiers head-to-head on the same generated datasets, highlighting the superiori generalization capabilities of the VQ-VAE 2-based detector. ",

While the effect of PLT on quality is well-documented, we highlight a lesser-known effect: PLT can enhance a model's stability to model updates and input perturbations, a set of properties we call model inertia.

We show that these training problems are polynomial-time many-one bireducible to the existential theory of the reals extended with the corresponding activation functions.

It is thus open, and equivalent with the decidability of the existential theory of the reals with the exponential function, whether training neural networks using the sigmoid activation function is algorithmically solvable.

We conduct experiments on complex political claims in the ClaimDecomp dataset and show that the aggregated evidence produced by our pipeline improves veracity judgments.

COVID-19 mortality risk estimators are often, however, developed with small unrepresentative samples and with methodological limitations. It is highly important to develop predictive tools for pulmonary embolism (PE) in COVID-19 patients as one of the most severe preventable complications of COVID-19. Using a dataset of more than 800,000 COVID-19 patients from an international cohort, we propose a cost-sensitive gradient-boosted machine learning model that predicts occurrence of PE and death at admission. Logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, and Shapley values were used to identify key predictors for PE and death. Our prediction model had a test AUROC of 75.9% and 74.2%, and sensitivities of 67.5% and 72.7% for PE and all-cause mortality respectively on a highly diverse and held-out test set. The PE prediction model was also evaluated on patients in UK and Spain separately with test results of 74.5% AUROC, 63.5% sensitivity and 78.9% AUROC, 95.7% sensitivity. Age, sex, region of admission, comorbidities (chronic cardiac and pulmonary disease, dementia, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, obesity, smoking), and symptoms (any, confusion, chest pain, fatigue, headache, fever, muscle or joint pain, shortness of breath) were the most important clinical predictors at admission. Our machine learning model developed from an international cohort can serve to better regulate hospital risk prioritisation of at-risk patients. ",

    "abstract": "Latent variable models have become instrumental in computational neuroscience for reasoning about neural computation. This has fostered the development of powerful offline algorithms for extracting latent neural trajectories from neural recordings. However, despite the potential of real time alternatives to give immediate feedback to experimentalists, and enhance experimental design, they have received markedly less attention. In this work, we introduce the exponential family variational Kalman filter (eVKF), an online recursive Bayesian method aimed at inferring latent trajectories while simultaneously learning the dynamical system generating them. eVKF works for arbitrary likelihoods and utilizes the constant base measure exponential family to model the latent state stochasticity. We derive a closed-form variational analogue to the predict step of the Kalman filter which leads to a provably tighter bound on the ELBO compared to another online variational method. We validate our method on synthetic and real-world data, and, notably, show that it achieves competitive performance ",

Recently, the community has explored cross-pathology and cross-language models which can improve diagnostic accuracy even further. However, strict patient data privacy regulations largely prevent institutions from sharing patient speech data with each other. In this paper, we employ federated learning (FL) for PD detection using speech signals from 3 real-world language corpora of German, Spanish, and Czech, each from a separate institution. Our results indicate that the FL model outperforms all the local models in terms of diagnostic accuracy, while not performing very differently from the model based on centrally combined training sets, with the advantage of not requiring any data sharing among collaborators. This will simplify inter-institutional collaborations, resulting in enhancement of patient outcomes. ",

The proposed method learns how to estimate CATEs from multiple tasks and uses the knowledge for unseen tasks. In the proposed method, based on the meta-learner framework, we decompose the CATE estimation problem into sub-problems. For each sub-problem, we formulate our estimation models using neural networks with task-shared and task-specific parameters. With our formulation, we can obtain optimal task-specific parameters in a closed form that are differentiable with respect to task-shared parameters, making it possible to perform effective meta-learning. The task-shared parameters are trained such that the expected CATE estimation performance in few-shot settings is improved by minimizing the difference between a CATE estimated with a large amount of data and one estimated with just a few data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing meta-learning approaches and CATE estimation methods. ",

We demonstrate that a nearly identical model architecture (HuBERT) trained with a masked language modeling loss does not exhibit this same ability, suggesting that the visual grounding objective is responsible for the emergence of this phenomenon. We propose the use of a minimum cut algorithm to automatically predict syllable boundaries in speech, followed by a 2-stage clustering method to group identical syllables together. We show that our model not only outperforms a state-of-the-art syllabic segmentation method on the language it was trained on (English), but also generalizes in a zero-shot fashion to Estonian. Finally, we show that the same model is capable of zero-shot generalization for a word segmentation task on 4 other languages from the Zerospeech Challenge, in some cases beating the previous state-of-the-art.

Each agent in the systems uses only local computation and communication in the overall process without leaking their private information. Based on the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method and multi-consensus inner loops, a distributed algorithm with the availability of larger stepsizes and accelerated convergence, namely ADBB, is proposed. Moreover, owing to employing only row-stochastic weight matrices, ADBB can resolve the optimization problems over unbalanced directed networks without requiring the knowledge of neighbors' out-degree for each agent. Via establishing contraction relationships between the consensus error, the optimality gap, and the gradient tracking error, ADBB is theoretically proved to converge linearly to the globally optimal solution. A real-world data set is used in simulations to validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based image segmentation and detection models have largely improved the efficiency of analyzing retinal landmarks such as optic disc (OD), optic cup (OC), and fovea. However, factors including ophthalmic disease-related lesions and low image quality issues may severely complicate automatic OD/OC segmentation and fovea detection. Most existing works treat the identification of each landmark as a single task, and take into account no prior information. To address these issues, we propose a prior guided multi-task transformer framework for joint OD/OC segmentation and fovea detection, named JOINEDTrans. JOINEDTrans effectively combines various spatial features of the fundus images, relieving the structural distortions induced by lesions and other imaging issues. It contains a segmentation branch and a detection branch. To be noted, we employ an encoder pretrained in a vessel segmentation task to effectively exploit the positional relationship among vessel, OD/OC, and fovea, successfully incorporating spatial prior into the proposed JOINEDTrans framework. There are a coarse stage and a fine stage in JOINEDTrans. In the coarse stage, OD/OC coarse segmentation and fovea heatmap localization are obtained through a joint segmentation and detection module. In the fine stage, we crop regions of interest for subsequent refinement and use predictions obtained in the coarse stage to provide additional information for better performance and faster convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that JOINEDTrans outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the publicly available GAMMA, REFUGE, and PALM fundus image datasets.

    "abstract": "Neural Transducer and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) are popular end-to-end automatic speech recognition systems. Due to their frame-synchronous design, blank symbols are introduced to address the length mismatch between acoustic frames and output tokens, which might bring redundant computation. Previous studies managed to accelerate the training and inference of neural Transducers by discarding frames based on the blank symbols predicted by a co-trained CTC. However, there is no guarantee that the co-trained CTC can maximize the ratio of blank symbols. This paper proposes two novel regularization methods to explicitly encourage more blanks by constraining the self-loop of non-blank symbols in the CTC. It is interesting to find that the frame reduction ratio of the neural Transducer can approach the theoretical boundary. Experiments on LibriSpeech corpus show that our proposed method accelerates the inference of neural Transducer by 4 times without sacrificing performance.

Concretely, we leverage an International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) multilingual model to create frame-level pseudo labels for unlabeled speech, and use these pseudo labels to guide hidden-unit BERT (HuBERT) based speech pretraining in a phonetically-informed manner. The experiments on the Multilingual Speech (MLS) Corpus show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the standard HuBERT on all the target languages. Moreover, on 3 of the 4 languages, comparing to the standard HuBERT, the approach performs better, meanwhile is able to save supervised training data by 1.5k hours (75%) at most. Our approach outperforms most of the state of the arts, with much less pretraining data in terms of hours and language diversity. Compared to XLSR-53 and a retraining based multilingual method, our approach performs better with full and limited finetuning data scenarios. ",

This enables us to study the NS variants both with respect to the spoken state language and their acoustic characteristics. In this paper, we investigate an extensive set of acoustic features, including MFCCs and prosodic features, as well as state-of-the-art self-supervised representations, namely, XLS-R, WavLM, and HuBERT, for the automatic detection of the four NS variants. In addition, we examine how the majority state language is reflected in the dialects. Our results show that NS dialects are influenced by the state language and that the four dialects are separable, reaching high classification accuracy, especially with the XLS-R model. ",
