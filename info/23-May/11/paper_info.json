    "title": "Enhancing Road Safety through Accurate Detection of Hazardous Driving  Behaviors with Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks",
    "abstract": "Car accidents remain a significant public safety issue worldwide, with the majority of them attributed to driver errors stemming from inadequate driving knowledge, non-compliance with regulations, and poor driving habits. To improve road safety, Driving Behavior Detection (DBD) systems have been proposed in several studies to identify safe and unsafe driving behavior. Many of these studies have utilized sensor data obtained from the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus to construct their models. However, the use of publicly available sensors is known to reduce the accuracy of detection models, while incorporating vendor-specific sensors into the dataset increases accuracy. To address the limitations of existing approaches, we present a reliable DBD system based on Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (GConvLSTM) that enhances the precision and practicality of DBD models using public sensors. Additionally, we incorporate non-public sensors to evaluate the model's effectiveness. Our proposed model achieved a high accuracy of 97.5\\% for public sensors and an average accuracy of 98.1\\% for non-public sensors, indicating its consistency and accuracy in both settings. To enable local driver behavior analysis, we deployed our DBD system on a Raspberry Pi at the network edge, with drivers able to access daily driving condition reports, sensor data, and prediction results through a monitoring dashboard. Furthermore, the dashboard issues voice warnings to alert drivers of hazardous driving conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed system can effectively detect hazardous and unsafe driving behavior, with potential applications in improving road safety and reducing the number of accidents caused by driver errors.

    "title": "Effects of data time lag in a decision-making system using machine  learning for pork price prediction",
    "abstract": "Spain is the third-largest producer of pork meat in the world, and many farms in several regions depend on the evolution of this market. However, the current pricing system is unfair, as some actors have better market information than others. In this context, historical pricing is an easy-to-find and affordable data source that can help all agents to be better informed. However, the time lag in data acquisition can affect their pricing decisions. In this paper, we study the effect that data acquisition delay has on a price prediction system using multiple prediction algorithms. We describe the integration of the best proposal into a decision support system prototype and test it in a real-case scenario. Specifically, we use public data from the most important regional pork meat markets in Spain published by the Ministry of Agriculture with a two-week delay and subscription-based data of the same markets obtained on the same day. The results show that the error difference between the best public and data subscription models is 0.6 Euro cents in favor of the data without delay. The market dimension makes these differences significant in the supply chain, giving pricing agents a better tool to negotiate market prices. ",

    "title": "CodeIE: Large Code Generation Models are Better Few-Shot Information  Extractors",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on massive corpora have demonstrated impressive few-shot learning ability on many NLP tasks. A common practice is to recast the task into a text-to-text format such that generative LLMs of natural language (NL-LLMs) like GPT-3 can be prompted to solve it. However, it is nontrivial to perform information extraction (IE) tasks with NL-LLMs since the output of the IE task is usually structured and therefore is hard to be converted into plain text. In this paper, we propose to recast the structured output in the form of code instead of natural language and utilize generative LLMs of code (Code-LLMs) such as Codex to perform IE tasks, in particular, named entity recognition and relation extraction. In contrast to NL-LLMs, we show that Code-LLMs can be well-aligned with these IE tasks by designing code-style prompts and formulating these IE tasks as code generation tasks. Experiment results on seven benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms fine-tuning moderate-size pre-trained models specially designed for IE tasks (e.g., UIE) and prompting NL-LLMs under few-shot settings. We further conduct a series of in-depth analyses to demonstrate the merits of leveraging Code-LLMs for IE tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Class imbalance problems widely exist in the medical field and heavily deteriorates performance of clinical predictive models. Most techniques to alleviate the problem rebalance class proportions and they predominantly assume the rebalanced proportions should be a function of the original data and oblivious to the model one uses. This work challenges this prevailing assumption and proposes that links the optimal class proportions to the model complexity, thereby tuning the class proportions per model. Our experiments on the opioid overdose prediction problem highlight the performance gain of tuning class proportions. Rigorous regression analysis also confirms the advantages of the theoretical framework proposed and the statistically significant correlation between the hyperparameters controlling the model complexity and the optimal class proportions.

    "abstract": "Deep learning based voice synthesis technology generates artificial human-like speeches, which has been used in deepfakes or identity theft attacks. Existing defense mechanisms inject subtle adversarial perturbations into the raw speech audios to mislead the voice synthesis models. However, optimizing the adversarial perturbation not only consumes substantial computation time, but it also requires the availability of entire speech. Therefore, they are not suitable for protecting live speech streams, such as voice messages or online meetings. In this paper, we propose VSMask, a real-time protection mechanism against voice synthesis attacks. Different from offline protection schemes, VSMask leverages a predictive neural network to forecast the most effective perturbation for the upcoming streaming speech. VSMask introduces a universal perturbation tailored for arbitrary speech input to shield a real-time speech in its entirety. To minimize the audio distortion within the protected speech, we implement a weight-based perturbation constraint to reduce the perceptibility of the added perturbation. We comprehensively evaluate VSMask protection performance under different scenarios. The experimental results indicate that VSMask can effectively defend against 3 popular voice synthesis models. None of the synthetic voice could deceive the speaker verification models or human ears with VSMask protection. In a physical world experiment, we demonstrate that VSMask successfully safeguards the real-time speech by injecting the perturbation over the air. ",

    "abstract": "Modern advances in machine learning (ML) and wearable medical sensors (WMSs) in edge devices have enabled ML-driven disease detection for smart healthcare. Conventional ML-driven disease detection methods rely on customizing individual models for each disease and its corresponding WMS data. However, such methods lack adaptability to distribution shifts and new task classification classes. Also, they need to be rearchitected and retrained from scratch for each new disease. Moreover, installing multiple ML models in an edge device consumes excessive memory, drains the battery faster, and complicates the detection process. To address these challenges, we propose DOCTOR, a multi-disease detection continual learning (CL) framework based on WMSs. It employs a multi-headed deep neural network (DNN) and an exemplar-replay-style CL algorithm. The CL algorithm enables the framework to continually learn new missions where different data distributions, classification classes, and disease detection tasks are introduced sequentially. It counteracts catastrophic forgetting with a data preservation method and a synthetic data generation module. The data preservation method efficiently preserves the most informative subset of training data from previous missions based on the average training loss of each data instance. The synthetic data generation module models the probability distribution of the real training data and then generates as much synthetic data as needed for replays while maintaining data privacy. The multi-headed DNN enables DOCTOR to detect multiple diseases simultaneously based on user WMS data. We demonstrate DOCTOR's efficacy in maintaining high multi-disease classification accuracy with a single DNN model in various CL experiments. DOCTOR achieves very competitive performance across all CL scenarios relative to the ideal joint-training framework while maintaining a small model size. ",

    "abstract": "A road network, in the context of traffic forecasting, is typically modeled as a graph where the nodes are sensors that measure traffic metrics (such as speed) at that location. Traffic forecasting is interesting because it is complex as the future speed of a road is dependent on a number of different factors. Therefore, to properly forecast traffic, we need a model that is capable of capturing all these different factors. A factor that is missing from the existing works is the node interactions factor. Existing works fail to capture the inter-node interactions because none are using the message-passing flavor of GNN, which is the one best suited to capture the node interactions This paper presents a plausible scenario in road traffic where node interactions are important and argued that the most appropriate GNN flavor to capture node interactions is message-passing. Results from real-world data show the superiority of the message-passing flavor for traffic forecasting. An additional experiment using synthetic data shows that the message-passing flavor can capture inter-node interaction better than other flavors. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, in particular, Machine Learning (ML) have emerged to be utilized in various applications due to their capability to learn how to solve complex problems. Over the last decade, rapid advances in ML have presented Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) consisting of a large number of neurons and layers. DNN Hardware Accelerators (DHAs) are leveraged to deploy DNNs in the target applications. Safety-critical applications, where hardware faults/errors would result in catastrophic consequences, also benefit from DHAs. Therefore, the reliability of DNNs is an essential subject of research. In recent years, several studies have been published accordingly to assess the reliability of DNNs. In this regard, various reliability assessment methods have been proposed on a variety of platforms and applications. Hence, there is a need to summarize the state of the art to identify the gaps in the study of the reliability of DNNs. In this work, we conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the reliability assessment methods of DNNs to collect relevant research works as much as possible, present a categorization of them, and address the open challenges. Through this SLR, three kinds of methods for reliability assessment of DNNs are identified including Fault Injection (FI), Analytical, and Hybrid methods. Since the majority of works assess the DNN reliability by FI, we characterize different approaches and platforms of the FI method comprehensively. Moreover, Analytical and Hybrid methods are propounded. Thus, different reliability assessment methods for DNNs have been elaborated on their conducted DNN platforms and reliability evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the identified methods and address the open challenges in the research area. ",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that standard training via empirical risk minimization (ERM) can produce models that achieve high accuracy on average but low accuracy on underrepresented groups due to the prevalence of spurious features. A predominant approach to tackle this group robustness problem minimizes the worst group error (akin to a minimax strategy) on the training data, hoping it will generalize well on the testing data. However, this is often suboptimal, especially when the out-of-distribution (OOD) test data contains previously unseen groups. Inspired by ideas from the information retrieval and learning-to-rank literature, this paper first proposes to use Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) as a metric of model quality for facilitating better hyperparameter tuning and model selection. Being a ranking-based metric, DCG weights multiple poorly-performing groups (instead of considering just the group with the worst performance). As a natural next step, we build on our results to propose a ranking-based training method called Discounted Rank Upweighting (DRU), which differentially reweights a ranked list of poorly-performing groups in the training data to learn models that exhibit strong OOD performance on the test data. Results on several synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the superior generalization ability of our group-ranking-based (akin to soft-minimax) approach in selecting and learning models that are robust to group distributional shifts.

A central question is the adequate structure for a space of spike trains and its implication for the design of error measurements of SNNs including time delay, threshold deviations, and the design of the reinitialization mode of the leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model. First we identify the underlying topology by analyzing the closure of all sub-threshold signals of a LIF model. For zero leakage this approach yields the Alexiewicz topology, which we adopt to LIF neurons with arbitrary positive leakage. As a result LIF can be understood as spike train quantization in the corresponding norm. This way we obtain various error bounds and inequalities such as a quasi isometry relation between incoming and outgoing spike trains. Another result is a Lipschitz-style global upper bound for the error propagation and a related resonance-type phenomenon. ",

    "abstract": "The capabilities of text generators have grown with the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLM). To prevent potential misuse, the ability to detect whether texts are produced by LLM has become increasingly important. Several related works have attempted to solve this problem using binary classifiers that categorize input text as human-written or LLM-generated. However, these classifiers have been shown to be unreliable. As impactful decisions could be made based on the result of the classification, the text source detection needs to be high-quality. To this end, this paper presents DeepTextMark, a deep learning-based text watermarking method for text source detection. Applying Word2Vec and Sentence Encoding for watermark insertion and a transformer-based classifier for watermark detection, DeepTextMark achieves blindness, robustness, imperceptibility, and reliability simultaneously. As discussed further in the paper, these traits are indispensable for generic text source detection, and the application focus of this paper is on the text generated by LLM. DeepTextMark can be implemented as an \"add-on\" to existing text generation systems. That is, the method does not require access or modification to the text generation technique. Experiments have shown high imperceptibility, high detection accuracy, enhanced robustness, reliability, and fast running speed of DeepTextMark. ",

Numerous recent studies have explored the use of machine learning for code analysis and program synthesis, including parallelization, in light of the success of machine learning in natural language processing. However, applying machine learning techniques to parallelism detection presents several challenges, such as the lack of an adequate dataset for training, an effective code representation with rich information, and a suitable machine learning model to learn the latent features of code for diverse analyses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel graph-based learning approach called Graph2Par that utilizes a heterogeneous augmented abstract syntax tree (Augmented-AST) representation for code. The proposed approach primarily focused on loop-level parallelization with OpenMP. Moreover, we create an OMP\\_Serial dataset with 18598 parallelizable and 13972 non-parallelizable loops to train the machine learning models. Our results show that our proposed approach achieves the accuracy of parallelizable code region detection with 85\\% accuracy and outperforms the state-of-the-art token-based machine learning approach. These results indicate that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art tools and capable of handling loops with complex structures that other tools may overlook. ",

    "abstract": "Gaps, dropouts and short clips of corrupted audio are a common problem and particularly annoying when they occur in speech. This paper uses machine learning to regenerate gaps of up to 320ms in an audio speech signal. Audio regeneration is translated into image regeneration by transforming audio into a Mel-spectrogram and using image in-painting to regenerate the gaps. The full Mel-spectrogram is then transferred back to audio using the Parallel-WaveGAN vocoder and integrated into the audio stream. Using a sample of 1300 spoken audio clips of between 1 and 10 seconds taken from the publicly-available LJSpeech dataset our results show regeneration of audio gaps in close to real time using GANs with a GPU equipped system. As expected, the smaller the gap in the audio, the better the quality of the filled gaps. On a gap of 240ms the average mean opinion score (MOS) for the best performing models was 3.737, on a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best) which is sufficient for a human to perceive as close to uninterrupted human speech.

    "title": "Regular Splitting Graph Network for 3D Human Pose Estimation",
    "abstract": "In human pose estimation methods based on graph convolutional architectures, the human skeleton is usually modeled as an undirected graph whose nodes are body joints and edges are connections between neighboring joints. However, most of these methods tend to focus on learning relationships between body joints of the skeleton using first-order neighbors, ignoring higher-order neighbors and hence limiting their ability to exploit relationships between distant joints. In this paper, we introduce a higher-order regular splitting graph network (RS-Net) for 2D-to-3D human pose estimation using matrix splitting in conjunction with weight and adjacency modulation. The core idea is to capture long-range dependencies between body joints using multi-hop neighborhoods and also to learn different modulation vectors for different body joints as well as a modulation matrix added to the adjacency matrix associated to the skeleton. This learnable modulation matrix helps adjust the graph structure by adding extra graph edges in an effort to learn additional connections between body joints. Instead of using a shared weight matrix for all neighboring body joints, the proposed RS-Net model applies weight unsharing before aggregating the feature vectors associated to the joints in order to capture the different relations between them. Experiments and ablations studies performed on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving superior performance over recent state-of-the-art methods for 3D human pose estimation.

    "abstract": "Change detection is an essential and widely utilized task in remote sensing that aims to detect and analyze changes occurring in the same geographical area over time, which has broad applications in urban development, agricultural surveys, and land cover monitoring. Detecting changes in remote sensing images is a complex challenge due to various factors, including variations in image quality, noise, registration errors, illumination changes, complex landscapes, and spatial heterogeneity. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature extraction and addressing these challenges. Its versatility has resulted in its widespread adoption for numerous image-processing tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of significant advancements in change detection for remote sensing images over the past decade. We first introduce some preliminary knowledge for the change detection task, such as problem definition, datasets, evaluation metrics, and transformer basics, as well as provide a detailed taxonomy of existing algorithms from three different perspectives: algorithm granularity, supervision modes, and learning frameworks in the methodology section. This survey enables readers to gain systematic knowledge of change detection tasks from various angles. We then summarize the state-of-the-art performance on several dominant change detection datasets, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of existing algorithms. Based on our survey, some future research directions for change detection in remote sensing are well identified. This survey paper will shed some light on the community and inspire further research efforts in the change detection task. ",

    "abstract": "The Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem is a well-known challenge in dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. In this problem, fixed resources must be allocated to serve customers over a finite horizon, while customers arrive according to a stochastic process. The typical NRM model assumes that customer arrivals are independent over time. However, in this paper, we explore a more general setting where customer arrivals over different periods can be correlated. We propose a new model that assumes the existence of a system state, which determines customer arrivals for the current period. This system state evolves over time according to a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain. Our model can be used to represent correlation in various settings and synthesizes previous literature on correlation models. To solve the NRM problem under our correlated model, we derive a new linear programming (LP) approximation of the optimal policy. Our approximation provides a tighter upper bound on the total expected value collected by the optimal policy than existing upper bounds. We use our LP to develop a new bid price policy, which computes bid prices for each system state and time period in a backward induction manner. The decision is then made by comparing the reward of the customer against the associated bid prices. Our policy guarantees to collect at least $1/(1+L)$ fraction of the total reward collected by the optimal policy, where $L$ denotes the maximum number of resources required by a customer. In summary, our work presents a new model for correlated customer arrivals in the NRM problem and provides an LP approximation for solving the problem under this model. We derive a new bid price policy and provides a theoretical guarantee on the performance of the policy. ",

    "abstract": "Driven by the wide adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) across different application domains, multi-tenancy execution, where multiple DNNs are deployed simultaneously on the same hardware, has been proposed to satisfy the latency requirements of different applications while improving the overall system utilization. However, multi-tenancy execution could lead to undesired system-level resource contention, causing quality-of-service (QoS) degradation for latency-critical applications. To address this challenge, we propose MoCA, an adaptive multi-tenancy system for DNN accelerators. Unlike existing solutions that focus on compute resource partition, MoCA dynamically manages shared memory resources of co-located applications to meet their QoS targets. Specifically, MoCA leverages the regularities in both DNN operators and accelerators to dynamically modulate memory access rates based on their latency targets and user-defined priorities so that co-located applications get the resources they demand without significantly starving their co-runners. We demonstrate that MoCA improves the satisfaction rate of the service level agreement (SLA) up to 3.9x (1.8x average), system throughput by 2.3x (1.7x average), and fairness by 1.3x (1.2x average), compared to prior work.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are essential to various fields, e.g., e-commerce, e-learning, and streaming media. At present, graph neural networks (GNNs) for session-based recommendations normally can only recommend items existing in users' historical sessions. As a result, these GNNs have difficulty recommending items that users have never interacted with (new items), which leads to a phenomenon of information cocoon. Therefore, it is necessary to recommend new items to users. As there is no interaction between new items and users, we cannot include new items when building session graphs for GNN session-based recommender systems. Thus, it is challenging to recommend new items for users when using GNN-based methods. We regard this challenge as '\\textbf{G}NN \\textbf{S}ession-based \\textbf{N}ew \\textbf{I}tem \\textbf{R}ecommendation (GSNIR)'. To solve this problem, we propose a dual-intent enhanced graph neural network for it. Due to the fact that new items are not tied to historical sessions, the users' intent is difficult to predict. We design a dual-intent network to learn user intent from an attention mechanism and the distribution of historical data respectively, which can simulate users' decision-making process in interacting with a new item. To solve the challenge that new items cannot be learned by GNNs, inspired by zero-shot learning (ZSL), we infer the new item representation in GNN space by using their attributes. By outputting new item probabilities, which contain recommendation scores of the corresponding items, the new items with higher scores are recommended to users. Experiments on two representative real-world datasets show the superiority of our proposed method. The case study from the real-world verifies interpretability benefits brought by the dual-intent module and the new item reasoning module.

We investigate the effect of robot gaze cues on people's subjective perceptions of a mobile robot as a socially present entity in three common hallway navigation scenarios. The tested robot gaze behaviors were path-oriented (looking at its own future path), or person-oriented (looking at the nearest person), with fixed-gaze as the control. We conduct a real-world study with 36 participants who walked through the hallway, and an online study with 233 participants who were shown simulated videos of the same scenarios. Our results suggest that the preferred gaze behavior is scenario-dependent. Person-oriented gaze behaviors which acknowledge the presence of the human are generally preferred when the robot and human cross paths. However, this benefit is diminished in scenarios that involve less implicit interaction between the robot and the human. ",

One major challenge is that adversarial examples transfer poorly against QNNs with unknown bitwidths because of the quantization shift and gradient misalignment issues. This paper proposes the Quantization Aware Attack to enhance the attack transferability by making the substitute model ``aware of'' the target of attacking models with multiple bitwidths. Specifically, we design a training objective with multiple bitwidths to align the gradient of the substitute model with the target model with different bitwidths and thus mitigate the negative effect of the above two issues. We conduct comprehensive evaluations by performing multiple transfer-based attacks on standard models and defense models with different architectures and quantization bitwidths. Experimental results show that QAA significantly improves the adversarial transferability of the state-of-the-art attacks by 3.4%-20.9% against normally trained models and 3.7%-13.4% against adversarially trained models on average.

Specifically, we introduce the instance-level and label-level similarities to recover label confidences as well as exploit label dependencies. At each training epoch, labels are propagated on the instance and label graphs to produce relatively accurate pseudo-labels; then, we train the deep model to fit the numerical labels. Moreover, we provide a careful analysis of the risk functions to guarantee the robustness of the proposed model.

Among numerous detection methods that have been recently proposed, the ones based on edge drawing attract increasing attention owing to their excellent detection efficiency.

Based on the observation that the line segments should locate on the edge points with both consistent coordinates and level-line information, i.e., the unit vector perpendicular to the gradient orientation, this paper proposes a level-line guided edge drawing for robust line segment detection (GEDRLSD). The level-line information provides potential directions for edge tracking, which could be served as a guideline for accurate edge drawing. Additionally, the level-line information is fused in line segment fitting to improve the robustness.

Our motivation for developing DFSQ is based on the distinctive activation distributions of current super-resolution models, which exhibit significant variance across samples and channels. To address this issue, DFSQ conducts channel-wise normalization of the activations and applies distribution-flexible subset quantization (SQ), wherein the quantization points are selected from a universal set consisting of multi-word additive log-scale values. To expedite the selection of quantization points in SQ, we propose a fast quantization points selection strategy that uses K-means clustering to select the quantization points closest to the centroids. Compared to the common iterative exhaustive search algorithm, our strategy avoids the enumeration of all possible combinations in the universal set, reducing the time complexity from exponential to linear. Consequently, the constraint of time costs on the size of the universal set is greatly relaxed. Extensive evaluations of various super-resolution models show that DFSQ effectively retains performance even without fine-tuning. For example, when quantizing EDSRx2 on the Urban benchmark, DFSQ achieves comparable performance to full-precision counterparts on 6- and 8-bit quantization, and incurs only a 0.1 dB PSNR drop on 4-bit quantization.

In this paper, we propose a novel search-based black-box adversarial attack guided by model behaviours for pre-trained programming language models, named Representation Nearest Neighbor Search(RNNS), to evaluate the robustness of Pre-trained PL models. Unlike other black-box adversarial attacks, RNNS uses the model-change signal to guide the search in the space of the variable names collected from real-world projects. Specifically, RNNS contains two main steps, 1) indicate which variable (attack position location) we should attack based on model uncertainty, and 2) search which adversarial tokens we should use for variable renaming according to the model behaviour observations. We evaluate RNNS on 6 code tasks (e.g., clone detection), 3 programming languages (Java, Python, and C), and 3 pre-trained code models: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, and CodeT5. The results demonstrate that RNNS outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box attacking methods (MHM and ALERT) in terms of attack success rate (ASR) and query times (QT). The perturbation of generated adversarial examples from RNNS is smaller than the baselines with respect to the number of replaced variables and the variable length change.

The personality theory in cognitive psychology describes that humans can well handle the above cooperation challenge by predicting others' personalities first and then their complex actions. Inspired by this two-step psychology theory, we propose a biologically plausible mixture of personality (MoP) improved spiking actor network (SAN), whereby a determinantal point process is used to simulate the complex formation and integration of different types of personality in MoP, and dynamic and spiking neurons are incorporated into the SAN for the efficient reinforcement learning. The benchmark Overcooked task, containing a strong requirement for cooperative cooking, is selected to test the proposed MoP-SAN. The experimental results show that the MoP-SAN can achieve both high performances during not only the learning paradigm but also the generalization test (i.e., cooperation with other unseen agents) paradigm where most counterpart deep actor networks failed. Necessary ablation experiments and visualization analyses were conducted to explain why MoP and SAN are effective in multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios while DNN performs poorly in the generalization test.

Previous works mainly focus on improving coordination ability via solving MARL-specific challenges (e.g., non-stationarity, credit assignment, scalability), but ignore the policy perturbation issue when testing in a different environment. This issue hasn't been considered in problem formulation or efficient algorithm design. To address this issue, we firstly model the problem as a limited policy adversary Dec-POMDP (LPA-Dec-POMDP), where some coordinators from a team might accidentally and unpredictably encounter a limited number of malicious action attacks, but the regular coordinators still strive for the intended goal. Then, we propose Robust Multi-Agent Coordination via Evolutionary Generation of Auxiliary Adversarial Attackers (ROMANCE), which enables the trained policy to encounter diversified and strong auxiliary adversarial attacks during training, thus achieving high robustness under various policy perturbations. Concretely, to avoid the ego-system overfitting to a specific attacker, we maintain a set of attackers, which is optimized to guarantee the attackers high attacking quality and behavior diversity. The goal of quality is to minimize the ego-system coordination effect, and a novel diversity regularizer based on sparse action is applied to diversify the behaviors among attackers. The ego-system is then paired with a population of attackers selected from the maintained attacker set, and alternately trained against the constantly evolving attackers. Extensive experiments on multiple scenarios from SMAC indicate our ROMANCE provides comparable or better robustness and generalization ability than other baselines. ",

    "abstract": "The noisy leaky integrate-and-fire (NLIF) model describes the voltage configurations of neuron networks with an interacting many-particles system at a microscopic level. When simulating neuron networks of large sizes, computing a coarse-grained mean-field Fokker-Planck equation solving the voltage densities of the networks at a macroscopic level practically serves as a feasible alternative in its high efficiency and credible accuracy. However, the macroscopic model fails to yield valid results of the networks when simulating considerably synchronous networks with active firing events. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale solver for the NLIF networks, which inherits the low cost of the macroscopic solver and the high reliability of the microscopic solver. For each temporal step, the multi-scale solver uses the macroscopic solver when the firing rate of the simulated network is low, while it switches to the microscopic solver when the firing rate tends to blow up. Moreover, the macroscopic and microscopic solvers are integrated with a high-precision switching algorithm to ensure the accuracy of the multi-scale solver. The validity of the multi-scale solver is analyzed from two perspectives: firstly, we provide practically sufficient conditions that guarantee the mean-field approximation of the macroscopic model and present rigorous numerical analysis on simulation errors when coupling the two solvers; secondly, the numerical performance of the multi-scale solver is validated through simulating several large neuron networks, including networks with either instantaneous or periodic input currents which prompt active firing events over a period of time.

Besides, the hierarchical distribution of heterogeneous resources makes the modeling and scheduling of k8s-oriented edge-cloud network particularly challenging. In this paper, we introduce KaiS, a learning-based scheduling framework for such edge-cloud network to improve the long-term throughput rate of request processing. First, we design a coordinated multi-agent actor-critic algorithm to cater to decentralized request dispatch and dynamic dispatch spaces within the edge cluster. Second, for diverse system scales and structures, we use graph neural networks to embed system state information, and combine the embedding results with multiple policy networks to reduce the orchestration dimensionality by stepwise scheduling. Finally, we adopt a two-time-scale scheduling mechanism to harmonize request dispatch and service orchestration, and present the implementation design of deploying the above algorithms compatible with native k8s components. Experiments using real workload traces show that KaiS can successfully learn appropriate scheduling policies, irrespective of request arrival patterns and system scales. Moreover, KaiS can enhance the average system throughput rate by 15.9% while reducing scheduling cost by 38.4% compared to baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Deepfake techniques have been widely used for malicious purposes, prompting extensive research interest in developing Deepfake detection methods. Deepfake manipulations typically involve tampering with facial parts, which can result in inconsistencies across different parts of the face. For instance, Deepfake techniques may change smiling lips to an upset lip, while the eyes remain smiling. Existing detection methods depend on specific indicators of forgery, which tend to disappear as the forgery patterns are improved. To address the limitation, we propose Mover, a new Deepfake detection model that exploits unspecific facial part inconsistencies, which are inevitable weaknesses of Deepfake videos. Mover randomly masks regions of interest (ROIs) and recovers faces to learn unspecific features, which makes it difficult for fake faces to be recovered, while real faces can be easily recovered. Specifically, given a real face image, we first pretrain a masked autoencoder to learn facial part consistency by dividing faces into three parts and randomly masking ROIs, which are then recovered based on the unmasked facial parts. Furthermore, to maximize the discrepancy between real and fake videos, we propose a novel model with dual networks that utilize the pretrained encoder and masked autoencoder, respectively. 1) The pretrained encoder is finetuned for capturing the encoding of inconsistent information in the given video. 2) The pretrained masked autoencoder is utilized for mapping faces and distinguishing real and fake videos. Our extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that Mover is highly effective. ",

For the consideration of parameter efficiency, recent studies focus on increasing model depth rather than width to achieve better performance. In this paper, we study how model width affects the Transformer model through a parameter-efficient multi-path structure. To better fuse features extracted from different paths, we add three additional operations to each sublayer: a normalization at the end of each path, a cheap operation to produce more features, and a learnable weighted mechanism to fuse all features flexibly. Extensive experiments on 12 WMT machine translation tasks show that, with the same number of parameters, the shallower multi-path model can achieve similar or even better performance than the deeper model. It reveals that we should pay more attention to the multi-path structure, and there should be a balance between the model depth and width to train a better large-scale Transformer. ",

Unfortunately, PyCG does not scale to large programs when adapted to whole-program analysis where dependent libraries are also analyzed. Further, PyCG does not support demand-driven analysis where only the reachable functions from given entry functions are analyzed. Moreover, PyCG is flow-insensitive and does not fully support Python's features, hindering its accuracy. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a scalable demand-driven approach for generating call graphs for Python programs, and implement it as a prototype tool Jarvis. Jarvis maintains an assignment graph (i.e., points-to relations between program identifiers) for each function in a program to allow reuse and improve scalability. Given a set of entry functions as the demands, Jarvis generates the call graph on-the-fly, where flow-sensitive intra-procedural analysis and inter-procedural analysis are conducted in turn. Our evaluation on a micro-benchmark of 135 small Python programs and a macro-benchmark of 6 real-world Python applications has demonstrated that Jarvis can significantly improve PyCG by at least 67% faster in time, 84% higher in precision, and at least 10% higher in recall.

However, state-of-the-art deep SNNs (including Spikformer and Spikingformer) suffer from a critical challenge related to the imprecise gradient backpropagation. This problem arises from the improper design of downsampling modules in these networks, and greatly hampering the overall model performance.

We prove that CML can effectively overcome the imprecision of gradient backpropagation from a theoretical perspective.

To make learning effective, we parameterize symbolic logical elements using neural representations, which facilitate the automatic generation and evaluation of meaningful logic clauses. Additionally, to make our framework generalizable across diverse misinformation sources, we introduce five meta-predicates that can be instantiated with different correlations.

    "abstract": "Learning causal structure among event types from discrete-time event sequences is a particularly important but challenging task. Existing methods, such as the multivariate Hawkes processes based methods, mostly boil down to learning the so-called Granger causality which assumes that the cause event happens strictly prior to its effect event. Such an assumption is often untenable beyond applications, especially when dealing with discrete-time event sequences in low-resolution; and typical discrete Hawkes processes mainly suffer from identifiability issues raised by the instantaneous effect, i.e., the causal relationship that occurred simultaneously due to the low-resolution data will not be captured by Granger causality. In this work, we propose Structure Hawkes Processes (SHPs) that leverage the instantaneous effect for learning the causal structure among events type in discrete-time event sequence. The proposed method is featured with the minorization-maximization of the likelihood function and a sparse optimization scheme. Theoretical results show that the instantaneous effect is a blessing rather than a curse, and the causal structure is identifiable under the existence of the instantaneous effect. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

A variety of receiver architectures based on chemical reaction networks (CRNs) and gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) has been introduced in the literature, because cells use these concepts to perform computations in nature. However, practical feasibility is still limited by stochastic fluctuations of chemical reactions and long computation times in GRNs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two receiver designs based on stochastic CRNs, i.e., CRNs that perform computations by exploiting the intrinsic fluctuations of chemical reactions with very low molecule counts. The first CRN builds on a recent result from chemistry that showed how Boltzmann machines (BMs), a commonly used machine learning model, can be implemented with CRNs. We show that BMs with optimal parameter values and their CRN implementations can act as maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) detectors. Furthermore, we show that BMs can be efficiently trained from simulation data to achieve close-to-MAP performance. While this approach yields a fixed CRN once deployed, our second approach based on a manually designed CRN can be trained with pilot symbols even within the cell and thus adapt to changing channel conditions. We extend the literature by showing that practical robust detectors can achieve close-to-MAP performance even without explicit channel knowledge. ",

While they can hinder the applicability of computer vision models in real-world scenarios, they are not always considered as a testbed for model generalization and robustness. In this survey, we present a comprehensive and systematic overview of methods that improve corruption robustness of computer vision models. Unlike existing surveys that focus on adversarial attacks and label noise, we cover extensively the study of robustness to common corruptions that can occur when deploying computer vision models to work in practical applications. We describe different types of image corruption and provide the definition of corruption robustness. We then introduce relevant evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets. We categorize methods into four groups. We also cover indirect methods that show improvements in generalization and may improve corruption robustness as a byproduct. We report benchmark results collected from the literature and find that they are not evaluated in a unified manner, making it difficult to compare and analyze. We thus built a unified benchmark framework to obtain directly comparable results on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate relevant backbone networks pre-trained on ImageNet using our framework, providing an overview of the base corruption robustness of existing models to help choose appropriate backbones for computer vision tasks. We identify that developing methods to handle a wide range of corruptions and efficiently learn with limited data and computational resources is crucial for future development. Additionally, we highlight the need for further investigation into the relationship among corruption robustness, OOD generalization, and shortcut learning. ",

Superior compression performance of our scheme is demonstrated on several widely-recognized NN's (FC-2, LeNet-5, and VGG-16) and datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10), surpassing the state-of-the-art method based on shallow tensor networks. For instance, about 10 million parameters in the three convolutional layers of VGG-16 are compressed in TN's with just $632$ parameters, while the testing accuracy on CIFAR-10 is surprisingly improved from $81.14\\%$ by the original NN to $84.36\\%$ after compression. Our work suggests TN as an exceptionally efficient mathematical structure for representing the variational parameters of NN's, which superiorly exploits the compressibility than the simple multi-way arrays.

    "abstract": "When building a new application we are increasingly confronted with the need of reusing and integrating pre-existing knowledge. Nevertheless, it is a fact that this prior knowledge is virtually impossible to reuse as-is. This is true also in domains, e.g., eHealth, where a lot of effort has been put into developing high-quality standards and reference ontologies, e.g. FHIR1. In this paper, we propose an integrated methodology, called iTelos, which enables data and knowledge reuse towards the construction of Interoperable Electronic Health Records (iEHR). The key intuition is that the data level and the schema level of an application should be developed independently, thus allowing for maximum flexibility in the reuse of the prior knowledge, but under the overall guidance of the needs to be satisfied, formalized as competence queries. This intuition is implemented by codifying all the requirements, including those concerning reuse, as part of a purpose defined a priori, which is then used to drive a middle-out development process where the application schema and data are continuously aligned. The proposed methodology is validated through its application to a large-scale case study. ",

In this work, we develop a novel and general framework which unifies many existing GNN models from the view of parameterized decomposition and filtering, and show how it helps to enhance the flexibility of GNNs while alleviating the smoothness and amplification issues of existing models. Essentially, we show that the extensively studied spectral graph convolutions with learnable polynomial filters are constrained variants of this formulation, and releasing these constraints enables our model to express the desired decomposition and filtering simultaneously.

    "abstract": "N-ary facts composed of a primary triple (head entity, relation, tail entity) and an arbitrary number of auxiliary attribute-value pairs, are prevalent in real-world knowledge graphs (KGs). Link prediction on n-ary facts is to predict a missing element in an n-ary fact. This helps populate and enrich KGs and further promotes numerous downstream applications. Previous studies usually require a substantial amount of high-quality data to understand the elements in n-ary facts. However, these studies overlook few-shot relations, which have limited labeled instances, yet are common in real-world scenarios. Thus, this paper introduces a new task, few-shot link prediction on n-ary facts. It aims to predict a missing entity in an n-ary fact with limited labeled instances. We further propose a model for Few-shot Link prEdict on N-ary facts, thus called FLEN, which consists of three modules: the relation learning, support-specific adjusting, and query inference modules. FLEN captures relation meta information from limited instances to predict a missing entity in a query instance. To validate the effectiveness of FLEN, we construct three datasets based on existing benchmark data. Our experimental results show that FLEN significantly outperforms existing related models in both few-shot link prediction on n-ary facts and binary facts. ",

    "abstract": "Complex event processing (CEP) is a powerful and increasingly more important tool to analyse data streams for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These data streams often contain private information that requires proper protection. However, privacy protection in CEP systems is still in its infancy, and most existing privacy-preserving mechanisms (PPMs) are adopted from those designed for data streams. Such approaches undermine the quality of the entire data stream and limit the performance of IoT applications. In this paper, we attempt to break the limitation and establish a new foundation for PPMs of CEP by proposing a novel pattern-level differential privacy (DP) guarantee. We introduce two PPMs that guarantee pattern-level DP. They operate only on data that correlate with private patterns rather than on the entire data stream, leading to higher data quality. One of the PPMs provides adaptive privacy protection and brings more granularity and generalization. We evaluate the performance of the proposed PPMs with two experiments on a real-world dataset and on a synthetic dataset. The results of the experiments indicate that our proposed privacy guarantee and its PPMs can deliver better data quality under equally strong privacy guarantees, compared to multiple well-known PPMs designed for data streams.

The method provides accurate prediction for ICU patients up to 24 hours before the event and provide time-resolved interpretability results. The performance of the framework relying on extreme gradient boosting was evaluated on a held-out test set from eICU, and externally validated on the MIMIC-IV cohort using the most important features identified by time-resolved Shapley values achieving AUCs of 91.0 (balanced accuracy of 82.3) for 6-hour prediction of mortality respectively. We show that our framework successfully leverages time-series physiological measurements by translating them into stacked static prediction problems to be robustly predictive through time in the ICU stay and can offer clinical insight from time-resolved interpretability ",

    "abstract": "Although Maxwell discovered the physical laws of electromagnetic waves 160 years ago, how to precisely model the propagation of an RF signal in an electrically large and complex environment remains a long-standing problem. The difficulty is in the complex interactions between the RF signal and the obstacles (e.g., reflection, diffraction, etc.). Inspired by the great success of using a neural network to describe the optical field in computer vision, we propose a neural radio-frequency radiance field, NeRF$^\\textbf{2}$, which represents a continuous volumetric scene function that makes sense of an RF signal's propagation. Particularly, after training with a few signal measurements, NeRF$^\\textbf{2}$ can tell how/what signal is received at any position when it knows the position of a transmitter. As a physical-layer neural network, NeRF$^\\textbf{2}$ can take advantage of the learned statistic model plus the physical model of ray tracing to generate a synthetic dataset that meets the training demands of application-layer artificial neural networks (ANNs). Thus, we can boost the performance of ANNs by the proposed turbo-learning, which mixes the true and synthetic datasets to intensify the training. Our experiment results show that turbo-learning can enhance performance with an approximate 50% increase. We also demonstrate the power of NeRF$^\\textbf{2}$ in the field of indoor localization and 5G MIMO. ",

    "title": "Do code refactorings influence the merge effort?",
    "abstract": "In collaborative software development, multiple contributors frequently change the source code in parallel to implement new features, fix bugs, refactor existing code, and make other changes. These simultaneous changes need to be merged into the same version of the source code. However, the merge operation can fail, and developer intervention is required to resolve the conflicts. Studies in the literature show that 10 to 20 percent of all merge attempts result in conflicts, which require the manual developer's intervention to complete the process. In this paper, we concern about a specific type of change that affects the structure of the source code and has the potential to increase the merge effort: code refactorings. We analyze the relationship between the occurrence of refactorings and the merge effort. To do so, we applied a data mining technique called association rule extraction to find patterns of behavior that allow us to analyze the influence of refactorings on the merge effort. Our experiments extracted association rules from 40,248 merge commits that occurred in 28 popular open-source projects. The results indicate that: (i) the occurrence of refactorings increases the chances of having merge effort; (ii) the more refactorings, the greater the chances of effort; (iii) the more refactorings, the greater the effort; and (iv) parallel refactorings increase even more the chances of having effort, as well as the intensity of it. The results obtained may suggest behavioral changes in the way refactorings are implemented by developer teams. In addition, they can indicate possible ways to improve tools that support code merging and those that recommend refactorings, considering the number of refactorings and merge effort attributes. ",

    "abstract": "Wildfire propagation is a highly stochastic process where small changes in environmental conditions (such as wind speed and direction) can lead to large changes in observed behaviour. A traditional approach to quantify uncertainty in fire-front progression is to generate probability maps via ensembles of simulations. However, use of ensembles is typically computationally expensive, which can limit the scope of uncertainty analysis. To address this, we explore the use of a spatio-temporal neural-based modelling approach to directly estimate the likelihood of fire propagation given uncertainty in input parameters. The uncertainty is represented by deliberately perturbing the input weather forecast during model training. The computational load is concentrated in the model training process, which allows larger probability spaces to be explored during deployment. Empirical evaluations indicate that the proposed model achieves comparable fire boundaries to those produced by the traditional SPARK simulation platform, with an overall Jaccard index (similarity score) of 67.4% on a set of 35 simulated fires. When compared to a related neural model (emulator) which was employed to generate probability maps via ensembles of emulated fires, the proposed approach produces competitive Jaccard similarity scores while being approximately an order of magnitude faster.

However, most existing works on semantic localization focus on passive vision tasks without viewpoint planning, or rely on additional rich modalities (e.g., depth measurements). Thus, the problem is largely unsolved. In this work, we explore a lightweight, entirely CPU-based, domain-adaptive semantic localization framework, called graph neural localizer.Our approach is inspired by two recently emerging technologies: (1) Scene graph, which combines the viewpoint- and appearance- invariance of local and global features; (2) Graph neural network, which enables direct learning/recognition of graph data (i.e., non-vector data). Specifically, a graph convolutional neural network is first trained as a scene graph classifier for passive vision, and then its knowledge is transferred to a reinforcement-learning planner for active vision. Experiments on two scenarios, self-supervised learning and unsupervised domain adaptation, using a photo-realistic Habitat simulator validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

However, the feature space that dominates representation learning has not been systematically studied in graph neural networks. In this paper, we propose to fill this gap by analyzing the feature space of both spatial and spectral models. We decompose graph neural networks into determined feature spaces and trainable weights, providing the convenience of studying the feature space explicitly using matrix space analysis. In particular, we theoretically find that the feature space tends to be linearly correlated due to repeated aggregations. Motivated by these findings, we propose 1) feature subspaces flattening and 2) structural principal components to expand the feature space. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed more comprehensive feature space, with comparable inference time to the baseline, and demonstrate its efficient convergence capability.

In this paper, we propose a new Causal Clothes-Invariant Learning (CCIL) method to achieve clothes-invariant feature learning by modeling causal intervention P(Y|do(X)). This new causality-based model is inherently invariant to the confounder in the causal view, which can achieve the clothes-invariant features and avoid the barrier faced by the likelihood-based methods.

We are interested in developing models capable of interactively mapping user utterances into executable logical forms (e.g., SPARQL) in the context of the conversational history. Our key idea is to represent information about an utterance and its context via a subgraph which is created dynamically, i.e., the number of nodes varies per utterance. Moreover, rather than treating the subgraph as a sequence we exploit its underlying structure, and thus encode it using a graph neural network which further allows us to represent a large number of (unseen) nodes. Experimental results show that modeling context dynamically is superior to static approaches, delivering performance improvements across the board (i.e., for simple and complex questions). Our results further confirm that modeling the structure of context is better at processing discourse information, (i.e., at handling ellipsis and resolving coreference) and longer interactions. ",

Secondly, we design an effective geometry-guided facial keypoint estimation module, providing accurate keypoints for generating motion fields. Lastly, we develop a 3D-aware cross-modal (ie, appearance and depth) attention mechanism, which can be applied to each generation layer, to capture facial geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging benchmarks (ie, VoxCeleb1, VoxCeleb2, and HDTF). The results demonstrate that our proposed framework can generate highly realistic-looking reenacted talking videos, with new state-of-the-art performances established on these benchmarks.

    "title": "Learning Optimal \"Pigovian Tax\" in Sequential Social Dilemmas",
    "abstract": "In multi-agent reinforcement learning, each agent acts to maximize its individual accumulated rewards. Nevertheless, individual accumulated rewards could not fully reflect how others perceive them, resulting in selfish behaviors that undermine global performance. The externality theory, defined as ``the activities of one economic actor affect the activities of another in ways that are not reflected in market transactions,'' is applicable to analyze the social dilemmas in MARL. One of its most profound non-market solutions, ``Pigovian Tax'', which internalizes externalities by taxing those who create negative externalities and subsidizing those who create positive externalities, could aid in developing a mechanism to resolve MARL's social dilemmas. The purpose of this paper is to apply externality theory to analyze social dilemmas in MARL. To internalize the externalities in MARL, the \\textbf{L}earning \\textbf{O}ptimal \\textbf{P}igovian \\textbf{T}ax method (LOPT), is proposed, where an additional agent is introduced to learn the tax/allowance allocation policy so as to approximate the optimal ``Pigovian Tax'' which accurately reflects the externalities for all agents. Furthermore, a reward shaping mechanism based on the approximated optimal ``Pigovian Tax'' is applied to reduce the social cost of each agent and tries to alleviate the social dilemmas. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed LOPT leads to higher collective social welfare in both the Escape Room and the Cleanup environments, which shows the superiority of our method in solving social dilemmas.

Our implicit neural representation maps 4D coordinates defining two-plane parameterization of the light fields to the corresponding color values. We leverage periodic activations to achieve high expressivity and accurate reconstruction for complex data manifolds while keeping low storage and inference time requirements. However, na\\\"ively trained non-3D structured networks do not adequately satisfy the multi-view consistency; instead, they perform alpha blending of nearby viewpoints. In contrast, our View Correspondence Network, or VICON, leverages stereo matching, optimization by automatic differentiation with respect to the input space, and multi-view pixel correspondence to provide a novel implicit representation of the light fields faithful to the novel views that are unseen during the training. Experimental results show VICON superior to the state-of-the-art non-3D implicit light field representations both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, our implicit representation captures a larger field of view (FoV), surpassing the extent of the observable scene by the cameras of the ground truth renderings. ",

One particular API, suitable for dense retrieval, is the semantic embedding API that builds vector representations of a given text. With a growing number of APIs at our disposal, in this paper, our goal is to analyze semantic embedding APIs in realistic retrieval scenarios in order to assist practitioners and researchers in finding suitable services according to their needs. Specifically, we wish to investigate the capabilities of existing APIs on domain generalization and multilingual retrieval. For this purpose, we evaluate the embedding APIs on two standard benchmarks, BEIR, and MIRACL. We find that re-ranking BM25 results using the APIs is a budget-friendly approach and is most effective on English, in contrast to the standard practice, i.e., employing them as first-stage retrievers. For non-English retrieval, re-ranking still improves the results, but a hybrid model with BM25 works best albeit at a higher cost. We hope our work lays the groundwork for thoroughly evaluating APIs that are critical in search and more broadly, in information retrieval. ",

We propose a self-supervised method that uses grasp interactions to collect segmentation supervision for an instance segmentation model. When a robot grasps an item, the mask of that grasped item can be inferred from the images of the scene before and after the grasp. Leveraging this insight, we learn a grasp segmentation model to segment the grasped object from before and after grasp images. Such a model can segment grasped objects from thousands of grasp interactions without costly human annotation. Using the segmented grasped objects, we can \"cut\" objects from their original scenes and \"paste\" them into new scenes to generate instance supervision. We show that our grasp segmentation model provides a 5x error reduction when segmenting grasped objects compared with traditional image subtraction approaches. Combined with our \"cut-and-paste\" generation method, instance segmentation models trained with our method achieve better performance than a model trained with 10x the amount of labeled data. On a real robotic grasping system, our instance segmentation model reduces the rate of grasp errors by over 3x compared to an image subtraction baseline. ",

Unlike mesh-based models, they require watertight geometry and object-wise semantics at the fa\\c{c}ade level. The principal challenge of such demanding semantic 3D reconstruction is reliable fa\\c{c}ade-level semantic segmentation of 3D input data. We present a novel method, called Scan2LoD3, that accurately reconstructs semantic LoD3 building models by improving fa\\c{c}ade-level semantic 3D segmentation. To this end, we leverage laser physics and 3D building model priors to probabilistically identify model conflicts. These probabilistic physical conflicts propose locations of model openings: Their final semantics and shapes are inferred in a Bayesian network fusing multimodal probabilistic maps of conflicts, 3D point clouds, and 2D images. To fulfill demanding LoD3 requirements, we use the estimated shapes to cut openings in 3D building priors and fit semantic 3D objects from a library of fa\\c{c}ade objects. Extensive experiments on the TUM city campus datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Scan2LoD3 over the state-of-the-art methods in fa\\c{c}ade-level detection, semantic segmentation, and LoD3 building model reconstruction. We believe our method can foster the development of probability-driven semantic 3D reconstruction at LoD3 since not only the high-definition reconstruction but also reconstruction confidence becomes pivotal for various applications such as autonomous driving and urban simulations.

Although many countermeasures have been developed to detect Deepfakes ex-post, undoubtedly, passive forensics has not considered any preventive measures for the pristine face before foreseeable manipulations. To complete this forensics ecosystem, we thus put forward the proactive solution dubbed SepMark, which provides a unified framework for source tracing and Deepfake detection. SepMark originates from encoder-decoder-based deep watermarking but with two separable decoders. For the first time the deep separable watermarking, SepMark brings a new paradigm to the established study of deep watermarking, where a single encoder embeds one watermark elegantly, while two decoders can extract the watermark separately at different levels of robustness. The robust decoder termed Tracer that resists various distortions may have an overly high level of robustness, allowing the watermark to survive both before and after Deepfake. The semi-robust one termed Detector is selectively sensitive to malicious distortions, making the watermark disappear after Deepfake. Only SepMark comprising of Tracer and Detector can reliably trace the trusted source of the marked face and detect whether it has been altered since being marked; neither of the two alone can achieve this. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SepMark on typical Deepfakes, including face swapping, expression reenactment, and attribute editing. ",

In addition to providing detailed descriptions of existing measures, we summarize and discuss results on the properties and relationships of these measures, and point to open research problems.

We propose a theoretical model to investigate whether a global search algorithm with incomplete prior information can be outperformed by a stochastic greedy search on average.

Our findings indicate that some graphs and uncertainty model parameters exist where the global search algorithm fails under uncertainty conditions, while the random greedy search performs better. We derive a critical curve that separates stable from unstable graphs for global search with incomplete information. Interestingly, the critical curve's behavior changes from monotonic to bell-shaped depending on the uncertainty parameters. We test our proposed model through numerical simulations on various synthetic and real-world graphs with different structures. Our results offer insights into the design and optimization of search algorithms for network-based applications, such as communication networks, social networks, and biological networks.

These approaches were previously limited to Euclidean configuration spaces, precluding their use with mobile bases or continuous revolute joints. In this paper, we handle such scenarios by modeling configuration spaces as Riemannian manifolds, and we describe a reduction procedure for the zero-curvature case to a mixed-integer convex optimization problem.

However, recent studies have shown that even the best VL models struggle to capture aspects of scene understanding, such as object attributes, relationships, and action states. In contrast, obtaining structured annotations, e.g., scene graphs (SGs) that could improve these models is time-consuming, costly, and tedious, and thus cannot be used on a large scale. Here we ask, can small datasets containing SG annotations provide sufficient information for enhancing structured understanding of VL models? We show that it is indeed possible to improve VL models using such data by utilizing a specialized model architecture and a new training paradigm. Our approach captures structure-related information for both the visual and textual encoders by directly supervising both components when learning from SG labels. We use scene graph supervision to generate fine-grained captions based on various graph augmentations highlighting different compositional aspects of the scene, and to predict SG information using an open vocabulary approach by adding special ``Adaptive SG tokens'' to the visual encoder. Moreover, we design a new adaptation technique tailored specifically to the SG tokens that allows better learning of the graph prediction task while still maintaining zero-shot capabilities. Our model shows strong performance improvements on the Winoground and VL-checklist datasets with only a mild degradation in zero-shot performance. ",

Our novel representation acts as a dynamic video encoding that captures fine details at high compression rates by factorizing space-time into a temporal matrix-vector decomposition. This allows us to obtain temporally coherent reconstructions of human actors for long sequences, while representing high-resolution details even in the context of challenging motion. While most research focuses on synthesizing at resolutions of 4MP or lower, we address the challenge of operating at 12MP.

Both, the case of the entire network and only a cluster, are addressed and the persistence of the obtained synchronization against perturbation is also discussed. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for the existence of attracting trajectories of each node is given. In all cases, the considered dependence on time requires only local integrability, which is a very mild regularity assumption. Moreover, our results mainly depend on the network structure and its properties, and achieve synchronization up to a constant in finite time. Hence they are quite suitable for applications. The applicability of the results is showcased via several examples: coupled van-der-Pol/FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators, weighted/signed opinion dynamics, and coupled Lorenz systems. ",

    "abstract": "Multilayer networks have permeated all the sciences as a powerful mathematical abstraction for interdependent heterogenous systems such as multimodal brain connectomes, transportation, ecological systems, and scientific collaboration. But describing such systems through a purely graph-theoretic formalism presupposes that the interactions that define the underlying infrastructures and support their functions are only pairwise-based; a strong assumption likely leading to oversimplifications. Indeed, most interdependent systems intrinsically involve higher-order intra- and inter-layer interactions. For instance, ecological systems involve interactions among groups within and in-between species, collaborations and citations link teams of coauthors to articles and vice versa, interactions might exist among groups of friends from different social networks, etc. While higher-order interactions have been studied for monolayer systems through the language of simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, a broad and systematic formalism incorporating them into the realm of multilayer systems is still lacking. Here, we introduce the concept of crossimplicial multicomplexes as a general formalism for modelling interdependent systems involving higher-order intra- and inter-layer connections. Subsequently, we introduce cross-homology and its spectral counterpart, the cross-Laplacian operators, to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for quantifying global and local intra- and inter-layer topological structures in such systems. When applied to multilayer networks, these cross-Laplacians provide powerful methods for detecting clusters in one layer that are controlled by hubs in another layer. We call such hubs spectral cross-hubs and define spectral persistence as a way to rank them according to their emergence along the cross-Laplacian spectra. ",

Specifically, we consider the class of 3-manifolds described by plumbing graphs and use Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for the problem of deciding whether a pair of graphs give homeomorphic 3-manifolds. We use supervised learning to train a GNN that provides the answer to such a question with high accuracy. Moreover, we consider reinforcement learning by a GNN to find a sequence of Neumann moves that relates the pair of graphs if the answer is positive. The setting can be understood as a toy model of the problem of deciding whether a pair of Kirby diagrams give diffeomorphic 3- or 4-manifolds. ",

    "title": "Computationally Efficient and Statistically Optimal Robust  High-Dimensional Linear Regression",
    "abstract": "High-dimensional linear regression under heavy-tailed noise or outlier corruption is challenging, both computationally and statistically. Convex approaches have been proven statistically optimal but suffer from high computational costs, especially since the robust loss functions are usually non-smooth. More recently, computationally fast non-convex approaches via sub-gradient descent are proposed, which, unfortunately, fail to deliver a statistically consistent estimator even under sub-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we introduce a projected sub-gradient descent algorithm for both the sparse linear regression and low-rank linear regression problems. The algorithm is not only computationally efficient with linear convergence but also statistically optimal, be the noise Gaussian or heavy-tailed with a finite 1 + epsilon moment. The convergence theory is established for a general framework and its specific applications to absolute loss, Huber loss and quantile loss are investigated. Compared with existing non-convex methods, ours reveals a surprising phenomenon of two-phase convergence. In phase one, the algorithm behaves as in typical non-smooth optimization that requires gradually decaying stepsizes. However, phase one only delivers a statistically sub-optimal estimator, which is already observed in the existing literature. Interestingly, during phase two, the algorithm converges linearly as if minimizing a smooth and strongly convex objective function, and thus a constant stepsize suffices. Underlying the phase-two convergence is the smoothing effect of random noise to the non-smooth robust losses in an area close but not too close to the truth. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical discovery and showcase the superiority of our algorithm over prior methods. ",
