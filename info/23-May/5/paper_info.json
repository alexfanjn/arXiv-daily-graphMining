    "title": "Correlation-Driven Multi-Level Multimodal Learning for Anomaly Detection  on Multiple Energy Sources",
    "abstract": "Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) has been widely used as an intelligent energy consumption measurement system. Electric power was the representative energy source that can be collected by AMI; most existing studies to detect abnormal energy consumption have focused on a single energy source, i.e., power. Recently, other energy sources such as water, gas, and heating have also been actively collected. As a result, it is necessary to develop a unified methodology for anomaly detection across multiple energy sources; however, research efforts have rarely been made to tackle this issue. The inherent difficulty with this issue stems from the fact that anomalies are not usually annotated. Moreover, existing works of anomaly definition depend on only individual energy sources. In this paper, we first propose a method for defining anomalies considering not only individual energy sources but also correlations between them. Then, we propose a new Correlation-driven Multi-Level Multimodal Learning model for anomaly detection on multiple energy sources. The distinguishing property of the model incorporates multiple energy sources in multi-levels based on the strengths of the correlations between them. Furthermore, we generalize the proposed model in order to integrate arbitrary new energy sources with further performance improvement, considering not only correlated but also non-correlated sources. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets consisting of three to five energy sources, we demonstrate that the proposed model clearly outperforms the existing multimodal learning and recent time-series anomaly detection models, and we observe that our model makes further the performance improvement as more correlated or non-correlated energy sources are integrated.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition enjoys a rapid growth along with the development of contrastive learning. The existing methods rely on imposing invariance to augmentations of 3D skeleton within a single data stream, which merely leverages the easy positive pairs and limits the ability to explore the complicated movement patterns. In this paper, we advocate that the defect of single-stream contrast and the lack of necessary feature transformation are responsible for easy positives, and therefore propose a Cross-Stream Contrastive Learning framework for skeleton-based action Representation learning (CSCLR). Specifically, the proposed CSCLR not only utilizes intra-stream contrast pairs, but introduces inter-stream contrast pairs as hard samples to formulate a better representation learning. Besides, to further exploit the potential of positive pairs and increase the robustness of self-supervised representation learning, we propose a Positive Feature Transformation (PFT) strategy which adopts feature-level manipulation to increase the variance of positive pairs. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD. Experimental results show that our proposed CSCLR exceeds the state-of-the-art methods on a diverse range of evaluation protocols. ",

    "abstract": "As Machine Learning models are considered for autonomous decisions with significant social impact, the need for understanding how these models work rises rapidly. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to provide interpretations for predictions made by Machine Learning models, in order to make the model trustworthy and more transparent for the user. For example, selecting relevant input variables for the problem directly impacts the model's ability to learn and make accurate predictions, so obtaining information about input importance play a crucial role when training the model. One of the main XAI techniques to obtain input variable importance is the sensitivity analysis based on partial derivatives. However, existing literature of this method provide no justification of the aggregation metrics used to retrieved information from the partial derivatives. In this paper, a theoretical framework is proposed to study sensitivities of ML models using metric techniques. From this metric interpretation, a complete family of new quantitative metrics called $\\alpha$-curves is extracted. These $\\alpha$-curves provide information with greater depth on the importance of the input variables for a machine learning model than existing XAI methods in the literature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the $\\alpha$-curves using synthetic and real datasets, comparing the results against other XAI methods for variable importance and validating the analysis results with the ground truth or literature information.

    "abstract": "Detecting plagiarism involves finding similar items in two different sources. In this article, we propose a novel method for detecting plagiarism that is based on attention mechanism-based long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) word embedding, enhanced with optimized differential evolution (DE) method for pre-training and a focal loss function for training. BERT could be included in a downstream task and fine-tuned as a task-specific BERT can be included in a downstream task and fine-tuned as a task-specific structure, while the trained BERT model is capable of detecting various linguistic characteristics. Unbalanced classification is one of the primary issues with plagiarism detection. We suggest a focal loss-based training technique that carefully learns minority class instances to solve this. Another issue that we tackle is the training phase itself, which typically employs gradient-based methods like back-propagation for the learning process and thus suffers from some drawbacks, including sensitivity to initialization. To initiate the BP process, we suggest a novel DE algorithm that makes use of a clustering-based mutation operator. Here, a winning cluster is identified for the current DE population, and a fresh updating method is used to produce potential answers. We evaluate our proposed approach on three benchmark datasets ( MSRP, SNLI, and SemEval2014) and demonstrate that it performs well when compared to both conventional and population-based methods. ",

While the original population protocol model considers the concept of anonymity, the issue of privacy is not investigated thoroughly. However, there is a need for time- and space-efficient privacy-preserving techniques in the population protocol model if these algorithms are to be implemented in settings handling sensitive data, such as sensor networks, IoT devices, and drones. In this work, we introduce several formal definitions of privacy, ranging from assuring only plausible deniability of the population input vector to having a full information-theoretic guarantee that knowledge beyond an agent's input and output bear no influence on the probability of a particular input vector. We then apply these definitions to both existing and novel protocols. We show that the Remainder-computing protocol given by Delporte-Gallet et al. in 2007 (which is proven to satisfy output independent privacy under adversarial scheduling) is not information-theoretically private under probabilistic scheduling. In contrast, we provide a new algorithm and demonstrate that it correctly and information-theoretically privately computes Remainder under probabilistic scheduling. ",

We apply this method to an anonymized time-series communication network from a large organization spanning 2019-2020, consisting of over 100 thousand vertices and 80 million edges. Our method embeds the data within 10 seconds on a standard computer and enables the detection of communication pattern shifts for individual vertices, vertex communities, and the overall graph structure. Through supporting theory and synthesis studies, we demonstrate the theoretical soundness of our approach under random graph models and its numerical effectiveness through simulation studies. ",

However, despite its surging popularity, the potential security risks of KGR are largely unexplored, which is concerning, given the increasing use of such capability in security-critical domains. This work represents a solid initial step towards bridging the striking gap. We systematize the security threats to KGR according to the adversary's objectives, knowledge, and attack vectors. Further, we present ROAR, a new class of attacks that instantiate a variety of such threats. Through empirical evaluation in representative use cases (e.g., medical decision support, cyber threat hunting, and commonsense reasoning), we demonstrate that ROAR is highly effective to mislead KGR to suggest pre-defined answers for target queries, yet with negligible impact on non-target ones. Finally, we explore potential countermeasures against ROAR, including filtering of potentially poisoning knowledge and training with adversarially augmented queries, which leads to several promising research directions.

Defending against such backdoor attacks has become urgent and important. In this paper, we propose AttDef, an efficient attribution-based pipeline to defend against two insertion-based poisoning attacks, BadNL and InSent. Specifically, we regard the tokens with larger attribution scores as potential triggers since larger attribution words contribute more to the false prediction results and therefore are more likely to be poison triggers. Additionally, we further utilize an external pre-trained language model to distinguish whether input is poisoned or not. We show that our proposed method can generalize sufficiently well in two common attack scenarios (poisoning training data and testing data), which consistently improves previous methods. For instance, AttDef can successfully mitigate both attacks with an average accuracy of 79.97% (56.59% up) and 48.34% (3.99% up) under pre-training and post-training attack defense respectively, achieving the new state-of-the-art performance on prediction recovery over four benchmark datasets.

While a lot of works have studied the hidden danger of backdoor attacks in image or text classification, there is a limited understanding of the model's robustness on backdoor attacks when the output space is infinite and discrete. In this paper, we study a much more challenging problem of testing whether sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Specifically, we find by only injecting 0.2\\% samples of the dataset, we can cause the seq2seq model to generate the designated keyword and even the whole sentence. Furthermore, we utilize Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to create multiple new triggers, which brings new challenges to backdoor detection since these backdoors are not static.

Both problems reduce to solving the satisfiability of quantified propositional logic formula with 3 levels of quantifiers ($\\exists\\forall\\exists$). In this paper, we introduce a Counter-Example Guided Refinement Abstraction (CEGAR) to efficiently solve these problems by coupling the resolution of two simpler formulas.

    "abstract": "International maritime crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated, often associated with wider criminal networks. Detecting maritime threats by means of fusing data purely related to physical movement (i.e., those generated by physical sensors, or hard data) is not sufficient. This has led to research and development efforts aimed at combining hard data with other types of data (especially human-generated or soft data). Existing work often assumes that input soft data is available in a structured format, or is focused on extracting certain relevant entities or concepts to accompany or annotate hard data. Much less attention has been given to extracting the rich knowledge about the situations of interest implicitly embedded in the large amount of soft data existing in unstructured formats (such as intelligence reports and news articles). In order to exploit the potentially useful and rich information from such sources, it is necessary to extract not only the relevant entities and concepts but also their semantic relations, together with the uncertainty associated with the extracted knowledge (i.e., in the form of probabilistic knowledge graphs). This will increase the accuracy of and confidence in, the extracted knowledge and facilitate subsequent reasoning and learning. To this end, we propose Maritime DeepDive, an initial prototype for the automated construction of probabilistic knowledge graphs from natural language data for the maritime domain. In this paper, we report on the current implementation of Maritime DeepDive, together with preliminary results on extracting probabilistic events from maritime piracy incidents. This pipeline was evaluated on a manually crafted gold standard, yielding promising results. ",

Existing graph contrastive anomaly detection (GCAD) methods have primarily focused on improving detection capability through graph augmentation and multi-scale contrast modules.

We dive into the multi-scale and graph augmentation mechanism and observed that multi-scale contrast modules do not enhance the expression, while the multi-GNN modules are the hidden contributors. Previous studies have tended to attribute the benefits brought by multi-GNN to the multi-scale modules. In the paper, we delve into the misconception and propose Multi-GNN and Augmented Graph contrastive framework MAG, which unified the existing GCAD methods in the contrastive self-supervised perspective. We extracted two variants from the MAG framework, L-MAG and M-MAG. The L-MAG is the lightweight instance of the MAG, which outperform the state-of-the-art on Cora and Pubmed with the low computational cost.

In this work, we aim to re-investigate the training process of residual networks from a novel social psychology perspective of loafing, and further propose a new training scheme as well as three improved strategies for boosting residual networks beyond their performance limits. Previous research has suggested that residual networks can be considered as ensembles of shallow networks, which implies that the final performance of a residual network is influenced by a group of subnetworks. We identify a previously overlooked problem that is analogous to social loafing, where subnetworks within a residual network are prone to exert less effort when working as part of a group compared to working alone. We define this problem as \\textit{network loafing}. Similar to the decreased individual productivity and overall performance as demonstrated in society, network loafing inevitably causes sub-par performance. Inspired by solutions from social psychology, we first propose a novel training scheme called stimulative training, which randomly samples a residual subnetwork and calculates the KL divergence loss between the sampled subnetwork and the given residual network for extra supervision. In order to unleash the potential of stimulative training, we further propose three simple-yet-effective strategies, including a novel KL- loss that only aligns the network logits direction, random smaller inputs for subnetworks, and inter-stage sampling rules. Comprehensive experiments and analysis verify the effectiveness of stimulative training as well as its three improved strategies. ",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the system developed by the USTC-NELSLIP team for SemEval-2023 Task 2 Multilingual Complex Named Entity Recognition (MultiCoNER II). A method named Statistical Construction and Dual Adaptation of Gazetteer (SCDAG) is proposed for Multilingual Complex NER. The method first utilizes a statistics-based approach to construct a gazetteer. Secondly, the representations of gazetteer networks and language models are adapted by minimizing the KL divergence between them at both the sentence-level and entity-level. Finally, these two networks are then integrated for supervised named entity recognition (NER) training. The proposed method is applied to XLM-R with a gazetteer built from Wikidata, and shows great generalization ability across different tracks. Experimental results and detailed analysis verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The official results show that our system ranked 1st on one track (Hindi) in this task. ",

    "abstract": "Precise calibration is the basis for the vision-guided robot system to achieve high-precision operations. Systems with multiple eyes (cameras) and multiple hands (robots) are particularly sensitive to calibration errors, such as micro-assembly systems. Most existing methods focus on the calibration of a single unit of the whole system, such as poses between hand and eye, or between two hands. These methods can be used to determine the relative pose between each unit, but the serialized incremental calibration strategy cannot avoid the problem of error accumulation in a large-scale system. Instead of focusing on a single unit, this paper models the multi-eye and multi-hand system calibration problem as a graph and proposes a method based on the minimum spanning tree and graph optimization. This method can automatically plan the serialized optimal calibration strategy in accordance with the system settings to get coarse calibration results initially. Then, with these initial values, the closed-loop constraints are introduced to carry out global optimization. Simulation experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm under different noises and various hand-eye configurations. In addition, experiments on real robot systems are presented to further verify the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "3D scene flow estimation aims to estimate point-wise motions between two consecutive frames of point clouds. Superpoints, i.e., points with similar geometric features, are usually employed to capture similar motions of local regions in 3D scenes for scene flow estimation. However, in existing methods, superpoints are generated with the offline clustering methods, which cannot characterize local regions with similar motions for complex 3D scenes well, leading to inaccurate scene flow estimation. To this end, we propose an iterative end-to-end superpoint based scene flow estimation framework, where the superpoints can be dynamically updated to guide the point-level flow prediction. Specifically, our framework consists of a flow guided superpoint generation module and a superpoint guided flow refinement module. In our superpoint generation module, we utilize the bidirectional flow information at the previous iteration to obtain the matching points of points and superpoint centers for soft point-to-superpoint association construction, in which the superpoints are generated for pairwise point clouds. With the generated superpoints, we first reconstruct the flow for each point by adaptively aggregating the superpoint-level flow, and then encode the consistency between the reconstructed flow of pairwise point clouds. Finally, we feed the consistency encoding along with the reconstructed flow into GRU to refine point-level flow. Extensive experiments on several different datasets show that our method can achieve promising performance. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting human scanpaths when exploring panoramic videos is a challenging task due to the spherical geometry and the multimodality of the input, and the inherent uncertainty and diversity of the output. Most previous methods fail to give a complete treatment of these characteristics, and thus are prone to errors. In this paper, we present a simple new criterion for scanpath prediction based on principles from lossy data compression. This criterion suggests minimizing the expected code length of quantized scanpaths in a training set, which corresponds to fitting a discrete conditional probability model via maximum likelihood. Specifically, the probability model is conditioned on two modalities: a viewport sequence as the deformation-reduced visual input and a set of relative historical scanpaths projected onto respective viewports as the aligned path input. The probability model is parameterized by a product of discretized Gaussian mixture models to capture the uncertainty and the diversity of scanpaths from different users. Most importantly, the training of the probability model does not rely on the specification of ``ground-truth'' scanpaths for imitation learning. We also introduce a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller-based sampler to generate realistic human-like scanpaths from the learned probability model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently produces better quantitative scanpath results in terms of prediction accuracy (by comparing to the assumed ``ground-truths'') and perceptual realism (through machine discrimination) over a wide range of prediction horizons. We additionally verify the perceptual realism improvement via a formal psychophysical experiment and the generalization improvement on several unseen panoramic video datasets. ",

The graph contrastive objective maximizes the agreement of multimodal representations, providing a natural interplay for all modalities without special customization.

    "abstract": "WebAssembly (Wasm) is a low-level binary format for web applications, which has found widespread adoption due to its improved performance and compatibility with existing software. However, the popularity of Wasm has also led to its exploitation for malicious purposes, such as cryptojacking, where malicious actors use a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies without their consent. To counteract this threat, machine learning-based detection methods aiming to identify cryptojacking activities within Wasm code have emerged. It is well-known that neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks, where inputs to a classifier are perturbed with minimal changes that result in a crass misclassification. While applying changes in image classification is easy, manipulating binaries in an automated fashion to evade malware classification without changing functionality is non-trivial. In this work, we propose a new approach to include adversarial examples in the code section of binaries via instrumentation. The introduced gadgets allow for the inclusion of arbitrary bytes, enabling efficient adversarial attacks that reliably bypass state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers such as the CNN-based Minos recently proposed at NDSS 2021. We analyze the cost and reliability of instrumentation-based adversarial example generation and show that the approach works reliably at minimal size and performance overheads. ",

    "abstract": "With the continuous increase of photovoltaic (PV) penetration, the voltage control interactions between newly installed PV inverters and previously deployed on-load tap-changer (OLTC) transformers become ever more significant. To achieve coordinated voltage regulation, current methods often rely on a decision-making algorithm to fully take over the control of all devices, requiring OLTC to give up its existing tap switching logic and execute corresponding upgrades. Aiming at bridging this gap, a soft coordination framework is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the decision-making commands are only applied on inverters, and OLTC that retains its own operation rule will be indirectly controlled by the changed system voltage, which is a result of appropriately adjusting inverters' Var output. The proposed method achieves the soft coordination by establishing a modified actor-critic algorithm to train a proxy model of inverters. The well-trained proxy model can properly adjust inverters' Var output to \"softly\" coordinate OLTC's tap operations, which finally attains coordinated voltage regulation and line loss minimization. Simulation results verify the superiority of our proposed method over traditional ones in coordinating heterogeneous devices for voltage control. ",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) agents are known to be vulnerable to evasion attacks during deployment. In single-agent environments, attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations on the policy or value network's inputs or outputs; in multi-agent environments, attackers can control an adversarial opponent to indirectly influence the victim's observation. Adversarial policies offer a promising solution to craft such attacks. Still, current approaches either require perfect or partial knowledge of the victim policy or suffer from sample inefficiency due to the sparsity of task-related rewards. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Intrinsically Motivated Adversarial Policy (IMAP) for efficient black-box evasion attacks in single- and multi-agent environments without any knowledge of the victim policy. IMAP uses four intrinsic objectives based on state coverage, policy coverage, risk, and policy divergence to encourage exploration and discover stronger attacking skills. We also design a novel Bias-Reduction (BR) method to boost IMAP further. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these intrinsic objectives and BR in improving adversarial policy learning in the black-box setting against multiple types of victim agents in various single- and multi-agent MuJoCo environments. Notably, our IMAP reduces the performance of the state-of-the-art robust WocaR-PPO agents by 34\\%-54\\% and achieves a SOTA attacking success rate of 83.91\\% in the two-player zero-sum game YouShallNotPass.

    "abstract": "Image retrieval plays an important role in the Internet world. Usually, the core parts of mainstream visual retrieval systems include an online service of the embedding model and a large-scale vector database. For traditional model upgrades, the old model will not be replaced by the new one until the embeddings of all the images in the database are re-computed by the new model, which takes days or weeks for a large amount of data. Recently, backward-compatible training (BCT) enables the new model to be immediately deployed online by making the new embeddings directly comparable to the old ones. For BCT, improving the compatibility of two models with less negative impact on retrieval performance is the key challenge. In this paper, we introduce AdvBCT, an Adversarial Backward-Compatible Training method with an elastic boundary constraint that takes both compatibility and discrimination into consideration. We first employ adversarial learning to minimize the distribution disparity between embeddings of the new model and the old model. Meanwhile, we add an elastic boundary constraint during training to improve compatibility and discrimination efficiently. Extensive experiments on GLDv2, Revisited Oxford (ROxford), and Revisited Paris (RParis) demonstrate that our method outperforms other BCT methods on both compatibility and discrimination.

This paper settled down the above two problems and further proposed Conversational Affective Causal Discovery (CACD). It is a novel causal discovery method showing how to discover causal relationships in a conversation via designing a common skeleton and generating a substitute for implicit causes. CACD contains two steps: (i) building a common centering one graph node causal skeleton for all utterances in variable-length conversations; (ii) Causal Auto-Encoder (CAE) correcting the skeleton to yield causal representation through generated implicit causes and known explicit causes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our novel method significantly outperforms the SOTA baselines in six affect-related datasets on the three tasks. ",

This communication protocol aims to mimic language features by encoding high-dimensional information through low-dimensional representation. Using grid-world mazes and reinforcement learning, teacher ANNs pass a compressed message to a student ANN for better task completion. Through this, the student achieves a higher goal-finding rate and generalizes the goal location across task worlds. Further optimizing message content to maximize student reward improves information encoding, suggesting that an accurate representation in the space of messages requires bi-directional input.

Multi,skeletons induce low sample utilization and multi values induce incapability of the distribution assumption, both leading that recovering causal relations from indefinite data is, as of yet, largely unexplored. We design the causal strength variational model to settle down these two problems. Specifically, we leverage the causal strength instead of independent noise as latent variable to mediate evidence lower bound. By this design ethos, The causal strength of different skeletons is regarded as a distribution and can be expressed as a single-valued causal graph matrix. Moreover, considering the latent confounders, we disentangle the causal graph G into two relatisubgraphs O and C. O contains pure relations between observed nodes, while C represents the relations from latent variables to observed nodes. We summarize the above designs as Confounding Disentanglement Causal Discovery (biCD), which is tailored to learn causal representation from indefinite data under the latent confounding.

To facilitate the design and the detection of large unitary constellations at reduced complexity, the proposed constellations are constructed as the Cartesian product of independent amplitude and phase-shift-keying (PSK) vectors, and hence, can be iteratively detected. The amplitude vector can be detected by exhaustive search, whose complexity is still sufficiently low in short packet transmissions. For detection of the PSK vector, we adopt a maximum-A-posteriori (MAP) criterion to improve the reliability of the sorted decision-feedback differential detection (sort-DFDD), which results in near-optimal error performance in the case of the same modulation order of the transmit PSK symbols at different time slots. This detector is called MAP-based-reliability-sort-DFDD (MAP-R-sort-DFDD) and has polynomial complexity. For the case of different modulation orders at different time slots, we observe that undetected symbols with lower modulation orders have a significant impact on the detection of PSK symbols with higher modulation orders. We exploit this observation and propose an improved detector called improved-MAP-R-sort-DFDD, which approaches the optimal error performance with polynomial time complexity. Simulation results show the merits of our proposed multi-symbol unitary constellation when compared to competing low-complexity unitary constellations. ",

In C-V2X, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) users share radio resources with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) users. Existing works primarily focus on the optimal pairing of V2V and V2I users under the assumption that each V2I user needs a single resource block (RB); minimizing any interference through power allocation. In contrast, in this work, we have considered that the number of RBs needed by the users is a function of their channel condition and Quality of Service (QoS) - a method called link adaptation. It is effective in compensating for the incessant channel quality fluctuations at the high frequencies of operation of 5G. The first proposed resource allocation scheme of this work greedily allocates RBs to V2I users using link adaptation and then uses Hungarian algorithm to pair V2V with V2I users, while minimizing interference through power allocation. To reduce the complexity, the second scheme groups RBs into resource chunks (RCs); then uses Hungarian algorithm twice - first to allocate RCs to V2I users, and then to pair V2I users with V2V users. Extensive simulations reveal that link adaptation increases the number of satisfied V2I users as well as their sum-rate, while also improving QoS of individual users, thereby making it indispensable for C-V2X system. We have also considered the presence of best-effort users, and the diverse QoS has been provided through the multi-numerology frame structure of 5G. ",

    "abstract": "We present a complete system for real-time rendering of scenes with complex appearance previously reserved for offline use. This is achieved with a combination of algorithmic and system level innovations. Our appearance model utilizes learned hierarchical textures that are interpreted using neural decoders, which produce reflectance values and importance-sampled directions. To best utilize the modeling capacity of the decoders, we equip the decoders with two graphics priors. The first prior -- transformation of directions into learned shading frames -- facilitates accurate reconstruction of mesoscale effects. The second prior -- a microfacet sampling distribution -- allows the neural decoder to perform importance sampling efficiently. The resulting appearance model supports anisotropic sampling and level-of-detail rendering, and allows baking deeply layered material graphs into a compact unified neural representation. By exposing hardware accelerated tensor operations to ray tracing shaders, we show that it is possible to inline and execute the neural decoders efficiently inside a real-time path tracer. We analyze scalability with increasing number of neural materials and propose to improve performance using code optimized for coherent and divergent execution. Our neural material shaders can be over an order of magnitude faster than non-neural layered materials. This opens up the door for using film-quality visuals in real-time applications such as games and live previews. ",

We introduce PubMed Graph Benchmark (PGB), a new benchmark dataset for evaluating heterogeneous graph embeddings for biomedical literature. PGB is one of the largest heterogeneous networks to date and consists of 30 million English articles. The benchmark contains rich metadata including abstract, authors, citations, MeSH terms, MeSH hierarchy, and some other information.

    "abstract": "Fractional programming (FP) plays a crucial role in wireless network design because many relevant problems involve maximizing or minimizing ratio terms. Notice that the maximization case and the minimization case of FP cannot be converted to each other in general, so they have to be dealt with separately in most of the previous studies. Thus, an existing FP method for maximizing ratios typically does not work for the minimization case, and vice versa. However, the FP objective can be mixed max-and-min, e.g., one may wish to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the legitimate receiver while minimizing that of the eavesdropper. We aim to fill the gap between max-FP and min-FP by devising a unified optimization framework. The main results are three-fold. First, we extend the existing max-FP technique called quadratic transform to the min-FP, and further develop a full generalization for the mixed case. Second. we provide a minorization-maximization (MM) interpretation of the proposed unified approach, thereby establishing its convergence and also obtaining a matrix extension; another result we obtain is a generalized Lagrangian dual transform which facilitates the solving of the logarithmic FP. Finally, we present three typical applications: the age-of-information (AoI) minimization, the Cramer-Rao bound minimization for sensing, and the secure data rate maximization, none of which can be efficiently addressed by the previous FP methods.

We also assess the importance of knowing the maximum angular rotor velocity of the quadcopter and show that over- or underestimating this limit leads to less robust flight. We propose an algorithm to identify the current maximum angular rotor velocity onboard and a network that adapts its policy based on the identified limit.

One of the most critical components of ensuring a high-quality experience is channel estimation, which is fundamental for efficient transmission and interference management in wireless networks. However, using deep neural networks (DNNs) in channel estimation raises security and trust concerns due to their complexity and the need for more transparency in decision-making. This paper proposes a Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDO)-based approach for secure and trustworthy channel estimation in 5G networks. Our approach combines the advantages of traditional and deep learning techniques by incorporating conventional pilot-based channel estimation as a prior in the deep learning model. Additionally, we use MCDO to obtain uncertainty-aware predictions, enhancing the model's security and trustworthiness. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms traditional and deep learning-based approaches regarding security, trustworthiness, and performance in 5G scenarios. ",

Different from most explanatory models which suffer from low accuracy, our model remains accurate while improving explainability, making it applicable in model-based learning.

To address this issue, we propose a multimodal fusion learning method for text-guided JPEG artifacts reduction, in which the corresponding text description not only provides the potential prior information of the highly compressed image, but also serves as supplementary information to assist in image deblocking. We fuse image features and text semantic features from the global and local perspectives respectively, and design a contrastive loss built upon contrastive learning to produce visually pleasing results. Extensive experiments, including a user study, prove that our method can obtain better deblocking results compared to the state-of-the-art methods. ",

These approaches use CNN-based detectors that rely on anchor proposals and post-processing stages such as NMS. To tackle these limitations, this paper presents a novel end-to-end semi-supervised table detection method that employs the deformable transformer for detecting table objects.

However, the computational burden of computing time-optimal trajectories based on the full quadrotor dynamics (typically on the order of minutes or even hours) can hinder its ability to respond quickly to changing scenarios. Additionally, modeling errors and external disturbances can lead to deviations from the desired trajectory during tracking in real time. This letter proposes a novel approach to computing time-optimal trajectories, by fixing the nodes with waypoint constraints and adopting separate sampling intervals for trajectories between waypoints, which significantly accelerates trajectory planning. Furthermore, the planned paths are tracked via a time-adaptive model predictive control scheme whose allocated tracking time can be adaptively adjusted on-the-fly, therefore enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness.

Although the dataset-specific models have achieved impressive performance, it is cumbersome as each dataset demands a model to be designed, trained, and stored. In this work, we aim to unify these translation tasks into a more general setting.

Through unified learning, UMLNMT is able to jointly train across multiple tasks, implementing intelligent on-demand translation. On seven widely-used translation tasks, including sentence translation, document translation, and chat translation, our UMLNMT results in substantial improvements over dataset-specific models with significantly reduced model deployment costs. Furthermore, UMLNMT can achieve competitive or better performance than state-of-the-art dataset-specific methods. Human evaluation and in-depth analysis also demonstrate the superiority of our approach on generating diverse and high-quality translations.

We choose to leverage Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) due to their efficiency in relating observations to latent generative factors and their effectiveness in data-efficient learning and interpretable representation learning. As a first contribution, we identify and remove unnecessary components in the functioning scheme of semi-supervised VAEs making them faster, smaller and easier to design. Our second and main contribution is to use VAEs and Transformers to build two models with inductive bias to separate information in latent representations into understandable concepts without annotated data. The first model, Attention-Driven VAE (ADVAE), is able to separately represent and control information about syntactic roles in sentences. The second model, QKVAE, uses separate latent variables to form keys and values for its Transformer decoder and is able to separate syntactic and semantic information in its neural representations. In transfer experiments, QKVAE has competitive performance compared to supervised models and equivalent performance to a supervised model using 50K annotated samples. Additionally, QKVAE displays improved syntactic role disentanglement capabilities compared to ADVAE. Overall, we demonstrate that it is possible to enhance the interpretability of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for language modeling with unannotated data in situations where text data is abundant but annotations are scarce.

Binary error-correcting codes transmitted through noisy channels with independent bit flips are well-studied in information theory. However, such codes are unsuitable for differential privacy since they have (by design) high sensitivity, i.e., neighboring integers have encodings with a large Hamming distance. Gray codes show that it is possible to create an efficient sensitivity 1 encoding, but are also not suitable for differential privacy due to lack of noise-robustness. Our main result is that it is possible, with a constant rate code, to simultaneously achieve the sensitivity of Gray codes and the noise-robustness of error-correcting codes (down to the noise level required for differential privacy). An application of this new encoding of the integers is a faster, space-optimal differentially private data structure for histograms. ",

Portraying the theoretical performance bounds of ISAC systems is fundamentally important to understand how sensing and communication functionalities interact (e.g., competitively or cooperatively) in terms of resource utilization, while revealing insights and guidelines for the development of effective physical-layer techniques. In this paper, we characterize the fundamental performance tradeoff between the detection probability for target monitoring and the user's achievable rate in ISAC systems. To this end, we first discuss the achievable rate of the user under sensing-free and sensing-interfered communication scenarios. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions for the probability of false alarm (PFA) and the successful probability of detection (PD) for monitoring the target of interest, where we consider both communication-assisted and communication-interfered sensing scenarios. In addition, the effects of the unknown channel coefficient are also taken into account in our theoretical analysis. Based on our analytical results, we then carry out a comprehensive assessment of the performance tradeoff between sensing and communication functionalities. Specifically, we formulate a power allocation problem to minimize the transmit power at the base station (BS) under the constraints of ensuring a required PD for perception as well as the communication user's quality of service requirement in terms of achievable rate. Finally, simulation results corroborate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed power allocation solutions. ",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of computing compact routing tables for a (weighted) planar graph $G:= (V, E,w)$ in the PRAM, CONGEST, and the novel HYBRID communication model. We present algorithms with polylogarithmic work and communication that are almost optimal in all relevant parameters, i.e., computation time, table sizes, and stretch. All algorithms are heavily randomized, and all our bounds hold w.h.p. For a given parameter $\\epsilon>0$, our scheme computes labels of size $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ and is computed in $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ time and $\\widetilde{O}(n)$ work in the PRAM and a HYBRID model and $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2} \\cdot HD)$ (Here, $HD$ denotes the network's hop-diameter) time in CONGEST. The stretch of the resulting routing scheme is $1+\\epsilon$. To achieve these results, we extend the divide-and-conquer framework of Li and Parter [STOC '19] and combine it with state-of-the-art distributed distance approximation algorithms [STOC '22]. Furthermore, we provide a distributed decomposition scheme, which may be of independent interest. ",

    "abstract": "When deploying artificial agents in real-world environments where they interact with humans, it is crucial that their behavior is aligned with the values, social norms or other requirements of that environment. However, many environments have implicit constraints that are difficult to specify and transfer to a learning agent. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that utilizes the principle of maximum causal entropy to learn constraints and an optimal policy that adheres to these constraints, using demonstrations of agents that abide by the constraints. We prove convergence in a tabular setting and provide an approximation which scales to complex environments. We evaluate the effectiveness of the learned policy by assessing the reward received and the number of constraint violations, and we evaluate the learned cost function based on its transferability to other agents. Our method has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art approaches across a variety of tasks and environments, and it is able to handle problems with stochastic dynamics and a continuous state-action space.

    "abstract": "Domain shift is a big challenge in NLP, thus, many approaches resort to learning domain-invariant features to mitigate the inference phase domain shift. Such methods, however, fail to leverage the domain-specific nuances relevant to the task at hand. To avoid such drawbacks, domain counterfactual generation aims to transform a text from the source domain to a given target domain. However, due to the limited availability of data, such frequency-based methods often miss and lead to some valid and spurious domain-token associations. Hence, we employ a three-step domain obfuscation approach that involves frequency and attention norm-based masking, to mask domain-specific cues, and unmasking to regain the domain generic context. Our experiments empirically show that the counterfactual samples sourced from our masked text lead to improved domain transfer on 10 out of 12 domain sentiment classification settings, with an average of 2% accuracy improvement over the state-of-the-art for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Further, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving 1.4% average accuracy improvement in the adversarial domain adaptation (ADA) setting. Moreover, our model also shows its domain adaptation efficacy on a large multi-domain intent classification dataset where it attains state-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "Graph Transformer is gaining increasing attention in the field of machine learning and has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks for graph representation learning. However, as current implementations of Graph Transformer primarily focus on learning representations of small-scale graphs, the quadratic complexity of the global self-attention mechanism presents a challenge for full-batch training when applied to larger graphs. Additionally, conventional sampling-based methods fail to capture necessary high-level contextual information, resulting in a significant loss of performance. In this paper, we introduce the Hierarchical Scalable Graph Transformer (HSGT) as a solution to these challenges. HSGT successfully scales the Transformer architecture to node representation learning tasks on large-scale graphs, while maintaining high performance. By utilizing graph hierarchies constructed through coarsening techniques, HSGT efficiently updates and stores multi-scale information in node embeddings at different levels. Together with sampling-based training methods, HSGT effectively captures and aggregates multi-level information on the hierarchical graph using only Transformer blocks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HSGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale benchmarks with graphs containing millions of nodes with high efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "Coverage analysis is widely used but can suffer from high overhead. This overhead is especially acute in the context of Python, which is already notoriously slow (a recent study observes a roughly 30x slowdown vs. native code). We find that the state-of-the-art coverage tool for Python, coverage.py, leads to slowdowns of 1.3x--3.6x (median: 2.8x) for the standard Python interpreter. Slowdowns are even more extreme when using PyPy, a JIT-compiled Python implementation, where coverage.py slows execution by 2.4x--325x (median: 14x). This performance degradation reduces the utility of coverage analysis in most use cases, including testing and fuzzing, and precludes its use in deployment. This paper presents SlipCover, a novel, near-zero overhead coverage analyzer for Python. SlipCover works without modifications to either the Python interpreter or PyPy. It first processes a program's AST to accurately identify all branches and lines. SlipCover then dynamically rewrites Python bytecodes to add lightweight instrumentation to each identified branch and line. At run time, SlipCover periodically de-instruments already-covered lines and branches. The result is extremely low overheads -- a median of just 5% -- making SlipCover suitable for use in deployment. We show its efficiency can translate to significant increases in the speed of coverage-based clients. As a proof of concept, we integrate SlipCover into TPBT, a targeted property-based testing system, and observe a 22x speedup. ",

A key task for DMS is to ascertain the cognitive state of a driver and to determine their level of tiredness. Neuromorphic vision systems, based on event camera technology, provide advanced sensing of facial characteristics, in particular the behavior of a driver's eyes. This research explores the potential to extend neuromorphic sensing techniques to analyze the entire facial region, detecting yawning behaviors that give a complimentary indicator of tiredness. A neuromorphic dataset is constructed from 952 video clips (481 yawns, 471 not-yawns) captured with an RGB color camera, with 37 subjects. A total of 95200 neuromorphic image frames are generated from this video data using a video-to-event converter. From these data 21 subjects were selected to provide a training dataset, 8 subjects were used for validation data, and the remaining 8 subjects were reserved for an \"unseen\" test dataset. An additional 12300 frames were generated from event simulations of a public dataset to test against other methods. A CNN with self-attention and a recurrent head was designed, trained, and tested with these data. Respective precision and recall scores of 95.9 percent and 94.7 percent were achieved on our test set, and 89.9 percent and 91 percent on the simulated public test set, demonstrating the feasibility to add yawn detection as a sensing component of a neuromorphic DMS.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various real-world applications. However, recent studies highlight the vulnerability of GNNs to malicious perturbations. Previous adversaries primarily focus on graph modifications or node injections to existing graphs, yielding promising results but with notable limitations. Graph modification attack~(GMA) requires manipulation of the original graph, which is often impractical, while graph injection attack~(GIA) necessitates training a surrogate model in the black-box setting, leading to significant performance degradation due to divergence between the surrogate architecture and the actual victim model. Furthermore, most methods concentrate on a single attack goal and lack a generalizable adversary to develop distinct attack strategies for diverse goals, thus limiting precise control over victim model behavior in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we present a gradient-free generalizable adversary that injects a single malicious node to manipulate the classification result of a target node in the black-box evasion setting. We propose Gradient-free Generalizable Single Node Injection Attack, namely G$^2$-SNIA, a reinforcement learning framework employing Proximal Policy Optimization. By directly querying the victim model, G$^2$-SNIA learns patterns from exploration to achieve diverse attack goals with extremely limited attack budgets. Through comprehensive experiments over three acknowledged benchmark datasets and four prominent GNNs in the most challenging and realistic scenario, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed G$^2$-SNIA over the existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, by comparing G$^2$-SNIA with multiple white-box evasion baselines, we confirm its capacity to generate solutions comparable to those of the best adversaries. ",

    "abstract": "Low-resolution point clouds are challenging for object detection methods due to their sparsity. Densifying the present point cloud by concatenating it with its predecessors is a popular solution to this challenge. Such concatenation is possible thanks to the removal of ego vehicle motion using its odometry. This method is called Ego Motion Compensation (EMC). Thanks to the added points, EMC significantly improves the performance of single-frame detectors. However, it suffers from the shadow effect that manifests in dynamic objects' points scattering along their trajectories. This effect results in a misalignment between feature maps and objects' locations, thus limiting performance improvement to stationary and slow-moving objects only. Scene flow allows aligning point clouds in 3D space, thus naturally resolving the misalignment in feature spaces. By observing that scene flow computation shares several components with 3D object detection pipelines, we develop a plug-in module that enables single-frame detectors to compute scene flow to rectify their Bird-Eye View representation. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset show that our module leads to a significant increase (up to 16%) in the Average Precision of large vehicles, which interestingly demonstrates the most severe shadow effect.

They can also increase crime rates, cause social disorder, and pose a public health risk. Currently, there is a lack of efficient and reliable methods for detecting and understanding UPD. To bridge this gap, we propose UPDExplainer, an interpretable transformer-based framework for UPD detection. We first develop a UPD detection model based on the Swin Transformer architecture, which leverages readily accessible street view images to learn discriminative representations. In order to provide clear and comprehensible evidence and analysis, we subsequently introduce a UPD factor identification and ranking module that combines visual explanation maps with semantic segmentation maps. This novel integrated approach enables us to identify the exact objects within street view images that are responsible for physical disorders and gain insights into the underlying causes. Experimental results on the re-annotated Place Pulse 2.0 dataset demonstrate promising detection performance of the proposed method, with an accuracy of 79.9%. For a comprehensive evaluation of the method's ranking performance, we report the mean Average Precision (mAP), R-Precision (RPrec), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), with success rates of 75.51%, 80.61%, and 82.58%, respectively.

A modified spatial and channel squeeze-and-excitation (scSE) module called parallel scSE or P-scSE is proposed that combines additive and max-out scSE. A new arrangement is introduced for the module by fusing it in the middle of each decoder stage.

In this work, we take a step back and ask, 'does it matter?' We conduct the largest tabular data analysis to date, by comparing 19 algorithms across 176 datasets, and we find that the 'NN vs. GBDT' debate is overemphasized: for a surprisingly high number of datasets, either the performance difference between GBDTs and NNs is negligible, or light hyperparameter tuning on a GBDT is more important than selecting the best algorithm. Next, we analyze 965 metafeatures to determine what properties of a dataset make NNs or GBDTs better-suited to perform well. For example, we find that GBDTs are much better than NNs at handling skewed feature distributions, heavy-tailed feature distributions, and other forms of dataset irregularities. Our insights act as a guide for practitioners to decide whether or not they need to run a neural net to reach top performance on their dataset.

In this work, we further investigate the information leakage issue and propose a generative embedding inversion attack (GEIA) that aims to reconstruct input sequences based only on their sentence embeddings.

This is because developers often spend significant time searching for relevant code examples on the internet, utilizing open-source projects and informal documentation. For finding useful code examples, informal documentation, such as Stack Overflow discussions and forums, can be invaluable. We have focused our research on Stack Overflow, which is a popular resource for discussing different topics among software developers. For increasing the quality of the recommended code examples, we have collected and recommended the best code examples in the Java programming language. We have utilized BERT in our approach, which is a Large Language Model (LLM) for text representation that can effectively extract semantic information from textual data. Our first step involved using BERT to convert code examples into numerical vectors. Subsequently, we applied LSH to identify Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN). Our research involved the implementation of two variants of this approach, namely the Random Hyperplane-based LSH and the Query-Aware LSH. Our study compared two algorithms using four parameters: HitRate, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Average Execution Time, and Relevance. The results of our analysis revealed that the Query- Aware (QA) approach outperformed the Random Hyperplane-based (RH) approach in terms of HitRate. Specifically, the QA approach achieved a HitRate improvement of 20% to 35% for query pairs compared to the RH approach. Creating hashing tables and assigning data samples to buckets using the QA approach is at least four times faster than the RH approach. The QA approach returns code examples within milliseconds, while it takes several seconds (sec) for the RH approach to recommend code examples. ",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes NeuralEditor that enables neural radiance fields (NeRFs) natively editable for general shape editing tasks. Despite their impressive results on novel-view synthesis, it remains a fundamental challenge for NeRFs to edit the shape of the scene. Our key insight is to exploit the explicit point cloud representation as the underlying structure to construct NeRFs, inspired by the intuitive interpretation of NeRF rendering as a process that projects or \"plots\" the associated 3D point cloud to a 2D image plane. To this end, NeuralEditor introduces a novel rendering scheme based on deterministic integration within K-D tree-guided density-adaptive voxels, which produces both high-quality rendering results and precise point clouds through optimization. NeuralEditor then performs shape editing via mapping associated points between point clouds. Extensive evaluation shows that NeuralEditor achieves state-of-the-art performance in both shape deformation and scene morphing tasks. Notably, NeuralEditor supports both zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning over the edited scene. Our code, benchmark, and demo video are available at https://immortalco.github.io/NeuralEditor.

    "abstract": "In the field of antibody engineering, an essential task is to design a novel antibody whose paratopes bind to a specific antigen with correct epitopes. Understanding antibody structure and its paratope can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of its function. Therefore, antibody structure prediction from its sequence alone has always been a highly valuable problem for de novo antibody design. AlphaFold2, a breakthrough in the field of structural biology, provides a solution to predict protein structure based on protein sequences and computationally expensive coevolutionary multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). However, the computational efficiency and undesirable prediction accuracy of antibodies, especially on the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies limit their applications in the industrially high-throughput drug design. To learn an informative representation of antibodies, we employed a deep antibody language model (ALM) on curated sequences from the observed antibody space database via a transformer model. We also developed a novel model named xTrimoABFold to predict antibody structure from antibody sequence based on the pretrained ALM as well as efficient evoformers and structural modules. The model was trained end-to-end on the antibody structures in PDB by minimizing the ensemble loss of domain-specific focal loss on CDR and the frame-aligned point loss. xTrimoABFold outperforms AlphaFold2 and other protein language model based SOTAs, e.g., OmegaFold, HelixFold-Single, and IgFold with a large significant margin (30+\\% improvement on RMSD) while performing 151 times faster than AlphaFold2. To the best of our knowledge, xTrimoABFold achieved state-of-the-art antibody structure prediction. Its improvement in both accuracy and efficiency makes it a valuable tool for de novo antibody design and could make further improvements in immuno-theory. ",

Both laying and broiler breeders need males, but it is a problem because they are produced more than needed. Being able to determine the sex of chicks in the egg at the beginning or early stage of incubation can eliminate ethical problems as well as many additional costs. When we look at the literature, the methods used are very costly, low in applicability, invasive, inadequate in accuracy, or too late to eliminate ethical problems. Considering the embryo's development, the earliest observed candidate feature for sex determination is blood vessels. Detection from blood vessels can eliminate ethical issues, and these vessels can be seen when light is shined into the egg until the first seven days. In this study, sex determination was made by morphological analysis from embryonic vascular images obtained in the first week when the light was shined into the egg using a standard camera without any invasive procedure to the egg.

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms have the potential to improve patient outcomes in digital pathology. However, generalization of these tools is currently limited by sensitivity to variations in tissue preparation, staining procedures and scanning equipment that lead to domain shift in digitized slides. To overcome this limitation and improve model generalization, we studied the effectiveness of two Synthetic DOmain-Targeted Augmentation (S-DOTA) methods, namely CycleGAN-enabled Scanner Transform (ST) and targeted Stain Vector Augmentation (SVA), and compared them against the International Color Consortium (ICC) profile-based color calibration (ICC Cal) method and a baseline method using traditional brightness, color and noise augmentations. We evaluated the ability of these techniques to improve model generalization to various tasks and settings: four models, two model types (tissue segmentation and cell classification), two loss functions, six labs, six scanners, and three indications (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), prostate adenocarcinoma). We compared these methods based on the macro-averaged F1 scores on in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets across multiple domains, and found that S-DOTA methods (i.e., ST and SVA) led to significant improvements over ICC Cal and baseline on OOD data while maintaining comparable performance on ID data. Thus, we demonstrate that S-DOTA may help address generalization due to domain shift in real world applications. ",

When streaming gaming videos are transmitted to customers' client devices from cloud servers, algorithms that can monitor distorted video quality without having any reference video available are desirable tools. However, creating No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR VQA) models that can accurately predict the quality of streaming gaming videos rendered by computer graphics engines is a challenging problem, since gaming content generally differs statistically from naturalistic videos, often lacks detail, and contains many smooth regions. Until recently, the problem has been further complicated by the lack of adequate subjective quality databases of mobile gaming content. We have created a new gaming-specific NR VQA model called the Gaming Video Quality Evaluator (GAMIVAL), which combines and leverages the advantages of spatial and temporal gaming distorted scene statistics models, a neural noise model, and deep semantic features. Using a support vector regression (SVR) as a regressor, GAMIVAL achieves superior performance on the new LIVE-Meta Mobile Cloud Gaming (LIVE-Meta MCG) video quality database. ",

We assume that the latent position vectors lie on an unknown one-dimensional curve and are coupled with a response covariate via a regression model. Using the geometry of the underlying latent position vectors, we propose a manifold learning and graph embedding technique to predict the response variable on out-of-sample nodes, and we establish convergence guarantees for these responses.

    "abstract": "Laplacian regularized stratified models (LRSM) are models that utilize the explicit or implicit network structure of the sub-problems as defined by the categorical features called strata (e.g., age, region, time, forecast horizon, etc.), and draw upon data from neighboring strata to enhance the parameter learning of each sub-problem. They have been widely applied in machine learning and signal processing problems, including but not limited to time series forecasting, representation learning, graph clustering, max-margin classification, and general few-shot learning. Nevertheless, existing works on LRSM have either assumed a known graph or are restricted to specific applications. In this paper, we start by showing the importance and sensitivity of graph weights in LRSM, and provably show that the sensitivity can be arbitrarily large when the parameter scales and sample sizes are heavily imbalanced across nodes. We then propose a generic approach to jointly learn the graph while fitting the model parameters by solving a single optimization problem. We interpret the proposed formulation from both a graph connectivity viewpoint and an end-to-end Bayesian perspective, and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. Convergence guarantees of the proposed optimization algorithm is also provided despite the lack of global strongly smoothness of the Laplacian regularization term typically required in the existing literature, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency of our approach compared to existing methods by various real-world numerical examples. ",

This study presents a data-driven, image-to-image translation method for reconstructing thermal data of a boiling system at CHF using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). The supervised learning process relies on paired images, which include total reflection visualizations and infrared thermometry measurements obtained from flow boiling experiments. Our proposed approach has the potential to not only provide evidence connecting phase interface dynamics with thermal distribution but also to simplify the laborious and time-consuming experimental setup and data-reduction procedures associated with infrared thermal imaging, thereby providing an effective solution for CHF diagnosis.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system for classifying benign and malignant lung lesions, and to assist physicians in real-time analysis of radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) videos. During the biopsy process of lung cancer, physicians use real-time ultrasound images to find suitable lesion locations for sampling. However, most of these images are difficult to classify and contain a lot of noise. Previous studies have employed 2D convolutional neural networks to effectively differentiate between benign and malignant lung lesions, but doctors still need to manually select good-quality images, which can result in additional labor costs. In addition, the 2D neural network has no ability to capture the temporal information of the ultrasound video, so it is difficult to obtain the relationship between the features of the continuous images. This study designs an automatic diagnosis system based on a 3D neural network, uses the SlowFast architecture as the backbone to fuse temporal and spatial features, and uses the SwAV method of contrastive learning to enhance the noise robustness of the model. The method we propose includes the following advantages, such as (1) using clinical ultrasound films as model input, thereby reducing the need for high-quality image selection by physicians, (2) high-accuracy classification of benign and malignant lung lesions can assist doctors in clinical diagnosis and reduce the time and risk of surgery, and (3) the capability to classify well even in the presence of significant image noise. The AUC, accuracy, precision, recall and specificity of our proposed method on the validation set reached 0.87, 83.87%, 86.96%, 90.91% and 66.67%, respectively. The results have verified the importance of incorporating temporal information and the effectiveness of using the method of contrastive learning on feature extraction. ",

    "abstract": "In the future 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) cellular systems, networked sensing is a promising technique that can leverage the cooperation among the base stations (BSs) to perform high-resolution localization. However, a dense deployment of BSs to fully reap the networked sensing gain is not a cost-efficient solution in practice. Motivated by the advance in the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology for 6G communication, this paper examines the feasibility of deploying the low-cost IRSs to enhance the anchor density for networked sensing. Specifically, we propose a novel heterogeneous networked sensing architecture, which consists of both the active anchors, i.e., the BSs, and the passive anchors, i.e., the IRSs. Under this framework, the BSs emit the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals in the downlink for localizing the targets based on their echoes reflected via/not via the IRSs. However, there are two challenges for using passive anchors in localization. First, it is impossible to utilize the round-trip signal between a passive IRS and a passive target for estimating their distance. Second, before localizing a target, we do not know which IRS is closest to it and serves as its anchor. In this paper, we show that the distance between a target and its associated IRS can be indirectly estimated based on the length of the BS-target-BS path and the BS-target-IRS-BS path. Moreover, we propose an efficient data association method to match each target to its associated IRS. Numerical results are given to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed heterogeneous networked sensing architecture with both active and passive anchors. ",
