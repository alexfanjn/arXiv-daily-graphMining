    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenges faced by Value Iteration Networks (VIN) in handling larger input maps and mitigating the impact of accumulated errors caused by increased iterations. We propose a novel approach, Value Iteration Networks with Gated Summarization Module (GS-VIN), which incorporates two main improvements: (1) employing an Adaptive Iteration Strategy in the Value Iteration module to reduce the number of iterations, and (2) introducing a Gated Summarization module to summarize the iterative process. The adaptive iteration strategy uses larger convolution kernels with fewer iteration times, reducing network depth and increasing training stability while maintaining the accuracy of the planning process. The gated summarization module enables the network to emphasize the entire planning process, rather than solely relying on the final global planning outcome, by temporally and spatially resampling the entire planning process within the VI module. We conduct experiments on 2D grid world path-finding problems and the Atari Mr. Pac-man environment, demonstrating that GS-VIN outperforms the baseline in terms of single-step accuracy, planning success rate, and overall performance across different map sizes. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the relationship between input size, kernel size, and the number of iterations in VI-based models, which is applicable to a majority of VI-based models and offers valuable insights for researchers and industrial deployment.

    "abstract": "Requirement specifications are typically written in natural language (NL) due to its usability across multiple domains and understandability by all stakeholders. However, unstructured NL is prone to quality problems (e.g., ambiguity) in writing requirements, which can result in project failures. To address this issue, we present a tool, named Paska, that automatically detects quality problems as smells in NL requirements and offers recommendations to improve their quality. Our approach relies on natural language processing (NLP) techniques and, most importantly, a state-of-the-art controlled natural language (CNL) for requirements (Rimay), to detect smells and suggest recommendations using patterns defined in Rimay to improve requirement quality. We evaluated Paska through an industrial case study in the financial domain involving 13 systems and 2725 annotated requirements. The results show that our tool is accurate in detecting smells (precision of 89% and recall of 89%) and suggesting appropriate Rimay pattern recommendations (precision of 96% and recall of 94%). ",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary computation has shown its superiority in dynamic optimization, but for the (dynamic) time-linkage problems, some theoretical studies have revealed the possible weakness of evolutionary computation. Since the theoretically analyzed time-linkage problem only considers the influence of an extremely strong negative time-linkage effect, it remains unclear whether the weakness also appears in problems with more general time-linkage effects. Besides, understanding in depth the relationship between time-linkage effect and algorithmic features is important to build up our knowledge of what algorithmic features are good at what kinds of problems. In this paper, we analyze the general time-linkage effect and consider the time-linkage OneMax with general weights whose absolute values reflect the strength and whose sign reflects the positive or negative influence. We prove that except for some small and positive time-linkage effects (that is, for weights $0$ and $1$), randomized local search (RLS) and (1+1)EA cannot converge to the global optimum with a positive probability. More precisely, for the negative time-linkage effect (for negative weights), both algorithms cannot efficiently reach the global optimum and the probability of failing to converge to the global optimum is at least $1-o(1)$. For the not so small positive time-linkage effect (positive weights greater than $1$), such a probability is at most $c+o(1)$ where $c$ is a constant strictly less than $1$. ",

There are several areas where xApps can be used that are being widely investigated, but the issue of mitigating conflicts between xApp decisions requires further in-depth investigation. This article defines a conflict mitigation framework (CMF) built into the existing O-RAN architecture; it enables the Conflict Mitigation component in O-RAN's Near- Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) to detect and resolve all conflict types defined in the O-RAN Alliance's technical specifications. Methods for detecting each type of conflict are defined, including message flows between Near-RT RIC components. The suitability of the proposed CMF is proven with a simulation of an O-RAN network. Results of the simulation show that enabling the CMF allows balancing the network control capabilities of conflicting xApps to significantly improve network performance, with a small negative impact on its reliability. It is concluded that defining a unified CMF in Near-RT RIC is the first step towards providing a standardized method of conflict detection and resolution in O-RAN environments. ",

The state-of-the-art works exploit the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for SAR ATR, leading to high computation costs. These deep CNN models are unsuitable to be deployed on resource-limited platforms. In this work, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) model to achieve accurate and low-latency SAR ATR. We transform the input SAR image into the graph representation. The proposed GNN model consists of a stack of GNN layers that operates on the input graph to perform target classification. Unlike the state-of-the-art CNNs, which need heavy convolution operations, the proposed GNN model has low computation complexity and achieves comparable high accuracy. The GNN-based approach enables our proposed \\emph{input pruning} strategy. By filtering out the irrelevant vertices in the input graph, we can reduce the computation complexity. Moreover, we propose the \\emph{model pruning} strategy to sparsify the model weight matrices which further reduces the computation complexity. We evaluate the proposed GNN model on the MSTAR dataset and ship discrimination dataset. The evaluation results show that the proposed GNN model achieves 99.38\\% and 99.7\\% classification accuracy on the above two datasets, respectively. The proposed pruning strategies can prune 98.6\\% input vertices and 97\\% weight entries with negligible accuracy loss. Compared with the state-of-the-art CNNs, the proposed GNN model has only 1/3000 computation cost and 1/80 model size. ",

For post-hoc interpretation, we aim to interpret decisions of a network in terms of high-level audio objects that are also listenable for the end-user. This is extended to present an inherently interpretable model with high performance. To this end, we propose a novel interpreter design that incorporates non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). In particular, an interpreter is trained to generate a regularized intermediate embedding from hidden layers of a target network, learnt as time-activations of a pre-learnt NMF dictionary. Our methodology allows us to generate intuitive audio-based interpretations that explicitly enhance parts of the input signal most relevant for a network's decision. We demonstrate our method's applicability on a variety of classification tasks, including multi-label data for real-world audio and music. ",

    "abstract": "Graph summarization is the problem of producing smaller graph representations of an input graph dataset, in such a way that the smaller compressed graphs capture relevant structural information for downstream tasks. There is a recent graph summarization method that formulates an optimal transport-based framework that allows prior information about node, edge, and attribute importance (never defined in that work) to be incorporated into the graph summarization process. However, very little is known about the statistical properties of this framework. To elucidate this question, we consider the problem of supervised graph summarization, wherein by using information theoretic measures we seek to preserve relevant information about a class label. To gain a theoretical perspective on the supervised summarization problem itself, we first formulate it in terms of maximizing the Shannon mutual information between the summarized graph and the class label. We show an NP-hardness of approximation result for this problem, thereby constraining what one should expect from proposed solutions. We then propose a summarization method that incorporates mutual information estimates between random variables associated with sample graphs and class labels into the optimal transport compression framework. We empirically show performance improvements over previous works in terms of classification accuracy and time on synthetic and certain real datasets. We also theoretically explore the limitations of the optimal transport approach for the supervised summarization problem and we show that it fails to satisfy a certain desirable information monotonicity property.

We show that this approach fails short of being efficient; e.g., entangled polynomial codes are not necessarily better than PolyDot codes in MPC setting, while they are always better for coded computation. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new construction; Adaptive Gap Entangled (AGE) polynomial codes for MPC. We show through analysis and simulations that MPC with AGE codes always perform better than existing CMPC algorithms in terms of the required number of workers as well as computation, storage, and communication overhead.

Several methods have been developed that project ontology axioms into graphs.

These limitations restrict the kind of tasks to which they can be applied. Category-theoretical semantics of logic languages formalizes interpretations using categories instead of sets, and categories have a graph-like structure. We developed CatE, which uses the category-theoretical formulation of the semantics of the Description Logic $\\mathcal{ALC}$ to generate a graph representation for ontology axioms. The CatE projection is total and injective, and therefore overcomes limitations of other graph-based ontology embedding methods which are generally not invertible. We apply CatE to a number of different tasks, including deductive and inductive reasoning, and we demonstrate that CatE improves over state of the art ontology embedding methods. Furthermore, we show that CatE can also outperform model-theoretic ontology embedding methods in machine learning tasks in the biomedical domain. ",

Existing literature focus on addressing this challenge through global-based or local-based representation approaches. The former employs global feature representations for recognization, which may lack fine-grained information. The latter captures local relationships with complex structures, possibly leading to high model complexity. To address the above challenges, this article proposes a novel framework called SGML-Net for few-shot fine-grained visual recognition. SGML-Net incorporates auxiliary information via saliency detection to guide discriminative representation learning, achieving high performance and low model complexity. Specifically, SGML-Net utilizes the saliency detection model to emphasize the key regions of each sub-category, providing a strong prior for representation learning. SGML-Net transfers such prior with two independent branches in a mutual learning paradigm. To achieve effective transfer, SGML-Net leverages the relationships among different regions, making the representation more informative and thus providing better guidance. The auxiliary branch is excluded upon the transfer's completion, ensuring low model complexity in deployment. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated on three widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance. ",

In UNSR, each agent learns a compact and disentangled unit-wise state representation outputted from transformer blocks, and produces its local action-value function. The proposed UNSR is used to boost the value decomposition with a multi-head attention mechanism for producing efficient credit assignment in the mixing network, providing an efficient reasoning path between the individual value function and joint value function. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared to solid baselines on the StarCraft II micromanagement challenge.

In steam-based networks, storage tanks are usually absent, and there is a strong need to utilize thermal inertia of the pipeline network as storage. However, this type of use of a heating network directly affects the operating condition of the network, and assuring safety and supply quality at the use side is an open problem. To address this, we formulate a novel control problem to utilize CHP units in frequency regulation market while satisfying physical constraints on a steam network described by a nonlinear model capturing dynamics of heat flows and heat accumulation in the network. Furthermore, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is proposed to solve this problem. By consistently combining several nonlinear control techniques, a computationally efficient MPC controller is obtained and shown to work in real-time. ",

Training data used for modern recommendation systems commonly includes categorical features taking on tens-of-millions of possible distinct values. These categorical tokens are typically assigned learned vector representations, that are stored in large embedding tables, on the order of 100s of GB. Storing and accessing these tables represent a substantial burden in commercial deployments. Our work proposes MEM-REC, a novel alternative representation approach for embedding tables. MEM-REC leverages bloom filters and hashing methods to encode categorical features using two cache-friendly embedding tables. The first table (token embedding) contains raw embeddings (i.e. learned vector representation), and the second table (weight embedding), which is much smaller, contains weights to scale these raw embeddings to provide better discriminative capability to each data point. We provide a detailed architecture, design and analysis of MEM-REC addressing trade-offs in accuracy and computation requirements, in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques. We show that MEM-REC can not only maintain the recommendation quality and significantly reduce the memory footprint for commercial scale recommendation models but can also improve the embedding latency. In particular, based on our results, MEM-REC compresses the MLPerf CriteoTB benchmark DLRM model size by 2900x and performs up to 3.4x faster embeddings while achieving the same AUC as that of the full uncompressed model.

It can prevent attackers from obtaining valid challenge-response pairs (CRPs), increasing its resistance to modeling attacks significantly. A 64-stage LFSR-APUF has been implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) board. The experimental results reveal that the proposed design can effectively resist various modeling attacks such as logistic regression (LR), evolutionary strategy (ES), Artificial Neuro Network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) with a prediction rate of 51.79% and a slight effect on the randomness, reliability, and uniqueness. Further, a lightweight authentication protocol is established based on the proposed LFSR-APUF. The protocol incorporates a low-overhead, ultra-lightweight, novel private bit conversion Cover function that is uniquely bound to each device in the authentication network. A dynamic and timevariant obfuscation scheme in combination with the proposed LFSR-APUF is implemented in the protocol. The proposed authentication protocol not only resists spoofing attacks, physical attacks, and modeling attacks effectively, but also ensures the security of the entire authentication network by transferring important information in encrypted form from the server to the database even when the attacker completely controls the server.

The environment where these networks are employed are non-homogeneous & non-linear in nature. The effectiveness of these systems must thus be evaluated using generalized fading channels.

We leverage gradient-based meta-learning for higher generalizability on zero-shot cross-dataset inference. Unlike the most-studied image classification in meta-learning, depth is pixel-level continuous range values, and mappings from each image to depth vary widely across environments. Thus no explicit task boundaries exist. We instead propose fine-grained task that treats each RGB-D pair as a task in our meta-optimization. We first show meta-learning on limited data induces much better prior (max +29.4\\%). Using meta-learned weights as initialization for following supervised learning, without involving extra data or information, it consistently outperforms baselines without the method. Compared to most indoor-depth methods that only train/ test on a single dataset, we propose zero-shot cross-dataset protocols, closely evaluate robustness, and show consistently higher generalizability and accuracy by our meta-initialization. The work at the intersection of depth and meta-learning potentially drives both research streams to step closer to practical use. ",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based methods have demonstrated superior performance for monocular 3D object detection recently, which predicts 3D attributes from a single 2D image. Most existing transformer-based methods leverage visual and depth representations to explore valuable query points on objects, and the quality of the learned queries has a great impact on detection accuracy. Unfortunately, existing unsupervised attention mechanisms in transformer are prone to generate low-quality query features due to inaccurate receptive fields, especially on hard objects. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel ``Supervised Scale-constrained Deformable Attention'' (SSDA) for monocular 3D object detection. Specifically, SSDA presets several masks with different scales and utilizes depth and visual features to predict the local feature for each query. Imposing the scale constraint, SSDA could well predict the accurate receptive field of a query to support robust query feature generation. What is more, SSDA is assigned with a Weighted Scale Matching (WSM) loss to supervise scale prediction, which presents more confident results as compared to the unsupervised attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on ``KITTI'' demonstrate that SSDA significantly improves the detection accuracy especially on moderate and hard objects, yielding SOTA performance as compared to the existing approaches.

    "abstract": "Neural network-based techniques for automated program repair are becoming increasingly effective. Despite their success, little is known about why they succeed or fail, and how their way of reasoning about the code to repair compares to human developers. This paper presents the first in-depth study comparing human and neural program repair. In particular, we investigate what parts of the buggy code humans and two state of the art neural repair models focus on. This comparison is enabled by a novel attention-tracking interface for human code editing, based on which we gather a dataset of 98 bug fixing sessions, and on the attention layers of neural repair models. Our results show that the attention of the humans and both neural models often overlaps (0.35 to 0.44 correlation). At the same time, the agreement between humans and models still leaves room for improvement, as evidenced by the higher human-human correlation of 0.56. While the two models either focus mostly on the buggy line or on the surrounding context, the developers adopt a hybrid approach that evolves over time, where 36.8% of the attention is given to the buggy line and the rest to the context. Overall, we find the humans to still be clearly more effective at finding a correct fix, with 67.3% vs. less than 3% correctly predicted patches. The results and data of this study are a first step into a deeper understanding of the internal process of neural program repair, and offer insights inspired by the behavior of human developers on how to further improve neural repair models.

We address the minimum-time reachability problem (minreach) in DTNs, and show how to efficiently solve it based on a novel zone-graph algorithm. We further show that solving minreach allows us to construct a summary TA capturing exactly the possible behaviors of a single TA within a DTN of arbitrary size. The combination of these two results enables the parameterized verification of DTNs, while avoiding the construction of an exponential-size cutoff-system required by existing results. Our techniques are also implemented, and experiments show their practicality. ",

Inspired by CPG's capability to naturally generate rhythmic patterns, researchers have attempted to create mathematical models of CPG and utilize them for the locomotion of legged robots. In this paper, we propose a network architecture that incorporates CPGs for rhythmic pattern generation and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network for sensory feedback. We also proposed a method that reformulates CPGs into a fully-differentiable stateless network, allowing CPGs and MLP to be jointly trained with gradient-based learning. The results show that our proposed method learned agile and dynamic locomotion policies which are capable of blind traversal over uneven terrain and resist external pushes. Simulation results also show that the learned policies are capable of self-modulating step frequency and step length to adapt to the locomotion velocity. ",

However, most existing robustness evaluations in NAS only consider $l_{\\infty}$ norm-based adversarial noises. In order to improve the robustness of DNN models against multiple types of noises, it is necessary to consider a comprehensive evaluation in NAS for robust architectures. But with the increasing number of types of robustness evaluations, it also becomes more time-consuming to find comprehensively robust architectures. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel efficient search of comprehensively robust neural architectures via multi-fidelity evaluation (ES-CRNA-ME). Specifically, we first search for comprehensively robust architectures under multiple types of evaluations using the weight-sharing-based NAS method, including different $l_{p}$ norm attacks, semantic adversarial attacks, and composite adversarial attacks. In addition, we reduce the number of robustness evaluations by the correlation analysis, which can incorporate similar evaluations and decrease the evaluation cost. Finally, we propose a multi-fidelity online surrogate during optimization to further decrease the search cost. On the basis of the surrogate constructed by low-fidelity data, the online high-fidelity data is utilized to finetune the surrogate. Experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

This paper introduces a cross-lingual consistency regularization, CrossConST, to bridge the representation gap among different languages and boost zero-shot translation performance. The theoretical analysis shows that CrossConST implicitly maximizes the probability distribution for zero-shot translation, and the experimental results on both low-resource and high-resource benchmarks show that CrossConST consistently improves the translation performance. The experimental analysis also proves that CrossConST could close the sentence representation gap and better align the representation space. Given the universality and simplicity of CrossConST, we believe it can serve as a strong baseline for future multilingual NMT research. ",

Given a constant $z\\ge 1$, the input to Robust $(k, z)$-Clustering is a set $P$ of $n$ weighted points in a metric space $(M,\\delta)$ and a positive integer $k$. Further, each point belongs to one (or more) of the $m$ many different groups $S_1,S_2,\\ldots,S_m$. Our goal is to find a set $X$ of $k$ centers such that $\\max_{i \\in [m]} \\sum_{p \\in S_i} w(p) \\delta(p,X)^z$ is minimized. This problem arises in the domains of robust optimization [Anthony, Goyal, Gupta, Nagarajan, Math. Oper. Res. 2010] and in algorithmic fairness. For polynomial time computation, an approximation factor of $O(\\log m/\\log\\log m)$ is known [Makarychev, Vakilian, COLT $2021$], which is tight under a plausible complexity assumption even in the line metrics. For FPT time, there is a $(3^z+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, which is tight under GAP-ETH [Goyal, Jaiswal, Inf. Proc. Letters, 2023]. Motivated by the tight lower bounds for general discrete metrics, we focus on \\emph{geometric} spaces such as the (discrete) high-dimensional Euclidean setting and metrics of low doubling dimension, which play an important role in data analysis applications. First, for a universal constant $\\eta_0 >0.0006$, we devise a $3^z(1-\\eta_{0})$-factor FPT approximation algorithm for discrete high-dimensional Euclidean spaces thereby bypassing the lower bound for general metrics. We complement this result by showing that even the special case of $k$-Center in dimension $\\Theta(\\log n)$ is $(\\sqrt{3/2}- o(1))$-hard to approximate for FPT algorithms. Finally, we complete the FPT approximation landscape by designing an FPT $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation scheme (EPAS) for the metric of sub-logarithmic doubling dimension. ",

Unlike previous unsupervised VAD methods that adopt a fixed structure to learn normality without considering different detection demands, we design a spatial-temporal hierarchical architecture (STHA) as a configurable architecture to flexibly detect different degrees of anomaly. The comprehensive structure of the STHA is delineated into a tripartite hierarchy, encompassing the following tiers: the stream level, the stack level, and the block level. Specifically, we design several auto-encoder-based blocks that possess varying capacities for extracting normal patterns. Then, we stack blocks according to the complexity degrees with both intra-stack and inter-stack residual links to learn hierarchical normality gradually. Considering the multisource knowledge of videos, we also model the spatial normality of video frames and temporal normality of RGB difference by designing two parallel streams consisting of stacks. Thus, STHA can provide various representation learning abilities by expanding or contracting hierarchically to detect anomalies of different degrees. Since the anomaly set is complicated and unbounded, our STHA can adjust its detection ability to adapt to the human detection demands and the complexity degree of anomaly that happened in the history of a scene. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks and perform extensive analysis, and the results demonstrate that our method performs comparablely to the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we design a toy dataset to prove that our model can better balance the learning ability to adapt to different detection demands. ",

To address this issue, we propose an enhanced model called BundleRecon. In the existing approaches, sampling is performed by a single ray that corresponds to a single pixel. In contrast, our model samples a patch of pixels using a bundle of rays, which incorporates information from neighboring pixels. Furthermore, we design bundle-based constraints to further improve the reconstruction quality.

In an honest world, reactions may be informative to users when selecting on what to spend their attention: through the wisdom of crowds, summed reactions may help identifying relevant and high-quality content. This is nullified by coordinated inauthentic liking. To restore wisdom-of-crowds effects, it is therefore desirable to separate the inauthentic agents from the wise crowd, and use only the latter as a voting *jury* on the relevance of a post. To this end, we design two *jury selection procedures* (JSPs) that discard agents classified as inauthentic. Using machine learning techniques, both cluster on binary vote data -- one using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM JSP), one the k-means algorithm (KM JSP) -- and label agents by logistic regression. We evaluate the jury selection procedures with an agent-based model, and show that the GMM JSP detects more inauthentic agents, but both JSPs select juries with vastly increased correctness of vote by majority. This proof of concept provides an argument for the release of reactions data from social media platforms through a direct use-case in the fight against online misinformation. ",

However, the current literature is limited to incorporation of effective norms for single value alignment with no consideration of agents' heterogeneity and the requirement of simultaneous promotion and alignment of multiple values. This research proposes a multi-value promotion model that uses multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to produce the optimum parametric set of norms that is aligned with multiple simultaneous values of heterogeneous agents and the system. To understand various aspects of this complex problem, several evolutionary algorithms were used to find a set of optimised norm parameters considering two toy tax scenarios with two and five values are considered. The results are analysed from different perspectives to show the impact of a selected evolutionary algorithm on the solution, and the importance of understanding the relation between values when prioritising them.

    "abstract": "Causal reasoning ability is crucial for numerous NLP applications. Despite the impressive emerging ability of ChatGPT in various NLP tasks, it is unclear how well ChatGPT performs in causal reasoning. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the ChatGPT's causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments show that ChatGPT is not a good causal reasoner, but a good causal interpreter. Besides, ChatGPT has a serious hallucination on causal reasoning, possibly due to the reporting biases between causal and non-causal relationships in natural language, as well as ChatGPT's upgrading processes, such as RLHF. The In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Though (COT) techniques can further exacerbate such causal hallucination. Additionally, the causal reasoning ability of ChatGPT is sensitive to the words used to express the causal concept in prompts, and close-ended prompts perform better than open-ended prompts. For events in sentences, ChatGPT excels at capturing explicit causality rather than implicit causality, and performs better in sentences with lower event density and smaller lexical distance between events.

Among them, the most well-known are selfish mining (SM), block withholding (BWH), fork after withholding (FAW) and bribery mining. In this paper, we propose two novel mining attacks: bribery semi-selfish mining (BSSM) and bribery stubborn mining (BSM). Both of them can increase the relative extra reward of the adversary and will make the target bribery miners suffer from the bribery miner dilemma. All targets earn less under the Nash equilibrium. For each target, their local optimal strategy is to accept the bribes. However, they will suffer losses, comparing with denying the bribes. Furthermore, for all targets, their global optimal strategy is to deny the bribes. Quantitative analysis and simulation have been verified our theoretical analysis. We propose practical measures to mitigate more advanced mining attack strategies based on bribery mining, and provide new ideas for addressing bribery mining attacks in the future. However, how to completely and effectively prevent these attacks is still needed on further research. ",

    "abstract": "The bipartite graph structure has shown its promising ability in facilitating the subspace clustering and spectral clustering algorithms for large-scale datasets. To avoid the post-processing via k-means during the bipartite graph partitioning, the constrained Laplacian rank (CLR) is often utilized for constraining the number of connected components (i.e., clusters) in the bipartite graph, which, however, neglects the distribution (or normalization) of these connected components and may lead to imbalanced or even ill clusters. Despite the significant success of normalized cut (Ncut) in general graphs, it remains surprisingly an open problem how to enforce a one-step normalized cut for bipartite graphs, especially with linear-time complexity. In this paper, we first characterize a novel one-step bipartite graph cut (OBCut) criterion with normalized constraints, and theoretically prove its equivalence to a trace maximization problem. Then we extend this cut criterion to a scalable subspace clustering approach, where adaptive anchor learning, bipartite graph learning, and one-step normalized bipartite graph partitioning are simultaneously modeled in a unified objective function, and an alternating optimization algorithm is further designed to solve it in linear time. Experiments on a variety of general and large-scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach. ",

In this work, we broaden the scope of this attack to include text generation and classification models, hence showing its broader applicability. More concretely, we propose a new model hijacking attack, Ditto, that can hijack different text classification tasks into multiple generation ones, e.g., language translation, text summarization, and language modeling. We use a range of text benchmark datasets such as SST-2, TweetEval, AGnews, QNLI, and IMDB to evaluate the performance of our attacks. Our results show that by using Ditto, an adversary can successfully hijack text generation models without jeopardizing their utility. ",

In other words, each embedding is regarded as a unique class of its own, whichmay hurt the generalization performance. In this study, we propose IS-CSE (instance smoothing contrastive sentence embedding) to smooth the boundaries of embeddings in the feature space. Specifically, we retrieve embeddings from a dynamic memory buffer according to the semantic similarity to get a positive embedding group. Then embeddings in the group are aggregated by a self-attention operation to produce a smoothed instance embedding for further analysis. We evaluate our method on standard semantic text similarity (STS) tasks and achieve an average of 78.30%, 79.47%, 77.73%, and 79.42% Spearman's correlation on the base of BERT-base, BERT-large, RoBERTa-base, and RoBERTa-large respectively, a 2.05%, 1.06%, 1.16% and 0.52% improvement compared to unsup-SimCSE.

More recently the performance improvements in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have enabled developers to exploit sufficient computing power to build a fair amount of ray tracing applications with the ability to run in real-time. Typically, real-time ray tracing is achieved by utilizing high performance kernels written in CUDA, OpenCL, and Vulkan which can be invoked by high-level languages via native bindings; a technique that fragments application code bases as well as limits portability. This paper presents a hardware-accelerated ray tracing rendering engine, fully written in Java, that can seamlessly harness the performance of underlying GPUs via the TornadoVM framework. Through this paper, we show the potential of Java and acceleration frameworks to process in real time a compute intensive application. Our results indicate that it is possible to enable real time ray tracing from Java by achieving up to 234, 152, 45 frames-per-second in 720p, 1080p, and 4K resolutions, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Most networks are not static objects, but instead they change over time. This observation has sparked rigorous research on temporal graphs within the last years. In temporal graphs, we have a fixed set of nodes and the connections between them are only available at certain time steps. This gives rise to a plethora of algorithmic problems on such graphs, most prominently the problem of finding temporal spanners, i.e., the computation of subgraphs that guarantee all pairs reachability via temporal paths. To the best of our knowledge, only centralized approaches for the solution of this problem are known. However, many real-world networks are not shaped by a central designer but instead they emerge and evolve by the interaction of many strategic agents. This observation is the driving force of the recent intensive research on game-theoretic network formation models. In this work we bring together these two recent research directions: temporal graphs and game-theoretic network formation. As a first step into this new realm, we focus on a simplified setting where a complete temporal host graph is given and the agents, corresponding to its nodes, selfishly create incident edges to ensure that they can reach all other nodes via temporal paths in the created network. This yields temporal spanners as equilibria of our game. We prove results on the convergence to and the existence of equilibrium networks, on the complexity of finding best agent strategies, and on the quality of the equilibria. By taking these first important steps, we uncover challenging open problems that call for an in-depth exploration of the creation of temporal graphs by strategic agents. ",

    "abstract": "The ability to generalize to a wide range of recording devices is a crucial performance factor for audio classification models. The characteristics of different types of microphones introduce distributional shifts in the digitized audio signals due to their varying frequency responses. If this domain shift is not taken into account during training, the model's performance could degrade severely when it is applied to signals recorded by unseen devices. In particular, training a model on audio signals recorded with a small number of different microphones can make generalization to unseen devices difficult. To tackle this problem, we convolve audio signals in the training set with pre-recorded device impulse responses (DIRs) to artificially increase the diversity of recording devices. We systematically study the effect of DIR augmentation on the task of Acoustic Scene Classification using CNNs and Audio Spectrogram Transformers. The results show that DIR augmentation in isolation performs similarly to the state-of-the-art method Freq-MixStyle. However, we also show that DIR augmentation and Freq-MixStyle are complementary, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on signals recorded by devices unseen during training. ",

Among many successful applications of OT in machine learning (ML), domain adaptation (DA) -- a field of study where the goal is to transfer a classifier from one labelled domain to another similar, yet different unlabelled or scarcely labelled domain -- has been historically among the most investigated ones. This success is due to the ability of OT to provide both a meaningful discrepancy measure to assess the similarity of two domains' distributions and a mapping that can project source domain data onto the target one. In this paper, we propose a principally new OT-based approach applied to DA that uses the closed-form solution of the OT problem given by an affine mapping and learns an embedding space for which this solution is optimal and computationally less complex. We show that our approach works in both homogeneous and heterogeneous DA settings and outperforms or is on par with other famous baselines based on both traditional OT and OT in incomparable spaces. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method vastly reduces computational complexity. ",

Also, they are usually sensitive to graph noises. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel graph Transformer architecture, termed Anchor Graph Transformer (AGFormer), by leveraging an anchor graph model. To be specific, AGFormer first obtains some representative anchors and then converts node-to-node message passing into anchor-to-anchor and anchor-to-node message passing process. Thus, AGFormer performs much more efficiently and also robustly than regular node-to-node Transformers.

Accurate and effortless diet logging is one of the significant bottlenecks for effective diet management and calorie restriction. Dish detection from food platters is a challenging problem due to a visually complex food layout. We present an end-to-end computational framework for diet management, from data compilation, annotation, and state-of-the-art model identification to its mobile app implementation. As a case study, we implement the framework in the context of Indian food platters known for their complex presentation that poses a challenge for the automated detection of dishes. Starting with the 61 most popular Indian dishes, we identify the state-of-the-art model through a comparative analysis of deep-learning-based object detection architectures. Rooted in a meticulous compilation of 68,005 platter images with 134,814 manual dish annotations, we first compare ten architectures for multi-label classification to identify ResNet152 (mAP=84.51%) as the best model. YOLOv8x (mAP=87.70%) emerged as the best model architecture for dish detection among the eight deep-learning models implemented after a thorough performance evaluation. By comparing with the state-of-the-art model for the IndianFood10 dataset, we demonstrate the superior object detection performance of YOLOv8x for this subset and establish Resnet152 as the best architecture for multi-label classification. The models thus trained on richly annotated data can be extended to include dishes from across global cuisines. The proposed framework is demonstrated through a proof-of-concept mobile application with diverse applications for diet logging, food recommendation systems, nutritional interventions, and mitigation of lifestyle disorders.

The methodology uses a population of RL agents training with a common experience buffer, with occasional crossovers and mutations of the agents in order to search efficiently through the policy space. Unlike prior literature on combining evolutionary search (ES) with RL, this work does not generate a distribution of agents from a common mean and covariance matrix. Neither does it require the evaluation of the entire population of policies at every time step. Instead, we focus on gradient-based training throughout the life of every policy (individual), with a sparse amount of evolutionary exploration. The resulting algorithm is shown to be robust to hyperparameter variations. As a surprising corollary, we show that simply initialising and training multiple RL agents with a common memory (with no further evolutionary updates) outperforms several standard RL baselines. ",

Firstly, we profoundly analyze the spatio-temporal correlation between the historical vehicle trajectory of user requests and construct the system model to predict the vehicle trajectory and content popularity, which lays a foundation for mobility-aware content caching and dispatching. Meanwhile, we probe into privacy protection strategies to realize privacy-preserved prediction model. Furthermore, based on trajectory and popular content prediction results, content caching strategy is studied, and adaptive and dynamic resource management schemes are proposed for hierarchical cooperative caching networks. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the superiority of our proposed scheme and algorithms. It shows that the proposed algorithms effectively improve the performance of the considered system in terms of hit ratio and average delay, and narrow the gap to the optimal caching scheme comparing with the traditional schemes.

The motivation for code refactoring could be to improve the design, structure, or implementation of an existing program without changing its functionality. To solve a very specific problem of coupling and cohesion, we propose using heuristic search-based techniques on an approximation of the full code refactoring problem, to guide the refactoring process toward solutions that have high cohesion and low coupling. We evaluated our approach by providing demonstrative examples of the effectiveness of this approach on random state problems and created a tool to implement the algorithm on Java projects. ",

    "abstract": "With the publication of DINO, a variant of the Detection Transformer (DETR), Detection Transformers are breaking the record in the object detection benchmark with the merits of their end-to-end design and scalability. However, the extension of DETR to oriented object detection has not been thoroughly studied although more benefits from its end-to-end architecture are expected such as removing NMS and anchor-related costs. In this paper, we propose a first strong DINO-based baseline for oriented object detection. We found that straightforward employment of DETRs for oriented object detection does not guarantee non-duplicate prediction, and propose a simple cost to mitigate this. Furthermore, we introduce a novel denoising strategy that uses Hungarian matching to filter redundant noised queries and query alignment to preserve matching consistency between Transformer decoder layers. Our proposed model outperforms previous rotated DETRs and other counterparts, achieving state-of-the-art performance in DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0, and DIOR-R benchmarks. ",

Traditionally, these tasks would be carried out by two independent systems; however, recent studies have demonstrated the potential to have one unified system architecture in order to reduce the computational burdens on the system, while maintaining high accuracy. In this work, we leverage a vision transformer architecture for joint spoof detection and matching and report competitive results with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for both a sequential system (two ViT models operating independently) and a unified architecture (a single ViT model for both tasks). ViT models are particularly well suited for this task as the ViT's global embedding encodes features useful for recognition, whereas the individual, local embeddings are useful for spoof detection. We demonstrate the capability of our unified model to achieve an average integrated matching (IM) accuracy of 98.87% across LivDet 2013 and 2015 CrossMatch sensors. This is comparable to IM accuracy of 98.95% of our sequential dual-ViT system, but with ~50% of the parameters and ~58% of the latency. ",

Although the Information Retrieval (IR) community has adopted LMs as the backbone of modern IR architectures, there has been little to no research in understanding how negation impacts neural IR. We therefore construct a straightforward benchmark on this theme: asking IR models to rank two documents that differ only by negation. We show that the results vary widely according to the type of IR architecture: cross-encoders perform best, followed by late-interaction models, and in last place are bi-encoder and sparse neural architectures. We find that most current information retrieval models do not consider negation, performing similarly or worse than randomly ranking. We show that although the obvious approach of continued fine-tuning on a dataset of contrastive documents containing negations increases performance (as does model size), there is still a large gap between machine and human performance.

In this paper, we present our work of iteratively engaging therapists and post-stroke survivors to design, develop, and evaluate a social robot exercise coaching system for personalized rehabilitation. Through interviews with therapists, we designed how this system interacts with the user and then developed an interactive social robot exercise coaching system. This system integrates a neural network model with a rule-based model to automatically monitor and assess patients' rehabilitation exercises and can be tuned with individual patient's data to generate real-time, personalized corrective feedback for improvement. With the dataset of rehabilitation exercises from 15 post-stroke survivors, we demonstrated our system significantly improves its performance to assess patients' exercises while tuning with held-out patient's data. In addition, our real-world evaluation study showed that our system can adapt to new participants and achieved 0.81 average performance to assess their exercises, which is comparable to the experts' agreement level. We further discuss the potential benefits and limitations of our system in practice. ",

We address the challenges by proposing four pre-training tasks and novel task-oriented adaptation (ToA) layers. Moreover, this paper discusses how to fine-tune the model on new recommendation task such that the ToA layers are adapted to ZSIR task. Comprehensive experiments on 18 markets dataset are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in both knowledge prediction and ZSIR task. ",

    "abstract": "Popular social media platforms employ neural network based image moderation engines to classify images uploaded on them as having potentially objectionable content. Such moderation engines must answer a large number of queries with heavy computational cost, even though the actual number of images with objectionable content is usually a tiny fraction. Inspired by recent work on Neural Group Testing, we propose an approach which exploits this fact to reduce the overall computational cost of such engines using the technique of Compressed Sensing (CS). We present the quantitative matrix-pooled neural network (QMPNN), which takes as input $n$ images, and a $m \\times n$ binary pooling matrix with $m < n$, whose rows indicate $m$ pools of images i.e. selections of $r$ images out of $n$. The QMPNN efficiently outputs the product of this matrix with the unknown sparse binary vector indicating whether each image is objectionable or not, i.e. it outputs the number of objectionable images in each pool. For suitable matrices, this is decoded using CS decoding algorithms to predict which images were objectionable. The computational cost of running the QMPNN and the CS algorithms is significantly lower than the cost of using a neural network with the same number of parameters separately on each image to classify the images, which we demonstrate via extensive experiments. Our technique is inherently resilient to moderate levels of errors in the prediction from the QMPNN. Furthermore, we present pooled deep outlier detection, which brings CS and group testing techniques to deep outlier detection, to provide for the case when the objectionable images do not belong to a set of pre-defined classes. This technique enables efficient automated moderation of off-topic images shared on topical forums dedicated to sharing images of a certain single class, many of which are currently human-moderated.

To solve this problem, Region Proposal Convolutional Interaction Network (RPCIN), a vision-based model, was proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance in long-term prediction. RPCIN only takes raw images and simple object descriptions, such as the bounding box and segmentation mask of each object, as input. However, despite its success, the model's capability can be compromised under conditions of environment misalignment. In this paper, we investigate two challenging conditions for environment misalignment: Cross-Domain and Cross-Context by proposing four datasets that are designed for these challenges: SimB-Border, SimB-Split, BlenB-Border, and BlenB-Split. The datasets cover two domains and two contexts. Using RPCIN as a probe, experiments conducted on the combinations of the proposed datasets reveal potential weaknesses of the vision-based long-term dynamics prediction model. Furthermore, we propose a promising direction to mitigate the Cross-Domain challenge and provide concrete evidence supporting such a direction, which provides dramatic alleviation of the challenge on the proposed datasets.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) converts source speech into the voice of any desired speaker using only one utterance of the speaker without requiring additional model updates. Typical methods use a speaker representation from a pre-trained speaker verification (SV) model or learn speaker representation during VC training to achieve zero-shot VC. However, existing speaker modeling methods overlook the variation of speaker information richness in temporal and frequency channel dimensions of speech. This insufficient speaker modeling hampers the ability of the VC model to accurately represent unseen speakers who are not in the training dataset. In this study, we present a robust zero-shot VC model with multi-level temporal-channel retrieval, referred to as MTCR-VC. Specifically, to flexibly adapt to the dynamic-variant speaker characteristic in the temporal and channel axis of the speech, we propose a novel fine-grained speaker modeling method, called temporal-channel retrieval (TCR), to find out when and where speaker information appears in speech. It retrieves variable-length speaker representation from both temporal and channel dimensions under the guidance of a pre-trained SV model. Besides, inspired by the hierarchical process of human speech production, the MTCR speaker module stacks several TCR blocks to extract speaker representations from multi-granularity levels. Furthermore, to achieve better speech disentanglement and reconstruction, we introduce a cycle-based training strategy to simulate zero-shot inference recurrently. We adopt perpetual constraints on three aspects, including content, style, and speaker, to drive this process. Experiments demonstrate that MTCR-VC is superior to the previous zero-shot VC methods in modeling speaker timbre while maintaining good speech naturalness. ",

The domain adversarial neural networks (DANN), where the classification loss and domain loss jointly update the parameters of feature extractor, are adopted to deal with the domain shift. However, limited EEG data quantity and strong individual difference are challenges for the DANN with cumbersome feature extractor. In this work, we propose knowledge distillation (KD) based lightweight DANN to enhance cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition. Specifically, the teacher model with strong context learning ability is utilized to learn complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of EEG, and robust lightweight student model is guided by the teacher model to learn more difficult domain-invariant features. In the feature-based KD framework, a transformer-based hierarchical temporalspatial learning model is served as the teacher model. The student model, which is composed of Bi-LSTM units, is a lightweight version of the teacher model. Hence, the student model could be supervised to mimic the robust feature representations of teacher model by leveraging complementary latent temporal features and spatial features. In the DANN-based cross-subject emotion recognition, we combine the obtained student model and a lightweight temporal-spatial feature interaction module as the feature extractor. And the feature aggregation is fed to the emotion classifier and domain classifier for domain-invariant feature learning. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct the subject-independent experiments on the public dataset DEAP with arousal and valence classification. The outstanding performance and t-SNE visualization of latent features verify the advantage and effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

In this work, we propose a novel attention-based node embedding framework for graphs.
