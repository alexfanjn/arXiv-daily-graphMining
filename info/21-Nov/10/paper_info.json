    "title": "RAVE: A variational autoencoder for fast and high-quality neural audio  synthesis",
    "abstract": "Deep generative models applied to audio have improved by a large margin the state-of-the-art in many speech and music related tasks. However, as raw waveform modelling remains an inherently difficult task, audio generative models are either computationally intensive, rely on low sampling rates, are complicated to control or restrict the nature of possible signals. Among those models, Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) give control over the generation by exposing latent variables, although they usually suffer from low synthesis quality. In this paper, we introduce a Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder (RAVE) allowing both fast and high-quality audio waveform synthesis. We introduce a novel two-stage training procedure, namely representation learning and adversarial fine-tuning. We show that using a post-training analysis of the latent space allows a direct control between the reconstruction fidelity and the representation compactness. By leveraging a multi-band decomposition of the raw waveform, we show that our model is the first able to generate 48kHz audio signals, while simultaneously running 20 times faster than real-time on a standard laptop CPU. We evaluate synthesis quality using both quantitative and qualitative subjective experiments and show the superiority of our approach compared to existing models. Finally, we present applications of our model for timbre transfer and signal compression. All of our source code and audio examples are publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "Attack trees are an important tool in security analysis, and an important part of attack tree analysis is computing metrics. This paper focuses on dynamic attack trees and their min time metric. For general attack trees, calculating min time efficiently is an open problem, with the fastest current method being enumerating all minimal attacks, which is NP-hard. This paper introduces 3 new tools for calculating min time. First, we show that static attack trees can be handled by a fast bottom-up algorithm. Second, we introduce a novel method for general dynamic attack trees based on mixed integer linear programming. Third, we show how the computation can be sped up by identifying the modules of an attack tree, i.e. subtrees connected to the rest of the attack tree via only one node. Experiments on a generated testing set of large attack trees verify that these methods have a large impact on performance. ",

    "title": "Does Thermal data make the detection systems more reliable?",
    "abstract": "Deep learning-based detection networks have made remarkable progress in autonomous driving systems (ADS). ADS should have reliable performance across a variety of ambient lighting and adverse weather conditions. However, luminance degradation and visual obstructions (such as glare, fog) result in poor quality images by the visual camera which leads to performance decline. To overcome these challenges, we explore the idea of leveraging a different data modality that is disparate yet complementary to the visual data. We propose a comprehensive detection system based on a multimodal-collaborative framework that learns from both RGB (from visual cameras) and thermal (from Infrared cameras) data. This framework trains two networks collaboratively and provides flexibility in learning optimal features of its own modality while also incorporating the complementary knowledge of the other. Our extensive empirical results show that while the improvement in accuracy is nominal, the value lies in challenging and extremely difficult edge cases which is crucial in safety-critical applications such as AD. We provide a holistic view of both merits and limitations of using a thermal imaging system in detection. ",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-vaxxers use social media to distribute fake news and anxiety-provoking information about the vaccine, which may harm the public. Here, we characterize the psycho-linguistic features of anti-vaxxers on the online social network Twitter. For this, we collected COVID-19 related tweets from February 2020 to June 2021 to analyse vaccination stance, linguistic features, and social network characteristics. Our results demonstrated that, compared to pro-vaxxers, anti-vaxxers tend to have more negative emotions, narrative thinking, and worse moral tendencies. This study can advance our understanding of the online anti-vaccination movement, and become critical for social media management and policy action during and after the pandemic. ",

    "abstract": "Link prediction infers potential links from observed networks, and is one of the essential problems in network analyses. In contrast to traditional graph representation modeling which only predicts two-way pairwise relations, we propose a novel tensor-based joint network embedding approach on simultaneously encoding pairwise links and hyperlinks onto a latent space, which captures the dependency between pairwise and multi-way links in inferring potential unobserved hyperlinks. The major advantage of the proposed embedding procedure is that it incorporates both the pairwise relationships and subgroup-wise structure among nodes to capture richer network information. In addition, the proposed method introduces a hierarchical dependency among links to infer potential hyperlinks, and leads to better link prediction. In theory we establish the estimation consistency for the proposed embedding approach, and provide a faster convergence rate compared to link prediction utilizing pairwise links or hyperlinks only. Numerical studies on both simulation settings and Facebook ego-networks indicate that the proposed method improves both hyperlink and pairwise link prediction accuracy compared to existing link prediction algorithms.

    "title": "Community detection using low-dimensional network embedding algorithms",
    "abstract": "With the increasing relevance of large networks in important areas such as the study of contact networks for spread of disease, or social networks for their impact on geopolitics, it has become necessary to study machine learning tools that are scalable to very large networks, often containing millions of nodes. One major class of such scalable algorithms is known as network representation learning or network embedding. These algorithms try to learn representations of network functionals (e.g.~nodes) by first running multiple random walks and then using the number of co-occurrences of each pair of nodes in observed random walk segments to obtain a low-dimensional representation of nodes on some Euclidean space. The aim of this paper is to rigorously understand the performance of two major algorithms, DeepWalk and node2vec, in recovering communities for canonical network models with ground truth communities. Depending on the sparsity of the graph, we find the length of the random walk segments required such that the corresponding observed co-occurrence window is able to perform almost exact recovery of the underlying community assignments. We prove that, given some fixed co-occurrence window, node2vec using random walks with a low non-backtracking probability can succeed for much sparser networks compared to DeepWalk using simple random walks. Moreover, if the sparsity parameter is low, we provide evidence that these algorithms might not succeed in almost exact recovery. The analysis requires developing general tools for path counting on random networks having an underlying low-rank structure, which are of independent interest. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel shape-aware relation network for accurate and real-time landmark detection in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) surgery. This task is of great clinical significance but extremely challenging due to bleeding, lighting reflection, and motion blur in the complicated surgical environment. Compared with existing solutions, which either neglect geometric relationships among targeting objects or capture the relationships by using complicated aggregation schemes, the proposed network is capable of achieving satisfactory accuracy while maintaining real-time performance by taking full advantage of the spatial relations among landmarks. We first devise an algorithm to automatically generate relation keypoint heatmaps, which are able to intuitively represent the prior knowledge of spatial relations among landmarks without using any extra manual annotation efforts. We then develop two complementary regularization schemes to progressively incorporate the prior knowledge into the training process. While one scheme introduces pixel-level regularization by multi-task learning, the other integrates global-level regularization by harnessing a newly designed grouped consistency evaluator, which adds relation constraints to the proposed network in an adversarial manner. Both schemes are beneficial to the model in training, and can be readily unloaded in inference to achieve real-time detection. We establish a large in-house dataset of ESD surgery for esophageal cancer to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, achieving better detection results faster. Promising results on two downstream applications further corroborate the great potential of our method in ESD clinical practice. ",

    "abstract": "FDG-PET reveals altered brain metabolism in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some biomarkers derived from FDG-PET by computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) technologies have been proved that they can accurately diagnosis normal control (NC), MCI, and AD. However, the studies of identification of early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI) with FDG-PET images are still insufficient. Compared with studies based on fMRI and DTI images, the researches of the inter-region representation features in FDG-PET images are insufficient. Moreover, considering the variability in different individuals, some hard samples which are very similar with both two classes limit the classification performance. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel bilinear pooling and metric learning network (BMNet), which can extract the inter-region representation features and distinguish hard samples by constructing embedding space. To validate the proposed method, we collect 998 FDG-PET images from ADNI. Following the common preprocessing steps, 90 features are extracted from each FDG-PET image according to the automatic anatomical landmark (AAL) template and then sent into the proposed network. Extensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments are performed for multiple two-class classifications. Experiments show that most metrics are improved after adding the bilinear pooling module and metric losses to the Baseline model respectively. Specifically, in the classification task between EMCI and LMCI, the specificity improves 6.38% after adding the triple metric loss, and the negative predictive value (NPV) improves 3.45% after using the bilinear pooling module.

As a result, we obtain a classification strategy that is robust under modeling uncertainties and experimental perturbations.

This provides a warning to the system analysts and they can ensure uninterrupted operation of the system. In this work we analyze both histograms and call graph of API usage to determine if the usage patterns of the system has shifted. We compare the application of nonparametric statistical and Bayesian sequential analysis to the problem. This is done in a way that overcomes the issue of repeated statistical tests and insures statistical significance of the alerts. The technique was simulated and tested and proven effective in detecting the drift in various scenarios. We also mention modifications to the technique to decrease its memory so that it can respond more quickly when the distribution drift occurs at a delay from when monitoring begins. ",

Here we show how a flow-based community-detection approach can integrate network information and distant metadata, providing a more nuanced picture of network structure and correlations. We analyse social and spatial networks using the map equation framework and find that our methodology can detect a variety of useful metadata-informed partitions in diverse real-world systems.

    "abstract": "Computational stress analysis is an important step in the design of material systems. Finite element method (FEM) is a standard approach of performing stress analysis of complex material systems. A way to accelerate stress analysis is to replace FEM with a data-driven machine learning based stress analysis approach. In this study, we consider a fiber-reinforced matrix composite material system and we use deep learning tools to find an alternative to the FEM approach for stress field prediction. We first try to predict stress field maps for composite material systems of fixed number of fibers with varying spatial configurations. Specifically, we try to find a mapping between the spatial arrangement of the fibers in the composite material and the corresponding von Mises stress field. This is achieved by using a convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically a U-Net architecture, using true stress maps of systems with same number of fibers as training data. U-Net is a encoder-decoder network which in this study takes in the composite material image as an input and outputs the stress field image which is of the same size as the input image. We perform a robustness analysis by taking different initializations of the training samples to find the sensitivity of the prediction accuracy to the small number of training samples. When the number of fibers in the composite material system is increased for the same volume fraction, a finer finite element mesh discretization is required to represent the geometry accurately. This leads to an increase in the computational cost. Thus, the secondary goal here is to predict the stress field for systems with larger number of fibers with varying spatial configurations using information from the true stress maps of relatively cheaper systems of smaller fiber number.
