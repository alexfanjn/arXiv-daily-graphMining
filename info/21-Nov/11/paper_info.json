    "title": "Collocation approximation by deep neural ReLU networks for parametric  elliptic PDEs with lognormal inputs",
    "abstract": "We study the deep ReLU neural network collocation approximation of the solution $u$ to elliptic PDEs with lognormal inputs, parametrized by $\\boldsymbol{y}$ from the non-compact set $\\mathbb{R}^\\infty$. The approximation error is measured in the norm of the Bochner space $L_2(\\mathbb{R}^\\infty, V, \\gamma)$, where $\\gamma$ is the infinite tensor product standard Gaussian probability measure on $\\mathbb{R}^\\infty$ and $V$ is the energy space. Under a certain assumption on $\\ell_q$-summability for the lognormal inputs $(0<q<2)$, we proved that given arbitrary number $\\delta >0$ small enough, for every integer $n > 1$, one can construct a compactly supported deep ReLU neural network $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_n:= \\big(\\phi_j\\big)_{j=1}^m$ of size at most $n$ on $\\mathbb{R}^m$ with $m =\\mathcal{O}(n^{1 - \\delta})$, and a sequence of points $\\big(\\boldsymbol{y}j\\big)_{j=1}^m \\subset \\mathbb{R}^m$ (which are independent of $u$) so that the collocation approximation of $u$ by $\\Phi_n u:= \\sum_{j=1}^m u\\big(\\boldsymbol{y}^j\\big) \\Phi_j,$ which is based on the $m$ solvers $\\Big( u\\big(\\boldsymbol{y}^j\\big)\\Big)_{j=1}^m$ and the deep ReLU network $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_n$, gives the twofold error bounds: $\\|u- \\Phi_n u \\|_{L_2(\\mathbb{R}^\\infty V, \\gamma)} = \\mathcal{O}\\left(m^{- (1/q - 1/2)}\\right) =\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{- (1-\\delta)(1/q - 1/2)}\\right),$ where $\\Phi_j$ are the extensions of $\\phi_j$ to the whole $\\mathbb{R}^\\infty$. We also obtained similar results for the case when the lognormal inputs are parametrized on $\\mathbb{R}^M$ with very large dimension $M$, and the approximation error is measured in the $\\sqrt{g_M}$-weighted uniform norm of the Bochner space $L_\\infty^{\\sqrt{g}}(\\mathbb{R}^M, V)$, where $g_M$ is the density function of the standard Gaussian probability measure on $\\mathbb{R}^M$.

    "title": "Lightweight machine unlearning in neural network",
    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning neural network has penetrated deeply into people's life. As the price of convenience, people's private information also has the risk of disclosure. The \"right to be forgotten\" was introduced in a timely manner, stipulating that individuals have the right to withdraw their consent from personal information processing activities based on their consent. To solve this problem, machine unlearning is proposed, which allows the model to erase all memory of private information. Previous studies, including retraining and incremental learning to update models, often take up extra storage space or are difficult to apply to neural networks. Our method only needs to make a small perturbation of the weight of the target model and make it iterate in the direction of the model trained with the remaining data subset until the contribution of the unlearning data to the model is completely eliminated. In this paper, experiments on five datasets prove the effectiveness of our method for machine unlearning, and our method is 15 times faster than retraining. ",

    "title": "TomoSLAM: factor graph optimization for rotation angle refinement in  microtomography",
    "abstract": "In computed tomography (CT), the relative trajectories of a sample, a detector, and a signal source are traditionally considered to be known, since they are caused by the intentional preprogrammed movement of the instrument parts. However, due to the mechanical backlashes, rotation sensor measurement errors, thermal deformations real trajectory differs from desired ones. This negatively affects the resulting quality of tomographic reconstruction. Neither the calibration nor preliminary adjustments of the device completely eliminates the inaccuracy of the trajectory but significantly increase the cost of instrument maintenance. A number of approaches to this problem are based on an automatic refinement of the source and sensor position estimate relative to the sample for each projection (at each time step) during the reconstruction process. A similar problem of position refinement while observing different images of an object from different angles is well known in robotics (particularly, in mobile robots and self-driving vehicles) and is called Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). The scientific novelty of this work is to consider the problem of trajectory refinement in microtomography as a SLAM problem. This is achieved by extracting Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) features from X-ray projections, filtering matches with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), calculating angles between projections, and using them in factor graph in combination with stepper motor control signals in order to refine rotation angles.

    "title": "Topic-aware latent models for representation learning on networks",
    "abstract": "Network representation learning (NRL) methods have received significant attention over the last years thanks to their success in several graph analysis problems, including node classification, link prediction, and clustering. Such methods aim to map each vertex of the network into a low-dimensional space in a way that the structural information of the network is preserved. Of particular interest are methods based on random walks; such methods transform the network into a collection of node sequences, aiming to learn node representations by predicting the context of each node within the sequence. In this paper, we introduce TNE, a generic framework to enhance the embeddings of nodes acquired by means of random walk-based approaches with topic-based information. Similar to the concept of topical word embeddings in Natural Language Processing, the proposed model first assigns each node to a latent community with the favor of various statistical graph models and community detection methods and then learns the enhanced topic-aware representations. We evaluate our methodology in two downstream tasks: node classification and link prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating node and community embeddings, we are able to outperform widely-known baseline NRL models. ",

    "abstract": "Detection of malicious activities in corporate environments is a very complex task and much effort has been invested into research of its automation. However, vast majority of existing methods operate only in a narrow scope which limits them to capture only fragments of the evidence of malware's presence. Consequently, such approach is not aligned with the way how the cyber threats are studied and described by domain experts. In this work, we discuss these limitations and design a detection framework which combines observed events from different sources of data. Thanks to this, it provides full insight into the attack life cycle and enables detection of threats that require this coupling of observations from different telemetries to identify the full scope of the incident. We demonstrate applicability of the framework on a case study of a real malware infection observed in a corporate network. ",

A vertex of a geometric graph is called convex if it lies outside of the convex hull of its neighbors. We show that for a geometric graph with $n$ vertices and $e$ edges there are at least $\\frac{n}{2}\\binom{2e/n}{3}$ pairs of disjoint edges provided that $2e\\geq n$ and all the vertices of the graph are convex. Besides, we prove that if any edge of a geometric graph with $n$ vertices is disjoint from at most $m$ edges, then the number of edges of this graph does not exceed $n(\\sqrt{1+8m}+3)/4$ provided that $n$ is sufficiently large. These two results are tight for an infinite family of graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Without the need of a clean reference, non-intrusive speech assessment methods have caught great attention for objective evaluations. Recently, deep neural network (DNN) models have been applied to build non-intrusive speech assessment approaches and confirmed to provide promising performance. However, most DNN-based approaches are designed for normal-hearing listeners without considering hearing-loss factors. In this study, we propose a DNN-based hearing aid speech assessment network (HASA-Net), formed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) model, to predict speech quality and intelligibility scores simultaneously according to input speech signals and specified hearing-loss patterns. To the best of our knowledge, HASA-Net is the first work to incorporate quality and intelligibility assessments utilizing a unified DNN-based non-intrusive model for hearing aids. Experimental results show that the predicted speech quality and intelligibility scores of HASA-Net are highly correlated to two well-known intrusive hearing-aid evaluation metrics, hearing aid speech quality index (HASQI) and hearing aid speech perception index (HASPI), respectively.
