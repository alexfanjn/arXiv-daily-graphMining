    "title": "Reddit and the Fourth Estate: Exploring the magnitude and effects of  media influence on community level moderation on Reddit",
    "abstract": "Most platforms, including Reddit, face a dilemma when applying interventions such as subreddit bans to toxic communities -- do they risk angering their user base by proactively enforcing stricter controls on discourse or do they defer interventions at the risk of eventually triggering negative media reactions which might impact their advertising revenue? In this paper, we analyze Reddit's previous administrative interventions to understand one aspect of this dilemma: the relationship between the media and administrative interventions. More specifically, we make two primary contributions. First, using a mediation analysis framework, we find evidence that Reddit's interventions for violating their content policy for toxic content occur because of media pressure. Second, using interrupted time series analysis, we show that media attention on communities with toxic content only increases the problematic behavior associated with that community (both within the community itself and across the platform). However, we find no significant difference in the impact of administrative interventions on subreddits with and without media pressure. Taken all together, this study provides evidence of a media-driven moderation strategy at Reddit and also suggests that such a strategy may not have a significantly different impact than a more proactive strategy.

    "abstract": "Conventional thermal preference prediction in buildings has limitations due to the difficulty in capturing all environmental and personal factors. New model features can improve the ability of a machine learning model to classify a person's thermal preference. The spatial context of a building can provide information to models about the windows, walls, heating and cooling sources, air diffusers, and other factors that create micro-environments that influence thermal comfort. Due to spatial heterogeneity, it is impractical to position sensors at a high enough resolution to capture all conditions. This research aims to build upon an existing vector-based spatial model, called Build2Vec, for predicting spatial-temporal occupants' indoor environmental preferences. Build2Vec utilizes the spatial data from the Building Information Model (BIM) and indoor localization in a real-world setting. This framework uses longitudinal intensive thermal comfort subjective feedback from smart watch-based ecological momentary assessments (EMA). The aggregation of these data is combined into a graph network structure (i.e., objects and relations) and used as input for a classification model to predict occupant thermal preference. The results of a test implementation show 14-28% accuracy improvement over a set of baselines that use conventional thermal preference prediction input variables. ",

    "title": "Equinox: neural networks in JAX via callable PyTrees and filtered  transformations",
    "abstract": "JAX and PyTorch are two popular Python autodifferentiation frameworks. JAX is based around pure functions and functional programming. PyTorch has popularised the use of an object-oriented (OO) class-based syntax for defining parameterised functions, such as neural networks. That this seems like a fundamental difference means current libraries for building parameterised functions in JAX have either rejected the OO approach entirely (Stax) or have introduced OO-to-functional transformations, multiple new abstractions, and been limited in the extent to which they integrate with JAX (Flax, Haiku, Objax). Either way this OO/functional difference has been a source of tension. Here, we introduce `Equinox', a small neural network library showing how a PyTorch-like class-based approach may be admitted without sacrificing JAX-like functional programming. We provide two main ideas. One: parameterised functions are themselves represented as `PyTrees', which means that the parameterisation of a function is transparent to the JAX framework. Two: we filter a PyTree to isolate just those components that should be treated when transforming (`jit', `grad' or `vmap'-ing) a higher-order function of a parameterised function -- such as a loss function applied to a model. Overall Equinox resolves the above tension without introducing any new programmatic abstractions: only PyTrees and transformations, just as with regular JAX.

    "abstract": "Early identification and prevention of various plant diseases in commercial farms and orchards is a key feature of precision agriculture technology. This paper presents a high-performance real-time fine-grain object detection framework that addresses several obstacles in plant disease detection that hinder the performance of traditional methods, such as, dense distribution, irregular morphology, multi-scale object classes, textural similarity, etc. The proposed model is built on an improved version of the You Only Look Once (YOLOv4) algorithm. The modified network architecture maximizes both detection accuracy and speed by including the DenseNet in the back-bone to optimize feature transfer and reuse, two new residual blocks in the backbone and neck enhance feature extraction and reduce computing cost; the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) enhances receptive field, and a modified Path Aggregation Network (PANet) preserves fine-grain localized information and improve feature fusion. Additionally, the use of the Hard-Swish function as the primary activation improved the model's accuracy due to better nonlinear feature extraction. The proposed model is tested in detecting four different diseases in tomato plants under various challenging environments. The model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art detection models in detection accuracy and speed. At a detection rate of 70.19 FPS, the proposed model obtained a precision value of $90.33 \\%$, F1-score of $93.64 \\%$, and a mean average precision ($mAP$) value of $96.29 \\%$. Current work provides an effective and efficient method for detecting different plant diseases in complex scenarios that can be extended to different fruit and crop detection, generic disease detection, and various automated agricultural detection processes.

For example, the adversary can infer whether the client owns a specific data instance, which is called a passive membership inference attack. In this paper, we propose a new passive inference attack that requires much less computation power and memory than existing methods.

This novel approach enables us to accurately detect loops and estimate six degrees-of-freedom poses in the case of small overlaps. We compare our L3D-based loop closure approach with recent approaches on LiDAR data and achieve state-of-the-art loop closure detection accuracy.

    "abstract": "Homophily describes the phenomenon that similarity breeds connection, i.e., individuals tend to form ties with other people who are similar to themselves in some aspect(s). The similarity in music taste can undoubtedly influence who we make friends with and shape our social circles. In this paper, we study homophily in an online music platform Last.fm regarding user preferences towards listening to mainstream (M), novel (N), or diverse (D) content. Furthermore, we draw comparisons with homophily based on listening profiles derived from artists users have listened to in the past, i.e., artist profiles. Finally, we explore the utility of users' artist profiles as well as features describing M, N, and D for the task of link prediction. Our study reveals that: (i) users with a friendship connection share similar music taste based on their artist profiles; (ii) on average, a measure of how diverse is the music two users listen to is a stronger predictor of friendship than measures of their preferences towards mainstream or novel content, i.e., homophily is stronger for D than for M and N; (iii) some user groups such as high-novelty-seekers (explorers) exhibit strong homophily, but lower than average artist profile similarity; (iv) using M, N and D achieves comparable results on link prediction accuracy compared with using artist profiles, but the combination of features yields the best accuracy results, and (v) using combined features does not add value if graph-based features such as common neighbors are available, making M, N, and D features primarily useful in a cold-start user recommendation setting for users with few friendship connections.

    "abstract": "Due to a large amount of information, it is difficult for users to find what they are interested in among the many choices. In order to improve users' experience, recommendation systems have been widely used in music recommendations, movie recommendations, online shopping, and other scenarios. Recently, Knowledge Graph (KG) has been proven to be an effective tool to improve the performance of recommendation systems. However, a huge challenge in applying knowledge graphs for recommendation is how to use knowledge graphs to obtain better user codes and item codes. In response to this problem, this research proposes a user Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder and item encoder recommendation algorithm based on Knowledge Graph (URIR). This study encodes items by capturing high-level neighbor information to generate items' representation vectors and applies an RNN and items' representation vectors to encode users to generate users' representation vectors, and then perform inner product operation on users' representation vectors and items' representation vectors to get probabilities of users interaction with items. Numerical experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that URIR is superior performance to state-of-the-art algorithms in indicators such as AUC, Precision, Recall, and MRR. This implies that URIR can effectively use knowledge graph to obtain better user codes and item codes, thereby obtaining better recommendation results. ",

In this study, we extend a deep learning (DL) model, which could predict the heave and surge motions of a floating semi-submersible 20 to 50 seconds ahead with good accuracy, to quantify its uncertainty of the predictive time series with the help of the dropout technique. By repeating the inference several times, it is found that the collection of the predictive time series is a Gaussian process (GP). The DL model with dropout learned a kernel inside, and the learning procedure was similar to GP regression. Adding noise into training data could help the model to learn more robust features from the training data, thereby leading to a better performance on test data with a wide noise level range.

We argue that the Lorentz symmetries and curved space-time can emerge from the interplay between stochastic entropy production and entropy destruction due to learning. We show that the non-equilibrium dynamics of non-trainable variables can be described by the geodesic equation (in the emergent space-time) for localized states of neurons, and by the Einstein equations (with cosmological constant) for the entire network. We conclude that the quantum description of trainable variables and the gravitational description of non-trainable variables are dual in the sense that they provide alternative macroscopic descriptions of the same learning system, defined microscopically as a neural network.

We present two novel methods of automatically detecting anomalous transient light curves in real-time. Both methods are based on the simple idea that if the light curves from a known population of transients can be accurately modelled, any deviations from model predictions are likely anomalies. The first modelling approach is a probabilistic neural network built using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) and the second is an interpretable Bayesian parametric model of a transient. We demonstrate our methods' ability to provide anomaly scores as a function of time on light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We show that the flexibility of neural networks, the attribute that makes them such a powerful tool for many regression tasks, is what makes them less suitable for anomaly detection when compared with our parametric model. The parametric model is able to identify anomalies with respect to common supernova classes with low false anomaly rates and high true anomaly rates achieving Area Under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) scores above 0.8 for most rare classes such as kilonovae, tidal disruption events, intermediate luminosity transients, and pair-instability supernovae. Our ability to identify anomalies improves over the lifetime of the light curves. Our framework, used in conjunction with transient classifiers, will enable fast and prioritised follow-up of unusual transients from new large-scale surveys. ",

Usual scanning techniques employ single-shot multi-slice sequences where anatomical information in different slices may be subject to different deformations, contrast variations or artifacts. Volumetric reconstruction formulations have been proposed to correct for these factors, but they must accommodate a non-homogeneous and non-isotropic sampling, so regularization becomes necessary. Thus, in this paper we propose a deep generative prior for robust volumetric reconstructions integrated with a diffeomorphic volume to slice registration method. Experiments are performed to validate our contributions and compare with a state of the art method in a cohort of $72$ fetal datasets in the range of $20-36$ weeks gestational age. Results suggest improved image resolution and more accurate prediction of gestational age at scan when comparing to a state of the art reconstruction method. In addition, gestational age prediction results from our volumetric reconstructions compare favourably with existing brain-based approaches, with boosted accuracy when integrating information of organs other than the brain. Namely, a mean absolute error of $0.618$ weeks ($R^2=0.958$) is achieved when combining fetal brain and trunk information. ",

We extended this approach and analyzed different machine learning methods (ridge regression, random forests and support vector machines)for reverse regression in multi-trait GWAS, using genotypes, gene expression data and ground-truth transcriptional regulatory networks from the DREAM5 SysGen Challenge and from a cross between two yeast strains to evaluate methods. We found that genotype prediction performance, in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), allowed to distinguish between genomic regions with high and low transcriptional activity. Moreover, model feature coefficients correlated with the strength of association between variants and individual traits, and were predictive of true trans-eQTL target genes, with complementary findings across methods.

    "abstract": "A continuous-time quantum walk on a graph evolves according to the unitary operator $e^{-iAt}$, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix of the graph. Perfect state transfer (PST) in a quantum walk is the transfer of a quantum state from one node of a graph to another node with $100\\%$ fidelity. It can be shown that the adjacency matrix of a cubelike graph is a finite sum of tensor products of Pauli $X$ operators. We use this fact to construct an efficient quantum circuit for the quantum walk on cubelike graphs. In \\cite{Cao2021, rishi2021(2)}, a characterization of integer weighted cubelike graphs is given that exhibit periodicity or PST at time $t=\\pi/2$. We use our circuits to demonstrate PST or periodicity in these graphs on IBM's quantum computing platform~\\cite{Qiskit, IBM2021}. ",

    "abstract": "Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is essential in experimental fluid dynamics. In the current work, we propose a new velocity field estimation paradigm, which achieves a synergetic combination of the deep learning method and the traditional cross-correlation method. Specifically, the deep learning method is used to optimize and correct a coarse velocity guess to achieve a super-resolution calculation. And the cross-correlation method provides the initial velocity field based on a coarse correlation with a large interrogation window. As a reference, the coarse velocity guess helps with improving the robustness of the proposed algorithm. This fully convolutional network with embedded cross-correlation is named as CC-FCN. CC-FCN has two types of input layers, one is for the particle images, and the other is for the initial velocity field calculated using cross-correlation with a coarse resolution. Firstly, two pyramidal modules extract features of particle images and initial velocity field respectively. Then the fusion module appropriately fuses these features. Finally, CC-FCN achieves the super-resolution calculation through a series of deconvolution layers to obtain the single-pixel velocity field. As the supervised learning strategy is considered, synthetic data sets including ground-truth fluid motions are generated to train the network parameters. Synthetic and real experimental PIV data sets are used to test the trained neural network in terms of accuracy, precision, spatial resolution and robustness. The test results show that these attributes of CC-FCN are further improved compared with those of other tested PIV algorithms. The proposed model could therefore provide competitive and robust estimations for PIV experiments. ",

    "abstract": "The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) is both a widely used metric and loss function for biomedical image segmentation due to its robustness to class imbalance. However, it is well known that the DSC loss is poorly calibrated, resulting in overconfident predictions that cannot be usefully interpreted in biomedical and clinical practice. Performance is often the only metric used to evaluate segmentations produced by deep neural networks, and calibration is often neglected. However, calibration is important for translation into biomedical and clinical practice, providing crucial contextual information to model predictions for interpretation by scientists and clinicians. In this study, we identify poor calibration as an emerging challenge of deep learning based biomedical image segmentation. We provide a simple yet effective extension of the DSC loss, named the DSC++ loss, that selectively modulates the penalty associated with overconfident, incorrect predictions. As a standalone loss function, the DSC++ loss achieves significantly improved calibration over the conventional DSC loss across five well-validated open-source biomedical imaging datasets. Similarly, we observe significantly improved when integrating the DSC++ loss into four DSC-based loss functions. Finally, we use softmax thresholding to illustrate that well calibrated outputs enable tailoring of precision-recall bias, an important post-processing technique to adapt the model predictions to suit the biomedical or clinical task. The DSC++ loss overcomes the major limitation of the DSC, providing a suitable loss function for training deep learning segmentation models for use in biomedical and clinical practice. ",

In this article, we propose an efficient method to learn linear non-Gaussian DAG in high dimensional cases, where the noises can be of any continuous non-Gaussian distribution. This is in sharp contrast to most existing DAG learning methods assuming Gaussian noise with additional variance assumptions to attain exact DAG recovery. The proposed method leverages a novel concept of topological layer to facilitate the DAG learning. Particularly, we show that the topological layers can be exactly reconstructed in a bottom-up fashion, and the parent-child relations among nodes in each layer can also be consistently established. More importantly, the proposed method does not require the faithfulness or parental faithfulness assumption which has been widely assumed in the literature of DAG learning. Its advantage is also supported by the numerical comparison against some popular competitors in various simulated examples as well as a real application on the global spread of COVID-19. ",

Following the works of Pennington et al., such Jacobians are modeled using free multiplicative convolutions from Free Probability Theory. We present a reliable and very fast method for computing the associated spectral densities. This method has a controlled and proven convergence. Our technique is based on an adaptative Newton-Raphson scheme, by finding and chaining basins of attraction: the Newton algorithm finds contiguous lilypad-like basins and steps from one to the next, heading towards the objective. We demonstrate the applicability of our method by using it to assess how the learning process is affected by network depth, layer widths and initialization choices: empirically, final test losses are very correlated to our Free Probability metrics.
