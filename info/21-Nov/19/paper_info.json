    "abstract": "Since BERT appeared, Transformer language models and transfer learning have become state-of-the-art for Natural Language Understanding tasks. Recently, some works geared towards pre-training, specially-crafted models for particular domains, such as scientific papers, medical documents, and others. In this work, we present RoBERTuito, a pre-trained language model for user-generated content in Spanish. We trained RoBERTuito on 500 million tweets in Spanish. Experiments on a benchmark of 4 tasks involving user-generated text showed that RoBERTuito outperformed other pre-trained language models for Spanish. In order to help further research, we make RoBERTuito publicly available at the HuggingFace model hub. ",

The first scheme takes advantage of some solution (or soliton equation) information to study the data-driven BT of sine-Gordon equation, and complex and real Miura transforms between the defocusing (focusing) mKdV equation and KdV equation, as well as the data-driven mKdV equation discovery via the Miura transforms. The second deep learning scheme uses the explicit/implicit BTs generating the higher-order solitons to train the data-driven discovery of mKdV and sine-Gordon equations, in which the high-order solution informations are more powerful for the enhanced leaning soliton equations with higher accurates.

    "title": "Deep neural networks-based denoising models for CT imaging and their  efficacy",
    "abstract": "Most of the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) based CT image denoising literature shows that DNNs outperform traditional iterative methods in terms of metrics such as the RMSE, the PSNR and the SSIM. In many instances, using the same metrics, the DNN results from low-dose inputs are also shown to be comparable to their high-dose counterparts. However, these metrics do not reveal if the DNN results preserve the visibility of subtle lesions or if they alter the CT image properties such as the noise texture. Accordingly, in this work, we seek to examine the image quality of the DNN results from a holistic viewpoint for low-dose CT image denoising. First, we build a library of advanced DNN denoising architectures. This library is comprised of denoising architectures such as the DnCNN, U-Net, Red-Net, GAN, etc. Next, each network is modeled, as well as trained, such that it yields its best performance in terms of the PSNR and SSIM. As such, data inputs (e.g. training patch-size, reconstruction kernel) and numeric-optimizer inputs (e.g. minibatch size, learning rate, loss function) are accordingly tuned. Finally, outputs from thus trained networks are further subjected to a series of CT bench testing metrics such as the contrast-dependent MTF, the NPS and the HU accuracy. These metrics are employed to perform a more nuanced study of the resolution of the DNN outputs' low-contrast features, their noise textures, and their CT number accuracy to better understand the impact each DNN algorithm has on these underlying attributes of image quality.

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) experience catastrophic forgetting (CF) during sequential learning. In contrast, the brain can learn continuously without any signs of catastrophic forgetting. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are the next generation of ANNs with many features borrowed from biological neural networks. Thus, SNNs potentially promise better resilience to CF. In this paper, we study the susceptibility of SNNs to CF and test several biologically inspired methods for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. SNNs are trained with biologically plausible local training rules based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Local training prohibits the direct use of CF prevention methods based on gradients of a global loss function. We developed and tested the method to determine the importance of synapses (weights) based on stochastic Langevin dynamics without the need for the gradients. Several other methods of catastrophic forgetting prevention adapted from analog neural networks were tested as well. The experiments were performed on freely available datasets in the SpykeTorch environment. ",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of microbial genomes from large metagenomic datasets is a critical procedure for finding uncultivated microbial populations and defining their microbial functional roles. To achieve that, we need to perform metagenomic binning, clustering the assembled contigs into draft genomes. Despite the existing computational tools, most of them neglect one important property of the metagenomic data, that is, the noise. To further improve the metagenomic binning step and reconstruct better metagenomes, we propose a deep Contrastive Learning framework for Metagenome Binning (CLMB), which can efficiently eliminate the disturbance of noise and produce more stable and robust results. Essentially, instead of denoising the data explicitly, we add simulated noise to the training data and force the deep learning model to produce similar and stable representations for both the noise-free data and the distorted data. Consequently, the trained model will be robust to noise and handle it implicitly during usage. CLMB outperforms the previous state-of-the-art binning methods significantly, recovering the most near-complete genomes on almost all the benchmarking datasets (up to 17\\% more reconstructed genomes compared to the second-best method). It also improves the performance of bin refinement, reconstructing 8-22 more high-quality genomes and 15-32 more middle-quality genomes than the second-best result. Impressively, in addition to being compatible with the binning refiner, single CLMB even recovers on average 15 more HQ genomes than the refiner of VAMB and Maxbin on the benchmarking datasets. CLMB is open-source and available at https://github.com/zpf0117b/CLMB/. ",

Here we propose a non-imaging based authentication scheme for optical PUFs materialized by random scattering media, in which the characteristic fingerprints of optical PUFs are extracted from stochastical fluctuations of the scattered light intensity with respect to laser challenges which are detected by a single-pixel detector. The randomness, uniqueness, unpredictability, and robustness of the extracted fingerprints are validated to be qualified for real authentication applications. By increasing the key length and improving the signal to noise ratio, the false accept rate of a fake PUF can be dramatically lowered to the order of 10^-28. In comparison to the conventional laser-speckle-imaging based authentication with unique identity information obtained from textures of laser speckle patterns, this non-imaging scheme can be implemented at small speckle size bellowing the Nyquist--Shannon sampling criterion of the commonly used CCD or CMOS cameras, offering benefits in system miniaturization and immunity against reverse engineering attacks simultaneously.

We present the approach, explain how it is founded on information theoretical principles, present detailed analysis steps and show the quantitative results of applying this model to a large benchmark of diverse commercial software applications. We demonstrate that our metric for language conciseness is strongly correlated with both an alternative analytical approach, and with a large scale developer survey, and show how its results can be applied to improve software metrics for multi-language applications.

    "abstract": "Reinforced concrete buildings are commonly used around the world. With recent earthquakes worldwide, rapid structural damage inspection and repair cost evaluation are crucial for building owners and policy makers to make informed risk management decisions. To improve the efficiency of such inspection, advanced computer vision techniques based on convolution neural networks have been adopted in recent research to rapidly quantify the damage state of structures. In this paper, an advanced object detection neural network, named YOLO-v2, is implemented which achieves 98.2% and 84.5% average precision in training and testing, respectively. The proposed YOLO-v2 is used in combination with the classification neural network, which improves the identification accuracy for critical damage state of reinforced concrete structures by 7.5%. The improved classification procedures allow engineers to rapidly and more accurately quantify the damage states of the structure, and also localize the critical damage features. The identified damage state can then be integrated with the state-of-the-art performance evaluation framework to quantify the financial losses of critical reinforced concrete buildings. The results can be used by the building owners and decision makers to make informed risk management decisions immediately after the strong earthquake shaking. Hence, resources can be allocated rapidly to improve the resiliency of the community. ",

Numerical results demonstrate that DNN-QST exhibits a great potential to achieve high fidelity for quantum state tomography with limited measurement resources and can achieve improved estimation when tomographic measurements suffer from noise. In addition, the results for 2-qubit states from quantum optical devices demonstrate the generalization of DNN-QST and its robustness against possible error in the experimental devices ",

Specifically, a simple adversarial attack method is proposed for holding the state of an individual's opinions closer to the target state in the voter model dynamics; the method shows that even when one opinion is the majority, the vote outcome can be inverted (i.e., the outcome can lean toward the other opinion) by adding extremely small (hard-to-detect) perturbations strategically generated in social networks. Adversarial attacks are relatively more effective for complex (large and dense) networks. The results indicate that opinion dynamics can be unknowingly distorted. ",

In this study, we try to draw parallels between a related optimization problem called point set registration. A graph can be represented as a point set in enough dimensions using a simplex embedding and sampling. Given two graphs, the isomorphism of them corresponds to the existence of a perfect registration between the point set forms of the graphs. In the case of non-isomorphism, the point set form optimization result can be used as a distance measure between two graphs having the same number of vertices and edges. The related idea of equivalence classes suggests that graph canonization may be an important tool in tackling graph isomorphism problem and an orthogonal transformation invariant feature extraction based on this high dimensional point set representation may be fruitful. The concepts presented can also be extended to automorphism, and subgraph isomorphism problems and can also be applied on hypergraphs with certain modifications. ",
