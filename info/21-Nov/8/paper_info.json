    "abstract": "Reconstructing missing information in epidemic spreading on contact networks can be essential in prevention and containment strategies. For instance, identifying and warning infective but asymptomatic individuals (e.g., manual contact tracing) helped contain outbreaks in the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of possible epidemic cascades typically grows exponentially with the number of individuals involved. The challenge posed by inference problems in the epidemics processes originates from the difficulty of identifying the almost negligible subset of those compatible with the evidence (for instance, medical tests). Here we present a new generative neural networks framework that can sample the most probable infection cascades compatible with observations. Moreover, the framework can infer the parameters governing the spreading of infections. The proposed method obtains better or comparable results with existing methods on the patient zero problem, risk assessment, and inference of infectious parameters in synthetic and real case scenarios like spreading infections in workplaces and hospitals.

    "abstract": "In this work, we evaluate theoretical results on the feasibility of, the worst-case impact of, and defense mechanisms against a stealthy sensor attack in an experimental setup. We demonstrate that for a controller with stable dynamics the stealthy sensor attack is possible to conduct and the theoretical worst-case impact is close to the achieved practical one. However, although the attack should theoretically be possible when the controller has integral action, we show that the integral action slows the attacker down and the attacker is not able to remain stealthy if it has not perfect knowledge of the controller state. In addition to that, we investigate the effect of different anomaly detectors on the attack impact and conclude that the impact under detectors with internal dynamics is smaller. Finally, we use noise injection into the controller dynamics to unveil the otherwise stealthy attacks. ",

    "title": "Control of a fly-mimicking flyer in complex flow using deep  reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "An integrated framework of computational fluid-structural dynamics (CFD-CSD) and deep reinforcement learning (deep-RL) is developed for control of a fly-scale flexible-winged flyer in complex flow. Dynamics of the flyer in complex flow is highly unsteady and nonlinear, which makes modeling the dynamics challenging. Thus, conventional control methodologies, where the dynamics is modeled, are insufficient for regulating such complicated dynamics. Therefore, in the present study, the integrated framework, in which the whole governing equations for fluid and structure are solved, is proposed to generate a control policy for the flyer. For the deep-RL to successfully learn the control policy, accurate and ample data of the dynamics are required. However, satisfying both the quality and quantity of the data on the intricate dynamics is extremely difficult since, in general, more accurate data are more costly. In the present study, two strategies are proposed to deal with the dilemma. To obtain accurate data, the CFD-CSD is adopted for precisely predicting the dynamics. To gain ample data, a novel data reproduction method is devised, where the obtained data are replicated for various situations while conserving the dynamics. With those data, the framework learns the control policy in various flow conditions and the learned policy is shown to have remarkable performance in controlling the flyer in complex flow fields. ",

    "title": "A practical analysis of ROP attacks",
    "abstract": "Control Flow Hijacking attacks have posed a serious threat to the security of applications for a long time where an attacker can damage the control Flow Integrity of the program and execute arbitrary code. These attacks can be performed by injecting code in the program's memory or reusing already existing code in the program (also known as Code-Reuse Attacks). Code-Reuse Attacks in the form of Return-into-libc Attacks or Return-Oriented Programming Attacks are said to be Turing Complete, providing a guarantee that there will always exist code segments (also called ROP gadgets) within a binary allowing an attacker to perform any kind of function by building a suitable ROP chain (chain of ROP gadgets). Our goal is to study different techniques of performing ROP Attacks and find the difficulties encountered to perform such attacks. For this purpose, we have designed an automated tool which works on 64-bit systems and generates a ROP chain from ROP gadgets to execute arbitrary system calls. ",

    "title": "Community detection in censored hypergraph",
    "abstract": "Community detection refers to the problem of clustering the nodes of a network (either graph or hypergrah) into groups. Various algorithms are available for community detection and all these methods apply to uncensored networks. In practice, a network may has censored (or missing) values and it is shown that censored values have non-negligible effect on the structural properties of a network. In this paper, we study community detection in censored $m$-uniform hypergraph from information-theoretic point of view. We derive the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery of the community structure. Besides, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to exactly recover the community structure up to the threshold. The proposed algorithm consists of a spectral algorithm plus a refinement step. It is also interesting to study whether a single spectral algorithm without refinement achieves the threshold. To this end, we also explore the semi-definite relaxation algorithm and analyze its performance. ",

    "title": "A bone suppression model ensemble to improve COVID-19 detection in chest  X-rays",
    "abstract": "Chest X-ray (CXR) is a widely performed radiology examination that helps to detect abnormalities in the tissues and organs in the thoracic cavity. Detecting pulmonary abnormalities like COVID-19 may become difficult due to that they are obscured by the presence of bony structures like the ribs and the clavicles, thereby resulting in screening/diagnostic misinterpretations. Automated bone suppression methods would help suppress these bony structures and increase soft tissue visibility. In this study, we propose to build an ensemble of convolutional neural network models to suppress bones in frontal CXRs, improve classification performance, and reduce interpretation errors related to COVID-19 detection. The ensemble is constructed by (i) measuring the multi-scale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM) score between the sub-blocks of the bone-suppressed image predicted by each of the top-3 performing bone-suppression models and the corresponding sub-blocks of its respective ground truth soft-tissue image, and (ii) performing a majority voting of the MS-SSIM score computed in each sub-block to identify the sub-block with the maximum MS-SSIM score and use it in constructing the final bone-suppressed image. We empirically determine the sub-block size that delivers superior bone suppression performance. It is observed that the bone suppression model ensemble outperformed the individual models in terms of MS-SSIM and other metrics. A CXR modality-specific classification model is retrained and evaluated on the non-bone-suppressed and bone-suppressed images to classify them as showing normal lungs or other COVID-19-like manifestations. We observed that the bone-suppressed model training significantly outperformed the model trained on non-bone-suppressed images toward detecting COVID-19 manifestations. ",
