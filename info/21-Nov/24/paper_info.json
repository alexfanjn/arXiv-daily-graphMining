    "title": "Simultaneous face detection and 360 degree headpose estimation",
    "abstract": "With many practical applications in human life, including manufacturing surveillance cameras, analyzing and processing customer behavior, many researchers are noticing face detection and head pose estimation on digital images. A large number of proposed deep learning models have state-of-the-art accuracy such as YOLO, SSD, MTCNN, solving the problem of face detection or HopeNet, FSA-Net, RankPose model used for head pose estimation problem. According to many state-of-the-art methods, the pipeline of this task consists of two parts, from face detection to head pose estimation. These two steps are completely independent and do not share information. This makes the model clear in setup but does not leverage most of the featured resources extracted in each model. In this paper, we proposed the Multitask-Net model with the motivation to leverage the features extracted from the face detection model, sharing them with the head pose estimation branch to improve accuracy. Also, with the variety of data, the Euler angle domain representing the face is large, our model can predict with results in the 360 Euler angle domain. Applying the multitask learning method, the Multitask-Net model can simultaneously predict the position and direction of the human head. To increase the ability to predict the head direction of the model, we change there presentation of the human face from the Euler angle to vectors of the Rotation matrix. ",

    "abstract": "As solar capacity installed worldwide continues to grow, there is an increasing awareness that advanced inspection systems are becoming of utmost importance to schedule smart interventions and minimize downtime likelihood. In this work we propose a novel automatic multi-stage model to detect panel defects on aerial images captured by unmanned aerial vehicle by using the YOLOv3 network and Computer Vision techniques. The model combines detections of panels and defects to refine its accuracy. The main novelties are represented by its versatility to process either thermographic or visible images and detect a large variety of defects and its portability to both rooftop and ground-mounted PV systems and different panel types. The proposed model has been validated on two big PV plants in the south of Italy with an outstanding AP@0.5 exceeding 98% for panel detection, a remarkable AP@0.4 (AP@0.5) of roughly 88.3% (66.95%) for hotspots by means of infrared thermography and a mAP@0.5 of almost 70% in the visible spectrum for detection of anomalies including panel shading induced by soiling and bird dropping, delamination, presence of puddles and raised rooftop panels. An estimation of the soiling coverage is also predicted. Finally an analysis of the influence of the different YOLOv3's output scales on the detection is discussed. ",

    "title": "Uncertainty estimation under model misspecification in neural network  regression",
    "abstract": "Although neural networks are powerful function approximators, the underlying modelling assumptions ultimately define the likelihood and thus the hypothesis class they are parameterizing. In classification, these assumptions are minimal as the commonly employed softmax is capable of representing any categorical distribution. In regression, however, restrictive assumptions on the type of continuous distribution to be realized are typically placed, like the dominant choice of training via mean-squared error and its underlying Gaussianity assumption. Recently, modelling advances allow to be agnostic to the type of continuous distribution to be modelled, granting regression the flexibility of classification models. While past studies stress the benefit of such flexible regression models in terms of performance, here we study the effect of the model choice on uncertainty estimation. We highlight that under model misspecification, aleatoric uncertainty is not properly captured, and that a Bayesian treatment of a misspecified model leads to unreliable epistemic uncertainty estimates. Overall, our study provides an overview on how modelling choices in regression may influence uncertainty estimation and thus any downstream decision making process. ",

    "title": "Techno-economic analysis of Power-to-Gas plants in a gas and electricity  distribution network system with high renewable energy penetration",
    "abstract": "Distributed generation, based on the exploitation of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), has increased in the last few decades to limit anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, and this trend will increase in the future. However, RES generation is not dispatchable, and an increasing share of RES may lead to inefficiencies and even problems for the electricity network. Flexible resources are needed to handle RES generation in order to support the delicate electricity generation and demand balance. Energy conversion technologies (P2X, Power to X) allow the flexibility of energy systems to be increased. These technologies make a connection between different energy sectors (e.g., electricity and gas) possible, and thus create new synergies within an overall multi energy system. This paper analyzes how the P2G technology can be used at the distribution network level (both gas and electricity) to optimize the use of RES. In fact, in order to coordinate P2X resources, it is necessary to take into account the whole multi energy scenario, and not just the electrical side: it therefore becomes fundamental to recognize the pros and cons that Balancing Service Providers (BSPs), composed of a number of P2G plants (representing the Balancing Responsible Providers, BRPs), may have when offering services to an electricity network. Moreover, the convenience of the decarbonization of the gas grid has been evaluated through the calculation of the levelized cost of Synthetic Natural Gas (LCSNG) for cost scenarios for the years 2030 and 2050, considering different assumptions about the cost of the surplus utilization of RES. The results show that LCSNG may vary from 47 to 319 EURO/MWh, according to the different configurations, i.e., only in the best case scenario is the SNG cost comparable with the cost of natural gas, and hence does the P2G technology result to be profitable ",

    "abstract": "Reaching consensus (a macroscopic state where almost all the system constituents display the same microscopic state) is a necessity in multiple complex socio-technical and econo-technical systems. In many distributed systems (of which blockchain-based applications are just the last example), the process of consensus formation is crucial not only for the emergence of a leading majority but for the very system to function. Inspired on this application, but with a broader applicability, we build a minimalistic network model of consensus formation for quantifying how central nodes - with respect to their average distance to others - can leverage on their position to obtain competitive advantage in the consensus process. We show that in a wide range of network topologies, the probability of forming a majority can significantly increase depending on the centrality of nodes that initiate the spreading. Further, we study the role that network topology plays on the consensus process: we show that central nodes in scale-free networks can win consensus in the network even if they broadcast states significantly later than peripheral ones.

    "abstract": "Inference in deep Bayesian neural networks is only fully understood in the infinite-width limit, where the posterior flexibility afforded by increased depth washes out and the posterior predictive collapses to a shallow Gaussian process. Here, we interpret finite deep linear Bayesian neural networks as data-dependent scale mixtures of Gaussian process predictors across output channels. We leverage this observation to study representation learning in these networks, allowing us to connect limiting results obtained in previous studies within a unified framework. In total, these results advance our analytical understanding of how depth affects inference in a simple class of Bayesian neural networks. ",

    "abstract": "With the growing popularity and ease of access to the internet, the problem of online rumors is escalating. People are relying on social media to gain information readily but fall prey to false information. There is a lack of credibility assessment techniques for online posts to identify rumors as soon as they arrive. Existing studies have formulated several mechanisms to combat online rumors by developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The literature so far provides supervised frameworks for rumor classification that rely on huge training datasets. However, in the online scenario where supervised learning is exigent, dynamic rumor identification becomes difficult. Early detection of online rumors is a challenging task, and studies relating to them are relatively few. It is the need of the hour to identify rumors as soon as they appear online. This work proposes a novel framework for unsupervised rumor detection that relies on an online post's content and social features using state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed architecture outperforms several existing baselines and performs better than several supervised techniques. The proposed method, being lightweight, simple, and robust, offers the suitability of being adopted as a tool for online rumor identification. ",

    "abstract": "Synchronization is critical for system level behaviour in physical, chemical, biological and social systems. Empirical evidence has shown that the network topology strongly impacts the synchronizablity of the system, and the analysis of their relationship remains an open challenge. We know that the eigenvalue distribution determines a network's synchronizability, but analytical expressions that connect network topology and all relevant eigenvalues (e.g., the extreme values) remain elusive. Here, we accurately determine its synchronizability by proposing an analytical method to estimate the extreme eigenvalues using perturbation theory. Our analytical method exposes the role global and local topology combine to influence synchronizability. We show that the smallest non-zero eigenvalue which determines synchronizability is estimated by the smallest degree augmented by the inverse degree difference in the least connected nodes. From this, we can conclude that there exists a clear negative relationship between the smallest non-zero eigenvalue and the local assortativity of nodes with smallest degree values. We validate the accuracy of our framework within the setting of a Scale-free (SF) network and can be driven by commonly used ODEs (e.g., 3-dimensional Rosler or Lorenz dynamics). From the results, we demonstrate that the synchronizability of the network can be tuned by rewiring the connections of these particular nodes while maintaining the general degree profile of the network.

Further, we propose adaptive Test-Time Training (TTT) based on uncertainty estimations in order to enhance the generalizability of the inertial odometry to various unseen data. We show in experiments that the Rotation-equivariance-supervised Inertial Odometry (RIO) trained with 30% data achieves on par performance with a model trained with the whole database. Adaptive TTT improves models performance in all cases and makes more than 25% improvements under several scenarios. ",

A recently introduced degree-preserving network growth (DPG) family of models preserves node degree, resulting in structures significantly different from and more diverse than previous models (Nature Physics 2021, DOI:10.1038/s41567-021-01417-7). Here we present a rigorous mathematical theory underlying the DPG family of network growth models. We prove that the general problem of deciding whether a simple graph can be obtained via the DPG process from a small \"kernel\" graph (DPG feasibility) is NP-complete, in contrast with the surprising numerical observation that most real-world networks are actually easily constructible by this process; a dichotomy that still needs to be understood. We demonstrate how some of the well-known network models can be constructed via the DPG process, using proper parametrization. ",
