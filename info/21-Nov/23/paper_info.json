    "abstract": "The phase-field fracture free-energy functional is non-convex with respect to the displacement and the phase field. This results in a poor performance of the conventional monolithic solvers like the Newton-Raphson method. In order to circumvent this issue, researchers opt for the alternate minimization (staggered) solvers. Staggered solvers are robust for the phase-field based fracture simulations as the displacement and the phase-field sub-problems are convex in nature. Nevertheless, the staggered solver requires very large number of iterations (of the order of thousands) to converge. In this work, a robust monolithic solver is presented for the phase-field fracture problem. The solver adopts a fracture energy-based arc-length method and an adaptive under-relaxation scheme. The arc-length method enables the simulation to overcome critical points (snap-back, snap-through instabilities) during the loading of a specimen. The use of an under-relaxation scheme stabilizes the solver by preventing the divergence due to an ill-behaving stiffness matrix. The efficiency of the proposed solver is further amplified with an adaptive mesh refinement scheme based on PHT-splines within the framework of isogeometric analysis. The numerical examples presented in the manuscript demonstrates the efficacy of the solver. All the codes and data-sets accompanying this work will be made available on GitHub (https://github.com/rbharali/IGAFrac). ",

The method defines criteria for selecting valid secondary positions, and then estimates which points from the original point cloud would be acquired by a scanner from these positions. We validate the method using synthetic scenes, and examine how the similarity of generated point clouds depends on scanner distance, occlusion, and angular resolution. We show that the method is more accurate at short distances, and that having a high scanner resolution for the original point clouds has a strong impact on the similarity of generated point clouds. We also demonstrate how the method can be applied to natural scene statistics: in particular, we apply our method to reposition the scanner horizontally and vertically, separately consider points belonging to the ground and to non-ground objects, and describe the impact on the distributions of distances to these two classes of points.

In recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINN) have emerged as a novel method for solving differential equations. PINN method has the advantage of being meshless, scalable, and can potentially be intelligent in terms of transferring the knowledge learned from solving one differential equation to the other. The exploration in this field has majorly been limited to solving linear-elasticity problems, crack propagation problems. This study uses PINNs to solve coupled thermo-mechanics problems of materials with functionally graded properties. An in-depth analysis of the PINN framework has been carried out by understanding the training datasets, model architecture, and loss functions. The efficacy of the PINN models in solving thermo-mechanics differential equations has been measured by comparing the obtained solutions either with analytical solutions or finite element method-based solutions. While R2 score of more than 99% has been achieved in predicting primary variables such as displacement and temperature fields, achieving the same for secondary variables such as stress turns out to be more challenging. This study is the first to implement the PINN framework for solving coupled thermo-mechanics problems on composite materials. This study is expected to enhance the understanding of the novel PINN framework and will be seminal for further research on PINNs. ",

We review state-of-the-art algorithms for each category and discuss the essential differences between these algorithms.

    "abstract": "Deep neural network based medical image systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Many defense mechanisms have been proposed in the literature, however, the existing defenses assume a passive attacker who knows little about the defense system and does not change the attack strategy according to the defense. Recent works have shown that a strong adaptive attack, where an attacker is assumed to have full knowledge about the defense system, can easily bypass the existing defenses. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial example defense system called Medical Aegis. To the best of our knowledge, Medical Aegis is the first defense in the literature that successfully addresses the strong adaptive adversarial example attacks to medical images. Medical Aegis boasts two-tier protectors: The first tier of Cushion weakens the adversarial manipulation capability of an attack by removing its high-frequency components, yet posing a minimal effect on classification performance of the original image; the second tier of Shield learns a set of per-class DNN models to predict the logits of the protected model. Deviation from the Shield's prediction indicates adversarial examples. Shield is inspired by the observations in our stress tests that there exist robust trails in the shallow layers of a DNN model, which the adaptive attacks can hardly destruct. Experimental results show that the proposed defense accurately detects adaptive attacks, with negligible overhead for model inference. ",

In particular, such problems may feature large differences in length scales, causing difficulties with meshing and preconditioning. These difficulties are increased if the region of localized dynamics changes in time. Overlapping domain decomposition methods, which split the problem at the continuous level, show promise due to their ease of implementation and computational efficiency. Accordingly, the present work aims to further develop the mathematical theory of such methods at both the continuous and discrete levels. For the continuous formulation of the problem, we provide a full convergence analysis. For the discrete problem, we show how the described method may be interpreted as a Gauss-Seidel scheme or as a Neumann series approximation, establishing a convergence criterion in terms of the spectral radius of the system. We then provide a spectral scaling argument and provide numerical evidence for its justification. ",

Humans often use background information as contextual cues for their visual system. Yet, regarding face-based systems, the background is often discarded, since face presentation attack detection (PAD) models are mostly trained with face crops. This work presents a comparative study of face PAD models (including multi-task learning, adversarial training and dynamic frame selection) in two settings: with and without crops. The results show that the performance is consistently better when the background is present in the images. The proposed multi-task methodology beats the state-of-the-art results on the ROSE-Youtu dataset by a large margin with an equal error rate of 0.2%. Furthermore, we analyze the models' predictions with Grad-CAM++ with the aim to investigate to what extent the models focus on background elements that are known to be useful for human inspection. From this analysis we can conclude that the background cues are not relevant across all the attacks. Thus, showing the capability of the model to leverage the background information only when necessary. ",

In this context, multiple distinct and incompatible languages can emerge. When an agent encounters a speaker of an alternative language, there is a requirement for a period of adaptation before they can efficiently converse. This adaptation results in the emergence of a new language and the forgetting of the previous language. In principle, this is an example of the Catastrophic Forgetting problem which can be mitigated by enabling the agents to learn and maintain multiple languages. We take inspiration from the Continual Learning literature and equip our agents with multi-headed neural networks which enable our agents to be multi-lingual. Our method is empirically validated within a referential MNIST based communication game and is shown to be able to maintain multiple languages where existing approaches cannot. ",

In this study, we propose a hypothesis testing framework that assesses how locally vertices are connected to each other along a specified vertex sequence, which provides a statistical foundation for an optimization problem called envelope reduction. The proposed tests are formulated based on a combinatorial approach and a block model with intrinsic vertex ordering.

Hence, the authors propose a novel graph-based framework SOcial graph with Multi-head attention and Publisher information and news Statistics Network (SOMPS-Net) comprising of two components - Social Interaction Graph (SIG) and Publisher and News Statistics (PNS). The posited model is experimented on the HealthStory dataset and generalizes across diverse medical topics including Cancer, Alzheimer's, Obstetrics, and Nutrition. SOMPS-Net significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art graph-based models experimented on HealthStory by 17.1%. Further, experiments on early detection demonstrated that SOMPS-Net predicted fake news articles with 79% certainty within just 8 hours of its broadcast.

It also makes the interpretation of observations of lines formed in the chromosphere and transition region a slow and computationally costly process, which limits the inference of the physical properties on rather small fields of view. Having access to a fast way of computing the deviation from the LTE regime through the departure coefficients could largely alleviate this problem. Aims: We propose to build and train a graph network that quickly predicts the atomic level populations without solving the non-LTE problem. Methods: We find an optimal architecture for the graph network for predicting the departure coefficients of the levels of an atom from the physical conditions of a model atmosphere. A suitable dataset with a representative sample of potential model atmospheres is used for training. This dataset has been computed using existing non-LTE synthesis codes. Results: The graph network has been integrated into existing synthesis and inversion codes for the particular case of \\caii. We demonstrate orders of magnitude gain in computing speed. We analyze the generalization capabilities of the graph network and demonstrate that it produces good predicted departure coefficients for unseen models. We implement this approach in \\hazel\\ and show how the inversions nicely compare with those obtained with standard non-LTE inversion codes. Our approximate method opens up the possibility of extracting physical information from the chromosphere on large fields-of-view with time evolution. This allows us to understand better this region of the Sun, where large spatial and temporal scales are crucial. ",

Efforts have been made to automate the detection and segmentation of polyps, a precancerous precursor, to effectively minimize missed rate. Widely used computer-aided polyp segmentation systems actuated by encoder-decoder have achieved high performance in terms of accuracy. However, polyp segmentation datasets collected from varied centers can follow different imaging protocols leading to difference in data distribution. As a result, most methods suffer from performance drop and require re-training for each specific dataset. We address this generalizability issue by proposing a global multi-scale residual fusion network (GMSRF-Net). Our proposed network maintains high-resolution representations while performing multi-scale fusion operations for all resolution scales. To further leverage scale information, we design cross multi-scale attention (CMSA) and multi-scale feature selection (MSFS) modules within the GMSRF-Net. The repeated fusion operations gated by CMSA and MSFS demonstrate improved generalizability of the network. Experiments conducted on two different polyp segmentation datasets show that our proposed GMSRF-Net outperforms the previous top-performing state-of-the-art method by 8.34% and 10.31% on unseen CVC-ClinicDB and unseen Kvasir-SEG, in terms of dice coefficient.
