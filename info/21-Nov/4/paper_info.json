    "title": "Game Theory in defence applications: a review",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a succinct review of attempts in the literature to use game theory to model decision making scenarios relevant to defence applications. Game theory has been proven as a very effective tool in modelling decision making processes of intelligent agents, entities, and players. It has been used to model scenarios from diverse fields such as economics, evolutionary biology, and computer science. In defence applications, there is often a need to model and predict actions of hostile actors, and players who try to evade or out-smart each other. Modelling how the actions of competitive players shape the decision making of each other is the forte of game theory. In past decades, there have been several studies which applied different branches of game theory to model a range of defence-related scenarios. This paper provides a structured review of such attempts, and classifies existing literature in terms of the kind of warfare modelled, the types of game used, and the players involved. The presented analysis provides a concise summary about the state-of-the-art with regards to the use of game theory in defence applications, and highlights the benefits and limitations of game theory in the considered scenarios.

    "title": "A dataset for multi-sensor drone detection",
    "abstract": "The use of small and remotely controlled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, has increased in recent years. This goes in parallel with misuse episodes, with an evident threat to the safety of people or facilities. As a result, the detection of UAV has also emerged as a research topic. Most studies on drone detection fail to specify the type of acquisition device, the drone type, the detection range, or the dataset. The lack of proper UAV detection studies employing thermal infrared cameras is also an issue, despite its success with other targets. Besides, we have not found any previous study that addresses the detection task as a function of distance to the target. Sensor fusion is indicated as an open research issue as well, although research in this direction is scarce too. To counteract the mentioned issues and allow fundamental studies with a common public benchmark, we contribute with an annotated multi-sensor database for drone detection that includes infrared and visible videos and audio files. The database includes three different drones, of different sizes and other flying objects that can be mistakenly detected as drones, such as birds, airplanes or helicopters. In addition to using several different sensors, the number of classes is higher than in previous studies. To allow studies as a function of the sensor-to-target distance, the dataset is divided into three categories (Close, Medium, Distant) according to the industry-standard Detect, Recognize and Identify (DRI) requirements, built on the Johnson criteria. Given that the drones must be flown within visual range due to regulations, the largest sensor-to-target distance for a drone is 200 m, and acquisitions are made in daylight. The data has been obtained at three airports in Sweden: Halmstad Airport (IATA code: HAD/ICAO code: ESMT), Gothenburg City Airport (GSE/ESGP) and Malm\\\"o Airport (MMX/ESMS). ",

The system is tested on a highly challenging database comprising over 10,500 real and fake images acquired with five sensors of different technologies and covering a wide range of direct attack scenarios in terms of materials and procedures followed to generate the gummy fingers. The proposed solution proves to be robust to the multi-scenario dataset, and presents an overall rate of 90% correctly classified samples. Furthermore, the liveness detection method presented has the added advantage over previously studied techniques of needing just one image from a finger to decide whether it is real or fake. This last characteristic provides the method with very valuable features as it makes it less intrusive, more user friendly, faster and reduces its implementation costs. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, robots could be seen as potential resources in tasks like helping people work remotely, sustaining social distancing, and improving mental or physical health. To enhance human-robot interaction, it is essential for robots to become more socialised, via processing multiple social cues in a complex real-world environment. Our study adopted a neurorobotic paradigm of gaze-triggered audio-visual crossmodal integration to make an iCub robot express human-like social attention responses. At first, a behavioural experiment was conducted on 37 human participants. To improve ecological validity, a round-table meeting scenario with three masked animated avatars was designed with the middle one capable of performing gaze shift, and the other two capable of generating sound. The gaze direction and the sound location are either congruent or incongruent. Masks were used to cover all facial visual cues other than the avatars' eyes. We observed that the avatar's gaze could trigger crossmodal social attention with better human performance in the audio-visual congruent condition than in the incongruent condition. Then, our computational model, GASP, was trained to implement social cue detection, audio-visual saliency prediction, and selective attention. After finishing the model training, the iCub robot was exposed to similar laboratory conditions as human participants, demonstrating that it can replicate similar attention responses as humans regarding the congruency and incongruency performance, while overall the human performance was still superior. Therefore, this interdisciplinary work provides new insights on mechanisms of crossmodal social attention and how it can be modelled in robots in a complex environment. ",

    "abstract": "Development of deep learning techniques to analyse image data is an expansive and emerging field. The benefits of tracking, identifying, measuring, and sorting features of interest from image data has endless applications for saving cost, time, and improving safety. Much research has been conducted on classifying cracks from image data using deep convolutional neural networks; however, minimal research has been conducted to study the efficacy of network performance when noisy images are used. This paper will address the problem and is dedicated to investigating the influence of image noise on network accuracy. The methods used incorporate a benchmark image data set, which is purposely deteriorated with two types of noise, followed by treatment with image enhancement pre-processing techniques. These images, including their native counterparts, are then used to train and validate two different networks to study the differences in accuracy and performance. Results from this research reveal that noisy images have a moderate to high impact on the network's capability to accurately classify images despite the application of image pre-processing. A new index has been developed for finding the most efficient method for classification in terms of computation timing and accuracy. Consequently, AlexNet was selected as the most efficient model based on the proposed index. ",

    "title": "A cross-modal fusion network based on self-attention and residual  structure for multimodal emotion recognition",
    "abstract": "The audio-video based multimodal emotion recognition has attracted a lot of attention due to its robust performance. Most of the existing methods focus on proposing different cross-modal fusion strategies. However, these strategies introduce redundancy in the features of different modalities without fully considering the complementary properties between modal information, and these approaches do not guarantee the non-loss of original semantic information during intra- and inter-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal fusion network based on self-attention and residual structure (CFN-SR) for multimodal emotion recognition. Firstly, we perform representation learning for audio and video modalities to obtain the semantic features of the two modalities by efficient ResNeXt and 1D CNN, respectively. Secondly, we feed the features of the two modalities into the cross-modal blocks separately to ensure efficient complementarity and completeness of information through the self-attention mechanism and residual structure. Finally, we obtain the output of emotions by splicing the obtained fused representation with the original representation. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on the RAVDESS dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed CFN-SR achieves the state-of-the-art and obtains 75.76% accuracy with 26.30M parameters. Our code is available at https://github.com/skeletonNN/CFN-SR.

    "abstract": "The continuous electrification of the mobility and heating sector will introduce new challenges to distribution grid operation. Uncoordinated activation of flexible units, e.g. simultaneous charging of electric vehicles as a reaction to price signals, could systematically trigger transformer or line protections. Real-time identification of such fast-ramped flexibility activations would allow taking counteractions to avoid potential social and financial cost. In this work, a novel data processing pipeline for identification of fast-ramped flexibility activation events is proposed. The pipeline combines techniques for unsupervised event detection and open-set classification. The systematic evaluation on real load data demonstrates that main building blocks of the proposed pipeline can be realized with methods that fulfill important requirements for an application in a distributed event detection architecture. For the detection of flexibility activation events an upper performance limit is identified. Moreover, it is demonstrated that application of an open-set classifier for classification of flexibility activation events can improve the performance compared to widely-applied closed-set classifiers.

The scenario under study involves the optimal allocation and migration of time-sensitive computing tasks in a resource-constrained internet of vehicles (IoV) context. This is achieved by tackling, as a main objective, the minimization of the carbon footprint of the edge network, whilst delivering adequate quality of service (QoS) to the end users (e.g., meeting task execution deadlines). EASE integrates a i) centralized optimization step, solved through model predictive control (MPC), to manage the renewable energy that is locally collected at the edge servers and their local computing resources, estimating their future availability, and ii) a distributed consensus step, solved via dual ascent in closed form, to reach agreement on service migrations. EASE is compared with existing strategies that always and never migrate the computing tasks. Quantitative results demonstrate the greater energy efficiency achieved by EASE, which often gets close to complete carbon neutrality, while also improving the QoS. ",

Data-driven controller design is commented, focusing on the Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) algorithms. The estimation of the $\\mathcal{H}_{\\infty}$ norm of $S(z)$ via impulse response is presented. Two illustrative real-world based examples, regarding a Boost-like second order plant and a SEPIC-like fourth order plant, are tested for all commented swarm intelligence algorithms with the proposed method. Each algorithm at each case was run for 50 times, with 100 search agents, and maximum number of iterations limited to 100. For both examples, I-GWO presented the the best desired behavior, with the least number of outliers and no bad outlier in terms of fitness and $||S(z)||_{\\infty}$ norm, as well as faster convergence, lowering the $||S(z)||_{\\infty}$ norm of the plant from values greater than 2.0 to 1.8, still maintaining a low fitness value.

We describe a solver for multiscale fully nonlinear elliptic equations that makes use of domain decomposition, an accelerated Schwarz framework, and two-layer neural networks to approximate the boundary-to-boundary map for the subdomains, which is the key step in the Schwarz procedure. Conventionally, the boundary-to-boundary map requires solution of boundary-value elliptic problems on each subdomain. By leveraging the compressibility of multiscale problems, our approach trains the neural network offline to serve as a surrogate for the usual implementation of the boundary-to-boundary map. Our method is applied to a multiscale semilinear elliptic equation and a multiscale $p$-Laplace equation. In both cases we demonstrate significant improvement in efficiency as well as good accuracy and generalization performance. ",

    "abstract": "A key task in the study of networked systems is to derive local and global properties that impact connectivity, synchronizability, and robustness. Computing shortest paths or geodesics in the network yields measures of node centrality and network connectivity that can contribute to explain such phenomena. We derive an analytic distribution of shortest path lengths, on the giant component in the supercritical regime or on small components in the subcritical regime, of any sparse (possibly directed) graph with conditionally independent edges, in the infinite-size limit. We provide specific results for widely used network families like stochastic block models, dot-product graphs, random geometric graphs, and graphons. The survival function of the shortest path length distribution possesses a simple closed-form lower bound which is asymptotically tight for finite lengths, has a natural interpretation of traversing independent geodesics in the network, and delivers novel insight in the above network families. Notably, the shortest path length distribution allows us to derive, for the network families above, important graph properties like the bond percolation threshold, size of the giant component, average shortest path length, and closeness and betweenness centralities. We also provide a corroborative analysis of a set of 20 empirical networks. This unifying framework demonstrates how geodesic statistics for a rich family of random graphs can be computed cheaply without having access to true or simulated networks, especially when they are sparse but prohibitively large.

Feature-based SR (SF), which uses a neural network as a function approximation to learn SR, seems more plausible neurobiological model. However, it is not well known how different methods of weight (W) initialization affect SF learning. In this study, SF learners were exposed to simple maze environments to analyze SF learning efficiency and W patterns pattern changes. Three kinds of W initialization pattern were used: identity matrix, zero matrix, and small random matrix. The SF learner initiated with random weight matrix showed better performance than other three RL agents. We will discuss the neurobiological meaning of SF weight matrix.

Using a network science approach, multimodal transport systems can be described as multilayer networks, where the networks associated to different transport modes are not considered in isolation, but as a set of interconnected layers. Despite the importance of multimodality in modern cities, a unified view of the topic is currently missing. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging research areas of multilayer transport networks and multimodal urban mobility, focusing on contributions from the interdisciplinary fields of complex systems, urban data science, and science of cities. First, we present an introduction to the mathematical framework of multilayer networks. We apply it to survey models of multimodal infrastructures, as well as measures used for quantifying multimodality, and related empirical findings. We review modelling approaches and observational evidence in multimodal mobility and public transport system dynamics, focusing on integrated real-world mobility patterns, where individuals navigate urban systems using different transport modes. We then provide a survey of freely available datasets on multimodal infrastructure and mobility, and a list of open source tools for their analyses.

Leveraging on recent results characterizing the set of aggregate demand profiles of a heterogeneous fleet of charging (or, respectively, discharging) devices we propose a way to achieve optimality, in a unit commitment problem, by adopting a simplified formulation with a number of constraints for the fleet that scales linearly in the number of time-slots considered and is independent of the size of the fleet. This is remarkable, as it shows that, under suitable conditions, a heterogeneous fleet of any size can effectively be treated as a single storage unit. ",
