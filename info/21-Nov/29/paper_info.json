    "abstract": "We propose a method by which to recover an underlying graph from a set of multivariate wave signals that is discretely sampled from a solution of the graph wave equation. Herein, the graph wave equation is defined with the graph Laplacian, and its solution is explicitly given as a mode expansion of the Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. For graph recovery, our idea is to extract modes corresponding to the square root of the eigenvalues from the discrete wave signals using the DMD method, and then to reconstruct the graph (Laplacian) from the eigenfunctions obtained as amplitudes of the modes. Moreover, in order to estimate modes more precisely, we modify the DMD method under an assumption that only stationary modes exist, because graph wave functions always satisfy this assumption. In conclusion, we demonstrate the proposed method on the wave signals over a path graph. Since our graph recovery procedure can be applied to non-wave signals, we also check its performance on human joint sensor time-series data. ",

    "abstract": "We present the first learning-based framework for category-level 3D object detection and implicit shape estimation based on a pair of stereo RGB images in the wild. Traditional stereo 3D object detection approaches describe the detected objects only with 3D bounding boxes and cannot infer their full surface geometry, which makes creating a realistic outdoor immersive experience difficult. In contrast, we propose a new model S-3D-RCNN that can perform precise localization as well as provide a complete and resolution-agnostic shape description for the detected objects. We first decouple the estimation of object coordinate systems from shape reconstruction using a global-local framework. We then propose a new instance-level network that addresses the unseen surface hallucination problem by extracting point-based representations from stereo region-of-interests, and infers implicit shape codes with predicted complete surface geometry. Extensive experiments validate our approach's superior performance using existing and new metrics on the KITTI benchmark. Code and pre-trained models will be available at this https URL. ",

    "abstract": "Obtaining per-beat information is a key task in the analysis of cardiac electrocardiograms (ECG), as many downstream diagnosis tasks are dependent on ECG-based measurements. Those measurements, however, are costly to produce, especially in recordings that change throughout long periods of time. However, existing annotated databases for ECG delineation are small, being insufficient in size and in the array of pathological conditions they represent. This article delves has two main contributions. First, a pseudo-synthetic data generation algorithm was developed, based in probabilistically composing ECG traces given \"pools\" of fundamental segments, as cropped from the original databases, and a set of rules for their arrangement into coherent synthetic traces. The generation of conditions is controlled by imposing expert knowledge on the generated trace, which increases the input variability for training the model. Second, two novel segmentation-based loss functions have been developed, which attempt at enforcing the prediction of an exact number of independent structures and at producing closer segmentation boundaries by focusing on a reduced number of samples. The best performing model obtained an $F_1$-score of 99.38\\% and a delineation error of $2.19 \\pm 17.73$ ms and $4.45 \\pm 18.32$ ms for all wave's fiducials (onsets and offsets, respectively), as averaged across the P, QRS and T waves for three distinct freely available databases. The excellent results were obtained despite the heterogeneous characteristics of the tested databases, in terms of lead configurations (Holter, 12-lead), sampling frequencies ($250$, $500$ and $2,000$ Hz) and represented pathophysiologies (e.g., different types of arrhythmias, sinus rhythm with structural heart disease), hinting at its generalization capabilities, while outperforming current state-of-the-art delineation approaches.

Moreover, for Goppa codes, our proof extends to the non-binary case as well, thus providing an algebraic explanation for the distinguisher which was missing up to now. All the upper bounds are tight and match experimental evidence. Our work also introduces new algebraic results about products of trace codes in general and of dual of alternant and Goppa codes in particular, clarifying their square code structure.

Therefore, we propose an efficient network comparison method based on network embedding, i.e., \\textit{DeepWalk}, which considers the global structural information. In detail, we calculate the distance between nodes through the vector extracted by \\textit{DeepWalk} and quantify the network dissimilarity by spectral entropy based Jensen-Shannon divergences of the distribution of the node distances. Experiments on both synthetic and empirical data show that our method outperforms the baseline methods and can distinguish networks perfectly by only using the global embedding based distance distribution. In addition, we show that our method can capture network properties, e.g., average shortest path length and link density. Moreover, the experiments of modularity further implies the functionality of our method. ",

Equivariances are common in scientific models, however integrating them directly into expressive inference networks (such as normalizing flows) is not straightforward. We here describe an alternative method to incorporate equivariances under joint transformations of parameters and data. Our method -- called group equivariant neural posterior estimation (GNPE) -- is based on self-consistently standardizing the \"pose\" of the data while estimating the posterior over parameters. It is architecture-independent, and applies both to exact and approximate equivariances. As a real-world application, we use GNPE for amortized inference of astrophysical binary black hole systems from gravitational-wave observations.

    "abstract": "Many tasks in deep learning involve optimizing over the \\emph{inputs} to a network to minimize or maximize some objective; examples include optimization over latent spaces in a generative model to match a target image, or adversarially perturbing an input to worsen classifier performance. Performing such optimization, however, is traditionally quite costly, as it involves a complete forward and backward pass through the network for each gradient step. In a separate line of work, a recent thread of research has developed the deep equilibrium (DEQ) model, a class of models that foregoes traditional network depth and instead computes the output of a network by finding the fixed point of a single nonlinear layer. In this paper, we show that there is a natural synergy between these two settings. Although, naively using DEQs for these optimization problems is expensive (owing to the time needed to compute a fixed point for each gradient step), we can leverage the fact that gradient-based optimization can \\emph{itself} be cast as a fixed point iteration to substantially improve the overall speed. That is, we \\emph{simultaneously} both solve for the DEQ fixed point \\emph{and} optimize over network inputs, all within a single ``augmented'' DEQ model that jointly encodes both the original network and the optimization process. Indeed, the procedure is fast enough that it allows us to efficiently \\emph{train} DEQ models for tasks traditionally relying on an ``inner'' optimization loop. We demonstrate this strategy on various tasks such as training generative models while optimizing over latent codes, training models for inverse problems like denoising and inpainting, adversarial training and gradient based meta-learning.

Understanding the interaction patterns between a particular virus and human proteins plays a crucial role in unveiling the underlying mechanism of viral infection and pathogenesis. This could further help in the prevention and treatment of virus-related diseases. However, the task of predicting protein-protein interactions between a new virus and human cells is extremely challenging due to scarce data on virus-human interactions and fast mutation rates of most viruses. We developed a multitask transfer learning approach that exploits the information of around 24 million protein sequences and the interaction patterns from the human interactome to counter the problem of small training datasets. Instead of using hand-crafted protein features, we utilize statistically rich protein representations learned by a deep language modeling approach from a massive source of protein sequences. Additionally, we employ an additional objective which aims to maximize the probability of observing human protein-protein interactions. This additional task objective acts as a regularizer and also allows to incorporate domain knowledge to inform the virus-human protein-protein interaction prediction model. Our approach achieved competitive results on 13 benchmark datasets and the case study for the SAR-CoV-2 virus receptor. Experimental results show that our proposed model works effectively for both virus-human and bacteria-human protein-protein interaction prediction tasks.

Incorporating network data is traditionally made by hand-crafted feature engineering, and lately, the graph neural network has emerged as an alternative, but it still does not improve over the traditional method's performance. Here we introduce a framework to improve credit scoring models by blending several Graph Representation Learning methods: feature engineering, graph embeddings, and graph neural networks. We stacked their outputs to produce a single score in this approach. We validated this framework using a unique multi-source dataset that characterizes the relationships and credit history for the entire population of a Latin American country, applying it to credit risk models, application, and behavior, targeting both individuals and companies. Our results show that the graph representation learning methods should be used as complements, and these should not be seen as self-sufficient methods as is currently done. In terms of AUC and KS, we enhance the statistical performance, outperforming traditional methods. In Corporate lending, where the gain is much higher, it confirms that evaluating an unbanked company cannot solely consider its features. The business ecosystem where these firms interact with their owners, suppliers, customers, and other companies provides novel knowledge that enables financial institutions to enhance their creditworthiness assessment. Our results let us know when and which group to use graph data and what effects on performance to expect. They also show the enormous value of graph data on the unbanked credit scoring problem, principally to help companies' banking. ",

However, the computer-generated holograms (CGHs) used for such applications are typically generated by iterative algorithms, which demand high computation effort, limiting advanced applications like in vivo optogenetic stimulation and fiber-optic cell manipulation. The random and discrete distribution of the fiber cores induces strong spatial aliasing to the CGHs, hence, an approach that can rapidly generate tailored CGHs for MCFs is highly demanded. We demonstrate a novel phase encoder deep neural network (CoreNet), which can generate accurate tailored CGHs for MCFs at a near video-rate. Simulations show that CoreNet can speed up the computation time by two magnitudes and increase the fidelity of the generated light field compared to the conventional CGH techniques. For the first time, real-time generated tailored CGHs are on-the-fly loaded to the phase-only SLM for dynamic light fields generation through the MCF microendoscope in experiments. This paves the avenue for real-time cell rotation and several further applications that require real-time high-fidelity light delivery in biomedicine. ",

In many practical scenarios, lies often affect groups of receivers, which inevitably entangles the payoffs of individuals to the payoffs of other agents in their group, and this makes the formalism of pairwise sender-receiver games inapt for where it might be useful the most. We therefore introduce group interactions among receivers, and study how their interconnectedness in higher-order social networks affects the evolution of lying. We observe a number of counterintuitive results that are rooted in the complexity of the underlying evolutionary dynamics, which has thus far remained hidden in the realm of pairwise interactions. We find conditions for honesty to persist even when there is a temptation to lie, and we observe the prevalence of moral strategy profiles even when lies favor the receiver at a cost to the sender. We confirm the robustness of our results by further performing simulations on hypergraphs created from real-world data using the SocioPatterns database. Altogether, our results provide persuasive evidence that moral behaviour may evolve on higher-order social networks, at least as long as individuals interact in groups that are small compared to the size of the network.

Each iteration of the algorithm generates a trajectory from the starting point to the target equilibrium state by implementing a distributionally robust risk-constrained model predictive control (MPC) scheme. At each iteration, a set of safe states (that satisfy the risk-constraint with high probability) and a certain number of independent and identically distributed samples of the uncertainty governing the risk constraint are available. These states and samples are accumulated in previous iterations. The safe states are used as terminal constraint in the MPC scheme and samples are used to construct a set of distributions, termed ambiguity set, such that it contains the underlying distribution of the uncertainty with high probability. The risk-constraint in each iteration is required to hold for all distributions in the ambiguity set. We establish that the trajectories generated by our iterative procedure are feasible, safe, and converge asymptotically to the equilibrium. Simulation example illustrates our results for the case of finding a risk-constrained path for a mobile robot in the presence of an uncertain obstacle. ",

Complex black-box models are typically used for decision making to achieve high accuracy; however, as important as high accuracy, it is essential for engineers to understand how the model makes the decision and verify that the model is physically meaningful. With this motivation, this study proposes a glass-box (interpretable) classification model to predict the seismic failure mode of conventional reinforced concrete shear (structural) walls. Reported experimental damage information of 176 conventional shear walls tested under reverse cyclic loading were designated as class-types, whereas key design properties (e.g. compressive strength of concrete, axial load ratio, and web reinforcement ratio) of shear walls were used as the basic classification features. The trade-off between model complexity and model interpretability was discussed using eight Machine Learning (ML) methods. The results showed that the Decision Tree method was a more convenient classifier with higher interpretability with a high classification accuracy than its counterparts. Also, to enhance the practicality of the model, a feature reduction was conducted to reduce the complexity of the proposed classifier with higher classification performance, and the most relevant features were identified, namely: compressive strength of concrete, wall aspect ratio, transverse boundary, and web reinforcement ratio. The ability of the final DT model to predict the failure modes was validated with a classification rate of around 90%. The proposed model aims to provide engineers interpretable, robust, and rapid prediction in seismic performance assessment. ",
