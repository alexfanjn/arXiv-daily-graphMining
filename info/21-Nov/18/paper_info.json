    "abstract": "Transition phenomena between metastable states play an important role in complex systems due to noisy fluctuations. In this paper, the physics informed neural networks (PINNs) are presented to compute the most probable transition pathway. It is shown that the expected loss is bounded by the empirical loss. And the convergence result for the empirical loss is obtained. Then, a sampling method of rare events is presented to simulate the transition path by the Markovian bridge process. And we investigate the inverse problem to extract the stochastic differential equation from the most probable transition pathway data and the Markovian bridge process data, respectively. Finally, several numerical experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness of our methods. ",

    "title": "On the coalition number of graphs",
    "abstract": "Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V$. {Two disjoint sets $V_1, V_2 \\subseteq V$ form a coalition in $G$ if none of them is a dominating set of $G$ but their union $V_1\\cup V_2$ is. A vertex partition $\\Psi=\\{V_1,\\ldots, V_k\\}$ of $V$ is called a coalition partition of $G$ if every set~$V_i\\in \\Psi$ is either a dominating set of $G$ with the cardinality $|V_i|=1$, or is not a dominating set but for some $V_j\\in \\Psi$, $V_i$ and $V_j$ form a coalition.} The maximum cardinality of a coalition partition of $G$ is called the coalition number of $G$, denoted by $\\mathcal{C}(G)$. A $\\mathcal{C}(G)$-partition is a coalition partition of $G$ with cardinality $\\mathcal{C}(G)$. Given a coalition partition $\\Psi=\\{V_1, V_2,\\ldots, V_r\\}$ of~$G$, a coalition graph $CG(G, \\Psi)$ is associated on $\\Psi$ such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between its vertices and the members of $\\Psi$. Two vertices of $CG(G, \\Psi)$ are adjacent if and only if the corresponding sets form a coalition in $G$. In this paper, we first show that for any graph $G$ with $\\delta(G)=1$, $\\mathcal{C}(G)\\leq 2\\Delta(G)+2$, where $\\delta(G)$ and $\\Delta(G)$ are the minimum degree and the maximum degree of $G$, respectively. Moreover, we characterize all graphs~$G$ with $\\delta(G)\\leq 1$ and $\\mathcal{C}(G)=n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$. Furthermore, we characterize all trees $T$ with $\\mathcal{C}(T)=n$ and all trees $T$ with $\\mathcal{C}(T)=n-1$. This solves partially one of the open problem posed in~\\cite{coal0}. On the other hand, we theoretically and empirically determine the number of coalition graphs that can be defined by all coalition partitions of a given path $P_k$. Furthermore, we show that there is no universal coalition path, a path whose coalition partitions defines all possible coalition graphs. These solve two open problems posed by Haynes et al.~\\cite{coal1}. ",

    "title": "Image-based monitoring of bolt loosening through deep-learning-based  integrated detection and tracking",
    "abstract": "Structural bolts are critical components used in different structural elements, such as beam-column connections and friction damping devices. The clamping force in structural bolts is highly influenced by the bolt rotation. Much of the existing vision-based research about bolt rotation estimation relies on traditional computer vision algorithms such as Hough Transform to assess static images of bolts. This requires careful image preprocessing, and it may not perform well in the situation of complicated bolt assemblies, or in the presence of surrounding objects and background noise, thus hindering their real-world applications. In this study, an integrated real-time detect-track method, namely RTDT-Bolt, is proposed to monitor the bolt rotation angle. First, a real-time convolutional-neural-networks-based object detector, named YOLOv3-tiny, is established and trained to localize structural bolts. Then, the target-free object tracking algorithm based on optical flow is implemented, to continuously monitor and quantify the rotation of structural bolts. In order to enhance the tracking performance against background noise and potential illumination changes during tracking, the YOLOv3-tiny is integrated with the optical flow tracking algorithm to re-detect the bolts when the tracking gets lost. Extensive parameter studies were conducted to identify optimal tracking performance and examine the potential limitations. The results indicate the RTDT-Bolt method can greatly enhance the tracking performance of bolt rotation, which can achieve over 90% accuracy using the recommended range for the parameters. ",

    "abstract": "When an individual's behavior has rational characteristics, this may lead to irrational collective actions for the group. A wide range of organisms from animals to humans often evolve the social attribute of cooperation to meet this challenge. Therefore, cooperation among individuals is of great significance for allowing social organisms to adapt to changes in the natural environment. Based on multi-agent reinforcement learning, we propose a new learning strategy for achieving coordination by incorporating a learning rate that can balance exploration and exploitation. We demonstrate that agents that use the simple strategy improve a relatively collective return in a decision task called the intertemporal social dilemma, where the conflict between the individual and the group is particularly sharp. We also explore the effects of the diversity of learning rates on the population of reinforcement learning agents and show that agents trained in heterogeneous populations develop particularly coordinated policies relative to those trained in homogeneous populations.

    "abstract": "An adapted deflation preconditioner is employed to accelerate the solution of linear systems resulting from the discretization of fracture mechanics problems with well-conditioned extended/generalized finite elements. The deflation space typically used for linear elasticity problems is enriched with additional vectors, accounting for the enrichment functions used, thus effectively removing low frequency components of the error. To further improve performance, deflation is combined, in a multiplicative way, with a block-Jacobi preconditioner, which removes high frequency components of the error as well as linear dependencies introduced by enrichment. The resulting scheme is tested on a series of non-planar crack propagation problems and compared to alternative linear solvers in terms of performance. ",

    "abstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has become a very active research area in the last few years. While significant progress has been made in image classification tasks, only a few AI methods are actually being deployed in hospitals. A major hurdle in actively using clinical AI models currently is the trustworthiness of these models. More often than not, these complex models are black boxes in which promising results are generated. However, when scrutinized, these models begin to reveal implicit biases during the decision making, such as detecting race and having bias towards ethnic groups and subpopulations. In our ongoing study, we develop a two-step adversarial debiasing approach with partial learning that can reduce the racial disparity while preserving the performance of the targeted task. The methodology has been evaluated on two independent medical image case-studies - chest X-ray and mammograms, and showed promises in bias reduction while preserving the targeted performance. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning method has attracted tremendous attention to handle fluid dynamics in recent years. However, the deep learning method requires much data to guarantee the generalization ability and the data of fluid dynamics are deficient. Recently, physics informed neural network (PINN) is popular to solve the fluid flow problems, which basic concept is to embed the governing equation and continuity equation into loss function, with the requirement of less dataset for obtaining a reliable neural network. In this paper, the mixed-variable PINN method, which convert the governing equation into continuum and constitutive formulations, is proposed to solve the fluid dynamics (flow past cylinder) without any labeled data. The initial/boundary conditions with penalty factors are also embedded into the loss function to become a well-imposed problem. The results show that mixed-variable PINN has better predictive ability to construct the flow field than traditional PINN scheme. Furthermore, the transfer learning method is adopted to is solve the fluid solutions with different Reynold numbers with less computational cost. The results also demonstrate that the transfer learning method can well simulate the different Reynolds number in a short time. ",
