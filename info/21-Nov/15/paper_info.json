    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach for predicting trust links between peers in social media, one that is grounded in the artificial intelligence area of multiagent trust modeling. In particular, we propose a data-driven multi-faceted trust modeling which incorporates many distinct features for a comprehensive analysis. We focus on demonstrating how clustering of similar users enables a critical new functionality: supporting more personalized, and thus more accurate predictions for users. Illustrated in a trust-aware item recommendation task, we evaluate the proposed framework in the context of a large Yelp dataset. We then discuss how improving the detection of trusted relationships in social media can assist in supporting online users in their battle against the spread of misinformation and rumours, within a social networking environment which has recently exploded in popularity. We conclude with a reflection on a particularly vulnerable user base, older adults, in order to illustrate the value of reasoning about groups of users, looking to some future directions for integrating known preferences with insights gained through data analysis.

    "abstract": "We present a moving target defense strategy to reduce the impact of stealthy sensor attacks on feedback systems. The defender periodically and randomly switches between thresholds from a discrete set to increase the uncertainty for the attacker and make stealthy attacks detectable. However, the defender does not know the exact goal of the attacker but only the prior of the possible attacker goals. Here, we model one period with a constant threshold as a Bayesian game and use the Bayesian Nash equilibrium to find the distribution for the choice of the threshold in that period, which takes the defender's uncertainty about the attacker into account. To obtain the equilibrium distribution, the defender minimizes its cost consisting of the cost for false alarms and the cost induced by the attack. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a moving target defense and formulate a linear program to determine the moving target defense. Furthermore, we present a closed-form solution for the special case when the defender knows the attacker's goals. The results are numerically evaluated on a four-tank process. ",

    "abstract": "Balancing social utility and equity in distributing limited vaccines represents a critical policy concern for protecting against the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. What is the nature of the trade-off between maximizing collective welfare and minimizing disparities between more and less privileged communities? To evaluate vaccination strategies, we propose a novel epidemic model that explicitly accounts for both demographic and mobility differences among communities and their association with heterogeneous COVID-19 risks, then calibrate it with large-scale data. Using this model, we find that social utility and equity can be simultaneously improved when vaccine access is prioritized for the most disadvantaged communities, which holds even when such communities manifest considerable vaccine reluctance. Nevertheless, equity among distinct demographic features are in tension due to their complex correlation in society. We design two behavior-and-demography-aware indices, community risk and societal harm, which capture the risks communities face and those they impose on society from not being vaccinated, to inform the design of comprehensive vaccine distribution strategies. Our study provides a framework for uniting utility and equity-based considerations in vaccine distribution, and sheds light on how to balance multiple ethical values in complex settings for epidemic control.

    "abstract": "Neural networks have proven to be remarkably successful for a wide range of complicated tasks, from image recognition and object detection to speech recognition and machine translation. One of their successes is the skill in prediction of future dynamics given a suitable training set of data. Previous studies have shown how Echo State Networks (ESNs), a subset of Recurrent Neural Networks, can successfully predict even chaotic systems for times longer than the Lyapunov time. This study shows that, remarkably, ESNs can successfully predict dynamical behavior that is qualitatively different from any behavior contained in the training set. Evidence is provided for a fluid dynamics problem where the flow can transition between laminar (ordered) and turbulent (disordered) regimes. Despite being trained on the turbulent regime only, ESNs are found to predict laminar behavior. Moreover, the statistics of turbulent-to-laminar and laminar-to-turbulent transitions are also predicted successfully, and the utility of ESNs in acting as an early-warning system for transition is discussed. These results are expected to be widely applicable to data-driven modelling of temporal behaviour in a range of physical, climate, biological, ecological and finance models characterized by the presence of tipping points and sudden transitions between several competing states.

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) fertiliser is routinely applied by farmers to increase crop yields. At present, farmers often over-apply N fertilizer in some locations or timepoints because they do not have high-resolution crop N status data. N-use efficiency can be low, with the remaining N lost to the environment, resulting in high production costs and environmental pollution. Accurate and timely estimation of N status in crops is crucial to improving cropping systems' economic and environmental sustainability. The conventional approaches based on tissue analysis in the laboratory for estimating N status in plants are time consuming and destructive. Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning have shown promise in addressing the aforementioned challenges in a non-destructive way. We propose a novel deep learning framework: a channel-spatial attention-based vision transformer (CSVT) for estimating crop N status from large images collected from a UAV in a wheat field. Unlike the existing works, the proposed CSVT introduces a Channel Attention Block (CAB) and a Spatial Interaction Block (SIB), which allows capturing nonlinear characteristics of spatial-wise and channel-wise features from UAV digital aerial imagery, for accurate N status prediction in wheat crops. Moreover, since acquiring labeled data is time consuming and costly, local-to-global self-supervised learning is introduced to pre-train the CSVT with extensive unlabelled data. The proposed CSVT has been compared with the state-of-the-art models, tested and validated on both testing and independent datasets. The proposed approach achieved high accuracy (0.96) with good generalizability and reproducibility for wheat N status estimation. ",

Partly for the simplicity's sake, many studies have focused on their projection onto their unipartite versions where one only needs to care about a single type of nodes. When it comes to mesoscale structures such as communities, however, it is ever more important to properly incorporate a priori structural restrictions such as bipartivity. In this paper, as a case study, we take the community structure of bipartite networks in various scales to examine the amount of information of bipartivity encoded in the community detection procedure. In particular, we report the robustness in reliability of detected community based on consistency by comparing the detection algorithm with or without the consideration of bipartivity. From the analysis with model networks embedding prescribed communities and real networks, we find that the community detection tailored to take the bipartivity into account clearly yields more robust community structures than the one without utilizing such structural information. Therefore, it demonstrates the necessity for customizing the community detection algorithm encoding whatever information known about networks of interest, and at the same time it raises an interesting question on the possibility of estimating the quantitative amount of information from such customization.

Existing sufficient conditions ensure that the same virus always wins regardless of initial states. For networks with an arbitrary but finite number of nodes, we present a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees local exponential stability of the two equilibria corresponding to each virus winning the battle. Thus, either of the viruses can win, depending on the initial states. We then prove that for almost any network layer of one virus, there exists a network layer for the other virus such that the resulting two-layer network satisfies the aforementioned condition. To operationalize our findings, a four-step procedure is developed to reliably and consistently design one of the network layers, when given the other layer. Numerical case studies illustrate the theoretical result and its practical consequences. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a universal framework for characterizing the statistical efficiency of a statistical estimation problem with differential privacy guarantees. Our framework, which we call High-dimensional Propose-Test-Release (HPTR), builds upon three crucial components: the exponential mechanism, robust statistics, and the Propose-Test-Release mechanism. Gluing all these together is the concept of resilience, which is central to robust statistical estimation. Resilience guides the design of the algorithm, the sensitivity analysis, and the success probability analysis of the test step in Propose-Test-Release. The key insight is that if we design an exponential mechanism that accesses the data only via one-dimensional robust statistics, then the resulting local sensitivity can be dramatically reduced. Using resilience, we can provide tight local sensitivity bounds. These tight bounds readily translate into near-optimal utility guarantees in several cases. We give a general recipe for applying HPTR to a given instance of a statistical estimation problem and demonstrate it on canonical problems of mean estimation, linear regression, covariance estimation, and principal component analysis. We introduce a general utility analysis technique that proves that HPTR nearly achieves the optimal sample complexity under several scenarios studied in the literature. ",

    "abstract": "Given a graph $G$ of degree $k$ over $n$ vertices, we consider the problem of computing a near maximum cut or a near minimum bisection in polynomial time. For graphs of girth $L$, we develop a local message passing algorithm whose complexity is $O(nkL)$, and that achieves near optimal cut values among all $L$-local algorithms. Focusing on max-cut, the algorithm constructs a cut of value $nk/4+ n\\mathsf{P}_\\star\\sqrt{k/4}+\\mathsf{err}(n,k,L)$, where $\\mathsf{P}_\\star\\approx 0.763166$ is the value of the Parisi formula from spin glass theory, and $\\mathsf{err}(n,k,L)=o_n(n)+no_k(\\sqrt{k})+n \\sqrt{k} o_L(1)$ (subscripts indicate the asymptotic variables). Our result generalizes to locally treelike graphs, i.e., graphs whose girth becomes $L$ after removing a small fraction of vertices. Earlier work established that, for random $k$-regular graphs, the typical max-cut value is $nk/4+ n\\mathsf{P}_\\star\\sqrt{k/4}+o_n(n)+no_k(\\sqrt{k})$. Therefore our algorithm is nearly optimal on such graphs. An immediate corollary of this result is that random regular graphs have nearly minimum max-cut, and nearly maximum min-bisection among all regular locally treelike graphs. This can be viewed as a combinatorial version of the near-Ramanujan property of random regular graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Transit timing variations (TTVs) can provide useful information for systems observed by transit, as they allow us to put constraints on the masses and eccentricities of the observed planets, or even to constrain the existence of non-transiting companions. However, TTVs can also act as a detection bias that can prevent the detection of small planets in transit surveys that would otherwise be detected by standard algorithms such as the Boxed Least Square algorithm (BLS) if their orbit was not perturbed. This bias is especially present for surveys with a long baseline, such as Kepler, some of the TESS sectors, and the upcoming PLATO mission. Here we introduce a detection method that is robust to large TTVs, and illustrate its use by recovering and confirming a pair of resonant super-Earths with ten-hour TTVs around Kepler-1705. The method is based on a neural network trained to recover the tracks of low-signal-to-noise-ratio(S/N) perturbed planets in river diagrams. We recover the transit parameters of these candidates by fitting the light curve. The individual transit S/N of Kepler-1705b and c are about three times lower than all the previously known planets with TTVs of 3 hours or more, pushing the boundaries in the recovery of these small, dynamically active planets. Recovering this type of object is essential for obtaining a complete picture of the observed planetary systems, and solving for a bias not often taken into account in statistical studies of exoplanet populations. In addition, TTVs are a means of obtaining mass estimates which can be essential for studying the internal structure of planets discovered by transit surveys. Finally, we show that due to the strong orbital perturbations, it is possible that the spin of the outer resonant planet of Kepler-1705 is trapped in a sub- or super-synchronous spin-orbit resonance.
