    "abstract": "We study convergence in networks of piecewise-smooth (PWS) systems that commonly arise in applications to model dynamical systems whose evolution is affected by macroscopic events such as switches and impacts. Existing approaches were typically oriented toward guaranteeing global bounded synchronizability, local stability of the synchronization manifold, or achieving synchronization by exerting a control action on each node. Here we start by generalizing existing results on QUAD systems to the case of PWS systems, accounting for a large variety of nonlinear coupling laws. Then, we propose that a discontinuous coupling can be used to guarantee global synchronizability of a network of N PWS agents under mild assumptions on the individual dynamics. We provide extensive numerical simulations to gain insights on larger networks. ",

    "title": "A robust collision source method for rank adaptive dynamical low-rank  approximation in radiation therapy",
    "abstract": "Deterministic models for radiation transport describe the density of radiation particles moving through a background material. In radiation therapy applications, the phase space of this density is composed of energy, spatial position and direction of flight. The resulting six-dimensional phase space prohibits fine numerical discretizations, which are essential for the construction of accurate and reliable treatment plans. In this work, we tackle the high dimensional phase space through a dynamical low-rank approximation of the particle density. Dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) evolves the solution on a low-rank manifold in time. Interpreting the energy variable as a pseudo-time lets us employ the DLRA framework to represent the solution of the radiation transport equation on a low-rank manifold for every energy. Stiff scattering terms are treated through an efficient implicit energy discretization and a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt the rank in energy. To facilitate the use of boundary conditions and reduce the overall rank, the radiation transport equation is split into collided and uncollided particles through a collision source method. Uncollided particles are described by a directed quadrature set guaranteeing low computational costs, whereas collided particles are represented by a low-rank solution. It can be shown that the presented method is L$^2$-stable under a time step restriction which does not depend on stiff scattering terms. Moreover, the implicit treatment of scattering does not require numerical inversions of matrices. Numerical results for radiation therapy configurations as well as the line source benchmark underline the efficiency of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "A common problem affecting neural network (NN) approximations of model predictive control (MPC) policies is the lack of analytical tools to assess the stability of the closed-loop system under the action of the NN-based controller. We present a general procedure to quantify the performance of such a controller, or to design minimum complexity NNs with rectified linear units (ReLUs) that preserve the desirable properties of a given MPC scheme. By quantifying the approximation error between NN-based and MPC-based state-to-input mappings, we first establish suitable conditions involving two key quantities, the worst-case error and the Lipschitz constant, guaranteeing the stability of the closed-loop system. We then develop an offline, mixed-integer optimization-based method to compute those quantities exactly. Together these techniques provide conditions sufficient to certify the stability and performance of a ReLU-based approximation of an MPC control law. ",

The element extraction method, which is currently the most robust method, is used in business software. However, in order to speed up extraction, the approach is done by finding the next element that optimizes a target function, which can result in local mesh of bad quality after many time steps. We provide TreeMesh, a method that uses this method in conjunction with reinforcement learning (also possible with supervised learning) and a novel Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) (Coulom(2006), Kocsis and Szepesv\\'ari(2006), Browne et~al.(2012)). The algorithm is based on a previously proposed approach (Pan et~al.(2021)). After making many improvements on DRL (algorithm, state-action-reward setting) and adding a MCTS, it outperforms the former work on the same boundary. Furthermore, using tree search, our program reveals much preponderance on seed-density-changing boundaries, which is common on thin-film materials. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new reachability analysis tool to compute an interval over-approximation of the output set of a feedforward neural network under given input uncertainty. The proposed approach adapts to neural networks an existing mixed-monotonicity method for the reachability analysis of dynamical systems and applies it to all possible partial networks within the given neural network. This ensures that the intersection of the obtained results is the tightest interval over-approximation of the output of each layer that can be obtained using mixed-monotonicity. Unlike other tools in the literature that focus on small classes of piecewise-affine or monotone activation functions, the main strength of our approach is its generality in the sense that it can handle neural networks with any Lipschitz-continuous activation function. In addition, the simplicity of the proposed framework allows users to very easily add unimplemented activation functions, by simply providing the function, its derivative and the global extrema and corresponding arguments of the derivative. Our algorithm is tested and compared to five other interval-based tools on 1000 randomly generated neural networks for four activation functions (ReLU, TanH, ELU, SiLU). We show that our tool always outperforms the Interval Bound Propagation method and that we obtain tighter output bounds than ReluVal, Neurify, VeriNet and CROWN (when they are applicable) in 15 to 60 percent of cases.

The k-domination problem with respect to this class of graphs can be used to model real-world facility location problem scenarios. For the classic minimum dominating set ($1$-domination) problem, all except one methods perform similarly, which is due to their equivalence in this particular case.

Using diagnostic linear readouts, we find that: (a) information about auxiliary variables increases across time in all network layers, (b) this information is indeed present in the recurrent information flow, and (c) its manipulation significantly affects task performance. These observations confirm the hypothesis that category-orthogonal auxiliary variable information is conveyed through recurrent connectivity and is used to optimize category inference in cluttered environments.

    "abstract": "Digital mammography is still the most common imaging tool for breast cancer screening. Although the benefits of using digital mammography for cancer screening outweigh the risks associated with the x-ray exposure, the radiation dose must be kept as low as possible while maintaining the diagnostic utility of the generated images, thus minimizing patient risks. Many studies investigated the feasibility of dose reduction by restoring low-dose images using deep neural networks. In these cases, choosing the appropriate training database and loss function is crucial and impacts the quality of the results. In this work, a modification of the ResNet architecture, with hierarchical skip connections, is proposed to restore low-dose digital mammography. We compared the restored images to the standard full-dose images. Moreover, we evaluated the performance of several loss functions for this task. For training purposes, we extracted 256,000 image patches from a dataset of 400 images of retrospective clinical mammography exams, where different dose levels were simulated to generate low and standard-dose pairs. To validate the network in a real scenario, a physical anthropomorphic breast phantom was used to acquire real low-dose and standard full-dose images in a commercially avaliable mammography system, which were then processed through our trained model. An analytical restoration model for low-dose digital mammography, previously presented, was used as a benchmark in this work. Objective assessment was performed through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and mean normalized squared error (MNSE), decomposed into residual noise and bias. Results showed that the perceptual loss function (PL4) is able to achieve virtually the same noise levels of a full-dose acquisition, while resulting in smaller signal bias compared to other loss functions.

    "abstract": "As cities struggle to adapt to more ``people-centered'' urbanism, transportation planning and engineering must innovate to expand the street network strategically in order to ensure efficiency but also to deter sprawl. Here, we conducted a study of over 200 cities around the world to understand the impact that the patterns of deceleration points in streets due to traffic signs has in trajectories done from motorized vehicles. We demonstrate that there is a ubiquitous nonlinear relationship between time and distance in the optimal trajectories within each city. More precisely, given a specific period of time $\\tau$, without any traffic, one can move on average up to the distance $\\left \\langle D \\right \\rangle \\sim\\tau^\\beta$. We found a super-linear relationship for almost all cities in which $\\beta>1.0$. This points to an efficiency of scale when traveling large distances, meaning the average speed will be higher for longer trips when compared to shorter trips. We demonstrate that this efficiency is a consequence of the spatial distribution of large segments of streets without deceleration points, favoring access to routes in which a vehicle can cross large distances without stops. These findings show that cities must consider how their street morphology can affect travel speed. ",

    "abstract": "The metric dimension dim(G) of a graph $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a subset $S$ of vertices of $G$ such that each vertex of $G$ is uniquely determined by its distances to $S$. It is well-known that the metric dimension of a graph can be drastically increased by the modification of a single edge. Our main result consists in proving that the increase of the metric dimension of an edge addition can be amortized in the sense that if the graph consists of a spanning tree $T$ plus $c$ edges, then the metric dimension of $G$ is at most the metric dimension of $T$ plus $6c$. We then use this result to prove a weakening of a conjecture of Eroh et al. The zero forcing number $Z(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a subset $S$ of black vertices (whereas the other vertices are colored white) of $G$ such that all the vertices will turned black after applying finitely many times the following rule: a white vertex is turned black if it is the only white neighbor of a black vertex. Eroh et al. conjectured that, for any graph $G$, $dim(G)\\leq Z(G) + c(G)$, where $c(G)$ is the number of edges that have to be removed from $G$ to get a forest. They proved the conjecture is true for trees and unicyclic graphs. We prove a weaker version of the conjecture: $dim(G)\\leq Z(G)+6c(G)$ holds for any graph. We also prove that the conjecture is true for graphs with edge disjoint cycles, widely generalizing the unicyclic result of Eroh et al. ",

Therefore, material researchers are often reluctant to easily disclose their private data, which leads to the problem of data island, and it is difficult to collect a large amount of data to train high-quality models. In this study, a material microstructure image feature extraction algorithm FedTransfer based on data privacy protection is proposed. The core contributions are as follows: 1) the federated learning algorithm is introduced into the polycrystalline microstructure image segmentation task to make full use of different user data to carry out machine learning, break the data island and improve the model generalization ability under the condition of ensuring the privacy and security of user data; 2) A data sharing strategy based on style transfer is proposed. By sharing style information of images that is not urgent for user confidentiality, it can reduce the performance penalty caused by the distribution difference of data among different users. ",
