    "title": "A hierarchical behavior prediction framework at signalized intersections",
    "abstract": "Road user behavior prediction is one of the most critical components in trajectory planning for autonomous driving, especially in urban scenarios involving traffic signals. In this paper, a hierarchical framework is proposed to predict vehicle behaviors at a signalized intersection, using the traffic signal information of the intersection. The framework is composed of two phases: a discrete intention prediction phase and a continuous trajectory prediction phase. In the discrete intention prediction phase, a Bayesian network is adopted to predict the vehicle's high-level intention, after that, maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning is utilized to learn the human driving model offline; during the online trajectory prediction phase, a driver characteristic is designed and updated to capture the different driving preferences between human drivers. We applied the proposed framework to one of the most challenging scenarios in autonomous driving: the yellow light running scenario. Numerical experiment results are presented in the later part of the paper which show the viability of the method. The accuracy of the Bayesian network for discrete intention prediction is 91.1%, and the prediction results are getting more and more accurate as the yellow time elapses. The average Euclidean distance error in continuous trajectory prediction is only 0.85 m in the yellow light running scenario. ",

    "abstract": "Community detection is a major issue in network analysis. This paper combines a socio-historical approach with an experimental reconstruction of programs to investigate the early automation of clique detection algorithms, which remains one of the unsolved NP-complete problems today. The research led by the archaeologist Jean-Claude Gardin from the 1950s on non-numerical information and graph analysis is retraced to demonstrate the early contributions of social sciences and humanities. The limited recognition and reception of Gardin's innovative computer application to the humanities are addressed through two factors, in addition to the effects of historiography and bibliographies on the recording, discoverability, and reuse of scientific productions: 1) funding policies, evidenced by the transfer of research effort on graph applications from temporary interdisciplinary spaces to disciplinary organizations related to the then-emerging field of computer science; and 2) the erratic careers of algorithms, in which efficiency, flaws, corrections, and authors' status, were determining factors.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated the efficacy of current state-of-the-art neural sentence embedding models for semantic similarity estimation of sentences from biomedical literature. We trained different neural embedding models on 1.7 million articles from the PubMed Open Access dataset, and evaluated them based on a biomedical benchmark set containing 100 sentence pairs annotated by human experts and a smaller contradiction subset derived from the original benchmark set. RESULTS: With a Pearson correlation of 0.819, our best unsupervised model based on the Paragraph Vector Distributed Memory algorithm outperforms previous state-of-the-art results achieved on the BIOSSES biomedical benchmark set. Moreover, our proposed supervised model that combines different string-based similarity metrics with a neural embedding model surpasses previous ontology-dependent supervised state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Pearson's r (r=0.871) on the biomedical benchmark set. In contrast to the promising results for the original benchmark, we found our best models' performance on the smaller contradiction subset to be poor. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we highlighted the value of neural network-based models for semantic similarity estimation in the biomedical domain by showing that they can keep up with and even surpass previous state-of-the-art approaches for semantic similarity estimation that depend on the availability of laboriously curated ontologies when evaluated on a biomedical benchmark set. Capturing contradictions and negations in biomedical sentences, however, emerged as an essential area for further work. ",

    "abstract": "The increase in people's use of mobile messaging services has led to the spread of social engineering attacks like phishing, considering that spam text is one of the main factors in the dissemination of phishing attacks to steal sensitive data such as credit cards and passwords. In addition, rumors and incorrect medical information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic are widely shared on social media leading to people's fear and confusion. Thus, filtering spam content is vital to reduce risks and threats. Previous studies relied on machine learning and deep learning approaches for spam classification, but these approaches have two limitations. Machine learning models require manual feature engineering, whereas deep neural networks require a high computational cost. This paper introduces a dynamic deep ensemble model for spam detection that adjusts its complexity and extracts features automatically. The proposed model utilizes convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction along with base classifiers such as random forests and extremely randomized trees for classifying texts into spam or legitimate ones. Moreover, the model employs ensemble learning procedures like boosting and bagging. As a result, the model achieved high precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy of 98.38%. ",

Our experiments show that with the existing algorithms there is a trade off between categorization and segmentation performance. We investigate the source of this conflict and conclude that the use of context building networks, albeit necessary for superior performance on categorization tasks, harms segmentation performance by causing a temporal shift on the learned representations. Aiming to bridge this gap, we take inspiration from the leading approach on segmentation, which simultaneously models the speech signal at the frame and phoneme level, and incorporate multi-level modelling into Aligned CPC (ACPC), a variation of CPC which exhibits the best performance on categorization tasks. Our multi-level ACPC (mACPC) improves in all categorization metrics and achieves state-of-the-art performance in word segmentation. ",

    "abstract": "The mean field (MF) theory of multilayer neural networks centers around a particular infinite-width scaling, where the learning dynamics is closely tracked by the MF limit. A random fluctuation around this infinite-width limit is expected from a large-width expansion to the next order. This fluctuation has been studied only in shallow networks, where previous works employ heavily technical notions or additional formulation ideas amenable only to that case. Treatment of the multilayer case has been missing, with the chief difficulty in finding a formulation that captures the stochastic dependency across not only time but also depth. In this work, we initiate the study of the fluctuation in the case of multilayer networks, at any network depth. Leveraging on the neuronal embedding framework recently introduced by Nguyen and Pham, we systematically derive a system of dynamical equations, called the second-order MF limit, that captures the limiting fluctuation distribution. We demonstrate through the framework the complex interaction among neurons in this second-order MF limit, the stochasticity with cross-layer dependency and the nonlinear time evolution inherent in the limiting fluctuation. A limit theorem is proven to relate quantitatively this limit to the fluctuation of large-width networks. We apply the result to show a stability property of gradient descent MF training: in the large-width regime, along the training trajectory, it progressively biases towards a solution with \"minimal fluctuation\" (in fact, vanishing fluctuation) in the learned output function, even after the network has been initialized at or has converged (sufficiently fast) to a global optimum. This extends a similar phenomenon previously shown only for shallow networks with a squared loss in the ERM setting, to multilayer networks with a loss function that is not necessarily convex in a more general setting.

Previous citizen science projects have been able to obtain large image datasets with linked geo-tracking information. As the number of international collaborators grows, the manual annotation by expert entomologists of the large amount of data gathered by these users becomes too time demanding and unscalable, posing a strong need for automated classification of mosquito species from images. We introduce the application of two Deep Convolutional Neural Networks in a comparative study to automate this classification task. We use the transfer learning principle to train two state-of-the-art architectures on the data provided by the Mosquito Alert project, obtaining testing accuracy of 94%. In addition, we applied explainable models based on the Grad-CAM algorithm to visualise the most discriminant regions of the classified images, which coincide with the white band stripes located at the legs, abdomen, and thorax of mosquitoes of the Aedes albopictus species. The model allows us to further analyse the classification errors. Visual Grad-CAM models show that they are linked to poor acquisition conditions and strong image occlusions. ",

One can interpret these measures as second-neighbor relations distinguished by the direction of the citation: BC is a similarity between two citing items, whereas CC is that between two cited items. A previous study proposed a two-layer node split network that can emulate clusters of coupling measures in a computationally efficient manner; however, the lack of intralayer links makes it impossible to obtain exact similarities. Here, we propose novel methods to estimate intralayer similarity on a node split network using personalized PageRank and neural embedding. We demonstrate that the proposed measures are strongly correlated with the coupling measures. Moreover, our proposed method can yield precise similarities between items even if they are distant from each other. We also show that many links with high similarity are missing in the original BC/CC network, which suggests that it is essential to consider long-range similarities. Comparative experiments on global and local edge sampling suggest that local sampling is stable for both similarities in node split networks. This analysis offers valuable insights into the process of searching for significantly related items regarding each coupling measure. ",

In this work we describe a quantum algorithm for the minimum $s{\\operatorname{-}}t$ cut problem on undirected graphs.

Sound type repertoires are fundamental for monitoring orca populations and are typically created visually and aurally. An orca pod occurring in the Ligurian Sea (Pelagos Sanctuary) in December 2019 provided a unique occasion for long-term recordings. The numerous data collected with the bottom recorder were analysed with a traditional human-driven inspection to create a repertoire of this pod and to compare it to catalogues from different orca populations (Icelandic and Antarctic) investigating its origins. Automatic signal detection and cross-correlation methods (R package warbleR) were used for the first time in orca studies. We found the Pearson cross-correlation method to be efficient for most pairwise calculations (> 85%) but with false positives. One sound type from our repertoire presented a high positive match (range 0.62-0.67) with one from the Icelandic catalogue, which was confirmed visually and aurally. Our first attempt to automatically classify orca sound types presented limitations due to background noise and sound complexity of orca communication. We show cross-correlation methods can be a powerful tool for sound type classification in combination with conventional methods. ",

    "abstract": "In 1973, Lemmens and Seidel posed the problem of determining $N_\\alpha(r)$, the maximum number of equiangular lines in $\\mathbb{R}^r$ with common angle $\\arccos(\\alpha)$. Recently, this question has been almost completely settled in the case where $r$ is large relative to $1/\\alpha$, with the approach relying on Ramsey's theorem. In this paper, we use orthogonal projections of matrices with respect to the Frobenius inner product in order to overcome this limitation, thereby obtaining upper bounds on $N_{\\alpha}(r)$ which significantly improve on the only previously known universal bound of Glazyrin and Yu, as well as taking an important step towards determining $N_\\alpha(r)$ exactly for all $r, \\alpha$. In particular, our results imply that $N_\\alpha(r) = \\Theta(r)$ for $\\alpha \\geq \\Omega(1/r^{1/5})$. Our arguments rely on a new geometric inequality for equiangular lines in $\\mathbb{R}^r$ which is tight when the number of lines meets the absolute bound $\\binom{r+1}{2}$. Moreover, using the connection to graphs, we obtain lower bounds on the second eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a regular graph which are tight for strongly regular graphs corresponding to $\\binom{r+1}{2}$ equiangular lines in $\\mathbb{R}^r$. Our results only require that the spectral gap is less than half the number of vertices and can therefore be seen as an extension of the Alon-Boppana theorem to dense graphs. Generalizing to $\\mathbb{C}$, we also obtain the first universal bound on the maximum number of complex equiangular lines in $\\mathbb{C}^r$ with common Hermitian angle $\\arccos(\\alpha)$. In particular, we prove an inequality for complex equiangular lines in $\\mathbb{C}^r$ which is tight if the number of lines meets the absolute bound $r^2$ and may be of independent interest in quantum theory. Additionally, we use our projection method to obtain an improvement to Welch's bound. ",
