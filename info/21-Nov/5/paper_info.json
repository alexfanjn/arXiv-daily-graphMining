    "title": "Unsupervised embedding and similarity detection of microregions using  public transport schedules",
    "abstract": "The role of spatial data in tackling city-related tasks has been growing in recent years. To use them in machine learning models, it is often necessary to transform them into a vector representation, which has led to the development in the field of spatial data representation learning. There is also a growing variety of spatial data types for which representation learning methods are proposed. Public transport timetables have so far not been used in the task of learning representations of regions in a city. In this work, a method is developed to embed public transport availability information into vector space. To conduct experiments on its application, public transport timetables were collected from 48 European cities. Using the H3 spatial indexing method, they were divided into micro-regions. A method was also proposed to identify regions with similar characteristics of public transport offers. On its basis, a multi-level typology of public transport offers in the regions was defined. This thesis shows that the proposed representation method makes it possible to identify micro-regions with similar public transport characteristics between the cities, and can be used to evaluate the quality of public transport available in a city.

    "abstract": "A new method for accurate indirect heat accounting in apartment buildings has been recently developed by the Centre Suisse d'Electronique et de Microtechnique (CSEM). It is based on a data driven approach aimed to the smart networking of any type of indirect heat allocation devices, which can provide, for each heat delivery point of an apartment building, measurements or estimations of the temperature difference between the heat transfer fluid and the indoor environment. The analysis of the data gathered from the devices installed on the heating bodies, together with the measurements of the overall building heat consumption provided by direct heat metering, allows the evaluation of the characteristic thermal model parameters of heating bodies at actual installation and working conditions. Thus overcoming the negative impact on accuracy of conventional indirect heat accounting due to off-design operation, in which these measurement systems normally operate. The method has been tested on conventional heat cost allocators (HCA), and on innovative smart radiator thermostatic valves developed by CSEM. The evaluations were carried out at the centralized heating system mock-up of the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM), and also in a real building in Neuchatel, Switzerland. The method has proven to be an effective tool to improve the accuracy of indirect heat metering systems; compared to conventional HCA systems, the error on the individual heating bill is reduced by 20% to 50%.

In this study, we propose InQSS, a speech intelligibility assessment model that uses both spectrogram and scattering coefficients as input features. In addition, InQSS uses a multi-task learning network in which quality scores can guide the training of the speech intelligibility assessment. The resulting model can predict not only the intelligibility scores but also the quality scores of a speech. The experimental results confirm that the scattering coefficients and quality scores are informative for intelligibility. Moreover, we released TMHINT-QI, which is a Chinese speech dataset that records the quality and intelligibility scores of clean, noisy, and enhanced speech. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been shown to be an effective tool in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). PINNs embed the PDE residual into the loss function of the neural network, and have been successfully employed to solve diverse forward and inverse PDE problems. However, one disadvantage of the first generation of PINNs is that they usually have limited accuracy even with many training points. Here, we propose a new method, gradient-enhanced physics-informed neural networks (gPINNs), for improving the accuracy and training efficiency of PINNs. gPINNs leverage gradient information of the PDE residual and embed the gradient into the loss function. We tested gPINNs extensively and demonstrated the effectiveness of gPINNs in both forward and inverse PDE problems. Our numerical results show that gPINN performs better than PINN with fewer training points. Furthermore, we combined gPINN with the method of residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR), a method for improving the distribution of training points adaptively during training, to further improve the performance of gPINN, especially in PDEs with solutions that have steep gradients.

    "title": "Convolutional generative adversarial imputation networks for  spatio-temporal missing data in storm surge simulations",
    "abstract": "Imputation of missing data is a task that plays a vital role in a number of engineering and science applications. Often such missing data arise in experimental observations from limitations of sensors or post-processing transformation errors. Other times they arise from numerical and algorithmic constraints in computer simulations. One such instance and the application emphasis of this paper are numerical simulations of storm surge. The simulation data corresponds to time-series surge predictions over a number of save points within the geographic domain of interest, creating a spatio-temporal imputation problem where the surge points are heavily correlated spatially and temporally, and the missing values regions are structurally distributed at random. Very recently, machine learning techniques such as neural network methods have been developed and employed for missing data imputation tasks. Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and GAN-based techniques have particularly attracted attention as unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, the Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (GAIN) performance is improved by applying convolutional neural networks instead of fully connected layers to better capture the correlation of data and promote learning from the adjacent surge points. Another adjustment to the method needed specifically for the studied data is to consider the coordinates of the points as additional features to provide the model more information through the convolutional layers. We name our proposed method as Convolutional Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (Conv-GAIN). The proposed method's performance by considering the improvements and adaptations required for the storm surge data is assessed and compared to the original GAIN and a few other techniques. The results show that Conv-GAIN has better performance than the alternative methods on the studied data. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years BERT shows apparent advantages and great potential in natural language processing tasks. However, both training and applying BERT requires intensive time and resources for computing contextual language representations, which hinders its universality and applicability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a deep bidirectional language model by using window masking mechanism at attention layer. This work computes contextual language representations without random masking as does in BERT and maintains the deep bidirectional architecture like BERT. To compute the same sentence representation, our method shows O(n) complexity less compared to other transformer-based models with O($n^2$). To further demonstrate its superiority, computing context language representations on CPU environments is conducted, by using the embeddings from the proposed method, logistic regression shows much higher accuracy in terms of SMS classification. Moverover, the proposed method also achieves significant higher performance in semantic similarity tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning algorithms are capable of providing remarkably accurate point-predictions; however, questions remain about their statistical reliability. Unlike conventional machine learning methods, conformal prediction algorithms return confidence sets (i.e., set-valued predictions) that correspond to a given significance level. Moreover, these confidence sets are valid in the sense that they guarantee finite sample control over type 1 error probabilities, allowing the practitioner to choose an acceptable error rate. In our paper, we propose inductive conformal prediction (ICP) algorithms for the tasks of text infilling and part-of-speech (POS) prediction for natural language data. We construct new conformal prediction-enhanced bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) algorithms for POS tagging and a new conformal prediction-enhanced BERT algorithm for text infilling. We analyze the performance of the algorithms in simulations using the Brown Corpus, which contains over 57,000 sentences. Our results demonstrate that the ICP algorithms are able to produce valid set-valued predictions that are small enough to be applicable in real-world applications. We also provide a real data example for how our proposed set-valued predictions can improve machine generated audio transcriptions. ",

In order to obtain the approximated solution of the Hamiltonian system, we first introduce a corresponding stochastic optimal control problem such that the Hamiltonian system of control problem is exactly what we need to solve, then develop two different algorithms suitable for different cases of the control problem and approximate the stochastic control via deep neural networks. From the numerical results, comparing with the Deep FBSDE method which was developed previously from the view of solving FBSDEs, the novel algorithms converge faster, which means that they require fewer training steps, and demonstrate more stable convergences for different Hamiltonian systems.

In this work, we focus on the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA) for solving the Max-Cut problem. Specifically, we address two problems in the QAOA, how to select initial parameters, and how to subsequently train the parameters to find an optimal solution. For the former, we propose graph neural networks (GNNs) as an initialisation routine for the QAOA parameters, adding to the literature on warm-starting techniques. We show the GNN approach generalises across not only graph instances, but also to increasing graph sizes, a feature not available to other warm-starting techniques. For training the QAOA, we test several optimisers for the MaxCut problem. These include quantum aware/agnostic optimisers proposed in literature and we also incorporate machine learning techniques such as reinforcement and meta-learning. With the incorporation of these initialisation and optimisation toolkits, we demonstrate how the QAOA can be trained as an end-to-end differentiable pipeline. ",
