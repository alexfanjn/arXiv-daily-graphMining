    "abstract": "Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have recently demonstrated impressive results on various generative tasks.Despite its promises, the learned representations of pre-trained DPMs, however, have not been fully understood. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the representation power of DPMs, and propose a novel knowledge transfer method that leverages the knowledge acquired by generative DPMs for recognition tasks. Our study begins by examining the feature space of DPMs, revealing that DPMs are inherently denoising autoencoders that balance the representation learning with regularizing model capacity. To this end, we introduce a novel knowledge transfer paradigm named RepFusion. Our paradigm extracts representations at different time steps from off-the-shelf DPMs and dynamically employs them as supervision for student networks, in which the optimal time is determined through reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach on several image classification, semantic segmentation, and landmark detection benchmarks, and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our results uncover the potential of DPMs as a powerful tool for representation learning and provide insights into the usefulness of generative models beyond sample generation.

This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages metapath-based semi-supervised learning, addressing the limitations of previous methods. We present a new framework, Metapath-based Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection (MSAD), incorporating GCN layers in both the encoder and decoder to efficiently propagate context information between abnormal and normal nodes. The design of metapath-based context information and a specifically crafted anomaly community enhance the process of learning differences in structures and attributes, both globally and locally. Through a comprehensive set of experiments conducted on seven real-world networks, this paper demonstrates the superiority of the MSAD method compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The promising results of this study pave the way for future investigations, focusing on the optimization and analysis of metapath patterns to further enhance the effectiveness of anomaly detection on attributed networks.

    "abstract": "While network slicing has become a prevalent approach to service differentiation, radio access network (RAN) slicing remains challenging due to the need of substantial adaptivity and flexibility to cope with the highly dynamic network environment in RANs. In this paper, we develop a slicing-based resource management framework for a two-tier RAN to support multiple services with different quality of service (QoS) requirements. The developed framework focuses on base station (BS) service coverage (SC) and interference management for multiple slices, each of which corresponds to a service. New designs are introduced in the spatial, temporal, and slice dimensions to cope with spatiotemporal variations in data traffic, balance adaptivity and overhead of resource management, and enhance flexibility in service differentiation. Based on the proposed framework, an energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, and an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted approach is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, a deep unsupervised learning-assisted algorithm is proposed for searching the optimal SC of the BSs, and an optimization-based analytical solution is found for managing interference among BSs. Simulation results under different data traffic distributions demonstrate that our proposed slicing-based resource management framework, empowered by the AI-assisted approach, outperforms the benchmark frameworks and achieves a close-to-optimal performance in energy efficiency.

    "abstract": "Embedded Network Stacks (ENS) enable low-resource devices to communicate with the outside world, facilitating the development of the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. Some defects in ENS are thus high-severity cybersecurity vulnerabilities: they are remotely triggerable and can impact the physical world. While prior research has shed light on the characteristics of defects in many classes of software systems, no study has described the properties of ENS defects nor identified a systematic technique to expose them. The most common automated approach to detecting ENS defects is feedback-driven randomized dynamic analysis (\"fuzzing\"), a costly and unpredictable technique. This paper provides the first systematic characterization of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in ENS. We analyzed 61 vulnerabilities across 6 open-source ENS. Most of these ENS defects are concentrated in the transport and network layers of the network stack, require reaching different states in the network protocol, and can be triggered by only 1-2 modifications to a single packet. We therefore propose a novel systematic testing framework that focuses on the transport and network layers, uses seeds that cover a network protocol's states, and systematically modifies packet fields. We evaluated this framework on 4 ENS and replicated 12 of the 14 reported IP/TCP/UDP vulnerabilities. On recent versions of these ENSs, it discovered 7 novel defects (6 assigned CVES) during a bounded systematic test that covered all protocol states and made up to 3 modifications per packet. We found defects in 3 of the 4 ENS we tested that had not been found by prior fuzzing research. Our results suggest that fuzzing should be deferred until after systematic testing is employed. ",

    "abstract": "We present an approach to ensure safe and deadlock-free navigation for decentralized multi-robot systems operating in constrained environments, including doorways and intersections. Although many solutions have been proposed to ensure safety, preventing deadlocks in a decentralized fashion with global consensus remains an open problem. We first formalize the objective as a non-cooperative, non-communicative, partially observable multi-robot navigation problem in constrained spaces with multiple conflicting agents, which we term as social mini-games. Our approach to ensuring safety and liveness rests on two novel insights: (i) deadlock resolution is equivalent to deriving a mixed-Nash equilibrium solution to a social mini-game and (ii) this mixed-Nash strategy can be interpreted as an analogue to control barrier functions (CBFs), that can then be integrated with standard CBFs, inheriting their safety guarantees. Together, the standard CBF along with the mixed-Nash CBF analogue preserves both safety and liveness. We evaluate our proposed game-theoretic navigation algorithm in simulation as well on physical robots using F1/10 robots, a Clearpath Jackal, as well as a Boston Dynamics Spot in a doorway, corridor intersection, roundabout, and hallway scenario. We show that (i) our approach results in safer and more efficient navigation compared to local planners based on geometrical constraints, optimization, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and auctions, (ii) our deadlock resolution strategy is the smoothest in terms of smallest average change in velocity and path deviation, and most efficient in terms of makespan (iii) our approach yields a flow rate of 2.8 - 3.3 (ms)^{-1 which is comparable to flow rate in human navigation at 4 (ms)^{-1}.

    "abstract": "Recent works have demonstrated success in MRI reconstruction using deep learning-based models. However, most reported approaches require training on a task-specific, large-scale dataset. Regularization by denoising (RED) is a general pipeline which embeds a denoiser as a prior for image reconstruction. The potential of RED has been demonstrated for multiple image-related tasks such as denoising, deblurring and super-resolution. In this work, we propose a regularization by neural style transfer (RNST) method to further leverage the priors from the neural transfer and denoising engine. This enables RNST to reconstruct a high-quality image from a noisy low-quality image with different image styles and limited data. We validate RNST with clinical MRI scans from 1.5T and 3T and show that RNST can significantly boost image quality. Our results highlight the capability of the RNST framework for MRI reconstruction and the potential for reconstruction tasks with limited data. ",

However, this quality comes at significant computational cost: nearly all of these models are iterative and require running inference multiple times with large models. This iterative process is needed to ensure that different regions of the image are not only aligned with the text prompt, but also compatible with each other. In this work, we propose a light-weight approach to achieving this compatibility between different regions of an image, using a Markov Random Field (MRF) model. This method is shown to work in conjunction with the recently proposed Muse model. The MRF encodes the compatibility among image tokens at different spatial locations and enables us to significantly reduce the required number of Muse prediction steps. Inference with the MRF is significantly cheaper, and its parameters can be quickly learned through back-propagation by modeling MRF inference as a differentiable neural-network layer. Our full model, SPEGTI, uses this proposed MRF model to speed up Muse by 1.5X with no loss in output image quality. ",

Developing accurate predictive models of such sequences is of a great importance for supporting a variety of models for interpreting/classifying the current patient condition, or predicting adverse clinical events and outcomes, all aimed to improve patient care. One important challenge of learning predictive models of clinical sequences is their patient-specific variability. Based on underlying clinical conditions, each patient's sequence may consist of different sets of clinical events (observations, lab results, medications, procedures). Hence, simple population-wide models learned from event sequences for many different patients may not accurately predict patient-specific dynamics of event sequences and their differences. To address the problem, we propose and investigate multiple new event sequence prediction models and methods that let us better adjust the prediction for individual patients and their specific conditions. The methods developed in this work pursue refinement of population-wide models to subpopulations, self-adaptation, and a meta-level model switching that is able to adaptively select the model with the best chance to support the immediate prediction. We analyze and test the performance of these models on clinical event sequences of patients in MIMIC-III database. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, huge progress has been made on learning neural implicit representations from multi-view images for 3D reconstruction. As an additional input complementing coordinates, using sinusoidal functions as positional encodings plays a key role in revealing high frequency details with coordinate-based neural networks. However, high frequency positional encodings make the optimization unstable, which results in noisy reconstructions and artifacts in empty space. To resolve this issue in a general sense, we introduce to learn neural implicit representations with quantized coordinates, which reduces the uncertainty and ambiguity in the field during optimization. Instead of continuous coordinates, we discretize continuous coordinates into discrete coordinates using nearest interpolation among quantized coordinates which are obtained by discretizing the field in an extremely high resolution. We use discrete coordinates and their positional encodings to learn implicit functions through volume rendering. This significantly reduces the variations in the sample space, and triggers more multi-view consistency constraints on intersections of rays from different views, which enables to infer implicit function in a more effective way. Our quantized coordinates do not bring any computational burden, and can seamlessly work upon the latest methods. Our evaluations under the widely used benchmarks show our superiority over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/MachinePerceptionLab/CQ-NIR. ",

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) has received increasing attention from researchers due to its wide range of applications. As conversation has a natural graph structure, numerous approaches used to model ERC based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have yielded significant results. However, the aggregation approach of traditional GCNs suffers from the node information redundancy problem, leading to node discriminant information loss. Additionally, single-layer GCNs lack the capacity to capture long-range contextual information from the graph. Furthermore, the majority of approaches are based on textual modality or stitching together different modalities, resulting in a weak ability to capture interactions between modalities. To address these problems, we present the relational bilevel aggregation graph convolutional network (RBA-GCN), which consists of three modules: the graph generation module (GGM), similarity-based cluster building module (SCBM) and bilevel aggregation module (BiAM). First, GGM constructs a novel graph to reduce the redundancy of target node information. Then, SCBM calculates the node similarity in the target node and its structural neighborhood, where noisy information with low similarity is filtered out to preserve the discriminant information of the node. Meanwhile, BiAM is a novel aggregation method that can preserve the information of nodes during the aggregation process. This module can construct the interaction between different modalities and capture long-range contextual information based on similarity clusters. On both the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, the weighted average F1 score of RBA-GCN has a 2.17$\\sim$5.21\\% improvement over that of the most advanced method. ",

Traditionally, infrastructure networks are designed with a radial topology lacking redundancy, which makes them vulnerable to disruptions. As a result, network topologies have evolved towards a ring topology with only one redundant edge and, from there, to more complex mesh networks. However, we prove that large rings are unreliable. Our research shows that a sparse mesh network with a small number of redundant edges that follow some design rules can significantly improve reliability while remaining cost-effective. Moreover, we have identified key areas where adding redundant edges can impact network reliability the most by using the SAIDI index, which measures the expected number of consumers disconnected from the source node. These findings offer network planners a valuable tool for quickly identifying and addressing reliability issues without the need for complex simulations. Properly planned sparse mesh networks can thus provide a reliable and a cost-effective solution to modern infrastructure challenges. ",

    "title": "TeD-SPAD: Temporal Distinctiveness for Self-supervised  Privacy-preservation for video Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) without human monitoring is a complex computer vision task that can have a positive impact on society if implemented successfully. While recent advances have made significant progress in solving this task, most existing approaches overlook a critical real-world concern: privacy. With the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence technologies, it becomes crucial to implement proper AI ethics into their development. Privacy leakage in VAD allows models to pick up and amplify unnecessary biases related to people's personal information, which may lead to undesirable decision making. In this paper, we propose TeD-SPAD, a privacy-aware video anomaly detection framework that destroys visual private information in a self-supervised manner. In particular, we propose the use of a temporally-distinct triplet loss to promote temporally discriminative features, which complements current weakly-supervised VAD methods. Using TeD-SPAD, we achieve a positive trade-off between privacy protection and utility anomaly detection performance on three popular weakly supervised VAD datasets: UCF-Crime, XD-Violence, and ShanghaiTech. Our proposed anonymization model reduces private attribute prediction by 32.25% while only reducing frame-level ROC AUC on the UCF-Crime anomaly detection dataset by 3.69%.

    "abstract": "Predicting high dimensional video sequences is a curiously difficult problem. The number of possible futures for a given video sequence grows exponentially over time due to uncertainty. This is especially evident when trying to predict complicated natural video scenes from a limited snapshot of the world. The inherent uncertainty accumulates the further into the future you predict making long-term prediction very difficult. In this work we introduce a number of improvements to existing work that aid in creating Robust Video Predictors (RoViPs). We show that with a combination of deep Perceptual and uncertainty-based reconstruction losses we are able to create high quality short-term predictions. Attention-based skip connections are utilised to allow for long range spatial movement of input features to further improve performance. Finally, we show that by simply making the predictor robust to its own prediction errors, it is possible to produce very long, realistic natural video sequences using an iterated single-step prediction task.

The exploration phase is then followed by a mapping phase which exploits the probabilistic map to reconstruct the underlying topography of the workspace by sampling in more detail regions where there is expected to be embedded objects. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we tested our approach on an experimental setup that consists of a series of quartz beads located underneath a polyethylene foam that prevents direct observation of the configuration and requires the use of tactile exploration to recover the location of the beads. We show the performance of our methodology using ten different configurations of the beads where the proposed approach is able to approximate the underlying configuration.

    "abstract": "As demands for high-quality videos continue to rise, high-resolution and high-dynamic range (HDR) imaging techniques are drawing attention. To generate an HDR video from low dynamic range (LDR) images, one of the critical steps is the motion compensation between LDR frames, for which most existing works employed the optical flow algorithm. However, these methods suffer from flow estimation errors when saturation or complicated motions exist. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end HDR video composition framework, which aligns LDR frames in the feature space and then merges aligned features into an HDR frame, without relying on pixel-domain optical flow. Specifically, we propose a luminance-based alignment network for HDR (LAN-HDR) consisting of an alignment module and a hallucination module. The alignment module aligns a frame to the adjacent reference by evaluating luminance-based attention, excluding color information. The hallucination module generates sharp details, especially for washed-out areas due to saturation. The aligned and hallucinated features are then blended adaptively to complement each other. Finally, we merge the features to generate a final HDR frame. In training, we adopt a temporal loss, in addition to frame reconstruction losses, to enhance temporal consistency and thus reduce flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs better or comparable to state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. ",

While deep learning methods have demonstrated effectiveness in predicting old stock prices, they require large training datasets unavailable for sub-new stocks.

Leveraging prediction tasks formulated by old stocks, our meta-learning method aims to acquire the fast generalization ability that can be further adapted to sub-new stock price prediction tasks, thereby solving the data scarcity of sub-new stocks. Moreover, we enhance the meta-learning process by incorporating an adaptive learning strategy sensitive to varying task difficulties. Through wavelet transform, we extract high-frequency coefficients to manifest stock price volatility. This allows the meta-learning model to assign gradient weights based on volatility-quantified task difficulty. Extensive experiments on datasets collected from three stock markets spanning twenty-two years prove that our Meta-Stock significantly outperforms previous methods and manifests strong applicability in real-world stock trading. Besides, we evaluate the reasonability of the task difficulty quantification and the effectiveness of the adaptive learning strategy. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method that leverages a visual-language model, CLIP, as a data source for zero-shot anomaly detection. Tremendous efforts have been put towards developing anomaly detectors due to their potential industrial applications. Considering the difficulty in acquiring various anomalous samples for training, most existing methods train models with only normal samples and measure discrepancies from the distribution of normal samples during inference, which requires training a model for each object category. The problem of this inefficient training requirement has been tackled by designing a CLIP-based anomaly detector that applies prompt-guided classification to each part of an image in a sliding window manner. However, the method still suffers from the labor of careful prompt ensembling with known object categories. To overcome the issues above, we propose leveraging CLIP as a data source for training. Our method generates text embeddings with the text encoder in CLIP with typical prompts that include words of normal and anomaly. In addition to these words, we insert several randomly generated words into prompts, which enables the encoder to generate a diverse set of normal and anomalous samples. Using the generated embeddings as training data, a feed-forward neural network learns to extract features of normal and anomaly from CLIP's embeddings, and as a result, a category-agnostic anomaly detector can be obtained without any training images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without laborious prompt ensembling in zero-shot setups. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance on various graph learning tasks, including recommendation, where they leverage user-item collaborative filtering signals in graphs. However, theoretical formulations of their capability are scarce, despite their empirical effectiveness in state-of-the-art recommender models. Recently, research has explored the expressiveness of GNNs in general, demonstrating that message passing GNNs are at most as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, and that GNNs combined with random node initialization are universal. Nevertheless, the concept of \"expressiveness\" for GNNs remains vaguely defined. Most existing works adopt the graph isomorphism test as the metric of expressiveness, but this graph-level task may not effectively assess a model's ability in recommendation, where the objective is to distinguish nodes of different closeness. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the expressiveness of GNNs in recommendation, considering three levels of expressiveness metrics: graph isomorphism (graph-level), node automorphism (node-level), and topological closeness (link-level). We propose the topological closeness metric to evaluate GNNs' ability to capture the structural distance between nodes, which aligns closely with the objective of recommendation. To validate the effectiveness of this new metric in evaluating recommendation performance, we introduce a learning-less GNN algorithm that is optimal on the new metric and can be optimal on the node-level metric with suitable modification. We conduct extensive experiments comparing the proposed algorithm against various types of state-of-the-art GNN models to explore the explainability of the new metric in the recommendation task.

    "abstract": "Recent work on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has demonstrated significant advances in high-quality view synthesis. A major limitation of NeRF is its low rendering efficiency due to the need for multiple network forwardings to render a single pixel. Existing methods to improve NeRF either reduce the number of required samples or optimize the implementation to accelerate the network forwarding. Despite these efforts, the problem of multiple sampling persists due to the intrinsic representation of radiance fields. In contrast, Neural Light Fields (NeLF) reduce the computation cost of NeRF by querying only one single network forwarding per pixel. To achieve a close visual quality to NeRF, existing NeLF methods require significantly larger network capacities which limits their rendering efficiency in practice. In this work, we propose a new representation called Neural Radiance Distribution Field (NeRDF) that targets efficient view synthesis in real-time. Specifically, we use a small network similar to NeRF while preserving the rendering speed with a single network forwarding per pixel as in NeLF. The key is to model the radiance distribution along each ray with frequency basis and predict frequency weights using the network. Pixel values are then computed via volume rendering on radiance distributions. Experiments show that our proposed method offers a better trade-off among speed, quality, and network size than existing methods: we achieve a ~254x speed-up over NeRF with similar network size, with only a marginal performance decline.

Furthermore, its nuclear configuration spaces authentically depict chemical reactions, making xxMD a more chemically relevant dataset.

While existing MOT datasets focus on occlusion and appearance similarity, complex motion patterns are widespread yet overlooked. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset called BEE23 to highlight complex motions. Identity association algorithms have long been the focus of MOT research. Existing trackers can be categorized into two association paradigms: single-feature paradigm (based on either motion or appearance feature) and serial paradigm (one feature serves as secondary while the other is primary). However, these paradigms are incapable of fully utilizing different features. In this paper, we propose a parallel paradigm and present the Two rOund Parallel matchIng meChanism (TOPIC) to implement it. The TOPIC leverages both motion and appearance features and can adaptively select the preferable one as the assignment metric based on motion level. Moreover, we provide an Attention-based Appearance Reconstruct Module (AARM) to reconstruct appearance feature embeddings, thus enhancing the representation of appearance features. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and BEE23. Notably, our proposed parallel paradigm surpasses the performance of existing association paradigms by a large margin, e.g., reducing false negatives by 12% to 51% compared to the single-feature association paradigm.

Therefore, based on swin transformer V2 (Swin V2) and VGG16, we propose an end-to-end compounded dense network SwinV2DNet to inherit the advantages of both transformer and CNN and overcome the shortcomings of existing networks in feature learning. Firstly, it captures the change relationship features through the densely connected Swin V2 backbone, and provides the low-level pre-changed and post-changed features through a CNN branch. Based on these three change features, we accomplish accurate change detection results. Secondly, combined with transformer and CNN, we propose mixed feature pyramid (MFP) which provides inter-layer interaction information and intra-layer multi-scale information for complete feature learning. MFP is a plug and play module which is experimentally proven to be also effective in other change detection networks. Further more, we impose a self-supervision strategy to guide a new CNN branch, which solves the untrainable problem of the CNN branch and provides the semantic change information for the features of encoder.

One of the important threats is \\textit{adversarial attacks}, which can lead to erroneous predictions and largely affect model performance on downstream tasks. Current adversarial attacks on code models usually adopt fixed sets of program transformations, such as variable renaming and dead code insertion, leading to limited attack effectiveness. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework, GraphCodeAttack, to better evaluate the robustness of code models. Given a target code model, GraphCodeAttack automatically mines important code patterns, which can influence the model's decisions, to perturb the structure of input code to the model. To do so, GraphCodeAttack uses a set of input source codes to probe the model's outputs and identifies the \\textit{discriminative} ASTs patterns that can influence the model decisions. GraphCodeAttack then selects appropriate AST patterns, concretizes the selected patterns as attacks, and inserts them as dead code into the model's input program. To effectively synthesize attacks from AST patterns, GraphCodeAttack uses a separate pre-trained code model to fill in the ASTs with concrete code snippets. We evaluate the robustness of two popular code models (e.g., CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT) against our proposed approach on three tasks: Authorship Attribution, Vulnerability Prediction, and Clone Detection. The experimental results suggest that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in attacking code models such as CARROT and ALERT. ",

    "title": "MISSRec: Pre-training and Transferring Multi-modal Interest-aware  Sequence Representation for Recommendation",
    "abstract": "The goal of sequential recommendation (SR) is to predict a user's potential interested items based on her/his historical interaction sequences. Most existing sequential recommenders are developed based on ID features, which, despite their widespread use, often underperform with sparse IDs and struggle with the cold-start problem. Besides, inconsistent ID mappings hinder the model's transferability, isolating similar recommendation domains that could have been co-optimized. This paper aims to address these issues by exploring the potential of multi-modal information in learning robust and generalizable sequence representations. We propose MISSRec, a multi-modal pre-training and transfer learning framework for SR. On the user side, we design a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model, where the contextual encoder learns to capture the sequence-level multi-modal synergy while a novel interest-aware decoder is developed to grasp item-modality-interest relations for better sequence representation. On the candidate item side, we adopt a dynamic fusion module to produce user-adaptive item representation, providing more precise matching between users and items. We pre-train the model with contrastive learning objectives and fine-tune it in an efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of MISSRec, promising an practical solution for real-world recommendation scenarios. ",

ReFit learns a feedback-update loop that mirrors the strategy of solving an inverse problem through optimization.

    "abstract": "Several methods exist today to accelerate Machine Learning(ML) or Deep-Learning(DL) model performance for training and inference. However, modern techniques that rely on various graph and operator parallelism methodologies rely on search space optimizations which are costly in terms of power and hardware usage. Especially in the case of inference, when the batch size is 1 and execution is on CPUs or for power-constrained edge devices, current techniques can become costly, complicated or inapplicable. To ameliorate this, we present a Critical-Path-based Linear Clustering approach to exploit inherent parallel paths in ML dataflow graphs. Our task parallelization approach further optimizes the structure of graphs via cloning and prunes them via constant propagation and dead-code elimination. Contrary to other work, we generate readable and executable parallel Pytorch+Python code from input ML models in ONNX format via a new tool that we have built called {\\bf Ramiel}. This allows us to benefit from other downstream acceleration techniques like intra-op parallelism and potentially pipeline parallelism. Our preliminary results on several ML graphs demonstrate up to 1.9$\\times$ speedup over serial execution and outperform some of the current mechanisms in both compile and runtimes. Lastly, our methods are lightweight and fast enough so that they can be used effectively for power and resource-constrained devices, while still enabling downstream optimizations. ",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and ALIGN, are generally trained on datasets consisting of image-caption pairs obtained from the web. However, real-world multimodal datasets, such as healthcare data, are significantly more complex: each image (e.g. X-ray) is often paired with text (e.g. physician report) that describes many distinct attributes occurring in fine-grained regions of the image. We refer to these samples as exhibiting high pairwise complexity, since each image-text pair can be decomposed into a large number of region-attribute pairings. The extent to which VLMs can capture fine-grained relationships between image regions and textual attributes when trained on such data has not been previously evaluated. The first key contribution of this work is to demonstrate through systematic evaluations that as the pairwise complexity of the training dataset increases, standard VLMs struggle to learn region-attribute relationships, exhibiting performance degradations of up to 37% on retrieval tasks. In order to address this issue, we introduce ViLLA as our second key contribution. ViLLA, which is trained to capture fine-grained region-attribute relationships from complex datasets, involves two components: (a) a lightweight, self-supervised mapping model to decompose image-text samples into region-attribute pairs, and (b) a contrastive VLM to learn representations from generated region-attribute pairs. We demonstrate with experiments across four domains (synthetic, product, medical, and natural images) that ViLLA outperforms comparable VLMs on fine-grained reasoning tasks, such as zero-shot object detection (up to 3.6 AP50 points on COCO and 0.6 mAP points on LVIS) and retrieval (up to 14.2 R-Precision points).

Consequently, the dominance in this domain has shifted towards Transformer, MLP, and CNN approaches. The substantial number of recurrent iterations are the fundamental reasons behind the limitations of RNNs in LTSF. To address these issues, we propose two novel strategies to reduce the number of iterations in RNNs for LTSF tasks: Segment-wise Iterations and Parallel Multi-step Forecasting (PMF). RNNs that combine these strategies, namely SegRNN, significantly reduce the required recurrent iterations for LTSF, resulting in notable improvements in forecast accuracy and inference speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegRNN not only outperforms SOTA Transformer-based models but also reduces runtime and memory usage by more than 78%. These achievements provide strong evidence that RNNs continue to excel in LTSF tasks and encourage further exploration of this domain with more RNN-based approaches. The source code is coming soon.

This presents an inherent privacy risk, as raw descriptors may be used to recover the source images from which they were extracted. To address this issue, researchers recently proposed privatizing image features by embedding them within an affine subspace containing the original feature as well as adversarial feature samples. In this paper, we propose two novel inversion attacks to show that it is possible to (approximately) recover the original image features from these embeddings, allowing us to recover privacy-critical image content. In light of such successes and the lack of theoretical privacy guarantees afforded by existing visual privacy methods, we further propose the first method to privatize image features via local differential privacy, which, unlike prior approaches, provides a guaranteed bound for privacy leakage regardless of the strength of the attacks. In addition, our method yields strong performance in visual localization as a downstream task while enjoying the privacy guarantee. ",

In this paper, we propose a method for detecting tampered parameters and bits, which can be used to detect, locate, and restore parameters that have been tampered with. We also propose an adaptive embedding method that maximizes information capacity while maintaining model accuracy. Our approach was tested on multiple neural networks subjected to attacks that modified weight parameters, and our results demonstrate that our method achieved great recovery performance when the modification rate was below 20%. Furthermore, for models where watermarking significantly affected accuracy, we utilized an adaptive bit technique to recover more than 15% of the accuracy loss of the model. ",

    "abstract": "Though many deep learning (DL)-based vulnerability detection approaches have been proposed and indeed achieved remarkable performance, they still have limitations in the generalization as well as the practical usage. More precisely, existing DL-based approaches (1) perform negatively on prediction tasks among functions that are lexically similar but have contrary semantics; (2) provide no intuitive developer-oriented explanations to the detected results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named SVulD, a function-level Subtle semantic embedding for Vulnerability Detection along with intuitive explanations, to alleviate the above limitations. Specifically, SVulD firstly trains a model to learn distinguishing semantic representations of functions regardless of their lexical similarity. Then, for the detected vulnerable functions, SVulD provides natural language explanations (e.g., root cause) of results to help developers intuitively understand the vulnerabilities. To evaluate the effectiveness of SVulD, we conduct large-scale experiments on a widely used practical vulnerability dataset and compare it with four state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by considering five performance measures. The experimental results indicate that SVulD outperforms all SOTAs with a substantial improvement (i.e., 23.5%-68.0% in terms of F1-score, 15.9%-134.8% in terms of PR-AUC and 7.4%-64.4% in terms of Accuracy). Besides, we conduct a user-case study to evaluate the usefulness of SVulD for developers on understanding the vulnerable code and the participants' feedback demonstrates that SVulD is helpful for development practice.

Humans easily identify moving salient objects in videos using the gestalt principle of common fate, which suggests that what moves together belongs together. Building upon this idea, we propose a self-supervised object discovery approach that leverages motion and appearance information to produce high-quality object segmentation masks. Specifically, we redesign the traditional graph cut on images to include motion information in a linear combination with appearance information to produce edge weights. Remarkably, this step produces object segmentation masks comparable to the current state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks. To further improve performance, we bootstrap a segmentation network trained on these preliminary masks as pseudo-ground truths to learn from its own outputs via self-training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, named LOCATE, on multiple standard video object segmentation, image saliency detection, and object segmentation benchmarks, achieving results on par with and, in many cases surpassing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the transferability of our approach to novel domains through a qualitative study on in-the-wild images.

In this work, we investigate whether we can improve the model robustness to the sub-action order by shrinking the temporal receptive field of action recognition models. For this, we design Video BagNet, a variant of the 3D ResNet-50 model with the temporal receptive field size limited to 1, 9, 17 or 33 frames. We analyze Video BagNet on synthetic and real-world video datasets and experimentally compare models with varying temporal receptive fields.

Benefit from this inherent mechanism, it has advantages in the performance and the interpretability. However,traditional semantic parsing methods usually generate a complete program before executing it, which struggles with multi-hop question answering over heterogeneous knowledge. Firstly,a complete multi-hop program relies on multiple heterogeneous supporting facts, and it is difficult for models to receive these facts simultaneously. Secondly,these methods ignore the interaction information between the previous-hop execution result and the current-hop program generation. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a self-iterative framework for multi-hop program generation (HopPG) over heterogeneous knowledge, which leverages the previous-hop execution results to retrieve supporting facts and generate subsequent programs iteratively.

    "abstract": "The robust constrained Markov decision process (RCMDP) is a recent task-modelling framework for reinforcement learning that incorporates behavioural constraints and that provides robustness to errors in the transition dynamics model through the use of an uncertainty set. Simulating RCMDPs requires computing the worst-case dynamics based on value estimates for each state, an approach which has previously been used in the Robust Constrained Policy Gradient (RCPG). Highlighting potential downsides of RCPG such as not robustifying the full constrained objective and the lack of incremental learning, this paper introduces two algorithms, called RCPG with Robust Lagrangian and Adversarial RCPG. RCPG with Robust Lagrangian modifies RCPG by taking the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian rather than either the value or the constraint. Adversarial RCPG also formulates the worst-case dynamics based on the Lagrangian but learns this directly and incrementally as an adversarial policy through gradient descent rather than indirectly and abruptly through constrained optimisation on a sorted value list. A theoretical analysis first derives the Lagrangian policy gradient for the policy optimisation of both proposed algorithms and then the adversarial policy gradient to learn the adversary for Adversarial RCPG. Empirical experiments injecting perturbations in inventory management and safe navigation tasks demonstrate the competitive performance of both algorithms compared to traditional RCPG variants as well as non-robust and non-constrained ablations. In particular, Adversarial RCPG ranks among the top two performing algorithms on all tests. ",

This paper addresses the privacy threats by updating a recent threat-modelling methodology and by tailoring it specifically to the soft privacy target property, which ensures citizens' full control on their personal data. The methodology now features the sources of documentation as an explicit variable that is to be considered. It is demonstrated by including a new version of the de-facto standard LINDDUN methodology as well as an additional source by ENISA which is found to be relevant to soft privacy. The main findings are a set of 23 domain-independent threats, 43 domain-specific assets and 525 domain-dependent threats for the target property in the automotive domain. While these exceed their previous versions, their main value is to offer self-evident support to at least two arguments. One is that LINDDUN has evolved much the way our original methodology already advocated because a few of our previously suggested extensions are no longer outstanding. The other one is that ENISA's treatment of privacy aboard smart cars should be extended considerably because our 525 threats fall in the same scope. ",

    "title": "Alternative Normalized-Preconditioning for Scalable Iterative Large-MIMO  Detection",
    "abstract": "Signal detection in large multiple-input multiple-output (large-MIMO) systems presents greater challenges compared to conventional massive-MIMO for two primary reasons. First, large-MIMO systems lack favorable propagation conditions as they do not require a substantially greater number of service antennas relative to user antennas. Second, the wireless channel may exhibit spatial non-stationarity when an extremely large aperture array (ELAA) is deployed in a large-MIMO system. In this paper, we propose a scalable iterative large-MIMO detector named ANPID, which simultaneously delivers 1) close to maximum-likelihood detection performance, 2) low computational-complexity (i.e., square-order of transmit antennas), 3) fast convergence, and 4) robustness to the spatial non-stationarity in ELAA channels. ANPID incorporates a damping demodulation step into stationary iterative (SI) methods and alternates between two distinct demodulated SI methods. Simulation results demonstrate that ANPID fulfills all the four features concurrently and outperforms existing low-complexity MIMO detectors, especially in highly-loaded large MIMO systems. ",

    "abstract": "Current video object detection (VOD) models often encounter issues with over-aggregation due to redundant aggregation strategies, which perform feature aggregation on every frame. This results in suboptimal performance and increased computational complexity. In this work, we propose an image-level Object Detection Difficulty (ODD) metric to quantify the difficulty of detecting objects in a given image. The derived ODD scores can be used in the VOD process to mitigate over-aggregation. Specifically, we train an ODD predictor as an auxiliary head of a still-image object detector to compute the ODD score for each image based on the discrepancies between detection results and ground-truth bounding boxes. The ODD score enhances the VOD system in two ways: 1) it enables the VOD system to select superior global reference frames, thereby improving overall accuracy; and 2) it serves as an indicator in the newly designed ODD Scheduler to eliminate the aggregation of frames that are easy to detect, thus accelerating the VOD process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, when utilized for selecting global reference frames, ODD-VOD consistently enhances the accuracy of Global-frame-based VOD models. When employed for acceleration, ODD-VOD consistently improves the frames per second (FPS) by an average of 73.3% across 8 different VOD models without sacrificing accuracy. When combined, ODD-VOD attains state-of-the-art performance when competing with many VOD methods in both accuracy and speed. Our work represents a significant advancement towards making VOD more practical for real-world applications. ",

    "abstract": "As a distributed machine learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) enables large-scale clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw data. However, due to the lack of data auditing for untrusted clients, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, especially backdoor attacks. By using poisoned data for local training or directly changing the model parameters, attackers can easily inject backdoors into the model, which can trigger the model to make misclassification of targeted patterns in images. To address these issues, we propose a novel data-free trigger-generation-based defense approach based on the two characteristics of backdoor attacks: i) triggers are learned faster than normal knowledge, and ii) trigger patterns have a greater effect on image classification than normal class patterns. Our approach generates the images with newly learned knowledge by identifying the differences between the old and new global models, and filters trigger images by evaluating the effect of these generated images. By using these trigger images, our approach eliminates poisoned models to ensure the updated global model is benign. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can defend against almost all the existing types of backdoor attacks and outperform all the seven state-of-the-art defense methods with both IID and non-IID scenarios. Especially, our approach can successfully defend against the backdoor attack even when 80\\% of the clients are malicious. ",

    "abstract": "Mixed-precision neural networks (MPNNs) that enable the use of just enough data width for a deep learning task promise significant advantages of both inference accuracy and computing overhead. FPGAs with fine-grained reconfiguration capability can adapt the processing with distinct data width and models, and hence, can theoretically unleash the potential of MPNNs. Nevertheless, commodity DPUs on FPGAs mostly emphasize generality and have limited support for MPNNs especially the ones with lower data width. In addition, primitive DSPs in FPGAs usually have much larger data width than that is required by MPNNs and haven't been sufficiently co-explored with MPNNs yet. To this end, we propose an open source MPNN accelerator design framework specifically tailored for FPGAs. In this framework, we have a systematic DSP-packing algorithm to pack multiple lower data width MACs in a single primitive DSP and enable efficient implementation of MPNNs. Meanwhile, we take DSP packing efficiency into consideration with MPNN quantization within a unified neural network architecture search (NAS) framework such that it can be aware of the DSP overhead during quantization and optimize the MPNN performance and accuracy concurrently. Finally, we have the optimized MPNN fine-tuned to a fully pipelined neural network accelerator template based on HLS and make best use of available resources for higher performance. Our experiments reveal the resulting accelerators produced by the proposed framework can achieve overwhelming advantages in terms of performance, resource utilization, and inference accuracy for MPNNs when compared with both handcrafted counterparts and prior hardware-aware neural network accelerators on FPGAs.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (NNs) are considered a powerful tool for balancing the performance and complexity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers due to their accurate feature extraction, high parallelism, and excellent inference ability. Graph NNs (GNNs) have recently demonstrated outstanding capability in learning enhanced message passing rules and have shown success in overcoming the drawback of inaccurate Gaussian approximation of expectation propagation (EP)-based MIMO detectors. However, the application of the GNN-enhanced EP detector to MIMO turbo receivers is underexplored and non-trivial due to the requirement of extrinsic information for iterative processing. This paper proposes a GNN-enhanced EP algorithm for MIMO turbo receivers, which realizes the turbo principle of generating extrinsic information from the MIMO detector through a specially designed training procedure. Additionally, an edge pruning strategy is designed to eliminate redundant connections in the original fully connected model of the GNN utilizing the correlation information inherently from the EP algorithm. Edge pruning reduces the computational cost dramatically and enables the network to focus more attention on the weights that are vital for performance. Simulation results and complexity analysis indicate that the proposed MIMO turbo receiver outperforms the EP turbo approaches by over 1 dB at the bit error rate of $10^{-5}$, exhibits performance equivalent to state-of-the-art receivers with 2.5 times shorter running time, and adapts to various scenarios.

In the paper, motivated by the anchor line-based lane detection methods, we propose a rail detection network called DALNet based on dynamic anchor line. Aiming to solve the problem that the predefined anchor line is image agnostic, we design a novel dynamic anchor line mechanism. It utilizes a dynamic anchor line generator to dynamically generate an appropriate anchor line for each rail instance based on the position and shape of the rails in the input image. These dynamically generated anchor lines can be considered as better position references to accurately localize the rails than the predefined anchor lines. In addition, we present a challenging urban rail detection dataset DL-Rail with high-quality annotations and scenario diversity. DL-Rail contains 7000 pairs of images and annotations along with scene tags, and it is expected to encourage the development of rail detection. We extensively compare DALNet with many competitive lane methods. The results show that our DALNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on our DL-Rail rail detection dataset and the popular Tusimple and LLAMAS lane detection benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Investigations of causality in operational systems aim at providing human-understandable explanations of why a system behaves as it does. There is, in particular, a demand to explain what went wrong on a given counterexample execution that shows that a system does not satisfy a given specification. To this end, this paper investigates a notion of counterfactual causality in transition systems based on Stalnaker's and Lewis' semantics of counterfactuals in terms of most similar possible worlds and introduces a novel corresponding notion of counterfactual causality in two-player games. Using distance functions between paths in transition systems, this notion defines whether reaching a certain set of states is a cause for the violation of a reachability or safety property. Similarly, using distance functions between memoryless strategies in reachability and safety games, it is defined whether reaching a set of states is a cause for the fact that a given strategy for the player under investigation is losing. The contribution of the paper is two-fold: In transition systems, it is shown that counterfactual causality can be checked in polynomial time for three prominent distance functions between paths. In two-player games, the introduced notion of counterfactual causality is shown to be checkable in polynomial time for two natural distance functions between memoryless strategies. Further, a notion of explanation that can be extracted from a counterfactual cause and that pinpoints changes to be made to the given strategy in order to transform it into a winning strategy is defined. For the two distance functions under consideration, the problem to decide whether such an explanation imposes only minimal necessary changes to the given strategy with respect to the used distance function turns out to be coNP-complete and not to be solvable in polynomial time if P is not equal to NP, respectively.

Unlike the laborious task of removing biases, our method proposes to insert biases instead, resulting in improved performance. To identify biases, we annotated two diverse datasets: a dataset of clinical skin lesions and a dataset of male and female faces. These bias annotations are published for the first time in this study, providing a valuable resource for future research. Through Counterfactual Bias Insertion, we discovered that biases associated with the frame, ruler, and glasses had a significant impact on models. By randomly introducing biases during training, we mitigated these biases and achieved a substantial decrease in bias measures, ranging from two-fold to more than 50-fold, while maintaining a negligible increase in the error rate.

However, it is extremely challenging to design efficient resource allocation schemes for future wireless communication networks since the formulated resource allocation problems are generally non-convex and consist of various coupled variables. Moreover, the dynamic changes of practical wireless communication environment and user service requirements thirst for efficient real-time resource allocation. To tackle these issues, a novel partially observable deep multi-agent active inference (PODMAI) framework is proposed for realizing intelligent resource allocation. A belief based learning method is exploited for updating the policy by minimizing the variational free energy. A decentralized training with a decentralized execution multi-agent strategy is designed to overcome the limitations of the partially observable state information. Exploited the proposed framework, an intelligent spectrum allocation and trajectory optimization scheme is developed for a spectrum sharing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network with dynamic transmission rate requirements as an example. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework can significantly improve the sum transmission rate of the secondary network compared to various benchmark schemes. Moreover, the convergence speed of the proposed PODMAI is significantly improved compared with the conventional reinforcement learning framework. Overall, our proposed framework can enrich the intelligent resource allocation frameworks and pave the way for realizing real-time resource allocation. ",

To achieve this goal, we have designed a competition that allows realistic and detailed investigation of problems in modern financial transaction data. The participants compete directly against each other, so possible attacks and defenses are examined in close-to-real-life conditions. Our main contributions are the analysis of the competition dynamics that answers the questions on how important it is to conceal a model from malicious users, how long does it take to break it, and what techniques one should use to make it more robust, and introduction additional way to attack models or increase their robustness. Our analysis continues with a meta-study on the used approaches with their power, numerical experiments, and accompanied ablations studies. We show that the developed attacks and defenses outperform existing alternatives from the literature while being practical in terms of execution, proving the validity of the competition as a tool for uncovering vulnerabilities of machine learning models and mitigating them in various domains.

One essential part of library migration is to find an analogical API that could provide the same functionality as current ones. However, given the large number of libraries/APIs, manually finding an analogical API could be very time-consuming and error-prone. Researchers have developed multiple automated analogical API recommendation techniques. Documentation-based methods have particularly attracted significant interest. Despite their potential, these methods have limitations, such as a lack of comprehensive semantic understanding in documentation and scalability challenges. In this work, we propose KGE4AR, a novel documentation-based approach that leverages knowledge graph (KG) embedding to recommend analogical APIs during library migration. Specifically, KGE4AR proposes a novel unified API KG to comprehensively and structurally represent three types of knowledge in documentation, which can better capture the high-level semantics. Moreover, KGE4AR then proposes to embed the unified API KG into vectors, enabling more effective and scalable similarity calculation. We build KGE4AR' s unified API KG for 35,773 Java libraries and assess it in two API recommendation scenarios: with and without target libraries. Our results show that KGE4AR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art documentation-based techniques in both evaluation scenarios in terms of all metrics (e.g., 47.1%-143.0% and 11.7%-80.6% MRR improvements in each scenario).

However, fast adversarial training often suffers from Catastrophic Overfitting (CO), which results in poor robustness performance. Catastrophic Overfitting describes the phenomenon of a sudden and significant decrease in robust accuracy during the training of fast adversarial training. Many effective techniques have been developed to prevent Catastrophic Overfitting and improve the model robustness from different perspectives. However, these techniques adopt inconsistent training settings and require different training costs, i.e, training time and memory costs, leading to unfair comparisons. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of over 10 fast adversarial training methods in terms of adversarial robustness and training costs. We revisit the effectiveness and efficiency of fast adversarial training techniques in preventing Catastrophic Overfitting from the perspective of model local nonlinearity and propose an effective Lipschitz regularization method for fast adversarial training. Furthermore, we explore the effect of data augmentation and weight averaging in fast adversarial training and propose a simple yet effective auto weight averaging method to improve robustness further. By assembling these techniques, we propose a FGSM-based fast adversarial training method equipped with Lipschitz regularization and Auto Weight averaging, abbreviated as FGSM-LAW. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art fast adversarial training methods and the advanced standard adversarial training methods.

    "title": "Pre-training with Aspect-Content Text Mutual Prediction for Multi-Aspect  Dense Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Grounded on pre-trained language models (PLMs), dense retrieval has been studied extensively on plain text. In contrast, there has been little research on retrieving data with multiple aspects using dense models. In the scenarios such as product search, the aspect information plays an essential role in relevance matching, e.g., category: Electronics, Computers, and Pet Supplies. A common way of leveraging aspect information for multi-aspect retrieval is to introduce an auxiliary classification objective, i.e., using item contents to predict the annotated value IDs of item aspects. However, by learning the value embeddings from scratch, this approach may not capture the various semantic similarities between the values sufficiently. To address this limitation, we leverage the aspect information as text strings rather than class IDs during pre-training so that their semantic similarities can be naturally captured in the PLMs. To facilitate effective retrieval with the aspect strings, we propose mutual prediction objectives between the text of the item aspect and content. In this way, our model makes more sufficient use of aspect information than conducting undifferentiated masked language modeling (MLM) on the concatenated text of aspects and content. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets (product and mini-program search) show that our approach can outperform competitive baselines both treating aspect values as classes and conducting the same MLM for aspect and content strings.

    "abstract": "Improving the reliability of deployed machine learning systems often involves developing methods to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. However, existing research often narrowly focuses on samples from classes that are absent from the training set, neglecting other types of plausible distribution shifts. This limitation reduces the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios, where systems encounter a wide variety of anomalous inputs. In this study, we categorize five distinct types of distribution shifts and critically evaluate the performance of recent OOD detection methods on each of them. We publicly release our benchmark under the name BROAD (Benchmarking Resilience Over Anomaly Diversity). Our findings reveal that while these methods excel in detecting unknown classes, their performance is inconsistent when encountering other types of distribution shifts. In other words, they only reliably detect unexpected inputs that they have been specifically designed to expect. As a first step toward broad OOD detection, we learn a generative model of existing detection scores with a Gaussian mixture. By doing so, we present an ensemble approach that offers a more consistent and comprehensive solution for broad OOD detection, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. Our code to download BROAD and reproduce our experiments is publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "Automatically disentangling an author's style from the content of their writing is a longstanding and possibly insurmountable problem in computational linguistics. At the same time, the availability of large text corpora furnished with author labels has recently enabled learning authorship representations in a purely data-driven manner for authorship attribution, a task that ostensibly depends to a greater extent on encoding writing style than encoding content. However, success on this surrogate task does not ensure that such representations capture writing style since authorship could also be correlated with other latent variables, such as topic. In an effort to better understand the nature of the information these representations convey, and specifically to validate the hypothesis that they chiefly encode writing style, we systematically probe these representations through a series of targeted experiments. The results of these experiments suggest that representations learned for the surrogate authorship prediction task are indeed sensitive to writing style. As a consequence, authorship representations may be expected to be robust to certain kinds of data shift, such as topic drift over time. Additionally, our findings may open the door to downstream applications that require stylistic representations, such as style transfer. ",

However, their ability to surpass, particularly in terms of accuracy, classical discretization methods such as the finite element methods, remains a significant challenge. Deep learning methods usually struggle to reliably decrease the error in their approximate solution. A new methodology to better control the error for deep learning methods is presented here. The main idea consists in computing an initial approximation to the problem using a simple neural network and in estimating, in an iterative manner, a correction by solving the problem for the residual error with a new network of increasing complexity. This sequential reduction of the residual of the partial differential equation allows one to decrease the solution error, which, in some cases, can be reduced to machine precision. The underlying explanation is that the method is able to capture at each level smaller scales of the solution using a new network. Numerical examples in 1D and 2D are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This approach applies not only to physics informed neural networks but to other neural network solvers based on weak or strong formulations of the residual. ",

    "abstract": "Although deep pre-trained language models have shown promising benefit in a large set of industrial scenarios, including Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction, how to integrate pre-trained language models that handle only textual signals into a prediction pipeline with non-textual features is challenging. Up to now two directions have been explored to integrate multi-modal inputs in fine-tuning of pre-trained language models. One consists of fusing the outcome of language models and non-textual features through an aggregation layer, resulting into ensemble framework, where the cross-information between textual and non-textual inputs are only learned in the aggregation layer. The second one consists of splitting non-textual features into fine-grained fragments and transforming the fragments to new tokens combined with textual ones, so that they can be fed directly to transformer layers in language models. However, this approach increases the complexity of the learning and inference because of the numerous additional tokens. To address these limitations, we propose in this work a novel framework BERT4CTR, with the Uni-Attention mechanism that can benefit from the interactions between non-textual and textual features while maintaining low time-costs in training and inference through a dimensionality reduction. Comprehensive experiments on both public and commercial data demonstrate that BERT4CTR can outperform significantly the state-of-the-art frameworks to handle multi-modal inputs and be applicable to CTR prediction.

In this paper, we further explore the generation capacity of LMs for sound event detection (SED), beyond the visual domain. Specifically, we propose an elegant method that aligns audio features and text features to accomplish sound event classification and temporal location. The framework consists of an acoustic encoder, a contrastive module that align the corresponding representations of the text and audio, and a decoupled language decoder that generates temporal and event sequences from the audio characteristic. Compared with conventional works that require complicated processing and barely utilize limited audio features, our model is more concise and comprehensive since language model directly leverage its semantic capabilities to generate the sequences. We investigate different decoupling modules to demonstrate the effectiveness for timestamps capture and event classification.

The Error-Back-Propagation algorithm, proposed by William-Hinton-Rummelhart, has had the merit of favouring the development of machine learning techniques, which has permeated every branch of research and technology since the mid-1980s. This extraordinary success is largely due to the black-box approach, but this same factor was also seen as a limitation, as soon more challenging problems were approached. One of the most critical aspects of the training algorithms was that of local minima of the loss function, typically the mean squared error of the output on the training set. In fact, as the most popular training algorithms are driven by the derivatives of the loss function, there is no possibility to evaluate if a reached minimum is local or global. The algorithm presented in this paper avoids the problem of local minima, as the training is based on the properties of the distribution of the training set, or better on its image internal to the neural network. The performance of the algorithm is shown for a well-known benchmark. ",

While causal analyses focus on defining semantics and its quantification, the gradient-based approach is central to explainable AI (XAI), tackling the interpretation of the black box. By synergizing these approaches, the exploration of how a model's internal mechanisms illuminate its causal effect has become integral for evidence-based decision-making. A parallel line of research has revealed that intersectionality - the combinatory impact of multiple demographics of an individual - can be structured in the form of an Averaged Treatment Effect (ATE). Initially, this study illustrates that the hateful memes detection problem can be formulated as an ATE, assisted by the principles of intersectionality, and that a modality-wise summarization of gradient-based attention attribution scores can delineate the distinct behaviors of three Transformerbased models concerning ATE. Subsequently, we show that the latest LLM LLaMA2 has the ability to disentangle the intersectional nature of memes detection in an in-context learning setting, with their mechanistic properties elucidated via meta-gradient, a secondary form of gradient. In conclusion, this research contributes to the ongoing dialogue surrounding XAI and the multifaceted nature of ML models. ",

Current research focuses on how the model efficiency can be maintained by introducing sparsity but without compromising accuracy of the model in the robot grasping domain. More specifically, in this research two light-weighted neural networks have been introduced, namely Sparse-GRConvNet and Sparse-GINNet, which leverage sparsity in the robotic grasping domain for grasp pose generation by integrating the Edge-PopUp algorithm. This algorithm facilitates the identification of the top K% of edges by considering their respective score values. Both the Sparse-GRConvNet and Sparse-GINNet models are designed to generate high-quality grasp poses in real-time at every pixel location, enabling robots to effectively manipulate unfamiliar objects. We extensively trained our models using two benchmark datasets: Cornell Grasping Dataset (CGD) and Jacquard Grasping Dataset (JGD). Both Sparse-GRConvNet and Sparse-GINNet models outperform the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97.75% with only 10% of the weight of GR-ConvNet and 50% of the weight of GI-NNet, respectively, on CGD. Additionally, Sparse-GRConvNet achieve an accuracy of 85.77% with 30% of the weight of GR-ConvNet and Sparse-GINNet achieve an accuracy of 81.11% with 10% of the weight of GI-NNet on JGD.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) has also shown promise in improving visual recognition by learning invariant features. However, the combination of CLIP with SSL is found to face challenges due to the multi-task framework that blends CLIP's contrastive loss and SSL's loss, including difficulties with loss weighting and inconsistency among different views of images in CLIP's output space. To overcome these challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based model called GOPro, which is a unified framework that ensures similarity between various augmented views of input images in a shared image-text embedding space, using a pair of learnable image and text projectors atop CLIP, to promote invariance and generalizability. To automatically learn such prompts, we leverage the visual content and style primitives extracted from pre-trained CLIP and adapt them to the target task. In addition to CLIP's cross-domain contrastive loss, we introduce a visual contrastive loss and a novel prompt consistency loss, considering the different views of the images. GOPro is trained end-to-end on all three loss objectives, combining the strengths of CLIP and SSL in a principled manner. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GOPro outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting techniques on three challenging domain generalization tasks across multiple benchmarks by a significant margin.

However, current methane emission monitoring techniques primarily rely on approximate emission factors or self-reporting, which have been shown to often dramatically underestimate emissions. Although initially designed to monitor surface properties, satellite multispectral data has recently emerged as a powerful method to analyze atmospheric content. However, the spectral resolution of multispectral instruments is poor, and methane measurements are typically very noisy. Methane data products are also sensitive to absorption by the surface and other atmospheric gases (water vapor in particular) and therefore provide noisy maps of potential methane plumes, that typically require extensive human analysis. Here, we show that the image recognition capabilities of deep learning methods can be leveraged to automatize the detection of methane leaks in Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral data, with dramatically reduced false positive rates compared with state-of-the-art multispectral methane data products, and without the need for a priori knowledge of potential leak sites.

    "title": "Development of a Novel Quantum Pre-processing Filter to Improve Image  Classification Accuracy of Neural Network Models",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel quantum pre-processing filter (QPF) to improve the image classification accuracy of neural network (NN) models. A simple four qubit quantum circuit that uses Y rotation gates for encoding and two controlled NOT gates for creating correlation among the qubits is applied as a feature extraction filter prior to passing data into the fully connected NN architecture. By applying the QPF approach, the results show that the image classification accuracy based on the MNIST (handwritten 10 digits) and the EMNIST (handwritten 47 class digits and letters) datasets can be improved, from 92.5% to 95.4% and from 68.9% to 75.9%, respectively. These improvements were obtained without introducing extra model parameters or optimizations in the machine learning process. However, tests performed on the developed QPF approach against a relatively complex GTSRB dataset with 43 distinct class real-life traffic sign images showed a degradation in the classification accuracy. Considering this result, further research into the understanding and the design of a more suitable quantum circuit approach for image classification neural networks could be explored utilizing the baseline method proposed in this paper.

While classification algorithms are used to detect pronounced anomalies, in the case of smaller and frequent systematic anomalies, the algorithms may falter due to a variety of reasons, including technical ones as well as natural limitations of human analysts. Therefore, as the next step after classification, we convert the complaint narratives into quantitative data, which are then analyzed using an algorithm for detecting systematic anomalies. We illustrate the entire procedure using complaint narratives from the Consumer Complaint Database of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. They include a group of malignant neoplasms with a variety of biological, clinical, and histopathological characteristics. There are more than 35 different histological forms of breast lesions that can be classified and diagnosed histologically according to cell morphology, growth, and architecture patterns. Recently, deep learning, in the field of artificial intelligence, has drawn a lot of attention for the computerized representation of medical images. Searchable digital atlases can provide pathologists with patch matching tools allowing them to search among evidently diagnosed and treated archival cases, a technology that may be regarded as computational second opinion. In this study, we indexed and analyzed the WHO breast taxonomy (Classification of Tumours 5th Ed.) spanning 35 tumour types. We visualized all tumour types using deep features extracted from a state-of-the-art deep learning model, pre-trained on millions of diagnostic histopathology images from the TCGA repository. Furthermore, we test the concept of a digital \"atlas\" as a reference for search and matching with rare test cases. The patch similarity search within the WHO breast taxonomy data reached over 88% accuracy when validating through \"majority vote\" and more than 91% accuracy when validating using top-n tumour types. These results show for the first time that complex relationships among common and rare breast lesions can be investigated using an indexed digital archive. ",

    "abstract": "We investigate the concept of network momentum, a novel trading signal derived from momentum spillover across assets. Initially observed within the confines of pairwise economic and fundamental ties, such as the stock-bond connection of the same company and stocks linked through supply-demand chains, momentum spillover implies a propagation of momentum risk premium from one asset to another. The similarity of momentum risk premium, exemplified by co-movement patterns, has been spotted across multiple asset classes including commodities, equities, bonds and currencies. However, studying the network effect of momentum spillover across these classes has been challenging due to a lack of readily available common characteristics or economic ties beyond the company level. In this paper, we explore the interconnections of momentum features across a diverse range of 64 continuous future contracts spanning these four classes. We utilise a linear and interpretable graph learning model with minimal assumptions to reveal the intricacies of the momentum spillover network. By leveraging the learned networks, we construct a network momentum strategy that exhibits a Sharpe ratio of 1.5 and an annual return of 22%, after volatility scaling, from 2000 to 2022. This paper pioneers the examination of momentum spillover across multiple asset classes using only pricing data, presents a multi-asset investment strategy based on network momentum, and underscores the effectiveness of this strategy through robust empirical analysis.

We illustrate our method on four early markers of pancreatic cancer and validate it on a large independent test set. Our results highlight the value of combining non-redundant DLR and HCR features, as evidenced by an improvement in the Area Under the Curve compared to baseline methods that do not address redundancy or solely rely on HCR features.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an iterative distributionally robust model predictive control (MPC) scheme to solve a risk-constrained infinite-horizon optimal control problem. In each iteration, the algorithm generates a trajectory from the starting point to the target equilibrium state with the aim of respecting risk constraints with high probability (that encodes safe operation of the system) and improving the cost of the trajectory as compared to previous iterations. At the end of each iteration, the visited states and observed samples of the uncertainty are stored and accumulated with the previous observations. For each iteration, the states stored previously are considered as terminal constraints of the MPC scheme, and samples obtained thus far are used to construct distributionally robust risk constraints. As iterations progress, more data is obtained and the environment is explored progressively to ensure better safety and cost optimality. We prove that the MPC scheme in each iteration is recursively feasible and the resulting trajectories converge asymptotically to the target while ensuring safety with high probability. We identify conditions under which the cost-to-go reduces as iterations progress. For systems with locally one-step reachable target, we specify scenarios that ensure finite-time convergence of iterations. We provide computationally tractable reformulations of the risk constraints for total variation and Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity sets. A simulation example illustrates the application of our results in finding a risk-constrained path for two mobile robots facing an uncertain obstacle. ",

    "abstract": "Learning relies on coordinated synaptic changes in recurrently connected populations of neurons. Therefore, understanding the collective evolution of synaptic connectivity over learning is a key challenge in neuroscience and machine learning. In particular, recent work has shown that the weight matrices of task-trained RNNs are typically low rank, but how this low rank structure unfolds over learning is unknown. To address this, we investigate the rank of the 3-tensor formed by the weight matrices throughout learning. By fitting RNNs of varying rank to large-scale neural recordings during a motor learning task, we find that the inferred weights are low-tensor-rank and therefore evolve over a fixed low-dimensional subspace throughout the entire course of learning. We next validate the observation of low-tensor-rank learning on an RNN trained to solve the same task by performing a low-tensor-rank decomposition directly on the ground truth weights, and by showing that the method we applied to the data faithfully recovers this low rank structure. Finally, we present a set of mathematical results bounding the matrix and tensor ranks of gradient descent learning dynamics which show that low-tensor-rank weights emerge naturally in RNNs trained to solve low-dimensional tasks. Taken together, our findings provide novel constraints on the evolution of population connectivity over learning in both biological and artificial neural networks, and enable reverse engineering of learning-induced changes in recurrent network dynamics from large-scale neural recordings.
