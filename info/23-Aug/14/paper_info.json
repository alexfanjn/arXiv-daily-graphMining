    "title": "Turning hazardous volatile matter compounds into fuel by catalytic steam  reforming: An evolutionary machine learning approach",
    "abstract": "Chemical and biomass processing systems release volatile matter compounds into the environment daily. Catalytic reforming can convert these compounds into valuable fuels, but developing stable and efficient catalysts is challenging. Machine learning can handle complex relationships in big data and optimize reaction conditions, making it an effective solution for addressing the mentioned issues. This study is the first to develop a machine-learning-based research framework for modeling, understanding, and optimizing the catalytic steam reforming of volatile matter compounds. Toluene catalytic steam reforming is used as a case study to show how chemical/textural analyses (e.g., X-ray diffraction analysis) can be used to obtain input features for machine learning models. Literature is used to compile a database covering a variety of catalyst characteristics and reaction conditions. The process is thoroughly analyzed, mechanistically discussed, modeled by six machine learning models, and optimized using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Ensemble machine learning provides the best prediction performance (R2 > 0.976) for toluene conversion and product distribution. The optimal tar conversion (higher than 77.2%) is obtained at temperatures between 637.44 and 725.62 {\\deg}C, with a steam-to-carbon molar ratio of 5.81-7.15 and a catalyst BET surface area 476.03-638.55 m2/g. The feature importance analysis satisfactorily reveals the effects of input descriptors on model prediction. Operating conditions (50.9%) and catalyst properties (49.1%) are equally important in modeling. The developed framework can expedite the search for optimal catalyst characteristics and reaction conditions, not only for catalytic chemical processing but also for related research areas. ",

    "abstract": "Heart failure is a life-threatening condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The ability to accurately predict patient survival can aid in early intervention and improve patient outcomes. In this study, we explore the potential of utilizing data pre-processing techniques and the Extra-Tree (ET) feature selection method in conjunction with the Random Forest (RF) classifier to improve survival prediction in heart failure patients. By leveraging the strengths of ET feature selection, we aim to identify the most significant predictors associated with heart failure survival. Using the public UCL Heart failure (HF) survival dataset, we employ the ET feature selection algorithm to identify the most informative features. These features are then used as input for grid search of RF. Finally, the tuned RF Model was trained and evaluated using different matrices. The approach was achieved 98.33% accuracy that is the highest over the exiting work. ",

    "abstract": "Classifying fine-grained lesions is challenging due to minor and subtle differences in medical images. This is because learning features of fine-grained lesions with highly minor differences is very difficult in training deep neural networks. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Fine-Grained Self-Supervised Learning(FG-SSL) method for classifying subtle lesions in medical images. The proposed method progressively learns the model through hierarchical block such that the cross-correlation between the fine-grained Jigsaw puzzle and regularized original images is close to the identity matrix. We also apply hierarchical block for progressive fine-grained learning, which extracts different information in each step, to supervised learning for discovering subtle differences. Our method does not require an asymmetric model, nor does a negative sampling strategy, and is not sensitive to batch size. We evaluate the proposed fine-grained self-supervised learning method on comprehensive experiments using various medical image recognition datasets. In our experiments, the proposed method performs favorably compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches on the widely-used ISIC2018, APTOS2019, and ISIC2017 datasets. ",

    "abstract": "We depend on our own memory to encode, store, and retrieve our experiences. However, memory lapses can occur. One promising avenue for achieving memory augmentation is through the use of augmented reality head-mounted displays to capture and preserve egocentric videos, a practice commonly referred to as life logging. However, a significant challenge arises from the sheer volume of video data generated through life logging, as the current technology lacks the capability to encode and store such large amounts of data efficiently. Further, retrieving specific information from extensive video archives requires substantial computational power, further complicating the task of quickly accessing desired content. To address these challenges, we propose a memory augmentation system that involves leveraging natural language encoding for video data and storing them in a vector database. This approach harnesses the power of large vision language models to perform the language encoding process. Additionally, we propose using large language models to facilitate natural language querying. Our system underwent extensive evaluation using the QA-Ego4D dataset and achieved state-of-the-art results with a BLEU score of 8.3, outperforming conventional machine learning models that scored between 3.4 and 5.8. Additionally, in a user study, our system received a higher mean response score of 4.13/5 compared to the human participants' score of 2.46/5 on real-life episodic memory tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is revolutionizing how we learn from data. With its growing popularity, it is now being used in many safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles and healthcare. Since thousands of participants can contribute in this collaborative setting, it is, however, challenging to ensure security and reliability of such systems. This highlights the need to design FL systems that are secure and robust against malicious participants' actions while also ensuring high utility, privacy of local data, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel FL framework dubbed as FLShield that utilizes benign data from FL participants to validate the local models before taking them into account for generating the global model. This is in stark contrast with existing defenses relying on server's access to clean datasets -- an assumption often impractical in real-life scenarios and conflicting with the fundamentals of FL. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our FLShield framework in different settings and demonstrate its effectiveness in thwarting various types of poisoning and backdoor attacks including a defense-aware one. FLShield also preserves privacy of local data against gradient inversion attacks. ",

In this paper, we introduce a novel stochastic geometry-based framework for the analysis of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and rate coverage in a multi-tier hybrid mmWave and THz network, where each tier has a particular base station (BS) density, transmit power, bandwidth, number of BS antennas, and cell-association bias factor. The proposed framework incorporates the effects of mmWave and THz channel characteristics, BS beamforming gain, and blockages. We investigate the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) decoupled cell-association strategy and characterise the per-tier cell-association probability. Based on that, we analytically derive the SINR and rate coverage probabilities of a typical user for both DL and UL transmissions. The analytical results are validated via extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the DL and UL decoupled cell-association strategy in terms of SINR and rate coverage over its coupled counterpart. Moreover, we observe that the superiority of using the DL and UL decoupled cell-association strategy becomes more evident with the dense deployment of THz networks. ",

    "abstract": "High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) of seeds, also known as seed phenotyping, is the comprehensive assessment of complex seed traits such as growth, development, tolerance, resistance, ecology, yield, and the measurement of parameters that form more complex traits. One of the key aspects of seed phenotyping is cereal yield estimation that the seed production industry relies upon to conduct their business. While mechanized seed kernel counters are available in the market currently, they are often priced high and sometimes outside the range of small scale seed production firms' affordability. The development of object tracking neural network models such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) enables computer scientists to design algorithms that can estimate cereal yield inexpensively. The key bottleneck with neural network models is that they require a plethora of labelled training data before they can be put to task. We demonstrate that the use of synthetic imagery serves as a feasible substitute to train neural networks for object tracking that includes the tasks of object classification and detection. Furthermore, we propose a seed kernel counter that uses a low-cost mechanical hopper, trained YOLOv8 neural network model, and object tracking algorithms on StrongSORT and ByteTrack to estimate cereal yield from videos. The experiment yields a seed kernel count with an accuracy of 95.2\\% and 93.2\\% for Soy and Wheat respectively using the StrongSORT algorithm, and an accuray of 96.8\\% and 92.4\\% for Soy and Wheat respectively using the ByteTrack algorithm.

State-of-the-art lacks efficient performance and resource management techniques necessary to either maximize total system throughput or minimize end-to-end workload latency. In this work, we propose HaX-CoNN, a novel scheme that characterizes and maps layers in concurrently executing DNN inference workloads to a diverse set of accelerators within a SoC. Our scheme uniquely takes per-layer execution characteristics, shared memory (SM) contention, and inter-accelerator transitions into account to find optimal schedules. We evaluate HaX-CoNN on NVIDIA Orin, NVIDIA Xavier, and Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoCs. Our experimental results indicate that HaX-CoNN minimizes memory contention by up to 45% and can improve latency and total throughput by up to 32% and 29%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "Aphid infestation poses a significant threat to crop production, rural communities, and global food security. While chemical pest control is crucial for maximizing yields, applying chemicals across entire fields is both environmentally unsustainable and costly. Hence, precise localization and management of aphids are essential for targeted pesticide application. The paper primarily focuses on using deep learning models for detecting aphid clusters. We propose a novel approach for estimating infection levels by detecting aphid clusters. To facilitate this research, we have captured a large-scale dataset from sorghum fields, manually selected 5,447 images containing aphids, and annotated each individual aphid cluster within these images. To facilitate the use of machine learning models, we further process the images by cropping them into patches, resulting in a labeled dataset comprising 151,380 image patches. Then, we implemented and compared the performance of four state-of-the-art object detection models (VFNet, GFLV2, PAA, and ATSS) on the aphid dataset. Extensive experimental results show that all models yield stable similar performance in terms of average precision and recall. We then propose to merge close neighboring clusters and remove tiny clusters caused by cropping, and the performance is further boosted by around 17%. The study demonstrates the feasibility of automatically detecting and managing insects using machine learning models. The labeled dataset will be made openly available to the research community. ",

Many works have been done to summarize the taxonomy of these patterns and some have tried to mitigate the problems through various techniques. However, these techniques are either time-consuming, not generalisable or limited to specific patterns. To address these issues, we propose UIGuard, a knowledge-driven system that utilizes computer vision and natural language pattern matching to automatically detect a wide range of dark patterns in mobile UIs. Our system relieves the need for manually creating rules for each new UI/app and covers more types with superior performance. In detail, we integrated existing taxonomies into a consistent one, conducted a characteristic analysis and distilled knowledge from real-world examples and the taxonomy. Our UIGuard consists of two components, Property Extraction and Knowledge-Driven Dark Pattern Checker. We collected the first dark pattern dataset, which contains 4,999 benign UIs and 1,353 malicious UIs of 1,660 instances spanning 1,023 mobile apps. Our system achieves a superior performance in detecting dark patterns (micro averages: 0.82 in precision, 0.77 in recall, 0.79 in F1 score).

    "abstract": "Traditional deep learning (DL) models are powerful classifiers, but many approaches do not provide uncertainties for their estimates. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for DL models have received increased attention in the literature due to their usefulness in decision making, particularly for high-consequence decisions. However, there has been little research done on how to evaluate the quality of such methods. We use statistical methods of frequentist interval coverage and interval width to evaluate the quality of credible intervals, and expected calibration error to evaluate classification predicted confidence. These metrics are evaluated on Bayesian neural networks (BNN) fit using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), bootstrapped neural networks (NN), Deep Ensembles (DE), and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. We apply these different UQ for DL methods to a hyperspectral image target detection problem and show the inconsistency of the different methods' results and the necessity of a UQ quality metric. To reconcile these differences and choose a UQ method that appropriately quantifies the uncertainty, we create a simulated data set with fully parameterized probability distribution for a two-class classification problem. The gold standard MCMC performs the best overall, and the bootstrapped NN is a close second, requiring the same computational expense as DE. Through this comparison, we demonstrate that, for a given data set, different models can produce uncertainty estimates of markedly different quality. This in turn points to a great need for principled assessment methods of UQ quality in DL applications. ",

Recent work shows that the gradient of an INR can be used to edit the data it represents directly without needing to convert it back to a discrete representation. However, given a function represented as a computation graph, traditional architectures face challenges in efficiently computing its nth-order gradient due to the higher demand for computing power and higher complexity in data movement. This makes it a promising target for FPGA acceleration. In this work, we introduce INR-Arch, a framework that transforms the computation graph of an nth-order gradient into a hardware-optimized dataflow architecture. We address this problem in two phases. First, we design a dataflow architecture that uses FIFO streams and an optimized computation kernel library, ensuring high memory efficiency and parallel computation. Second, we propose a compiler that extracts and optimizes computation graphs, automatically configures hardware parameters such as latency and stream depths to optimize throughput, while ensuring deadlock-free operation, and outputs High-Level Synthesis (HLS) code for FPGA implementation. We utilize INR editing as our benchmark, presenting results that demonstrate 1.8-4.8x and 1.5-3.6x speedup compared to CPU and GPU baselines respectively. Furthermore, we obtain 3.1-8.9x and 1.7-4.3x lower memory usage, and 1.7-11.3x and 5.5-32.8x lower energy-delay product. Our framework will be made open-source and available on GitHub. ",

    "abstract": "We present VERF, a collection of two methods (VERF-PnP and VERF-Light) for providing runtime assurance on the correctness of a camera pose estimate of a monocular camera without relying on direct depth measurements. We leverage the ability of NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) to render novel RGB perspectives of a scene. We only require as input the camera image whose pose is being estimated, an estimate of the camera pose we want to monitor, and a NeRF model containing the scene pictured by the camera. We can then predict if the pose estimate is within a desired distance from the ground truth and justify our prediction with a level of confidence. VERF-Light does this by rendering a viewpoint with NeRF at the estimated pose and estimating its relative offset to the sensor image up to scale. Since scene scale is unknown, the approach renders another auxiliary image and reasons over the consistency of the optical flows across the three images. VERF-PnP takes a different approach by rendering a stereo pair of images with NeRF and utilizing the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm. We evaluate both methods on the LLFF dataset, on data from a Unitree A1 quadruped robot, and on data collected from Blue Origin's sub-orbital New Shepard rocket to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pose monitoring method across a range of scene scales. We also show monitoring can be completed in under half a second on a 3090 GPU. ",

    "abstract": "Increasing attention has been paid to resources on islands, thus microgrids on islands need to be invested. Different from onshore microgrids, offshore microgrids (OM) are usually abundant in ocean renewable energy (ORE), such as offshore wind, tidal power generation (TPG), etc. Moreover, some special loads such as seawater desalination unit (SDU) should be included. In this sense, this paper proposes a planning method for OM to minimize the investment cost while the ORE's fluctuation could be accommodated with robustness. First, a deterministic planning model (DPM) is formulated for the OM with TPG and SDU. A robust planning model (RPM) is then developed considering the uncertainties from both TPG and load demand. The Column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm is then employed to solve the RPM, producing planning results for the OM that is robust against the worst scenario. Results of the case studies show that the investment and operation decisions of the proposed model are robust, and TPG shows good complementarity with the other RESs. ",

While many previous studies have focused on cross-modal matching between hand-drawn sketches and 3D shapes, the critical issue of how to handle low-quality and noisy samples in sketch data has been largely neglected. This paper presents an uncertainty-aware cross-modal transfer network (UACTN) that addresses this issue. UACTN decouples the representation learning of sketches and 3D shapes into two separate tasks: classification-based sketch uncertainty learning and 3D shape feature transfer. We first introduce an end-to-end classification-based approach that simultaneously learns sketch features and uncertainty, allowing uncertainty to prevent overfitting noisy sketches by assigning different levels of importance to clean and noisy sketches. Then, 3D shape features are mapped into the pre-learned sketch embedding space for feature alignment. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Representing nodes in a network as dense vectors node embeddings is important for understanding a given network and solving many downstream tasks. In particular, for weighted homophilous graphs where similar nodes are connected with larger edge weights, we desire node embeddings where node pairs with strong weights have closer embeddings. Although random walk based node embedding methods like node2vec and node2vec+ do work for weighted networks via including edge weights in the walk transition probabilities, our experiments show that the embedding result does not adequately reflect edge weights. In this paper, we propose ARGEW (Augmentation of Random walks by Graph Edge Weights), a novel augmentation method for random walks that expands the corpus in such a way that nodes with larger edge weights end up with closer embeddings. ARGEW can work with any random walk based node embedding method, because it is independent of the random sampling strategy itself and works on top of the already-performed walks. With several real-world networks, we demonstrate that with ARGEW, compared to not using it, the desired pattern that node pairs with larger edge weights have closer embeddings is much clearer. We also examine ARGEW's performance in node classification: node2vec with ARGEW outperforms pure node2vec and is not sensitive to hyperparameters (i.e. consistently good). In fact, it achieves similarly good results as supervised GCN, even without any node feature or label information during training. Finally, we explain why ARGEW works consistently well by exploring the coappearance distributions using a synthetic graph with clear structural roles. ",

However, these methods follow the CNN-based two-stage paradigm with limited feature extraction ability, and often rely on auxiliary information for better performance. Without introducing any additional information, we creatively propose a transformer-based framework for compositional HOI learning. Human-object pair representations and interaction representations are re-composed across different HOI instances, which involves richer contextual information and promotes the generalization of knowledge.

While numerous machine learning models adopting this two-step procedure have been developed, there has not been an end-to-end model that can identify teeth and their associated diseases at the same time. To fill the gap, we develop YOLOrtho, a unified framework for teeth enumeration and dental disease detection. We develop our model on Dentex Challenge 2023 data, which consists of three distinct types of annotated data. The first part is labeled with quadrant, and the second part is labeled with quadrant and enumeration and the third part is labeled with quadrant, enumeration and disease. To further improve detection, we make use of Tufts Dental public dataset. To fully utilize the data and learn both teeth detection and disease identification simultaneously, we formulate diseases as attributes attached to their corresponding teeth. Due to the nature of position relation in teeth enumeration, We replace convolution layer with CoordConv in our model to provide more position information for the model. We also adjust the model architecture and insert one more upsampling layer in FPN in favor of large object detection. Finally, we propose a post-process strategy for teeth layout that corrects teeth enumeration based on linear sum assignment.

    "abstract": "Billions of people are sharing their daily live images on social media everyday. However, malicious collectors use deep face recognition systems to easily steal their biometric information (e.g., faces) from these images. Some studies are being conducted to generate encrypted face photos using adversarial attacks by introducing imperceptible perturbations to reduce face information leakage. However, existing studies need stronger black-box scenario feasibility and more natural visual appearances, which challenge the feasibility of privacy protection. To address these problems, we propose a frequency-restricted identity-agnostic (FRIA) framework to encrypt face images from unauthorized face recognition without access to personal information. As for the weak black-box scenario feasibility, we obverse that representations of the average feature in multiple face recognition models are similar, thus we propose to utilize the average feature via the crawled dataset from the Internet as the target to guide the generation, which is also agnostic to identities of unknown face recognition systems; in nature, the low-frequency perturbations are more visually perceptible by the human vision system. Inspired by this, we restrict the perturbation in the low-frequency facial regions by discrete cosine transform to achieve the visual naturalness guarantee. Extensive experiments on several face recognition models demonstrate that our FRIA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in generating more natural encrypted faces while attaining high black-box attack success rates of 96%. In addition, we validate the efficacy of FRIA using real-world black-box commercial API, which reveals the potential of FRIA in practice. Our codes can be found in https://github.com/XinDong10/FRIA.

We thus provide formal definitions for two kinds of robustness, namely label robustness and pure robustness. Secondly, as previous works fail to consider robustness about all points in a disturbance interval, we utilise a probably approximately correct (PAC) framework for robustness verification. Additionally, this framework can not only identify potential counterexamples, but also provides interpretable analyses of the original methods. Our approach is applied using a prototype tool named TrajPAC. With TrajPAC, we evaluate the robustness of four state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models -- Trajectron++, MemoNet, AgentFormer, and MID -- on trajectories from five scenes of the ETH/UCY dataset and scenes of the Stanford Drone Dataset.

This domain gap leads to missing detections for densely observed objects, misaligned confidence scores, and increased high-confidence false positives, rendering the detector highly unreliable. To address this, we introduce MS3D++, a self-training framework for multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation in 3D object detection. MS3D++ provides a straightforward approach to domain adaptation by generating high-quality pseudo-labels, enabling the adaptation of 3D detectors to a diverse range of lidar types, regardless of their density. Our approach effectively fuses predictions of an ensemble of multi-frame pre-trained detectors from different source domains to improve domain generalization. We subsequently refine the predictions temporally to ensure temporal consistency in box localization and object classification. Furthermore, we present an in-depth study into the performance and idiosyncrasies of various 3D detector components in a cross-domain context, providing valuable insights for improved cross-domain detector ensembling. Experimental results on Waymo, nuScenes and Lyft demonstrate that detectors trained with MS3D++ pseudo-labels achieve state-of-the-art performance, comparable to training with human-annotated labels in Bird's Eye View (BEV) evaluation for both low and high density lidar.

In this work, we explore how to ameliorate the quality of pseudo-labeling in MIDN. Formally, we devise Cyclic-Bootstrap Labeling (CBL), a novel weakly supervised object detection pipeline, which optimizes MIDN with rank information from a reliable teacher network. Specifically, we obtain this teacher network by introducing a weighted exponential moving average strategy to take advantage of various refinement modules. A novel class-specific ranking distillation algorithm is proposed to leverage the output of weighted ensembled teacher network for distilling MIDN with rank information. As a result, MIDN is guided to assign higher scores to accurate proposals among their neighboring ones, thus benefiting the subsequent pseudo labeling.

Recent deep MTL methods for RS (e.g. MMoE, PLE) focus on designing soft gating-based parameter-sharing networks that implicitly learn a generalized representation for each task. However, MTL methods may suffer from performance degeneration when dealing with conflicting tasks, as negative transfer effects can occur on the task-shared bottom representation. This can result in a reduced capacity for MTL methods to capture task-specific characteristics, ultimately impeding their effectiveness and hindering the ability to generalize well on all tasks. In this paper, we focus on the bottom representation learning of MTL in RS and propose the Deep Task-specific Bottom Representation Network (DTRN) to alleviate the negative transfer problem. DTRN obtains task-specific bottom representation explicitly by making each task has its own representation learning network in the bottom representation modeling stage. Specifically, it extracts the user's interests from multiple types of behavior sequences for each task through the parameter-efficient hypernetwork. To further obtain the dedicated representation for each task, DTRN refines the representation of each feature by employing a SENet-like network for each task. The two proposed modules can achieve the purpose of getting task-specific bottom representation to relieve tasks' mutual interference. Moreover, the proposed DTRN is flexible to combine with existing MTL methods. Experiments on one public dataset and one industrial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DTRN. Furthermore, we deploy DTRN in an industrial recommender system and gain remarkable improvements in multiple tasks. ",

To address these problems, we propose a simple and effective method called Stochastic Gradient Aggregation (SGA), which alleviates the gradient vanishing and escapes from poor local optima at the same time. Specifically, SGA employs the small-batch training to perform multiple iterations of inner pre-search. Then, all the inner gradients are aggregated as a one-step gradient estimation to enhance the gradient stability and reduce quantization errors.

In this paper, we highlight the importance of context information on user behavior modeling and propose a novel model named Deep Context Interest Network (DCIN), which integrally models the click and its display context to learn users' context-aware interests. DCIN consists of three key modules: 1) Position-aware Context Aggregation Module (PCAM), which performs aggregation of display items with an attention mechanism; 2) Feedback-Context Fusion Module (FCFM), which fuses the representation of clicks and display contexts through non-linear feature interaction; 3) Interest Matching Module (IMM), which activates interests related with the target item. Moreover, we provide our hands-on solution to implement our DCIN model on large-scale industrial systems. The significant improvements in both offline and online evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DCIN method.

In this paper, we focus on a particular setting of learning adaptive prompts on the fly for each test sample from an unseen new domain, which is known as test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Existing TPT methods typically rely on data augmentation and confidence selection. However, conventional data augmentation techniques, e.g., random resized crops, suffers from the lack of data diversity, while entropy-based confidence selection alone is not sufficient to guarantee prediction fidelity. To address these issues, we propose a novel TPT method, named DiffTPT, which leverages pre-trained diffusion models to generate diverse and informative new data. Specifically, we incorporate augmented data by both conventional method and pre-trained stable diffusion to exploit their respective merits, improving the models ability to adapt to unknown new test data. Moreover, to ensure the prediction fidelity of generated data, we introduce a cosine similarity-based filtration technique to select the generated data with higher similarity to the single test sample. Our experiments on test datasets with distribution shifts and unseen categories demonstrate that DiffTPT improves the zero-shot accuracy by an average of 5.13\\% compared to the state-of-the-art TPT method.

    "title": "Going Deep and Going Wide: Counting Logic and Homomorphism  Indistinguishability over Graphs of Bounded Treedepth and Treewidth",
    "abstract": "We study the expressive power of first-order logic with counting quantifiers, especially the $k$-variable and quantifier-rank-$q$ fragment $\\mathsf{C}^k_q$, using homomorphism indistinguishability. Recently, Dawar, Jakl, and Reggio (2021) proved that two graphs satisfy the same $\\mathsf{C}^k_q$-sentences if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class $\\mathcal{T}^k_q$ of graphs admitting a $k$-pebble forest cover of depth $q$. Their proof builds on the categorical framework of game comonads developed by Abramsky, Dawar, and Wang (2017). We reprove their result using elementary techniques inspired by Dvo\\v{r}\\'ak (2010). Using these techniques we also give a characterisation of guarded counting logic. Our main focus, however, is to provide a graph theoretic analysis of the graph class $\\mathcal{T}^k_q$. This allows us to separate $\\mathcal{T}^k_q$ from the intersection of the graph class $\\mathcal{TW}_{k-1}$, that is graphs of treewidth less or equal $k-1$, and $\\mathcal{TD}_q$, that is graphs of treedepth at most $q$ if $q$ is sufficiently larger than $k$. We are able to lift this separation to the semantic separation of the respective homomorphism indistinguishability relations. A part of this separation is to prove that the class $\\mathcal{TD}_q$ is homomorphism distinguishing closed, which was already conjectured by Roberson (2022). ",

    "title": "Adaptive SGD with Polyak stepsize and Line-search: Robust Convergence  and Variance Reduction",
    "abstract": "The recently proposed stochastic Polyak stepsize (SPS) and stochastic line-search (SLS) for SGD have shown remarkable effectiveness when training over-parameterized models. However, in non-interpolation settings, both algorithms only guarantee convergence to a neighborhood of a solution which may result in a worse output than the initial guess. While artificially decreasing the adaptive stepsize has been proposed to address this issue (Orvieto et al. [2022]), this approach results in slower convergence rates for convex and over-parameterized models. In this work, we make two contributions: Firstly, we propose two new variants of SPS and SLS, called AdaSPS and AdaSLS, which guarantee convergence in non-interpolation settings and maintain sub-linear and linear convergence rates for convex and strongly convex functions when training over-parameterized models. AdaSLS requires no knowledge of problem-dependent parameters, and AdaSPS requires only a lower bound of the optimal function value as input. Secondly, we equip AdaSPS and AdaSLS with a novel variance reduction technique and obtain algorithms that require $\\smash{\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}}(n+1/\\epsilon)$ gradient evaluations to achieve an $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)$-suboptimality for convex functions, which improves upon the slower $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$ rates of AdaSPS and AdaSLS without variance reduction in the non-interpolation regimes. Moreover, our result matches the fast rates of AdaSVRG but removes the inner-outer-loop structure, which is easier to implement and analyze. Finally, numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate our theory and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms. ",

In this paper, we further explore this idea by evaluating with context-aware pronoun translation test set by training multi-encoder models trained on three different context settings viz, previous two sentences, random two sentences, and a mix of both as context. Specifically, we evaluate the models on the ContraPro test set to study how different contexts affect pronoun translation accuracy. The results show that the model can perform well on the ContraPro test set even when the context is random. We also analyze the source representations to study whether the context encoder generates noise. Our analysis shows that the context encoder provides sufficient information to learn discourse-level information. Additionally, we observe that mixing the selected context (the previous two sentences in this case) and the random context is generally better than the other settings. ",

In contrast to prior work, we address the uncertainty due to lack of knowledge, which is relevant for the detection of data not represented by the training distribution, the so-called out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Motivated by anomaly detection, we propose to detect OOD images from an encoder-decoder depth estimation model based on the reconstruction error. Given the features extracted with the fixed depth encoder, we train an image decoder for image reconstruction using only in-distribution data. Consequently, OOD images result in a high reconstruction error, which we use to distinguish between in- and out-of-distribution samples. We built our experiments on the standard NYU Depth V2 and KITTI benchmarks as in-distribution data. Our post hoc method performs astonishingly well on different models and outperforms existing uncertainty estimation approaches without modifying the trained encoder-decoder depth estimation model. ",

    "abstract": "The Helmholtz equation is related to seismic exploration, sonar, antennas, and medical imaging applications. It is one of the most challenging problems to solve in terms of accuracy and convergence due to the scalability issues of the numerical solvers. For 3D large-scale applications, high-performance parallel solvers are also needed. In this paper, a matrix-free parallel iterative solver is presented for the three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous Helmholtz equation. We consider the preconditioned Krylov subspace methods for solving the linear system obtained from finite-difference discretization. The Complex Shifted Laplace Preconditioner (CSLP) is employed since it results in a linear increase in the number of iterations as a function of the wavenumber. The preconditioner is approximately inverted using one parallel 3D multigrid cycle. For parallel computing, the global domain is partitioned blockwise. The matrix-vector multiplication and preconditioning operator are implemented in a matrix-free way instead of constructing large, memory-consuming coefficient matrices. Numerical experiments of 3D model problems demonstrate the robustness and outstanding strong scaling of our matrix-free parallel solution method. Moreover, the weak parallel scalability indicates our approach is suitable for realistic 3D heterogeneous Helmholtz problems with minimized pollution error. ",

While the audio modality provides spatial cues to locate the sound source, existing approaches only use audio as an auxiliary role to compare spatial regions of the visual modality. Humans, on the other hand, utilize both audio and visual modalities as spatial cues to locate sound sources. In this paper, we propose an audio-visual spatial integration network that integrates spatial cues from both modalities to mimic human behavior when detecting sound-making objects. Additionally, we introduce a recursive attention network to mimic human behavior of iterative focusing on objects, resulting in more accurate attention regions. To effectively encode spatial information from both modalities, we propose audio-visual pair matching loss and spatial region alignment loss. By utilizing the spatial cues of audio-visual modalities and recursively focusing objects, our method can perform more robust sound source localization. Comprehensive experimental results on the Flickr SoundNet and VGG-Sound Source datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing approaches.

We further investigate a model estimation method under a complex setting, where we want to infer the posterior distribution of the time lags and understand how this distribution varies across different scenarios. We treat the time lags as latent variables and formulate a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution of the time lags. By explicitly modeling the time lags in Hawkes processes, we add flexibility to the model. The inferred time-lag posterior distributions are of scientific meaning and help trace the original causal time that supports the root cause analysis. We empirically evaluate our model's event prediction and time-lag inference accuracy on synthetic and real data, achieving promising results. ",

However, deep neural networks are facing security threats from backdoor attacks and can be manipulated into attacker-decided behaviors by the backdoor attacker. To defend the backdoor, prior research has focused on using clean data to remove backdoor attacks before model deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of defending against backdoor attacks at test time by utilizing partially poisoned data to remove the backdoor from the model. To address the problem, a two-stage method Test-Time Backdoor Defense (TTBD) is proposed. In the first stage, we propose two backdoor sample detection methods, namely DDP and TeCo, to identify poisoned samples from a batch of mixed, partially poisoned samples. Once the poisoned samples are detected, we employ Shapley estimation to calculate the contribution of each neuron's significance in the network, locate the poisoned neurons, and prune them to remove backdoor in the models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTBD removes the backdoor successfully with only a batch of partially poisoned data across different model architectures and datasets against different types of backdoor attacks.

Despite the recent advances in VSR, current approaches rely on labeled data to fully train or finetune their models predicting the target speech. This hinders their ability to generalize well beyond the training set and leads to performance degeneration under out-of-distribution challenging scenarios. Unlike previous works that involve auxiliary losses or complex training procedures and architectures, we propose a simple approach, named Lip2Vec that is based on learning a prior model. Given a robust visual speech encoder, this network maps the encoded latent representations of the lip sequence to their corresponding latents from the audio pair, which are sufficiently invariant for effective text decoding. The generated audio representation is then decoded to text using an off-the-shelf Audio Speech Recognition (ASR) model. The proposed model compares favorably with fully-supervised learning methods on the LRS3 dataset achieving 26 WER. Unlike SoTA approaches, our model keeps a reasonable performance on the VoxCeleb test set. We believe that reprogramming the VSR as an ASR task narrows the performance gap between the two and paves the way for more flexible formulations of lip reading. ",

    "abstract": "Stochastic gradient methods have been a popular and powerful choice of optimization methods, aimed at minimizing functions. Their advantage lies in the fact that that one approximates the gradient as opposed to using the full Jacobian matrix. One research direction, related to this, has been on the application to infinite-dimensional problems, where one may naturally have a Hilbert space framework. However, there has been limited work done on considering this in a more general setup, such as where the natural framework is that of a Banach space. This article aims to address this by the introduction of a novel stochastic method, the stochastic steepest descent method (SSD). The SSD will follow the spirit of stochastic gradient descent, which utilizes Riesz representation to identify gradients and derivatives. Our choice for using such a method is that it naturally allows one to adopt a Banach space setting, for which recent applications have exploited the benefit of this, such as in PDE-constrained shape optimization. We provide a convergence theory related to this under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of this method on a couple of numerical applications, namely a $p$-Laplacian and an optimal control problem. Our assumptions are verified in these applications. ",

We compare two epistemic and two aleatoric UQ methods on both temporal and spatio-temporal transfer tasks, and find that meaningful uncertainty estimates can be recovered. We further demonstrate how uncertainty estimates can be employed for unsupervised outlier detection on changes in city traffic dynamics. We find that our approach can capture both temporal and spatial effects on traffic behaviour in a representative case study for the city of Moscow. Our work presents a further step towards boosting uncertainty awareness in traffic prediction tasks, and aims to highlight the value contribution of UQ methods to a better understanding of city traffic dynamics.

In decision phase, traffic volumes on a coming day at network-wide toll stations would be achieved effectively, which is especially calibrated for vital few highway stations.

Conditioning the Transformer encoder on multiple target inferences over the same corpus, i.e., intent and multiple slot types, allows learning richer language interactions than a single-task model would be able to. In fact, experimental results demonstrate that conditioning the model on an increasing number of dialogue inference tasks leads to improved results: on the MultiWOZ dataset, the joint intent and slot detection can be improved by 3.2\\% by conditioning on intent, 10.8\\% by conditioning on slot and 14.4\\% by conditioning on both intent and slots.

    "title": "Noise-Resilient Designs for Optical Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "All analog signal processing is fundamentally subject to noise, and this is also the case in modern implementations of Optical Neural Networks (ONNs). Therefore, to mitigate noise in ONNs, we propose two designs that are constructed from a given, possibly trained, Neural Network (NN) that one wishes to implement. Both designs have the capability that the resulting ONNs gives outputs close to the desired NN. To establish the latter, we analyze the designs mathematically. Specifically, we investigate a probabilistic framework for the first design that establishes that the design is correct, i.e., for any feed-forward NN with Lipschitz continuous activation functions, an ONN can be constructed that produces output arbitrarily close to the original. ONNs constructed with the first design thus also inherit the universal approximation property of NNs. For the second design, we restrict the analysis to NNs with linear activation functions and characterize the ONNs' output distribution using exact formulas. Finally, we report on numerical experiments with LeNet ONNs that give insight into the number of components required in these designs for certain accuracy gains. We specifically study the effect of noise as a function of the depth of an ONN. The results indicate that in practice, adding just a few components in the manner of the first or the second design can already be expected to increase the accuracy of ONNs considerably. ",

    "abstract": "Complex emotion recognition is a cognitive task that has so far eluded the same excellent performance of other tasks that are at or above the level of human cognition. Emotion recognition through facial expressions is particularly difficult due to the complexity of emotions expressed by the human face. For a machine to approach the same level of performance in this domain as a human, it may need to synthesise knowledge and understand new concepts in real-time as humans do. Humans are able to learn new concepts using only few examples, by distilling the important information from memories and discarding the rest. Similarly, continual learning methods learn new classes whilst retaining the knowledge of known classes, whilst few-shot learning methods are able to learn new classes using very few training examples. We propose a novel continual learning method inspired by human cognition and learning that can accurately recognise new compound expression classes using few training samples, by building on and retaining its knowledge of basic expression classes. Using GradCAM visualisations, we demonstrate the relationship between basic and compound facial expressions, which our method leverages through knowledge distillation and a novel Predictive Sorting Memory Replay. Our method achieves the current state-of-the-art in continual learning for complex facial expression recognition with 74.28% Overall Accuracy on new classes. We also demonstrate that using continual learning for complex facial expression recognition achieves far better performance than non-continual learning methods, improving on state-of-the-art non-continual learning methods by 13.95%. To the best of our knowledge, our work is also the first to apply few-shot learning to complex facial expression recognition, achieving the state-of-the-art with 100% accuracy using a single training sample for each expression class.

    "abstract": "Uncertainties in the real world mean that is impossible for system designers to anticipate and explicitly design for all scenarios that a robot might encounter. Thus, robots designed like this are fragile and fail outside of highly-controlled environments. Causal models provide a principled framework to encode formal knowledge of the causal relationships that govern the robot's interaction with its environment, in addition to probabilistic representations of noise and uncertainty typically encountered by real-world robots. Combined with causal inference, these models permit an autonomous agent to understand, reason about, and explain its environment. In this work, we focus on the problem of a robot block-stacking task due to the fundamental perception and manipulation capabilities it demonstrates, required by many applications including warehouse logistics and domestic human support robotics. We propose a novel causal probabilistic framework to embed a physics simulation capability into a structural causal model to permit robots to perceive and assess the current state of a block-stacking task, reason about the next-best action from placement candidates, and generate post-hoc counterfactual explanations. We provide exemplar next-best action selection results and outline planned experimentation in simulated and real-world robot block-stacking tasks. ",

Existing face forgery detection methods try to learn generalizable features, but they still fall short of practical application. Additionally, finetuning these methods on historical training data is resource-intensive in terms of time and storage. In this paper, we focus on a novel and challenging problem: Continual Face Forgery Detection (CFFD), which aims to efficiently learn from new forgery attacks without forgetting previous ones. Specifically, we propose a Historical Distribution Preserving (HDP) framework that reserves and preserves the distributions of historical faces. To achieve this, we use universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) to simulate historical forgery distribution, and knowledge distillation to maintain the distribution variation of real faces across different models. We also construct a new benchmark for CFFD with three evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on the benchmarks show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors. ",

    "abstract": "Non-volatile memory (NVM) crossbars have been identified as a promising technology, for accelerating important machine learning operations, with matrix-vector multiplication being a key example. Binary neural networks (BNNs) are especially well-suited for use with NVM crossbars due to their use of a low-bitwidth representation for both activations and weights. However, the aggressive quantization of BNNs can result in suboptimal accuracy, and the analog effects of NVM crossbars can further degrade the accuracy during inference. This paper presents a comprehensive study that benchmarks BNNs trained and validated on ImageNet and deployed on NeuroSim, a simulator for NVM-crossbar-based PIM architecture. Our study analyzes the impact of various parameters, such as input precision and ADC resolution, on both the accuracy of the inference and the hardware performance metrics. We have found that an ADC resolution of 8-bit with an input precision of 4-bit achieves near-optimal accuracy compared to the original BNNs. In addition, we have identified bottleneck components in the PIM architecture that affect area, latency, and energy consumption, and we demonstrate the impact that different BNN layers have on hardware performance.

Compared with the conventional acquisition models founded on geometry analysis with divergence angle threshold, utilizing SNR as the decision criterion is more appropriate for practical engineering requirements. Specially, under the combined effects of platform vibration and turbulence, we decouple the parameters of beam divergence angle, spiral pitch, and coverage factor at a fixed transmitted power for a given average received SNR threshold. Then the single-scan acquisition probability is obtained by integrating the field of uncertainty (FOU), probability distribution of coverage factor, and receiver field angle. Consequently, the closed-form analytical expression of acquisition time expectation adopting multi-scan, which ensures acquisition success, with essential reset time between single-scan is derived. The optimizations concerning the beam divergence angle, spiral pitch, and FOU are presented. Moreover, the influence of platform vibration is investigated. All the analytical derivations are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. Notably, we provide a theoretical method for designing the minimum divergence angle modulated by the laser, which not only improves the acquisition performance within a certain vibration range, but also achieves a good trade-off with the system complexity.

    "abstract": "As the key to realizing aBCIs, EEG emotion recognition has been widely studied by many researchers. Previous methods have performed well for intra-subject EEG emotion recognition. However, the style mismatch between source domain (training data) and target domain (test data) EEG samples caused by huge inter-domain differences is still a critical problem for EEG emotion recognition. To solve the problem of cross-dataset EEG emotion recognition, in this paper, we propose an EEG-based Emotion Style Transfer Network (E2STN) to obtain EEG representations that contain the content information of source domain and the style information of target domain, which is called stylized emotional EEG representations. The representations are helpful for cross-dataset discriminative prediction. Concretely, E2STN consists of three modules, i.e., transfer module, transfer evaluation module, and discriminative prediction module. The transfer module encodes the domain-specific information of source and target domains and then re-constructs the source domain's emotional pattern and the target domain's statistical characteristics into the new stylized EEG representations. In this process, the transfer evaluation module is adopted to constrain the generated representations that can more precisely fuse two kinds of complementary information from source and target domains and avoid distorting. Finally, the generated stylized EEG representations are fed into the discriminative prediction module for final classification. Extensive experiments show that the E2STN can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset EEG emotion recognition tasks. ",

As width parameters, we consider treewidth, clique-width, twin-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number, whereas as graph classes we consider $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs, line graphs and their common superclass, for $t \\geq 3$, of $K_{t,t}$-free graphs. We first provide a complete comparison when restricted to $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs, showing in particular that treewidth, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number are all equivalent. This extends a result of Gurski and Wanke (2000) stating that treewidth and clique-width are equivalent for the class of $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs. Next, we provide a complete comparison when restricted to line graphs, showing in particular that, on any class of line graphs, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number are all equivalent, and bounded if and only if the class of root graphs has bounded treewidth. This extends a resut of Gurski and Wanke (2007) stating that a class of graphs~${\\cal G}$ has bounded treewidth if and only if the class of line graphs of graphs in ${\\cal G}$ has bounded clique-width. We then provide an almost-complete comparison for $K_{t,t}$-free graphs, leaving one missing case. Our main result is that $K_{t,t}$-free graphs of bounded mim-width have bounded tree-independence number. This result has structural and algorithmic consequences. In particular, it proves a special case of a conjecture of Dallard, Milani\\v{c} and \\v{S}torgel. Finally, we consider the question of whether boundedness of a certain width parameter is preserved under graph powers. We show that the question has a positive answer for sim-width precisely in the case of odd powers. ",

Thus, the ability to stabilize such patterns is crucial. Most of the existing studies on stabilization assume that network systems states can be measured online so that feedback control strategies can be used. However, in many real-world scenarios, systems states, e.g., neuronal activity in the brain, are often difficult to measure. In this paper, we take this situation into account and study the stabilization problem of linear network systems with an open-loop control strategy (vibrational control). We derive a graph-theoretic sufficient condition for structural vibrational stabilizability, under which network systems can always be stabilized. We further provide an approach to select the locations in the network for control placement and design corresponding vibrational inputs to stabilize systems that satisfy this condition. Finally, we provide some numerical results that demonstrate the validity of our theoretical findings. ",

Networks are of interest in evolutionary biology since they are used, for example, to represent the evolutionary history of a set $X$ of species whose ancestors have exchanged genes in the past. For $M$ some arbitrary set of symbols, $d:{X \\choose 2} \\to M \\cup \\{\\odot\\}$ is a symbolic arboreal map if there exists some arboreal network $N$ whose vertices with outdegree two or more are labelled by elements in $M$ and so that $d(\\{x,y\\})$, $\\{x,y\\} \\in {X \\choose 2}$, is equal to the label of the least common ancestor of $x$ and $y$ in $N$ if this exists and $\\odot$ else. Important examples of symbolic arboreal maps include the symbolic ultrametrics, which arise in areas such as game theory, phylogenetics and cograph theory. In this paper we show that a map $d:{X \\choose 2} \\to M \\cup \\{\\odot\\}$ is a symbolic arboreal map if and only if $d$ satisfies certain 3- and 4-point conditions and the graph with vertex set $X$ and edge set consisting of those pairs $\\{x,y\\} \\in {X \\choose 2}$ with $d(\\{x,y\\}) \\neq \\odot$ is Ptolemaic.

In particular, we show that for any connected graph $G$ with vertex set $X$ and edge clique cover $K$ in which there are no two distinct sets in $K$ with one a subset of the other, there is some network with $|K|$ roots and leaf set $X$ whose shared ancestry graph is $G$.

The associated random recurrent neural network acts as a featurizer of the data, and change points are identified from a univariate quantification of the distance between the featurization and the space spanned by a representative conceptor matrix. This model agnostic method can suggest potential locations of interest that warrant further study. We prove that, under mild assumptions, the method provides a consistent estimate of the true change point, and quantile estimates for statistics are produced via a moving block bootstrap of the original data. The method is tested on simulations from several classes of processes, and we evaluate performance with clustering metrics, graphical methods, and observed Type 1 error control.
