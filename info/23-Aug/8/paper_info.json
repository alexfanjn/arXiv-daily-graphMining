    "title": "Can Self-Supervised Representation Learning Methods Withstand  Distribution Shifts and Corruptions?",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning in computer vision aims to leverage the inherent structure and relationships within data to learn meaningful representations without explicit human annotation, enabling a holistic understanding of visual scenes. Robustness in vision machine learning ensures reliable and consistent performance, enhancing generalization, adaptability, and resistance to noise, variations, and adversarial attacks. Self-supervised paradigms, namely contrastive learning, knowledge distillation, mutual information maximization, and clustering, have been considered to have shown advances in invariant learning representations. This work investigates the robustness of learned representations of self-supervised learning approaches focusing on distribution shifts and image corruptions in computer vision. Detailed experiments have been conducted to study the robustness of self-supervised learning methods on distribution shifts and image corruptions. The empirical analysis demonstrates a clear relationship between the performance of learned representations within self-supervised paradigms and the severity of distribution shifts and corruptions. Notably, higher levels of shifts and corruptions are found to significantly diminish the robustness of the learned representations. These findings highlight the critical impact of distribution shifts and image corruptions on the performance and resilience of self-supervised learning methods, emphasizing the need for effective strategies to mitigate their adverse effects. The study strongly advocates for future research in the field of self-supervised representation learning to prioritize the key aspects of safety and robustness in order to ensure practical applicability.

    "abstract": "The performance of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) varies across problems, making it hard to develop new algorithms or apply existing ones to new problems. To simplify the development and application of new multiobjective algorithms, there has been an increasing interest in their automatic design from their components. These automatically designed metaheuristics can outperform their human-developed counterparts. However, it is still unknown what are the most influential components that lead to performance improvements. This study specifies a new methodology to investigate the effects of the final configuration of an automatically designed algorithm. We apply this methodology to a tuned Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) designed by the iterated racing (irace) configuration package on constrained problems of 3 groups: (1) analytical real-world problems, (2) analytical artificial problems and (3) simulated real-world. We then compare the impact of the algorithm components in terms of their Search Trajectory Networks (STNs), the diversity of the population, and the anytime hypervolume values. Looking at the objective space behavior, the MOEAs studied converged before half of the search to generally good HV values in the analytical artificial problems and the analytical real-world problems. For the simulated problems, the HV values are still improving at the end of the run. In terms of decision space behavior, we see a diverse set of the trajectories of the STNs in the analytical artificial problems. These trajectories are more similar and frequently reach optimal solutions in the other problems. ",

    "title": "Improving Generalization of Adversarial Training via Robust Critical  Fine-Tuning",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples, posing a significant security risk in critical applications. Adversarial Training (AT) is a well-established technique to enhance adversarial robustness, but it often comes at the cost of decreased generalization ability. This paper proposes Robustness Critical Fine-Tuning (RiFT), a novel approach to enhance generalization without compromising adversarial robustness. The core idea of RiFT is to exploit the redundant capacity for robustness by fine-tuning the adversarially trained model on its non-robust-critical module. To do so, we introduce module robust criticality (MRC), a measure that evaluates the significance of a given module to model robustness under worst-case weight perturbations. Using this measure, we identify the module with the lowest MRC value as the non-robust-critical module and fine-tune its weights to obtain fine-tuned weights. Subsequently, we linearly interpolate between the adversarially trained weights and fine-tuned weights to derive the optimal fine-tuned model weights. We demonstrate the efficacy of RiFT on ResNet18, ResNet34, and WideResNet34-10 models trained on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets. Our experiments show that \\method can significantly improve both generalization and out-of-distribution robustness by around 1.5% while maintaining or even slightly enhancing adversarial robustness.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the robustness of semantic segmentation techniques by leveraging the synergy between label-to-image generators and image-to-label segmentation models. Specifically, we design and train Robusta, a novel robust conditional generative adversarial network to generate realistic and plausible perturbed or outlier images that can be used to train reliable segmentation models. We conduct in-depth studies of the proposed generative model, assess the performance and robustness of the downstream segmentation network, and demonstrate that our approach can significantly enhance the robustness of semantic segmentation techniques in the face of real-world perturbations, distribution shifts, and out-of-distribution samples. Our results suggest that this approach could be valuable in safety-critical applications, where the reliability of semantic segmentation techniques is of utmost importance and comes with a limited computational budget in inference.

    "abstract": "Personalized review-based rating prediction aims at leveraging existing reviews to model user interests and item characteristics for rating prediction. Most of the existing studies mainly encounter two issues. First, the rich knowledge contained in the fine-grained aspects of each review and the knowledge graph is rarely considered to complement the pure text for better modeling user-item interactions. Second, the power of pre-trained language models is not carefully studied for personalized review-based rating prediction. To address these issues, we propose an approach named Knowledge-aware Collaborative Filtering with Pre-trained Language Model (KCF-PLM). For the first issue, to utilize rich knowledge, KCF-PLM develops a transformer network to model the interactions of the extracted aspects w.r.t. a user-item pair. For the second issue, to better represent users and items, KCF-PLM takes all the historical reviews of a user or an item as input to pre-trained language models. Moreover, KCF-PLM integrates the transformer network and the pre-trained language models through representation propagation on the knowledge graph and user-item guided attention of the aspect representations. Thus KCF-PLM combines review text, aspect, knowledge graph, and pre-trained language models together for review-based rating prediction. We conduct comprehensive experiments on several public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of KCF-PLM. ",

    "abstract": "Textual graphs (TGs) are graphs whose nodes correspond to text (sentences or documents), which are widely prevalent. The representation learning of TGs involves two stages: (i) unsupervised feature extraction and (ii) supervised graph representation learning. In recent years, extensive efforts have been devoted to the latter stage, where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have dominated. However, the former stage for most existing graph benchmarks still relies on traditional feature engineering techniques. More recently, with the rapid development of language models (LMs), researchers have focused on leveraging LMs to facilitate the learning of TGs, either by jointly training them in a computationally intensive framework (merging the two stages), or designing complex self-supervised training tasks for feature extraction (enhancing the first stage). In this work, we present SimTeG, a frustratingly Simple approach for Textual Graph learning that does not innovate in frameworks, models, and tasks. Instead, we first perform supervised parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on a pre-trained LM on the downstream task, such as node classification. We then generate node embeddings using the last hidden states of finetuned LM. These derived features can be further utilized by any GNN for training on the same task. We evaluate our approach on two fundamental graph representation learning tasks: node classification and link prediction. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach significantly improves the performance of various GNNs on multiple graph benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Adverse drug reaction (ADR) prediction plays a crucial role in both health care and drug discovery for reducing patient mortality and enhancing drug safety. Recently, many studies have been devoted to effectively predict the drug-ADRs incidence rates. However, these methods either did not effectively utilize non-clinical data, i.e., physical, chemical, and biological information about the drug, or did little to establish a link between content-based and pure collaborative filtering during the training phase. In this paper, we first formulate the prediction of multi-label ADRs as a drug-ADR collaborative filtering problem, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide extensive benchmark results of previous collaborative filtering methods on two large publicly available clinical datasets. Then, by exploiting the easy accessible drug characteristics from non-clinical data, we propose ADRNet, a generalized collaborative filtering framework combining clinical and non-clinical data for drug-ADR prediction. Specifically, ADRNet has a shallow collaborative filtering module and a deep drug representation module, which can exploit the high-dimensional drug descriptors to further guide the learning of low-dimensional ADR latent embeddings, which incorporates both the benefits of collaborative filtering and representation learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on two publicly available real-world drug-ADR clinical datasets and two non-clinical datasets to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed ADRNet.

The existence of those actors and their agendas is undeniable, but the explanation is overly simplistic and contributed to create a narrative that tends to preserve the status quo. In this essay, I analyze several facets of the lack of online privacy and idiosyncrasies exhibited by privacy advocates, together with characteristics of the industry mostly responsible for the datafication process and why its asserted high effectiveness should be openly inquired. Then I discuss of possible effects of datafication on human behavior, the prevalent market-oriented assumption at the base of online privacy, and some emerging adaptation strategies. In the last part, the regulatory approach to online privacy is considered. The EU's GDPR is praised as the reference case of modern privacy regulations, but the same success hinders critical aspects that also emerged, from the quirks of the institutional decision process, to the flaws of the informed consent principle. A glimpse on the likely problematic future is provided with a discussion on privacy related aspects of EU, UK, and China's proposed generative AI policies. ",

    "abstract": "Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is an essential task in recommendation systems, where accurately predicting unknown QoS values can improve user satisfaction. However, existing QoS prediction techniques may perform poorly in the presence of noise data, such as fake location information or virtual gateways. In this paper, we propose the Probabilistic Deep Supervision Network (PDS-Net), a novel framework for QoS prediction that addresses this issue. PDS-Net utilizes a Gaussian-based probabilistic space to supervise intermediate layers and learns probability spaces for both known features and true labels. Moreover, PDS-Net employs a condition-based multitasking loss function to identify objects with noise data and applies supervision directly to deep features sampled from the probability space by optimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance between the probability space of these objects and the real-label probability space. Thus, PDS-Net effectively reduces errors resulting from the propagation of corrupted data, leading to more accurate QoS predictions. Experimental evaluations on two real-world QoS datasets demonstrate that the proposed PDS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of our approach. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce Branched Latent Neural Operators (BLNOs) to learn input-output maps encoding complex physical processes. A BLNO is defined by a simple and compact feedforward partially-connected neural network that structurally disentangles inputs with different intrinsic roles, such as the time variable from model parameters of a differential equation, while transferring them into a generic field of interest. BLNOs leverage interpretable latent outputs to enhance the learned dynamics and break the curse of dimensionality by showing excellent generalization properties with small training datasets and short training times on a single processor. Indeed, their generalization error remains comparable regardless of the adopted discretization during the testing phase. Moreover, the partial connections, in place of a fully-connected structure, significantly reduce the number of tunable parameters. We show the capabilities of BLNOs in a challenging test case involving biophysically detailed electrophysiology simulations in a biventricular cardiac model of a pediatric patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The model includes a purkinje network for fast conduction and a heart-torso geometry. Specifically, we trained BLNOs on 150 in silico generated 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) while spanning 7 model parameters, covering cell-scale, organ-level and electrical dyssynchrony. Although the 12-lead ECGs manifest very fast dynamics with sharp gradients, after automatic hyperparameter tuning the optimal BLNO, trained in less than 3 hours on a single CPU, retains just 7 hidden layers and 19 neurons per layer. The mean square error is on the order of $10^{-4}$ on an independent test dataset comprised of 50 additional electrophysiology simulations. This paper provides a novel computational tool to build reliable and efficient reduced-order models for digital twinning in engineering applications. ",

However, most works pursue designing better architectures to learn overall features more efficiently, while ignoring the long-tail nature of interaction-object pair categories. In this paper, we propose to alleviate the impact of such an unbalanced distribution via Virtual Image Leaning (VIL). Firstly, a novel label-to-image approach, Multiple Steps Image Creation (MUSIC), is proposed to create a high-quality dataset that has a consistent distribution with real images. In this stage, virtual images are generated based on prompts with specific characterizations and selected by multi-filtering processes. Secondly, we use both virtual and real images to train the model with the teacher-student framework. Considering the initial labels of some virtual images are inaccurate and inadequate, we devise an Adaptive Matching-and-Filtering (AMF) module to construct pseudo-labels. Our method is independent of the internal structure of HOI detectors, so it can be combined with off-the-shelf methods by training merely 10 additional epochs. With the assistance of our method, multiple methods obtain significant improvements, and new state-of-the-art results are achieved on two benchmarks. ",

SDG frameworks produced in the finance industry are designed to provide scores that indicate how well a company aligns with each of the 17 SDGs. This scoring enables a consistent assessment of investments that have the potential of building an inclusive and sustainable economy. As a result of the high quality and reliability required by such frameworks, the process of creating and maintaining them is time-consuming and requires extensive domain expertise. In this work, we describe a data-driven system that seeks to automate the process of creating an SDG framework. First, we propose a novel method for collecting and filtering a dataset of texts from different web sources and a knowledge graph relevant to a set of companies. We then implement and deploy classifiers trained with this data for predicting scores of alignment with SDGs for a given company. Our results indicate that our best performing model can accurately predict SDG scores with a micro average F1 score of 0.89, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solution. We further describe how the integration of the models for its use by humans can be facilitated by providing explanations in the form of data relevant to a predicted score. We find that our proposed solution enables access to a large amount of information that analysts would normally not be able to process, resulting in an accurate prediction of SDG scores at a fraction of the cost.

    "abstract": "The main approaches for simulating FMCW radar are based on ray tracing, which is usually computationally intensive and do not account for background noise. This work proposes a faster method for FMCW radar simulation capable of generating synthetic raw radar data using generative adversarial networks (GAN). The code and pre-trained weights are open-source and available on GitHub. This method generates 16 simultaneous chirps, which allows the generated data to be used for the further development of algorithms for processing radar data (filtering and clustering). This can increase the potential for data augmentation, e.g., by generating data in non-existent or safety-critical scenarios that are not reproducible in real life. In this work, the GAN was trained with radar measurements of a motorcycle and used to generate synthetic raw radar data of a motorcycle traveling in a straight line. For generating this data, the distance of the motorcycle and Gaussian noise are used as input to the neural network. The synthetic generated radar chirps were evaluated using the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Then, the Range-Azimuth (RA) map is calculated twice: (1\\textsuperscript{st}) based on synthetic data using this GAN and (2\\textsuperscript{nd}) based on real data. Based on these RA maps, an algorithm with adaptive threshold and edge detection is used for object detection. The results have shown that the data is realistic in terms of coherent radar reflections of the motorcycle and background noise based on the comparison of chirps, the RA maps and the object detection results. Thus, the proposed method in this work has shown to minimize the simulation-to-reality gap for the generation of radar data. ",

There is a large amount of intelligent threat information regarding malware.

In this study, we reviewed and extended an existing malware ontology to cover Android malware. Our extended ontology is called AndMalOnt.

    "abstract": "The open radio access network (O-RAN), with its disaggregated and open architecture, is poised to meet the demands of the next generation of wireless communication. However, to unlock the full potentials of O-RAN, real-time network modeling and optimization are essential. A promising solution for such requirement is the use of network digital twin (NDT). NDT provides a comprehensive view of a network, covering both physical and logical components, including infrastructure, protocols, and algorithms. NDT, as a real-time virtual representation of O-RAN facilitates a variety of operations, such as emulations, test, optimization, monitoring, and analysis of a new configuration in a risk-free environment, without requiring them to be implemented in real network. Such capability enables the vendors and network operators for a faster adoption of new solutions with frequent updates, while ensuring the resiliency of the existing services via planning ahead under various \"what-if\" scenarios. In this paper, we first describe what exactly NDT means in the context of O-RAN, as well as its key enablers. We then describe the NDT application within the O-RAN in both prior and post-deployment. Finally, we provide two practical uses cases, namely network energy efficiency and traffic steering, where the NDT can be leveraged effectively. ",

    "abstract": "Privacy has rapidly become a major concern/design consideration. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Garbled Circuits (GC) are privacy-preserving techniques that support computations on encrypted data. HE and GC can complement each other, as HE is more efficient for linear operations, while GC is more effective for non-linear operations. Together, they enable complex computing tasks, such as machine learning, to be performed exactly on ciphertexts. However, HE and GC introduce two major bottlenecks: an elevated computational overhead and high data transfer costs. This paper presents PPIMCE, an in-memory computing (IMC) fabric designed to mitigate both computational overhead and data transfer issues. Through the use of multiple IMC cores for high parallelism, and by leveraging in-SRAM IMC for data management, PPIMCE offers a compact, energy-efficient solution for accelerating HE and GC. PPIMCE achieves a 107X speedup against a CPU implementation of GC. Additionally, PPIMCE achieves a 1,500X and 800X speedup compared to CPU and GPU implementations of CKKS-based HE multiplications. For privacy-preserving machine learning inference, PPIMCE attains a 1,000X speedup compared to CPU and a 12X speedup against CraterLake, the state-of-art privacy preserving computation accelerator.

One of the most heavily studied SSUF objectives is to minimize the violation of some given arc capacities. A seminal result of Dinitz, Garg, and Goemans showed that, whenever a fractional flow exists respecting the capacities, then there is an unsplittable one violating the capacities by at most the maximum demand. Goemans conjectured a very natural cost version of the same result, where the unsplittable flow is required to be no more expensive than the fractional one. This intriguing conjecture remains open. More so, there are arguably no non-trivial graph classes for which it is known to hold. We show that a slight weakening of it (with at most twice as large violations) holds for planar graphs. Our result is based on a connection to a highly structured discrepancy problem, whose repeated resolution allows us to successively reduce the number of paths used for each terminal, until we obtain an unsplittable flow. Moreover, our techniques also extend to simultaneous upper and lower bounds on the flow values. This also affirmatively answers a conjecture of Morell and Skutella for planar SSUF. ",

We then generalize our algorithm to check consistency on a group-$k$ basis by using a generalized notion of consistency and using generalized graphs. We also present modified maximum clique algorithms that function on generalized graphs to find the set of measurements that is internally group-$k$ consistent. We address the exponential nature of group-$k$ consistency and present methods that can substantially decrease the number of necessary checks performed when evaluating consistency.

We used hourly full-disk line-of-sight magnetogram images and selected binary prediction mode to predict the occurrence of $\\geq$M1.0-class flares within 24 hours. We leveraged custom data augmentation and sample weighting to counter the inherent class-imbalance problem and used true skill statistic and Heidke skill score as evaluation metrics. Recent advancements in gradient-based attention methods allow us to interpret models by sending gradient signals to assign the burden of the decision on the input features. We interpret our model using three post hoc attention methods: (i) Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, (ii) Deep Shapley Additive Explanations, and (iii) Integrated Gradients. Our analysis shows that full-disk predictions of solar flares align with characteristics related to the active regions. The key findings of this study are: (1) We demonstrate that our full disk model can tangibly locate and predict near-limb solar flares, which is a critical feature for operational flare forecasting, (2) Our candidate model achieves an average TSS=0.51$\\pm$0.05 and HSS=0.38$\\pm$0.08, and (3) Our evaluation suggests that these models can learn conspicuous features corresponding to active regions from full-disk magnetograms.

Existing methods seek to minimize the total error in the cleaning process - to avoid cleaning examples that are not noise, and to ensure cleaning of examples that are. This is an important measure of accuracy but insufficient to guarantee good estimates of the true FPR or TPR for a model, and we show that using the model to directly clean its own validation data leads to underestimates even if total error is low. This indicates a need for researchers to pursue methods that not only reduce total error but also seek to de-correlate cleaning error with model scores. ",

We show that this LP can be significantly pruned, allowing us to compute bounds for significantly larger causal inference problems compared to existing techniques. This pruning procedure allows us to compute bounds in closed form for a special class of problems, including a well-studied family of problems where multiple confounded treatments influence an outcome. We extend our pruning methodology to fractional LPs which compute bounds for causal queries which incorporate additional observations about the unit. We show that our methods provide significant runtime improvement compared to benchmarks in experiments and extend our results to the finite data setting. For causal inference without additional observations, we propose an efficient greedy heuristic that produces high quality bounds, and scales to problems that are several orders of magnitude larger than those for which the pruned LP can be solved.

    "abstract": "Machine learning has rapidly evolved during the last decade, achieving expert human performance on notoriously challenging problems such as image classification. This success is partly due to the re-emergence of bio-inspired modern artificial neural networks (ANNs) along with the availability of computation power, vast labelled data and ingenious human-based expert knowledge as well as optimisation approaches that can find the correct configuration (and weights) for these networks. Neuroevolution is a term used for the latter when employing evolutionary algorithms. Most of the works in neuroevolution have focused their attention in a single type of ANNs, named Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Moreover, most of these works have used a single optimisation approach. This work makes a progressive step forward in neuroevolution for vehicle trajectory prediction, referred to as neurotrajectory prediction, where multiple objectives must be considered. To this end, rich ANNs composed of CNNs and Long-short Term Memory Network are adopted. Two well-known and robust Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation (EMO) algorithms, NSGA-II and MOEA/D are also adopted. The completely different underlying mechanism of each of these algorithms sheds light on the implications of using one over the other EMO approach in neurotrajectory prediction. In particular, the importance of considering objective scaling is highlighted, finding that MOEA/D can be more adept at focusing on specific objectives whereas, NSGA-II tends to be more invariant to objective scaling. Additionally, certain objectives are shown to be either beneficial or detrimental to finding valid models, for instance, inclusion of a distance feedback objective was considerably detrimental to finding valid models, while a lateral velocity objective was more beneficial.

To enhance the model's sensitivity on the trailing harmonics, we modify the Combined Frequency and Periodicity (CFP) representation using discrete z-transform. Second, the vocal and non-vocal segments with extremely short duration are uncommon. To ensure a more stable melody contour, we design a differentiable loss function that prevents the model from predicting such segments. We apply these modifications to several models, including MSNet, FTANet, and a newly introduced model, PianoNet, modified from a piano transcription network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modifications are empirically effective for singing melody extraction. ",

Novel algorithms were recently introduced with the goal of handling the lack of gradient signal to guide the search in the space of programmatic policies. Most of such PIRL algorithms first train a neural policy that is used as an oracle to guide the search in the programmatic space. In this paper, we show that such PIRL-specific algorithms are not needed, depending on the language used to encode the programmatic policies. This is because one can use actor-critic algorithms to directly obtain a programmatic policy. We use a connection between ReLU neural networks and oblique decision trees to translate the policy learned with actor-critic algorithms into programmatic policies. This translation from ReLU networks allows us to synthesize policies encoded in programs with if-then-else structures, linear transformations of the input values, and PID operations. Empirical results on several control problems show that this translation approach is capable of learning short and effective policies. Moreover, the translated policies are at least competitive and often far superior to the policies PIRL algorithms synthesize. ",

Stress prediction using biosignal data recorded by wearables is a key area of study in mobile sensing research because real-time stress prediction can enable digital interventions to immediately react at the onset of stress, helping to avoid many psychological and physiological symptoms such as heart rhythm irregularities. Electrodermal activity (EDA) is often used to measure stress. However, major challenges with the prediction of stress using machine learning include the subjectivity and sparseness of the labels, a large feature space, relatively few labels, and a complex nonlinear and subjective relationship between the features and outcomes. To tackle these issues, we examine the use of model personalization: training a separate stress prediction model for each user. To allow the neural network to learn the temporal dynamics of each individual's baseline biosignal patterns, thus enabling personalization with very few labels, we pre-train a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) using self-supervised learning (SSL). We evaluate our method using the Wearable Stress and Affect prediction (WESAD) dataset. We fine-tune the pre-trained networks to the stress prediction task and compare against equivalent models without any self-supervised pre-training. We discover that embeddings learned using our pre-training method outperform supervised baselines with significantly fewer labeled data points: the models trained with SSL require less than 30% of the labels to reach equivalent performance without personalized SSL. This personalized learning method can enable precision health systems which are tailored to each subject and require few annotations by the end user, thus allowing for the mobile sensing of increasingly complex, heterogeneous, and subjective outcomes such as stress.

We propose a novel algorithm termed MW-UCB for generalized wireless network scheduling, which is based on the Max-Weight policy and leverages the Sliding-Window Upper-Confidence Bound to learn the channels' statistics under non-stationarity. MW-UCB is provably throughput-optimal under mild assumptions on the variability of mean service rates. Specifically, as long as the total variation in mean service rates over any time period grows sub-linearly in time, we show that MW-UCB can achieve the stability region arbitrarily close to the stability region of the class of policies with full knowledge of the channel statistics. Extensive simulations validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the favorable performance of MW-UCB. ",

In this article, we briefly review the NeRF representation, and describe the three decades-long quest to find the best 3D representation for view synthesis and related problems, culminating in the NeRF papers. We then describe new developments in terms of NeRF representations and make some observations and insights regarding the future of 3D representations. ",

We investigate the impact of this \"content drift\" for large-scale similarity search tools, based on nearest neighbor search in embedding space. Unless a costly index reconstruction is performed frequently, content drift degrades the search accuracy and efficiency. The degradation is especially severe since, in general, both the query and database distributions change. We introduce and analyze real-world image and video datasets for which temporal information is available over a long time period. Based on the learnings, we devise DeDrift, a method that updates embedding quantizers to continuously adapt large-scale indexing structures on-the-fly. DeDrift almost eliminates the accuracy degradation due to the query and database content drift while being up to 100x faster than a full index reconstruction. ",

    "abstract": "Self-training emerges as an important research line on domain adaptation. By taking the model's prediction as the pseudo labels of the unlabeled data, self-training bootstraps the model with pseudo instances in the target domain. However, the prediction errors of pseudo labels (label noise) challenge the performance of self-training. To address this problem, previous approaches only use reliable pseudo instances, i.e., pseudo instances with high prediction confidence, to retrain the model. Although these strategies effectively reduce the label noise, they are prone to miss the hard examples. In this paper, we propose a new self-training framework for domain adaptation, namely Domain adversarial learning enhanced Self-Training Framework (DaMSTF). Firstly, DaMSTF involves meta-learning to estimate the importance of each pseudo instance, so as to simultaneously reduce the label noise and preserve hard examples. Secondly, we design a meta constructor for constructing the meta-validation set, which guarantees the effectiveness of the meta-learning module by improving the quality of the meta-validation set. Thirdly, we find that the meta-learning module suffers from the training guidance vanishment and tends to converge to an inferior optimal. To this end, we employ domain adversarial learning as a heuristic neural network initialization method, which can help the meta-learning module converge to a better optimal. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DaMSTF. On the cross-domain sentiment classification task, DaMSTF improves the performance of BERT with an average of nearly 4%. ",

This description provides insights into how these networks learn features and generalize well when trained past zero training error. However, to date, (NC) has only been studied in the final layer of these networks. In the present paper, we provide the first comprehensive empirical analysis of the emergence of (NC) in the intermediate hidden layers of these classifiers. We examine a variety of network architectures, activations, and datasets, and demonstrate that some degree of (NC) emerges in most of the intermediate hidden layers of the network, where the degree of collapse in any given layer is typically positively correlated with the depth of that layer in the neural network. Moreover, we remark that: (1) almost all of the reduction in intra-class variance in the samples occurs in the shallower layers of the networks, (2) the angular separation between class means increases consistently with hidden layer depth, and (3) simple datasets require only the shallower layers of the networks to fully learn them, whereas more difficult ones require the entire network. Ultimately, these results provide granular insights into the structural propagation of features through classification neural networks. ",

A distributed cyber-physical system (CPS) consists of a network of agents, each of which measures (or computes) a continuous-time signal. Examples include distributed industrial controllers connected over wireless networks and connected vehicles in traffic. The safety requirements of such CPS, expressed as logical predicates, must be monitored at runtime. This monitoring faces three challenges: first, every agent only knows its own signal, whereas the safety requirement is global and carries over multiple signals. Second, the agents' local clocks drift from each other, so they do not even agree on the time. Thus, it is not clear which signal values are actually synchronous to evaluate the safety predicate. Third, CPS signals are continuous-time so there are potentially uncountably many safety violations to be reported. In this paper, we present the first decentralized algorithm for detecting conjunctive predicates in this setup. Our algorithm returns all possible violations of the predicate, which is important for eliminating bugs from distributed systems regardless of actual clock drift. We prove that this detection algorithm is in the same complexity class as the detector for discrete systems. We implement our detector and validate it experimentally. ",

Towards this issue, we propose a Dual degrAdation-inSpired deep Unfolding network, termed DASUNet, for low-light image enhancement. Specifically, we construct a dual degradation model (DDM) to explicitly simulate the deterioration mechanism of low-light images. It learns two distinct image priors via considering degradation specificity between luminance and chrominance spaces. To make the proposed scheme tractable, we design an alternating optimization solution to solve the proposed DDM. Further, the designed solution is unfolded into a specified deep network, imitating the iteration updating rules, to form DASUNet. Local and long-range information are obtained by prior modeling module (PMM), inheriting the advantages of convolution and Transformer, to enhance the representation capability of dual degradation priors. Additionally, a space aggregation module (SAM) is presented to boost the interaction of two degradation models. Extensive experiments on multiple popular low-light image datasets validate the effectiveness of DASUNet compared to canonical state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement methods.

Early detection and diagnosis can significantly reduce cancer risk, in which cervical cytology classification is indispensable. Researchers have recently designed many networks for automated cervical cancer diagnosis, but the limited accuracy and bulky size of these individual models cannot meet practical application needs. To address this issue, we propose a Voting-Stacking ensemble strategy, which employs three Inception networks as base learners and integrates their outputs through a voting ensemble. The samples misclassified by the ensemble model generate a new training set on which a linear classification model is trained as the meta-learner and performs the final predictions. In addition, a multi-level Stacking ensemble framework is designed to improve performance further. The method is evaluated on the SIPakMed, Herlev, and Mendeley datasets, achieving accuracies of 100\\%, 100\\%, and 100\\%, respectively.

The proposed method is considered reviewing works for the anomaly-based network intrusion detection system (anomaly-NIDS) models. Furthermore, the effectiveness of proposed algorithms and selected datasets are discussed for the recent direction and improvements of ML and DL to the NIDS.

Existing methods in the field of clothing animation are limited to either static behavior or specific network models for individual garments, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios where diverse animated garments are required. Our proposed method overcomes these limitations by providing a unified framework that predicts dynamic behavior for different garments with arbitrary topology and looseness, resulting in versatile and realistic deformations. First, we observe that the problem of bias towards low frequency always hampers supervised learning and leads to overly smooth deformations. To address this issue, we introduce a frequency-control strategy from a spectral perspective that enhances the generation of high-frequency details of the deformation. In addition, to make the network highly generalizable and able to learn various clothing deformations effectively, we propose a spectral descriptor to achieve a generalized description of the global shape information. Building on the above strategies, we develop a dynamic clothing deformation estimator that integrates frequency-controllable attention mechanisms with long short-term memory. The estimator takes as input expressive features from garments and human bodies, allowing it to automatically output continuous deformations for diverse clothing types, independent of mesh topology or vertex count. Finally, we present a neural collision handling method to further enhance the realism of garments. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of free-swinging garments and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. ",

However, results from LLMs can be highly unstable; nondeterministically returning very different codes for the same prompt. Non-determinism is a potential menace to scientific conclusion validity. When non-determinism is high, scientific conclusions simply cannot be relied upon unless researchers change their behaviour to control for it in their empirical analyses. This paper conducts an empirical study to demonstrate that non-determinism is, indeed, high, thereby underlining the need for this behavioural change. We choose to study ChatGPT because it is already highly prevalent in the code generation research literature. We report results from a study of 829 code generation problems from three code generation benchmarks (i.e., CodeContests, APPS, and HumanEval). Our results reveal high degrees of non-determinism: the ratio of coding tasks with zero equal test output across different requests is 72.73%, 60.40%, and 65.85% for CodeContests, APPS, and HumanEval, respectively. In addition, we find that setting the temperature to 0 does not guarantee determinism in code generation, although it indeed brings less non-determinism than the default configuration (temperature=1). These results confirm that there is, currently, a significant threat to scientific conclusion validity. In order to put LLM-based research on firmer scientific foundations, researchers need to take into account non-determinism in drawing their conclusions. ",

Due to the scaling invariance arising from the linearity, an optimal reconstruction function $f$ for such a problem is positive homogeneous, i.e., satisfies $f(\\lambda x) = \\lambda f(x)$ for all non-negative $\\lambda$. In a $ReLu$ network, this condition translates to considering networks without bias terms. We first consider recovery of sparse vectors from few linear measurements. We prove that $ReLu$- networks with only one hidden layer cannot even recover $1$-sparse vectors, not even approximately, and regardless of the width of the network. However, with two hidden layers, approximate recovery with arbitrary precision and arbitrary sparsity level $s$ is possible in a stable way. We then extend our results to a wider class of recovery problems including low-rank matrix recovery and phase retrieval. Furthermore, we also consider the approximation of general positive homogeneous functions with neural networks. Extending previous work, we establish new results explaining under which conditions such functions can be approximated with neural networks. Our results also shed some light on the seeming contradiction between previous works showing that neural networks for inverse problems typically have very large Lipschitz constants, but still perform very well also for adversarial noise. Namely, the error bounds in our expressivity results include a combination of a small constant term and a term that is linear in the noise level, indicating that robustness issues may occur only for very small noise levels.

This is useful in a wide range of real-world applications where collecting pixel-wise labels is not feasible in time or cost. Current approaches to semi-supervised semantic segmentation work by predicting pseudo-labels for each pixel from a class-wise probability distribution output by a model. If the predicted probability distribution is incorrect, however, this leads to poor segmentation results, which can have knock-on consequences in safety critical systems, like medical images or self-driving cars. It is, therefore, important to understand what a model does not know, which is mainly achieved by uncertainty quantification. Recently, neural processes (NPs) have been explored in semi-supervised image classification, and they have been a computationally efficient and effective method for uncertainty quantification. In this work, we move one step forward by adapting NPs to semi-supervised semantic segmentation, resulting in a new model called NP-SemiSeg. We experimentally evaluated NP-SemiSeg on the public benchmarks PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, with different training settings, and the results verify its effectiveness. ",

Alternatively, model ensemble adversarial attacks are proposed to fuse outputs from surrogate models with diverse architectures to get an ensemble loss, making the generated adversarial example more likely to transfer to other models as it can fool multiple models concurrently. However, existing ensemble attacks simply fuse the outputs of the surrogate models evenly, thus are not efficacious to capture and amplify the intrinsic transfer information of adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose an adaptive ensemble attack, dubbed AdaEA, to adaptively control the fusion of the outputs from each model, via monitoring the discrepancy ratio of their contributions towards the adversarial objective. Furthermore, an extra disparity-reduced filter is introduced to further synchronize the update direction. As a result, we achieve considerable improvement over the existing ensemble attacks on various datasets, and the proposed AdaEA can also boost existing transfer-based attacks, which further demonstrates its efficacy and versatility.

The introduced ES$^2$N model is based on defining the reservoir layer as a convex combination of a nonlinear reservoir (as in the standard ESN), and a linear reservoir that implements an orthogonal transformation. We provide a thorough mathematical analysis of the introduced model, proving that the whole eigenspectrum of the Jacobian of the ES2N map can be contained in an annular neighbourhood of a complex circle of controllable radius, and exploit this property to demonstrate that the ES$^2$N's forward dynamics evolves close to the edge-of-chaos regime by design. Remarkably, our experimental analysis shows that the newly introduced reservoir model is able to reach the theoretical maximum short-term memory capacity. At the same time, in comparison to standard ESN, ES$^2$N is shown to offer a favorable trade-off between memory and nonlinearity, as well as a significant improvement of performance in autoregressive nonlinear modeling.

In this paper, we formulate a conjecture, i.e., existing overlooked valuable information in the pruned graph connections and model parameters which can be re-grouped into GLT to enhance the final performance. Specifically, we propose an adversarial complementary erasing (ACE) framework to explore the valuable information from the pruned components, thereby developing a more powerful GLT, referred to as the ACE-GLT. The main idea is to mine valuable information from pruned edges/weights after each round of IMP, and employ the ACE technique to refine the GLT processing. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-GLT outperforms existing methods for searching GLT in diverse tasks. Our code will be made publicly available. ",

To realize their objectives, most automation functionalities rely on the Minimization of Drive Test (MDT) reports. The MDT reports are used to generate inferences about network state and performance, thus dynamically change network parameters accordingly. However, the collection of MDT reports from commodity user devices, particularly low cost IoT devices, make them a vulnerable entry point to launch an adversarial attack on emerging deeply automated wireless networks. This adds a new dimension to the security threats in the IoT and cellular networks. Existing literature on IoT, SON, or zero touch automation does not address this important problem. In this paper, we investigate an impactful, first of its kind adversarial attack that can be launched by exploiting the malicious MDT reports from the compromised user equipment (UE). We highlight the detrimental repercussions of this attack on the performance of common network automation functions. We also propose a novel Malicious MDT Reports Identification framework (MRIF) as a countermeasure to detect and eliminate the malicious MDT reports using Machine Learning and verify it through a use-case. Thus, the defense mechanism can provide the resilience and robustness for zero touch automation SON engines against the adversarial MDT attacks ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the removal of motion blur in photographs has seen impressive progress in the hands of deep learning-based methods, trained to map directly from blurry to sharp images. For this reason, approaches that explicitly use a forward degradation model received significantly less attention. However, a well-defined specification of the blur genesis, as an intermediate step, promotes the generalization and explainability of the method. Towards this goal, we propose a learning-based motion deblurring method based on dense non-uniform motion blur estimation followed by a non-blind deconvolution approach. Specifically, given a blurry image, a first network estimates the dense per-pixel motion blur kernels using a lightweight representation composed of a set of image-adaptive basis motion kernels and the corresponding mixing coefficients. Then, a second network trained jointly with the first one, unrolls a non-blind deconvolution method using the motion kernel field estimated by the first network. The model-driven aspect is further promoted by training the networks on sharp/blurry pairs synthesized according to a convolution-based, non-uniform motion blur degradation model. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that the kernel prediction network produces accurate motion blur estimates, and that the deblurring pipeline leads to restorations of real blurred images that are competitive or superior to those obtained with existing end-to-end deep learning-based methods.

This paper studies how these restrictions impact young online gamers, and their evasion efforts. We present results from surveys (n = 2,415) and semi-structured interviews (n = 35) revealing viable commonly deployed APS evasion techniques and APS vulnerabilities. We conclude that the APS does not work as designed, even against very young online game players, and can act as a censorship evasion training ground for tomorrow's adults, by familiarization with and normalization of general evasion techniques, and desensitization to their dangers. Findings from these studies may further inform developers of censorship-resistant systems about the perceptions and evasion strategies of their prospective users, and help design tools that leverage services and platforms popular among the censored audience.

When exposure times are inaccurate, for example, when they are extracted from a camera's EXIF metadata, the reconstructed HDR images reveal banding artifacts at smooth gradients. To remedy this, we propose to estimate exposure ratios directly from the input images. We derive the exposure time estimation as an optimization problem, in which pixels are selected from pairs of exposures to minimize estimation error caused by camera noise. When pixel values are represented in the logarithmic domain, the problem can be solved efficiently using a linear solver. We demonstrate that the estimation can be easily made robust to pixel misalignment caused by camera or object motion by collecting pixels from multiple spatial tiles. The proposed automatic exposure estimation and alignment eliminates banding artifacts in popular datasets and is essential for applications that require physically accurate reconstructions, such as measuring the modulation transfer function of a display.

Our systematic analysis of current implementations of FIDO2 reveals four underlying flaws, and we demonstrate the feasibility of seven attacks that exploit those flaws. The flaws include (1) Lack of confidentiality/integrity of FIDO2 messages accessible to browser extensions, (2) Broken clone detection algorithm, (3) Potential for user misunderstanding from social engineering and notification/error messages, and (4) Cookie life cycle. We build malicious browser extensions and demonstrate the attacks on ten popular web servers that use FIDO2. We also show that many browser extensions have sufficient permissions to conduct the attacks if they were compromised. A static and dynamic analysis of current browser extensions finds no evidence of the attacks in the wild.

    "abstract": "In recent years, 3D representation learning has turned to 2D vision-language pre-trained models to overcome data scarcity challenges. However, existing methods simply transfer 2D alignment strategies, aligning 3D representations with single-view 2D images and coarse-grained parent category text. These approaches introduce information degradation and insufficient synergy issues, leading to performance loss. Information degradation arises from overlooking the fact that a 3D representation should be equivalent to a series of multi-view images and more fine-grained subcategory text. Insufficient synergy neglects the idea that a robust 3D representation should align with the joint vision-language space, rather than independently aligning with each modality. In this paper, we propose a multi-view joint modality modeling approach, termed JM3D, to obtain a unified representation for point cloud, text, and image. Specifically, a novel Structured Multimodal Organizer (SMO) is proposed to address the information degradation issue, which introduces contiguous multi-view images and hierarchical text to enrich the representation of vision and language modalities. A Joint Multi-modal Alignment (JMA) is designed to tackle the insufficient synergy problem, which models the joint modality by incorporating language knowledge into the visual modality. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, JM3D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D classification. JM3D outperforms ULIP by approximately 4.3% on PointMLP and achieves an improvement of up to 6.5% accuracy on PointNet++ in top-1 accuracy for zero-shot 3D classification on ModelNet40.

    "abstract": "Humans recognize anomalies through two aspects: larger patch-wise representation discrepancies and weaker patch-to-normal-patch correlations. However, the previous AD methods didn't sufficiently combine the two complementary aspects to design AD models. To this end, we find that Transformer can ideally satisfy the two aspects as its great power in the unified modeling of patch-wise representations and patch-to-patch correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel AD framework: FOcus-the-Discrepancy (FOD), which can simultaneously spot the patch-wise, intra- and inter-discrepancies of anomalies. The major characteristic of our method is that we renovate the self-attention maps in transformers to Intra-Inter-Correlation (I2Correlation). The I2Correlation contains a two-branch structure to first explicitly establish intra- and inter-image correlations, and then fuses the features of two-branch to spotlight the abnormal patterns. To learn the intra- and inter-correlations adaptively, we propose the RBF-kernel-based target-correlations as learning targets for self-supervised learning. Besides, we introduce an entropy constraint strategy to solve the mode collapse issue in optimization and further amplify the normal-abnormal distinguishability. Extensive experiments on three unsupervised real-world AD benchmarks show the superior performance of our approach. Code will be available at https://github.com/xcyao00/FOD. ",

In the present work, we propose a new methodology that integrates a feature attention module with a pretrained VGG19 convolutional neural network (CNN) for more accurate DR detection. Here, the pretrained net is fine-tuned with the proposed feature attention block. The proposed module aims to leverage the complementary information from various regions of fundus images to enhance the discriminative power of the CNN. The said feature attention module incorporates an attention mechanism which selectively highlights salient features from images and fuses them with the original input. The simultaneous learning of attention weights for the features and thereupon the combination of attention-modulated features within the feature attention block facilitates the network's ability to focus on relevant information while reducing the impact of noisy or irrelevant features. Performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on a widely used dataset for diabetic retinopathy classification e.g., the APTOS (Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society) DR Dataset. Results are compared with/without attention module, as well as with other state-of-the-art approaches.

Currently, we define four categories of key instructions: calling subfunctions, comparing instruction, returning instruction, and memory-store instruction. Thus if we symbolically execute similar binary codes, symbolic values at these key instructions are expected to be similar. As such, we implement a prototype tool, which has three steps.

In this paper, we propose a style-guided high-order attention network for image emotion distribution learning termed StyleEDL, which interactively learns stylistic-aware representations of images by exploring the hierarchical stylistic information of visual contents. Specifically, we consider exploring the intra- and inter-layer correlations among GRAM-based stylistic representations, and meanwhile exploit an adversary-constrained high-order attention mechanism to capture potential interactions between subtle visual parts. In addition, we introduce a stylistic graph convolutional network to dynamically generate the content-dependent emotion representations to benefit the final emotion distribution learning. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed StyleEDL compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, current methods usually focus on a single task (\\emph{e.g.}, denoising, deblurring or super-resolution) which cannot address the needs of real-world multi-task processing, especially on mobile devices. Thus, developing an all-in-one method that can restore images from various unknown distortions is a significant challenge. Previous works have employed contrastive learning to learn the degradation representation from observed images, but this often leads to representation drift caused by deficient positive and negative pairs. To address this issue, we propose a novel All-in-one Multi-degradation Image Restoration Network (AMIRNet) that can effectively capture and utilize accurate degradation representation for image restoration. AMIRNet learns a degradation representation for unknown degraded images by progressively constructing a tree structure through clustering, without any prior knowledge of degradation information. This tree-structured representation explicitly reflects the consistency and discrepancy of various distortions, providing a specific clue for image restoration. To further enhance the performance of the image restoration network and overcome domain gaps caused by unknown distortions, we design a feature transform block (FTB) that aligns domains and refines features with the guidance of the degradation representation. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple distorted datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method and its advantages over state-of-the-art restoration methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

    "abstract": "In modern industries, fault diagnosis has been widely applied with the goal of realizing predictive maintenance. The key issue for the fault diagnosis system is to extract representative characteristics of the fault signal and then accurately predict the fault type. In this paper, we propose a Causal Disentanglement Hidden Markov model (CDHM) to learn the causality in the bearing fault mechanism and thus, capture their characteristics to achieve a more robust representation. Specifically, we make full use of the time-series data and progressively disentangle the vibration signal into fault-relevant and fault-irrelevant factors. The ELBO is reformulated to optimize the learning of the causal disentanglement Markov model. Moreover, to expand the scope of the application, we adopt unsupervised domain adaptation to transfer the learned disentangled representations to other working environments. Experiments were conducted on the CWRU dataset and IMS dataset. Relevant results validate the superiority of the proposed method. ",

    "title": "Brighten-and-Colorize: A Decoupled Network for Customized Low-Light  Image Enhancement",
    "abstract": "Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the perceptual quality of an image captured in low-light conditions. Generally, a low-light image can be divided into lightness and chrominance components. Recent advances in this area mainly focus on the refinement of the lightness, while ignoring the role of chrominance. It easily leads to chromatic aberration and, to some extent, limits the diverse applications of chrominance in customized LLIE. In this work, a ``brighten-and-colorize'' network (called BCNet), which introduces image colorization to LLIE, is proposed to address the above issues. BCNet can accomplish LLIE with accurate color and simultaneously enables customized enhancement with varying saturations and color styles based on user preferences. Specifically, BCNet regards LLIE as a multi-task learning problem: brightening and colorization. The brightening sub-task aligns with other conventional LLIE methods to get a well-lit lightness. The colorization sub-task is accomplished by regarding the chrominance of the low-light image as color guidance like the user-guide image colorization. Upon completion of model training, the color guidance (i.e., input low-light chrominance) can be simply manipulated by users to acquire customized results. This customized process is optional and, due to its decoupled nature, does not compromise the structural and detailed information of lightness. Extensive experiments on the commonly used LLIE datasets show that the proposed method achieves both State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance and user-friendly customization. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-party collaborative training, such as distributed learning and federated learning, is used to address the big data challenges. However, traditional multi-party collaborative training algorithms were mainly designed for balanced data mining tasks and are intended to optimize accuracy (\\emph{e.g.}, cross-entropy). The data distribution in many real-world applications is skewed and classifiers, which are trained to improve accuracy, perform poorly when applied to imbalanced data tasks since models could be significantly biased toward the primary class. Therefore, the Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) was introduced as an effective metric. Although single-machine AUPRC maximization methods have been designed, multi-party collaborative algorithm has never been studied. The change from the single-machine to the multi-party setting poses critical challenges. To address the above challenge, we study the serverless multi-party collaborative AUPRC maximization problem since serverless multi-party collaborative training can cut down the communications cost by avoiding the server node bottleneck, and reformulate it as a conditional stochastic optimization problem in a serverless multi-party collaborative learning setting and propose a new ServerLess biAsed sTochastic gradiEnt (SLATE) algorithm to directly optimize the AUPRC. After that, we use the variance reduction technique and propose ServerLess biAsed sTochastic gradiEnt with Momentum-based variance reduction (SLATE-M) algorithm to improve the convergence rate, which matches the best theoretical convergence result reached by the single-machine online method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to solve the multi-party collaborative AUPRC maximization problem. ",

    "abstract": "When dealing with large graphs, community detection is a useful data triage tool that can identify subsets of the network that a data analyst should investigate. In an adversarial scenario, the graph may be manipulated to avoid scrutiny of certain nodes by the analyst. Robustness to such behavior is an important consideration for data analysts in high-stakes scenarios such as cyber defense and counterterrorism. In this paper, we evaluate the use of overlapping community detection methods in the presence of adversarial attacks aimed at lowering the priority of a specific vertex. We formulate the data analyst's choice as a Stackelberg game in which the analyst chooses a community detection method and the attacker chooses an attack strategy in response. Applying various attacks from the literature to seven real network datasets, we find that, when the attacker has a sufficient budget, overlapping community detection methods outperform non-overlapping methods, often overwhelmingly so. This is the case when the attacker can only add edges that connect to the target and when the capability is added to add edges between neighbors of the target. We also analyze the tradeoff between robustness in the presence of an attack and performance when there is no attack. Our extensible analytic framework enables network data analysts to take these considerations into account and incorporate new attacks and community detection methods as they are developed. ",

Conventional numerical methods face challenges in handling interface conditions. Deep neural networks offer a mesh-free and flexible alternative, but they suffer from drawbacks such as time-consuming optimization and local optima. In this paper, we propose a mesh-free approach based on Randomized Neural Networks (RNNs), which avoid optimization solvers during training, making them more efficient than traditional deep neural networks. Our approach, called Local Randomized Neural Networks (LRNNs), uses different RNNs to approximate solutions in different subdomains. We discretize the interface problem into a linear system at randomly sampled points across the domain, boundary, and interface using a finite difference scheme, and then solve it by a least-square method. For time-dependent interface problems, we use a space-time approach based on LRNNs. We show the effectiveness and robustness of the LRNNs methods through numerical examples of elliptic and parabolic interface problems. We also demonstrate that our approach can handle high-dimension interface problems. Compared to conventional numerical methods, our approach achieves higher accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom, eliminates the need for complex interface meshing and fitting, and significantly reduces training time, outperforming deep neural networks.

Prior methods exploit multi-scale convolutional networks, which are limited in three aspects: (1) Convolutions are local operators while identifying the cause of edge formation requires looking at far away pixels. (2) Priors specific to edge cause are fixed in prediction heads. (3) Using separate networks for generic and fine-grained edge detection, and the constraint between them may be violated. To address these three issues, we propose a two-stage transformer-based network sequentially predicting generic edges and fine-grained edges, which has a global receptive field thanks to the attention mechanism. The prior knowledge of edge causes is formulated as four learnable cause tokens in a cause-aware decoder design. Furthermore, to encourage the consistency between generic edges and fine-grained edges, an edge aggregation and alignment loss is exploited.

Given the promising abilities of large language models (LLMs) in code synthesis, researchers are actively exploring their potential to automate code translation, i.e., generating code in target PL from its equivalent in another PL. The pre-requisite for advancing the state of LLM-based code translation is to understand their limitations. To that end, we present a large-scale empirical study to investigate the ability of LLMs, including general LLMs and code LLMs, for code translation across pairs of different languages, including C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our analysis involves the translation of 1,700 code samples from three distinct benchmarks and real-world projects, revealing LLMs are yet to be reliably used to automate code translation -- with incorrect translations ranging from 52.7% to 97.9% across the studied LLMs. Further manual investigation of unsuccessful translations among all PLs identifies 14 root causes for translation bugs. Based on the insights from the empirical study, we propose a prompt-crafting approach to provide additional context for LLMs, improving the performance of LLM-based code translation by 5.5% on average across different PLs, LLMs, and benchmarks. Our study is the first of its kind, in terms of its scale and breadth, that provides insights into the current limitations of LLMs in code translation and opportunities for improving them. Our collected extensive dataset -- consisting of 1,700 code samples written in five PLs with 10K+ tests, 43K+ translated code, 1,725 manually labeled bugs, and 1,365 bug-fix pairs generated using LLMs -- can help drive research in this area.

Instead of attempting to approximate functions in the inverse problems, we embed a library as a low dimensional manifold in the network such that unknowns can be reduced to some scalars. The nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) is $i\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t}-\\beta\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2}+\\gamma|\\psi|^2\\psi+V(x)\\psi=0,$ where the wave function $\\psi(x,t)$ is the solution to the forward problem and the potential $V(x)$ is the quantity of interest of the inverse problem. The main contributions of this work come from two aspects. First, we construct a special neural network directly from the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, which is motivated by a splitting method. The physics behind the construction enhances explainability of the neural network. The other part is using a library-search algorithm to project the solution space of the inverse problem to a lower-dimensional space. The way to seek the solution in a reduced approximation space can be traced back to the compressed sensing theory. The motivation of this part is to alleviate the training burden in estimating functions. Instead, with a well-chosen library, one can greatly simplify the training process. A brief analysis is given, which focuses on well-possedness of some mentioned inverse problems and convergence of the neural network approximation. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, we explore in some representative problems including simple equations and a couple equation. The results can well verify the theory part. In the future, we can further explore manifold learning to enhance the approximation effect of the library-search algorithm. ",

In thiscontext, iterative proximal algorithms are widely used, enabling to handle non-smooth functions and linear operators. Recently, these algorithms have been paired with deep learning strategies, to further improve the estimate quality. In particular, proximal neural networks (PNNs) have been introduced, obtained by unrolling a proximal algorithm as for finding a MAP estimate, but over a fixed number of iterations, with learned linear operators and parameters. As PNNs are based on optimization theory, they are very flexible, and can be adapted to any image restoration task, as soon as a proximal algorithm can solve it. They further have much lighter architectures than traditional networks. In this article we propose a unified framework to build PNNs for the Gaussian denoising task, based on both the dual-FB and the primal-dual Chambolle-Pock algorithms. We further show that accelerated inertial versions of these algorithms enable skip connections in the associated NN layers. We propose different learning strategies for our PNN framework, and investigate their robustness (Lipschitz property) and denoising efficiency. Finally, we assess the robustness of our PNNs when plugged in a forward-backward algorithm for an image deblurring problem. ",

Emotion recognition is essential in building robust conversational agents in domains such as law, healthcare, education, and customer support. Most of the studies published on SER use datasets created by employing professional actors in a noise-free environment. In natural settings such as a customer care conversation, the audio is often noisy with speakers regularly switching between different languages as they see fit. We have worked in collaboration with a leading unicorn in the Conversational AI sector to develop Natural Speech Emotion Dataset (NSED). NSED is a natural code-mixed speech emotion dataset where each utterance in a conversation is annotated with emotion, sentiment, valence, arousal, and dominance (VAD) values. In this paper, we show that by incorporating word-level VAD value we improve on the task of SER by 2%, for negative emotions, over the baseline value for NSED. High accuracy for negative emotion recognition is essential because customers expressing negative opinions/views need to be pacified with urgency, lest complaints and dissatisfaction snowball and get out of hand. Escalation of negative opinions speedily is crucial for business interests. Our study then can be utilized to develop conversational agents which are more polite and empathetic in such situations. ",

Moreover, decision-based attacks based on querying boundary points in the estimated normal vector direction often suffer from inefficiency and convergence issues. In this paper, we propose a novel query-efficient curvature-aware geometric decision-based black-box attack (CGBA) that conducts boundary search along a semicircular path on a restricted 2D plane to ensure finding a boundary point successfully irrespective of the boundary curvature. While the proposed CGBA attack can work effectively for an arbitrary decision boundary, it is particularly efficient in exploiting the low curvature to craft high-quality adversarial examples, which is widely seen and experimentally verified in commonly used classifiers under non-targeted attacks. In contrast, the decision boundaries often exhibit higher curvature under targeted attacks. Thus, we develop a new query-efficient variant, CGBA-H, that is adapted for the targeted attack. In addition, we further design an algorithm to obtain a better initial boundary point at the expense of some extra queries, which considerably enhances the performance of the targeted attack. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods against some well-known classifiers on the ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets, demonstrating the superiority of CGBA and CGBA-H over state-of-the-art non-targeted and targeted attacks, respectively.

Due to their nature, anomalies sparsely occur in real data, thus making the task of anomaly detection a challenging problem for classification algorithms to solve. Methods that are based on Deep Neural Networks such as LSTM, Autoencoders, Convolutional Autoencoders etc., have shown positive results in such imbalanced data. However, the major challenge that algorithms face when applied to multivariate time series is that the anomaly can arise from a small subset of the feature set. To boost the performance of these base models, we propose a feature-bagging technique that considers only a subset of features at a time, and we further apply a transformation that is based on nested rotation computed from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve the effectiveness and generalization of the approach. To further enhance the prediction performance, we propose an ensemble technique that combines multiple base models toward the final decision. In addition, a semi-supervised approach using a Logistic Regressor to combine the base models' outputs is proposed. The proposed methodology is applied to the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB) dataset, which contains time series data related to the flow of water in a closed circuit, and the experimental results show that the proposed ensemble technique outperforms the basic algorithms.

However, miscalibration through under-confidence has not yet to receive much attention. In this paper, we address the necessity of paying attention to the under-confidence issue. We first introduce a novel metric, a miscalibration score, to identify the overall and class-wise calibration status, including being over or under-confident. Our proposed metric reveals the pitfalls of existing calibration techniques, where they often overly calibrate the model and worsen under-confident predictions. Then we utilize the class-wise miscalibration score as a proxy to design a calibration technique that can tackle both over and under-confidence. We report extensive experiments that show our proposed methods substantially outperforming existing calibration techniques. We also validate our proposed calibration technique on an automatic failure detection task with a risk-coverage curve, reporting that our methods improve failure detection as well as trustworthiness of the model.

    "abstract": "Failure detection (FD) in AI systems is a crucial safeguard for the deployment for safety-critical tasks. The common evaluation method of FD performance is the Risk-coverage (RC) curve, which reveals the trade-off between the data coverage rate and the performance on accepted data. One common way to quantify the RC curve by calculating the area under the RC curve. However, this metric does not inform on how suited any method is for FD, or what the optimal coverage rate should be. As FD aims to achieve higher performance with fewer data discarded, evaluating with partial coverage excluding the most uncertain samples is more intuitive and meaningful than full coverage. In addition, there is an optimal point in the coverage where the model could achieve ideal performance theoretically. We propose the Excess Area Under the Optimal RC Curve (E-AUoptRC), with the area in coverage from the optimal point to the full coverage. Further, the model performance at this optimal point can represent both model learning ability and calibration. We propose it as the Trust Index (TI), a complementary evaluation metric to the overall model accuracy. We report extensive experiments on three benchmark image datasets with ten variants of transformer and CNN models. Our results show that our proposed methods can better reflect the model trustworthiness than existing evaluation metrics. We further observe that the model with high overall accuracy does not always yield the high TI, which indicates the necessity of the proposed Trust Index as a complementary metric to the model overall accuracy.

    "abstract": "Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on real-world graphs consisting of billions of nodes and edges is quite challenging, primarily due to the substantial memory needed to store the graph and its intermediate node and edge features, and there is a pressing need to speed up the training process. A common approach to achieve speed up is to divide the graph into many smaller subgraphs, which are then distributed across multiple GPUs in one or more machines and processed in parallel. However, existing distributed methods require frequent and substantial cross-GPU communication, leading to significant time overhead and progressively diminishing scalability. Here, we introduce CoFree-GNN, a novel distributed GNN training framework that significantly speeds up the training process by implementing communication-free training. The framework utilizes a Vertex Cut partitioning, i.e., rather than partitioning the graph by cutting the edges between partitions, the Vertex Cut partitions the edges and duplicates the node information to preserve the graph structure. Furthermore, the framework maintains high model accuracy by incorporating a reweighting mechanism to handle a distorted graph distribution that arises from the duplicated nodes. We also propose a modified DropEdge technique to further speed up the training process. Using an extensive set of experiments on real-world networks, we demonstrate that CoFree-GNN speeds up the GNN training process by up to 10 times over the existing state-of-the-art GNN training approaches.

    "abstract": "Irregularly sampled multivariate time series are ubiquitous in several application domains, leading to sparse, not fully-observed and non-aligned observations across different variables. Standard sequential neural network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), consider regular spacing between observation times, posing significant challenges to irregular time series modeling. While most of the proposed architectures incorporate RNN variants to handle irregular time intervals, convolutional neural networks have not been adequately studied in the irregular sampling setting. In this paper, we parameterize convolutional layers by employing time-explicitly initialized kernels. Such general functions of time enhance the learning process of continuous-time hidden dynamics and can be efficiently incorporated into convolutional kernel weights. We, thus, propose the time-parameterized convolutional neural network (TPCNN), which shares similar properties with vanilla convolutions but is carefully designed for irregularly sampled time series. We evaluate TPCNN on both interpolation and classification tasks involving real-world irregularly sampled multivariate time series datasets. Our experimental results indicate the competitive performance of the proposed TPCNN model which is also significantly more efficient than other state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, the proposed architecture allows the interpretability of the input series by leveraging the combination of learnable time functions that improve the network performance in subsequent tasks and expedite the inaugural application of convolutions in this field.

    "abstract": "Recent studies of two-view correspondence learning usually establish an end-to-end network to jointly predict correspondence reliability and relative pose. We improve such a framework from two aspects. First, we propose a Local Feature Consensus (LFC) plugin block to augment the features of existing models. Given a correspondence feature, the block augments its neighboring features with mutual neighborhood consensus and aggregates them to produce an enhanced feature. As inliers obey a uniform cross-view transformation and share more consistent learned features than outliers, feature consensus strengthens inlier correlation and suppresses outlier distraction, which makes output features more discriminative for classifying inliers/outliers. Second, existing approaches supervise network training with the ground truth correspondences and essential matrix projecting one image to the other for an input image pair, without considering the information from the reverse mapping. We extend existing models to a Siamese network with a reciprocal loss that exploits the supervision of mutual projection, which considerably promotes the matching performance without introducing additional model parameters. Building upon MSA-Net, we implement the two proposals and experimentally achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. ",

We propose new training losses to reduce useless features and the corresponding detection method without prior knowledge of adversarial attacks. The detection rate (true positive rate) against all given white-box attacks is above 93.9% except for attacks without limits (DF($\\infty$)), while the false positive rate is barely 2.5%.

    "abstract": "With the continuous increase in the size and complexity of machine learning models, the need for specialized hardware to efficiently run such models is rapidly growing. To address such a need, silicon-photonic-based neural network (SP-NN) accelerators have recently emerged as a promising alternative to electronic accelerators due to their lower latency and higher energy efficiency. Not only can SP-NNs alleviate the fan-in and fan-out problem with linear algebra processors, their operational bandwidth can match that of the photodetection rate (typically 100 GHz), which is at least over an order of magnitude faster than electronic counterparts that are restricted to a clock rate of a few GHz. Unfortunately, the underlying silicon photonic devices in SP-NNs suffer from inherent optical losses and crosstalk noise originating from fabrication imperfections and undesired optical couplings, the impact of which accumulates as the network scales up. Consequently, the inferencing accuracy in an SP-NN can be affected by such inefficiencies -- e.g., can drop to below 10% -- the impact of which is yet to be fully studied. In this paper, we comprehensively model the optical loss and crosstalk noise using a bottom-up approach, from the device to the system level, in coherent SP-NNs built using Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) devices. The proposed models can be applied to any SP-NN architecture with different configurations to analyze the effect of loss and crosstalk. Such an analysis is important where there are inferencing accuracy and scalability requirements to meet when designing an SP-NN. Using the proposed analytical framework, we show a high power penalty and a catastrophic inferencing accuracy drop of up to 84% for SP-NNs of different scales with three known MZI mesh configurations (i.e., Reck, Clements, and Diamond) due to accumulated optical loss and crosstalk noise.

    "abstract": "Infrared and visible image fusion has gradually proved to be a vital fork in the field of multi-modality imaging technologies. In recent developments, researchers not only focus on the quality of fused images but also evaluate their performance in downstream tasks. Nevertheless, the majority of methods seldom put their eyes on the mutual learning from different modalities, resulting in fused images lacking significant details and textures. To overcome this issue, we propose an interactive graph neural network (GNN)-based architecture between cross modality for fusion, called IGNet. Specifically, we first apply a multi-scale extractor to achieve shallow features, which are employed as the necessary input to build graph structures. Then, the graph interaction module can construct the extracted intermediate features of the infrared/visible branch into graph structures. Meanwhile, the graph structures of two branches interact for cross-modality and semantic learning, so that fused images can maintain the important feature expressions and enhance the performance of downstream tasks. Besides, the proposed leader nodes can improve information propagation in the same modality. Finally, we merge all graph features to get the fusion result. Extensive experiments on different datasets (TNO, MFNet and M3FD) demonstrate that our IGNet can generate visually appealing fused images while scoring averagely 2.59% mAP@.5 and 7.77% mIoU higher in detection and segmentation than the compared state-of-the-art methods.

In the paper, we propose a Local Structure-aware Graph Contrastive representation Learning method (LS-GCL) to model the structural information of nodes from multiple views. Specifically, we construct the semantic subgraphs that are not limited to the first-order neighbors. For the local view, the semantic subgraph of each target node is input into a shared GNN encoder to obtain the target node embeddings at the subgraph-level. Then, we use a pooling function to generate the subgraph-level graph embeddings. For the global view, considering the original graph preserves indispensable semantic information of nodes, we leverage the shared GNN encoder to learn the target node embeddings at the global graph-level. The proposed LS-GCL model is optimized to maximize the common information among similar instances at three various perspectives through a multi-level contrastive loss function.

Inspired by the effectiveness of contrastive self-supervised methods in utilizing unlabelled data, weiqing explore leveraging these techniques on unlabelled food images. In contrastive self-supervised methods, two views are randomly generated from an image by data augmentations. However, regarding food images, the two views tend to contain similar informative contents, causing large mutual information, which impedes the efficacy of contrastive self-supervised learning. To address this problem, we propose Feature Suppressed Contrast (FeaSC) to reduce mutual information between views. As the similar contents of the two views are salient or highly responsive in the feature map, the proposed FeaSC uses a response-aware scheme to localize salient features in an unsupervised manner. By suppressing some salient features in one view while leaving another contrast view unchanged, the mutual information between the two views is reduced, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of contrast learning for self-supervised food pre-training. As a plug-and-play module, the proposed method consistently improves BYOL and SimSiam by 1.70\\% $\\sim$ 6.69\\% classification accuracy on four publicly available food recognition datasets.

To effectively mine the above three features and establish a high-precision prediction model, we propose a double sampling transformer (DSformer), which consists of the double sampling (DS) block and the temporal variable attention (TVA) block. Firstly, the DS block employs down sampling and piecewise sampling to transform the original series into feature vectors that focus on global information and local information respectively. Then, TVA block uses temporal attention and variable attention to mine these feature vectors from different dimensions and extract key information. Finally, based on a parallel structure, DSformer uses multiple TVA blocks to mine and integrate different features obtained from DS blocks respectively. The integrated feature information is passed to the generative decoder based on a multi-layer perceptron to realize multivariate time series long-term prediction. Experimental results on nine real-world datasets show that DSformer can outperform eight existing baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has exhibited significant success in novel view synthesis, surface reconstruction, etc. However, since no physical reflection is considered in its rendering pipeline, NeRF mistakes the reflection in the mirror as a separate virtual scene, leading to the inaccurate reconstruction of the mirror and multi-view inconsistent reflections in the mirror. In this paper, we present a novel neural rendering framework, named Mirror-NeRF, which is able to learn accurate geometry and reflection of the mirror and support various scene manipulation applications with mirrors, such as adding new objects or mirrors into the scene and synthesizing the reflections of these new objects in mirrors, controlling mirror roughness, etc. To achieve this goal, we propose a unified radiance field by introducing the reflection probability and tracing rays following the light transport model of Whitted Ray Tracing, and also develop several techniques to facilitate the learning process. Experiments and comparisons on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Most existing methods focus on the imbalance of the predicted predicate while ignoring the imbalance of the subject-object pairs, which could not achieve satisfactory results. To address the two imbalance cases, we propose a novel Environment Invariant Curriculum Relation learning (EICR) method, which can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to existing SGG methods. Concretely, to remove the imbalance of the subject-object pairs, we first construct different distribution environments for the subject-object pairs and learn a model invariant to the environment changes. Then, we construct a class-balanced curriculum learning strategy to balance the different environments to remove the predicate imbalance. Comprehensive experiments conducted on VG and GQA datasets demonstrate that our EICR framework can be taken as a general strategy for various SGG models, and achieve significant improvements. ",

This paper shows that instead of hinging on these strenuous operations, quality image representations can be learned by treating scene/multi-label image SSL simply as a multi-label classification problem, which greatly simplifies the learning framework. Specifically, multiple binary pseudo-labels are assigned for each input image by comparing its embeddings with those in two dictionaries, and the network is optimized using the binary cross entropy loss. The proposed method is named Multi-Label Self-supervised learning (MLS). Visualizations qualitatively show that clearly the pseudo-labels by MLS can automatically find semantically similar pseudo-positive pairs across different images to facilitate contrastive learning. MLS learns high quality representations on MS-COCO and achieves state-of-the-art results on classification, detection and segmentation benchmarks. At the same time, MLS is much simpler than existing methods, making it easier to deploy and for further exploration. ",

However, their performance may be significantly degraded when dealing with audio of a different dataset. The orthogonal weight modification to overcome catastrophic forgetting does not consider the similarity of genuine audio across different datasets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a continual learning algorithm for fake audio detection to overcome catastrophic forgetting, called Regularized Adaptive Weight Modification (RAWM). When fine-tuning a detection network, our approach adaptively computes the direction of weight modification according to the ratio of genuine utterances and fake utterances. The adaptive modification direction ensures the network can effectively detect fake audio on the new dataset while preserving its knowledge of old model, thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In addition, genuine audio collected from quite different acoustic conditions may skew their feature distribution, so we introduce a regularization constraint to force the network to remember the old distribution in this regard. Our method can easily be generalized to related fields, like speech emotion recognition. We also evaluate our approach across multiple datasets and obtain a significant performance improvement on cross-dataset experiments. ",

However, poorly designed implicit GNN layers can experience over-smoothing or may have limited adaptability to learn data geometry, potentially hindering their performance in graph learning problems. To address these issues, we introduce a geometric framework to design implicit graph diffusion layers based on a parameterized graph Laplacian operator. Our framework allows learning the geometry of vertex and edge spaces, as well as the graph gradient operator from data. We further show how implicit GNN layers can be viewed as the fixed-point solution of a Dirichlet energy minimization problem and give conditions under which it may suffer from over-smoothing. To overcome the over-smoothing problem, we design our implicit graph diffusion layer as the solution of a Dirichlet energy minimization problem with constraints on vertex features, enabling it to trade off smoothing with the preservation of node feature information. With an appropriate hyperparameter set to be larger than the largest eigenvalue of the parameterized graph Laplacian, our framework guarantees a unique equilibrium and quick convergence. Our models demonstrate better performance than leading implicit and explicit GNNs on benchmark datasets for node and graph classification tasks, with substantial accuracy improvements observed for some datasets.

Drawing inspiration from examples of convolution layers exploiting translation symmetry, we explore how code symmetries can enhance LLM architectures for program analysis and modeling. We present a rigorous group-theoretic framework that formally defines code symmetries as semantics-preserving transformations and provides techniques for precisely reasoning about symmetry preservation within LLM architectures. Using this framework, we introduce a novel variant of self-attention that preserves program symmetries, demonstrating its effectiveness in generalization and robustness through detailed experimental evaluations across different binary and source code analysis tasks. Overall, our code symmetry framework offers rigorous and powerful reasoning techniques that can guide the future development of specialized LLMs for code and advance LLM-guided program reasoning tasks.

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are prone to various vulnerabilities, leading to substantial financial losses over time. Current analysis tools mainly target vulnerabilities with fixed control or dataflow patterns, such as re-entrancy and integer overflow. However, a recent study on Web3 security bugs revealed that about 80% of these bugs cannot be audited by existing tools due to the lack of domain-specific property description and checking. Given recent advances in Generative Pretraining Transformer (GPT), it is worth exploring how GPT could aid in detecting logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts. In this paper, we propose GPTScan, the first tool combining GPT with static analysis for smart contract logic vulnerability detection. Instead of relying solely on GPT to identify vulnerabilities, which can lead to high false positives and is limited by GPT's pre-trained knowledge, we utilize GPT as a versatile code understanding tool. By breaking down each logic vulnerability type into scenarios and properties, GPTScan matches candidate vulnerabilities with GPT. To enhance accuracy, GPTScan further instructs GPT to intelligently recognize key variables and statements, which are then validated by static confirmation. Evaluation on diverse datasets with around 400 contract projects and 3K Solidity files shows that GPTScan achieves high precision (over 90%) for token contracts and acceptable precision (57.14%) for large projects like Web3Bugs. It effectively detects groundtruth logic vulnerabilities with a recall of over 80%, including 9 new vulnerabilities missed by human auditors. GPTScan is fast and cost-effective, taking an average of 14.39 seconds and 0.01 USD to scan per thousand lines of Solidity code. Moreover, static confirmation helps GPTScan reduce two-thirds of false positives. ",

Existing FL systems typically adopt Federated Average (FedAvg) as the training algorithm and implement differential privacy with a Gaussian mechanism. However, the inherent privacy-utility trade-off in these systems severely degrades the training performance if a tight privacy budget is enforced. Besides, the Gaussian mechanism requires model weights to be of high-precision. To improve communication efficiency and achieve a better privacy-utility trade-off, we propose a communication-efficient FL training algorithm with differential privacy guarantee. Specifically, we propose to adopt binary neural networks (BNNs) and introduce discrete noise in the FL setting. Binary model parameters are uploaded for higher communication efficiency and discrete noise is added to achieve the client-level differential privacy protection. The achieved performance guarantee is rigorously proved, and it is shown to depend on the level of discrete noise. Experimental results based on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets will demonstrate that the proposed training algorithm achieves client-level privacy protection with performance gain while enjoying the benefits of low communication overhead from binary model updates.

The proposed method reduces neural networks via eliminating stable ReLU neurons, and transforming them into a sequential neural network consisting of ReLU and Affine layers which can be handled by the most verification tools. We instantiate the reduction technique on the state-of-the-art complete and incomplete verification tools, including alpha-beta-crown, VeriNet and PRIMA. Our experiments on a large set of benchmarks indicate that the proposed technique can significantly reduce neural networks and speed up existing verification tools.

    "abstract": "\\textit{Federated learning} (FL) is a nascent distributed learning paradigm to train a shared global model without violating users' privacy. FL has been shown to be vulnerable to various Byzantine attacks, where malicious participants could independently or collusively upload well-crafted updates to deteriorate the performance of the global model. However, existing defenses could only mitigate part of Byzantine attacks, without providing an all-sided shield for FL. It is difficult to simply combine them as they rely on totally contradictory assumptions. In this paper, we propose FPD, a \\underline{\\textbf{f}}our-\\underline{\\textbf{p}}ronged \\underline{\\textbf{d}}efense against both non-colluding and colluding Byzantine attacks. Our main idea is to utilize absolute similarity to filter updates rather than relative similarity used in existingI works. To this end, we first propose a reliable client selection strategy to prevent the majority of threats in the bud. Then we design a simple but effective score-based detection method to mitigate colluding attacks. Third, we construct an enhanced spectral-based outlier detector to accurately discard abnormal updates when the training data is \\textit{not independent and identically distributed} (non-IID). Finally, we design update denoising to rectify the direction of the slightly noisy but harmful updates. The four sequentially combined modules can effectively reconcile the contradiction in addressing non-colluding and colluding Byzantine attacks. Extensive experiments over three benchmark image classification datasets against four state-of-the-art Byzantine attacks demonstrate that FPD drastically outperforms existing defenses in IID and non-IID scenarios (with $30\\%$ improvement on model accuracy).

The second module is a Distortion-Adaptive Attention Block that reduces local distortions on multi-scale features. Secondly, to exploit the unique characteristics of 360{\\deg} data, we present a learnable relation matrix and use it as part of the positional embedding to further improve performance.

    "title": "POSIT: Promotion of Semantic Item Tail via Adversarial Learning",
    "abstract": "In many recommender problems, a handful of popular items (e.g. movies/TV shows, news etc.) can be dominant in recommendations for many users. However, we know that in a large catalog of items, users are likely interested in more than what is popular. The dominance of popular items may mean that users will not see items they would likely enjoy. In this paper, we propose a technique to overcome this problem using adversarial machine learning. We define a metric to translate user-level utility metric in terms of an advantage/disadvantage over items. We subsequently use that metric in an adversarial learning framework to systematically promote disadvantaged items. The resulting algorithm identifies semantically meaningful items that get promoted in the learning algorithm. In the empirical study, we evaluate the proposed technique on three publicly available datasets and four competitive baselines. The result shows that our proposed method not only improves the coverage, but also, surprisingly, improves the overall performance. ",

    "abstract": "Class-incremental learning (CIL) has achieved remarkable successes in learning new classes consecutively while overcoming catastrophic forgetting on old categories. However, most existing CIL methods unreasonably assume that all old categories have the same forgetting pace, and neglect negative influence of forgetting heterogeneity among different old classes on forgetting compensation. To surmount the above challenges, we develop a novel Heterogeneous Forgetting Compensation (HFC) model, which can resolve heterogeneous forgetting of easy-to-forget and hard-to-forget old categories from both representation and gradient aspects. Specifically, we design a task-semantic aggregation block to alleviate heterogeneous forgetting from representation aspect. It aggregates local category information within each task to learn task-shared global representations. Moreover, we develop two novel plug-and-play losses: a gradient-balanced forgetting compensation loss and a gradient-balanced relation distillation loss to alleviate forgetting from gradient aspect. They consider gradient-balanced compensation to rectify forgetting heterogeneity of old categories and heterogeneous relation consistency. Experiments on several representative datasets illustrate effectiveness of our HFC model. The code is available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HFC. ",

The decision model, derived from Fishburn and LaValle (1996) and whose parameters we learn, is general enough to be compatible with any strict weak order on subsets, thanks to the consideration of possible interactions between elements. Moreover, we accept not to predict some preferences if the available preference data are not compatible with a reliable prediction. A predicted preference is considered reliable if all the simplest models (Occam's razor) explaining the preference data agree on it. Following the robust ordinal regression methodology, our predictions are based on an uncertainty set encompassing the possible values of the model parameters. We define a robust ordinal dominance relation between subsets and we design a procedure to determine whether this dominance relation holds. Numerical tests are provided on synthetic and real-world data to evaluate the richness and reliability of the preference predictions made. ",

    "abstract": "Friedrichs' systems (FS) are symmetric positive linear systems of first-order partial differential equations (PDEs), which provide a unified framework for describing various elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic semi-linear PDEs such as the linearized Euler equations of gas dynamics, the equations of compressible linear elasticity and the Dirac-Klein-Gordon system. FS were studied to approximate PDEs of mixed elliptic and hyperbolic type in the same domain. For this and other reasons, the versatility of the discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM) represents the best approximation space for FS. We implement a distributed memory solver for stationary FS in deal.II. Our focus is model order reduction. Since FS model hyperbolic PDEs, they often suffer from a slow Kolmogorov n-width decay. We develop two approaches to tackle this problem. The first is domain decomposable reduced-order models (DD-ROMs). We will show that the DGM offers a natural formulation of DD-ROMs, in particular regarding interface penalties, compared to the continuous finite element method. We also develop new repartitioning strategies to obtain more efficient local approximations of the solution manifold. The second approach involves graph neural networks used to infer the limit of a succession of projection-based linear ROMs corresponding to lower viscosity constants: the heuristic behind is to develop a multi-fidelity super-resolution paradigm to mimic the mathematical convergence to vanishing viscosity solutions while exploiting to the most interpretable and certified projection-based ROMs. ",

Robots are adept at deliberately moving, sensing, and interacting with their environments. The pervasive use of this technology promises societal and economic payoffs due to its capabilities - conversely, the capabilities of robots to move within and sense the world around them is susceptible to abuse. Robots, unlike typical sensors, are inherently autonomous, active, and deliberate. Such automated agents can become AI double agents liable to violate the privacy of coworkers, privileged spaces, and other stakeholders. In this work we highlight the understudied and inevitable threats to privacy that can be posed by the autonomous, deliberate motions and sensing of robots. We frame the problem within broader sociotechnological questions alongside a comprehensive review. The privacy-aware motion planning problem is formulated in terms of cost functions that can be modified to induce privacy-aware behavior - preserving, agnostic, or violating. Simulated case studies in manipulation and navigation, with altered cost functions, are used to demonstrate how privacy-violating threats can be easily injected, sometimes with only small changes in performance (solution path lengths). Such functionality is already widely available. This preliminary work is meant to lay the foundations for near-future, holistic, interdisciplinary investigations that can address questions surrounding privacy in intelligent robotic behaviors determined by planning algorithms.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation addresses the issue of preference drift by predicting the next item based on the user's previous behaviors. Recently, a promising approach using contrastive learning has emerged, demonstrating its effectiveness in recommending items under sparse user-item interactions. Significantly, the effectiveness of combinations of various augmentation methods has been demonstrated in different domains, particularly in computer vision. However, when it comes to augmentation within a contrastive learning framework in sequential recommendation, previous research has only focused on limited conditions and simple structures. Thus, it is still possible to extend existing approaches to boost the effects of augmentation methods by using progressed structures with the combinations of multiple augmentation methods. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Hierarchical Contrastive Learning with Multiple Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation(HCLRec) to overcome the aforementioned limitation. Our framework leverages existing augmentation methods hierarchically to improve performance. By combining augmentation methods continuously, we generate low-level and high-level view pairs. We employ a Transformers-based model to encode the input sequence effectively. Furthermore, we introduce additional blocks consisting of Transformers and position-wise feed-forward network(PFFN) layers to learn the invariance of the original sequences from hierarchically augmented views. We pass the input sequence to subsequent layers based on the number of increment levels applied to the views to handle various augmentation levels. Within each layer, we compute contrastive loss between pairs of views at the same level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and that HCLRec is robust even when faced with the problem of sparse interaction. ",

Recently, synthetic data has been widely used for pose estimation tasks, but most methods still rely on supervised learning paradigms utilising synthetic images and labels. Can training be fully unsupervised? Is a tiny synthetic dataset sufficient? What are the minimum assumptions that we could make for estimating animal pose? Our proposal addresses these questions through a simple yet effective self-supervised method that only assumes the availability of unlabelled images and a small set of synthetic 2D poses. We completely remove the need for any 3D or 2D pose annotations (or complex 3D animal models), and surprisingly our approach can still learn accurate 3D and 2D poses simultaneously. We train our method with unlabelled images of horses mainly collected for YouTube videos and a prior consisting of 2D synthetic poses. The latter is three times smaller than the number of images needed for training. We test our method on a challenging set of horse images and evaluate the predicted 3D and 2D poses. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn accurate animal poses even with as few assumptions as unlabelled images and a small set of 2D poses generated from synthetic data. Given the minimum requirements and the abundance of unlabelled data, our method could be easily deployed to different animals. ",

Multi-Head Attention (MHA) employs an absolute positional encoding, which imposes limitations on token length and entails substantial memory consumption during the processing of embedded inputs. The current remedy proposed by researchers involves the utilization of relative positional encoding, similar to the approach adopted in Transformer-XL or Relative Multi-Head Attention (RMHA), albeit the employed architecture consumes considerable memory resources. To address these challenges, this study endeavors to refine MHA, leveraging relative positional encoding in conjunction with the Depth-Wise Convolutional Layer architecture, which promises heightened accuracy coupled with minimized memory usage. The proposed RCMHA framework entails the modification of two integral components: firstly, the application of the Depth-Wise Convolutional Layer to the input embedding, encompassing Query, Key, and Value parameters; secondly, the incorporation of Relative Positional Encoding into the attention scoring phase, harmoniously integrated with Scaled Dot-Product Attention. Empirical experiments underscore the advantages of RCMHA, wherein it exhibits superior accuracy, boasting a score of 0.572 in comparison to alternative attention modules such as MHA, Multi-DConv-Head Attention (MDHA), and RMHA.

The vast majority of these relations are defined as positive statements, but the importance of negative statements is increasingly recognized, especially under an Open World Assumption. Explicitly considering negative statements has been shown to improve performance on tasks such as entity summarization and question answering or domain-specific tasks such as protein function prediction. However, no attention has been given to the exploration of negative statements by knowledge graph embedding approaches despite the potential of negative statements to produce more accurate representations of entities in a knowledge graph. We propose a novel approach, TrueWalks, to incorporate negative statements into the knowledge graph representation learning process. In particular, we present a novel walk-generation method that is able to not only differentiate between positive and negative statements but also take into account the semantic implications of negation in ontology-rich knowledge graphs. This is of particular importance for applications in the biomedical domain, where the inadequacy of embedding approaches regarding negative statements at the ontology level has been identified as a crucial limitation. We evaluate TrueWalks in ontology-rich biomedical knowledge graphs in two different predictive tasks based on KG embeddings: protein-protein interaction prediction and gene-disease association prediction. We conduct an extensive analysis over established benchmarks and demonstrate that our method is able to improve the performance of knowledge graph embeddings on all tasks. ",

By introducing positional embeddings based on eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, geometric properties are encoded intrinsically and Dirichlet, Neumann and periodic boundary conditions of the PDE solution are enforced directly through the neural network architecture. The proposed embeddings lead to improved error convergence for static PDEs and extend EDNNs towards computational domains of realistic complexity. Several steps are taken to improve performance of EDNNs: Solving the EDNN update equation with a Krylov solver avoids the explicit assembly of Jacobians and enables scaling to larger neural networks. Computational efficiency is further improved by an ad-hoc active sampling scheme that uses the PDE dynamics to effectively sample collocation points. A modified linearly implicit Rosenbrock method is proposed to alleviate the time step requirements of stiff PDEs. Lastly, a completely training-free approach, which automatically enforces initial conditions and only requires time integration, is compared against EDNNs that are trained on the initial conditions. We report results for the Korteweg-de Vries equation, a nonlinear heat equation and (nonlinear) advection-diffusion problems on domains with and without holes and various boundary conditions, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The numerical results highlight EDNNs as a promising surrogate model for parametrized PDEs with slow decaying Kolmogorov n-width. ",

The proposed system leverages the VGG16 model for feature extraction and utilizes a custom Siamese network with triplet loss, referred to as RoadScan. The system aims to address the critical issue of potholes on roads, which pose significant risks to road users. Accidents due to potholes on the roads have led to numerous accidents. Although it is necessary to completely remove potholes, it is a time-consuming process. Hence, a general road user should be able to detect potholes from a safe distance in order to avoid damage. Existing methods for pothole detection heavily rely on object detection algorithms which tend to have a high chance of failure owing to the similarity in structures and textures of a road and a pothole. Additionally, these systems utilize millions of parameters thereby making the model difficult to use in small-scale applications for the general citizen. By analyzing diverse image processing methods and various high-performing networks, the proposed model achieves remarkable performance in accurately detecting potholes. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, EER, precision, recall, and AUROC validate the effectiveness of the system.

Through this pipeline, we establish the Discrete and Continuous Instant-level (DCI) dataset, enabling comprehensive experiments involving three detection models and three physical adversarial attacks. Our findings highlight diverse model performances under adversarial conditions. Yolo v6 demonstrates remarkable resilience, experiencing just a marginal 6.59% average drop in average precision (AP). In contrast, the ASA attack yields a substantial 14.51% average AP reduction, twice the effect of other algorithms. We also note that static scenes yield higher recognition AP values, and outcomes remain relatively consistent across varying weather conditions. Intriguingly, our study suggests that advancements in adversarial attack algorithms may be approaching its ``limitation''.In summary, our work underscores the significance of adversarial attacks in real-world contexts and introduces the DCI dataset as a versatile benchmark.

    "abstract": "Recent interactive segmentation methods iteratively take source image, user guidance and previously predicted mask as the input without considering the invariant nature of the source image. As a result, extracting features from the source image is repeated in each interaction, resulting in substantial computational redundancy. In this work, we propose the Feature Decoupling-Recycling Network (FDRN), which decouples the modeling components based on their intrinsic discrepancies and then recycles components for each user interaction. Thus, the efficiency of the whole interactive process can be significantly improved. To be specific, we apply the Decoupling-Recycling strategy from three perspectives to address three types of discrepancies, respectively. First, our model decouples the learning of source image semantics from the encoding of user guidance to process two types of input domains separately. Second, FDRN decouples high-level and low-level features from stratified semantic representations to enhance feature learning. Third, during the encoding of user guidance, current user guidance is decoupled from historical guidance to highlight the effect of current user guidance. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 datasets from different domains and modalities, which demonstrate the following merits of our model: 1) superior efficiency than other methods, particularly advantageous in challenging scenarios requiring long-term interactions (up to 4.25x faster), while achieving favorable segmentation performance; 2) strong applicability to various methods serving as a universal enhancement technique; 3) well cross-task generalizability, e.g., to medical image segmentation, and robustness against misleading user guidance.

    "title": "DNFOMP: Dynamic Neural Field Optimal Motion Planner for Navigation of  Autonomous Robots in Cluttered Environment",
    "abstract": "Motion planning in dynamically changing environments is one of the most complex challenges in autonomous driving. Safety is a crucial requirement, along with driving comfort and speed limits. While classical sampling-based, lattice-based, and optimization-based planning methods can generate smooth and short paths, they often do not consider the dynamics of the environment. Some techniques do consider it, but they rely on updating the environment on-the-go rather than explicitly accounting for the dynamics, which is not suitable for self-driving. To address this, we propose a novel method based on the Neural Field Optimal Motion Planner (NFOMP), which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of normalized curvature and the number of cusps. Our approach embeds previously known moving obstacles into the neural field collision model to account for the dynamics of the environment. We also introduce time profiling of the trajectory and non-linear velocity constraints by adding Lagrange multipliers to the trajectory loss function. We applied our method to solve the optimal motion planning problem in an urban environment using the BeamNG.tech driving simulator. An autonomous car drove the generated trajectories in three city scenarios while sharing the road with the obstacle vehicle. Our evaluation shows that the maximum acceleration the passenger can experience instantly is -7.5 m/s^2 and that 89.6% of the driving time is devoted to normal driving with accelerations below 3.5 m/s^2. The driving style is characterized by 46.0% and 31.4% of the driving time being devoted to the light rail transit style and the moderate driving style, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Airwriting recognition is a task that involves identifying letters written in free space using finger movement. It is a special case of gesture recognition, where gestures correspond to letters in a specific language. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain activity and has been widely used in brain-computer interface applications. Leveraging EEG signals for airwriting recognition offers a promising alternative input method for Human-Computer Interaction. One key advantage of airwriting recognition is that users don't need to learn new gestures. By concatenating recognized letters, a wide range of words can be formed, making it applicable to a broader population. However, there has been limited research in the recognition of airwriting using EEG signals, which forms the core focus of this study. The NeuroAiR dataset comprising EEG signals recorded during writing English uppercase alphabets is first constructed. Various features are then explored in conjunction with different deep learning models to achieve accurate airwriting recognition. These features include processed EEG data, Independent Component Analysis components, source-domain-based scout time series, and spherical and head harmonic decomposition-based features. Furthermore, the impact of different EEG frequency bands on system performance is comprehensively investigated. The highest accuracy achieved in this study is 44.04% using Independent Component Analysis components and the EEGNet classification model. The results highlight the potential of EEG-based airwriting recognition as a user-friendly modality for alternative input methods in Human-Computer Interaction applications. This research sets a strong baseline for future advancements and demonstrates the viability and utility of EEG-based airwriting recognition. ",

    "abstract": "The Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) market is rapidly expanding and becoming more mature. For example, OpenAI's ChatGPT is an advanced large language model (LLM) that generates responses for various queries with associated fees. Although these models can deliver satisfactory performance, they are far from perfect. Researchers have long studied the vulnerabilities and limitations of LLMs, such as adversarial attacks and model toxicity. Inevitably, commercial ML models are also not exempt from such issues, which can be problematic as MLaaS continues to grow. In this paper, we discover a new attack strategy against LLM APIs, namely the prompt abstraction attack. Specifically, we propose Mondrian, a simple and straightforward method that abstracts sentences, which can lower the cost of using LLM APIs. In this approach, the adversary first creates a pseudo API (with a lower established price) to serve as the proxy of the target API (with a higher established price). Next, the pseudo API leverages Mondrian to modify the user query, obtain the abstracted response from the target API, and forward it back to the end user. Our results show that Mondrian successfully reduces user queries' token length ranging from 13% to 23% across various tasks, including text classification, generation, and question answering. Meanwhile, these abstracted queries do not significantly affect the utility of task-specific and general language models like ChatGPT. Mondrian also reduces instruction prompts' token length by at least 11% without compromising output quality. As a result, the prompt abstraction attack enables the adversary to profit without bearing the cost of API development and deployment. ",

It is up to 8.3x faster than SCC, the state-of-the-art distributed algorithm for hierarchical clustering, while achieving 1.16x higher quality. In fact, TeraHAC essentially retains the quality of the celebrated HAC algorithm while significantly improving the running time. ",

    "abstract": "Modern applications commonly need to manage dataset types composed of heterogeneous data and schemas, making it difficult to access them in an integrated way. A single data store to manage heterogeneous data using a common data model is not effective in such a scenario, which results in the domain data being fragmented in the data stores that best fit their storage and access requirements (e.g., NoSQL, relational DBMS, or HDFS). Besides, organization workflows independently consume these fragments, and usually, there is no explicit link among the fragments that would be useful to support an integrated view. The research challenge tackled by this work is to provide the means to query heterogeneous data residing on distinct data repositories that are not explicitly connected. We propose a federated database architecture by providing a single abstract global conceptual schema to users, allowing them to write their queries, encapsulating data heterogeneity, location, and linkage by employing: (i) meta-models to represent the global conceptual schema, the remote data local conceptual schemas, and mappings among them; (ii) provenance to create explicit links among the consumed and generated data residing in separate datasets. We evaluated the architecture through its implementation as a polystore service, following a microservice architecture approach, in a scenario that simulates a real case in Oil \\& Gas industry. Also, we compared the proposed architecture to a relational multidatabase system based on foreign data wrappers, measuring the user's cognitive load to write a query (or query complexity) and the query processing time. The results demonstrated that the proposed architecture allows query writing two times less complex than the one written for the relational multidatabase system, adding an excess of no more than 30% in query processing time.

This study highlights the significance of spatial-temporal deep learning (DL) techniques within the DSM framework. A novel architecture is proposed, incorporating spatial information using a base convolutional neural network (CNN) model and spatial attention mechanism, along with climate temporal information using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, for SOC prediction across Europe. The model utilizes a comprehensive set of environmental features, including Landsat-8 images, topography, remote sensing indices, and climate time series, as input features. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional ML approaches like random forest commonly used in DSM, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE). This model is a robust tool for predicting SOC and could be applied to other soil properties, thereby contributing to the advancement of DSM techniques and facilitating land management and decision-making processes based on accurate information.

    "abstract": "Multimedia recommendation has received much attention in recent years. It models user preferences based on both behavior information and item multimodal information. Though current GCN-based methods achieve notable success, they suffer from two limitations: (1) Modality noise contamination to the item representations. Existing methods often mix modality features and behavior features in a single view (e.g., user-item view) for propagation, the noise in the modality features may be amplified and coupled with behavior features. In the end, it leads to poor feature discriminability; (2) Incomplete user preference modeling caused by equal treatment of modality features. Users often exhibit distinct modality preferences when purchasing different items. Equally fusing each modality feature ignores the relative importance among different modalities, leading to the suboptimal user preference modeling. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel Multi-View Graph Convolutional Network for the multimedia recommendation. Specifically, to avoid modality noise contamination, the modality features are first purified with the aid of item behavior information. Then, the purified modality features of items and behavior features are enriched in separate views, including the user-item view and the item-item view. In this way, the distinguishability of features is enhanced. Meanwhile, a behavior-aware fuser is designed to comprehensively model user preferences by adaptively learning the relative importance of different modality features. Furthermore, we equip the fuser with a self-supervised auxiliary task. This task is expected to maximize the mutual information between the fused multimodal features and behavior features, so as to capture complementary and supplementary preference information simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. ",

    "abstract": "Extracting useful visual cues for the downstream tasks is especially challenging under low-light vision. Prior works create enhanced representations by either correlating visual quality with machine perception or designing illumination-degrading transformation methods that require pre-training on synthetic datasets. We argue that optimizing enhanced image representation pertaining to the loss of the downstream task can result in more expressive representations. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel module, FeatEnHancer, that hierarchically combines multiscale features using multiheaded attention guided by task-related loss function to create suitable representations. Furthermore, our intra-scale enhancement improves the quality of features extracted at each scale or level, as well as combines features from different scales in a way that reflects their relative importance for the task at hand. FeatEnHancer is a general-purpose plug-and-play module and can be incorporated into any low-light vision pipeline. We show with extensive experimentation that the enhanced representation produced with FeatEnHancer significantly and consistently improves results in several low-light vision tasks, including dark object detection (+5.7 mAP on ExDark), face detection (+1.5 mAPon DARK FACE), nighttime semantic segmentation (+5.1 mIoU on ACDC ), and video object detection (+1.8 mAP on DarkVision), highlighting the effectiveness of enhancing hierarchical features under low-light vision.

However, under their blind spot constraints, previous self-supervised video denoising methods suffer from significant information loss and texture destruction in either the whole reference frame or neighbor frames, due to their inadequate consideration of the receptive field. Moreover, the limited number of available neighbor frames in previous methods leads to the discarding of distant temporal information. Nonetheless, simply adopting existing recurrent frameworks does not work, since they easily break the constraints on the receptive field imposed by self-supervision. In this paper, we propose RDRF for self-supervised video denoising, which not only fully exploits both the reference and neighbor frames with a denser receptive field, but also better leverages the temporal information from both local and distant neighbor features. First, towards a comprehensive utilization of information from both reference and neighbor frames, RDRF realizes a denser receptive field by taking more neighbor pixels along the spatial and temporal dimensions. Second, it features a self-supervised recurrent video denoising framework, which concurrently integrates distant and near-neighbor temporal features. This enables long-term bidirectional information aggregation, while mitigating error accumulation in the plain recurrent framework. Our method exhibits superior performance on both synthetic and real video denoising datasets. Codes will be available at https://github.com/Wang-XIaoDingdd/RDRF. ",

Interface limits between planning areas are sometimes published, but they are not generalizable to arbitrary zone shapes.

Here, we present a simple method for estimating ITLs using a DC power flow approximation via the power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix. Linear optimization is performed to identify the distribution of power flows that maximizes the total flow on interface-crossing lines, subject to individual line ratings, limits on bus injection/withdrawal, and the relationships among flows, injections, and withdrawals imposed by the PTDF matrix. We demonstrate the application of the method on a 134-zone ~65000-bus system, and we explore the influence of flow direction, contingency level, and zone size on the estimated ITLs. There is significant heterogeneity in the ratio of the ITL to the sum of interface-crossing line ratings, which highlights the importance of accounting for the physical constraints on power flows imposed by Kirchhoff's laws when estimating zonal ITLs.

Furthermore, we explore diverse adaptations of the node2vec algorithm to induce distinct exploratory behaviors. Our empirical findings demonstrate that despite the varied behaviors inherent in these embeddings, only slight performance differences manifest in the context of link prediction.

This paper proposes a novel method for RUL prediction of Lithium-ion batteries. The proposed framework comprises two stages: determining the FPC using a neural network-based model to divide the degradation data into distinct health states and predicting the degradation pattern after the FPC to estimate the remaining useful life as a percentage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches in terms of RUL prediction.

In Pearl's framework of using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to capture the causal intervention, a Diffusion-based Causal Model (DCM) was proposed incorporating the diffusion model to answer the causal questions more accurately, assuming that all of the confounders are observed. However, unmeasured confounders in practice exist, which hinders DCM from being applicable. To alleviate this limitation of DCM, we propose an extended model called Backdoor Criterion based DCM (BDCM), whose idea is rooted in the Backdoor criterion to find the variables in DAG to be included in the decoding process of the diffusion model so that we can extend DCM to the case with unmeasured confounders. Synthetic data experiment demonstrates that our proposed model captures the counterfactual distribution more precisely than DCM under the unmeasured confounders. ",

    "abstract": "Video-based person Re-Identification (V-ReID) aims to retrieve specific persons from raw videos captured by non-overlapped cameras. As a fundamental task, it spreads many multimedia and computer vision applications. However, due to the variations of persons and scenes, there are still many obstacles that must be overcome for high performance. In this work, we notice that both the long-term and short-term information of persons are important for robust video representations. Thus, we propose a novel deep learning framework named Long Short-Term Representation Learning (LSTRL) for effective V-ReID. More specifically, to extract long-term representations, we propose a Multi-granularity Appearance Extractor (MAE), in which four granularity appearances are effectively captured across multiple frames. Meanwhile, to extract short-term representations, we propose a Bi-direction Motion Estimator (BME), in which reciprocal motion information is efficiently extracted from consecutive frames. The MAE and BME are plug-and-play and can be easily inserted into existing networks for efficient feature learning. As a result, they significantly improve the feature representation ability for V-ReID. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks show that our proposed approach can deliver better performances than most state-of-the-arts. ",

Different from images or languages, real-world financial data are high-dimensional, sparse, noisy and extremely imbalanced, which makes deep neural network models particularly challenging to train and fragile in practice. In this work, we propose DeRisk, an effective deep learning risk prediction framework for credit risk prediction on real-world financial data. DeRisk is the first deep risk prediction model that outperforms statistical learning approaches deployed in our company's production system. We also perform extensive ablation studies on our method to present the most critical factors for the empirical success of DeRisk. ",

We propose an adaptive robust control that can actively learn the ellipsoid sets. Particularly, the proposed approach utilizes the recursive set-membership state estimation in learning the ellipsoidal sets, aiming at mitigating uncertainties in the system control. Upon the learned sets representing the recognized uncertainties, we construct a robust control with one-step prediction for system output tracking. In deriving an optimized control law, we reformulate the optimization objective into a second-order cone programming problem that can be solved in a computationally friendly way. To further stimulate the active learning of uncertainties over the control procedures, we enrich the information used for the learning by maximizing the volume of the ellipsoid set, supposed to lead to increased learning accuracy and accelerated uncertainty reduction. To verify our approach, we conduct numerical simulations to compare the fixed-ellipsoidal-set robust control with ours, and investigate the positive effect of the designed active learning in the uncertain system control process.

FSDv1 stands out as a representative work, achieving impressive efficacy and efficiency, albeit with intricate structures and handcrafted designs. In this paper, we present FSDv2, an evolution that aims to simplify the previous FSDv1 while eliminating the inductive bias introduced by its handcrafted instance-level representation, thus promoting better general applicability. To this end, we introduce the concept of \\textbf{virtual voxels}, which takes over the clustering-based instance segmentation in FSDv1. Virtual voxels not only address the notorious issue of the Center Feature Missing problem in fully sparse detectors but also endow the framework with a more elegant and streamlined approach. Consequently, we develop a suite of components to complement the virtual voxel concept, including a virtual voxel encoder, a virtual voxel mixer, and a virtual voxel assignment strategy. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that the virtual voxel mechanism is functionally similar to the handcrafted clustering in FSDv1 while being more general. We conduct experiments on three large-scale datasets: Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2 dataset, and nuScenes dataset. Our results showcase state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets, highlighting the superiority of FSDv2 in long-range scenarios and its general applicability to achieve competitive performance across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we provide comprehensive experimental analysis to elucidate the workings of FSDv2.

Frequently used measures for fat estimation are the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, or the waist-hip-ratio.

The estimation of visceral (VAT) and abdominal subcutaneous (ASAT) adipose tissue volume has shown to be a more accurate measure for named risk factors. In this work, we show that triangulated body surface meshes can be used to accurately predict VAT and ASAT volumes using graph neural networks. Our methods achieve high performance while reducing training time and required resources compared to state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in this area. We furthermore envision this method to be applicable to cheaper and easily accessible medical surface scans instead of expensive medical images. ",

However, state-of-the-art SRNs do not adapt the allocation of available network parameters to the complex features found in scientific data, leading to a loss in reconstruction quality. We address this shortcoming with an adaptively placed multi-grid SRN (APMGSRN) and propose a domain decomposition training and inference technique for accelerated parallel training on multi-GPU systems. We also release an open-source neural volume rendering application that allows plug-and-play rendering with any PyTorch-based SRN. Our proposed APMGSRN architecture uses multiple spatially adaptive feature grids that learn where to be placed within the domain to dynamically allocate more neural network resources where error is high in the volume, improving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy of SRNs for scientific data without requiring expensive octree refining, pruning, and traversal like previous adaptive models. In our domain decomposition approach for representing large-scale data, we train an set of APMGSRNs in parallel on separate bricks of the volume to reduce training time while avoiding overhead necessary for an out-of-core solution for volumes too large to fit in GPU memory. After training, the lightweight SRNs are used for realtime neural volume rendering in our open-source renderer, where arbitrary view angles and transfer functions can be explored.

We introduce a simple pipeline that employs a standard prediction with a U-Net, followed by a single graph neural network to associate and classify vertebrae with full orientation. To test our method, we introduce a new vertebra dataset that also contains pedicle detections that are associated with vertebra bodies, creating a more challenging landmark prediction, association and classification task. Our method is able to accurately associate the correct body and pedicle landmarks, ignore false positives and classify vertebrae in a simple, fully trainable pipeline avoiding application-specific heuristics.

We provide the most accurate (in terms of faithfulness to the original literature) versions of these models to clarify the deviation from them existing in their variants adopted in one of the most popular network analysis packages. The difference in technical realizations of those models could be conceived as minor details, but we discover significantly notable changes caused by the possibly inadvertent modification. For the Harary model, the stochasticity in the original formulation allows a much wider range of the clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length. For the Newman-Watts model, due to the drastically different degree distributions, the clustering coefficient can also be affected, which is verified by our higher-order analytic derivation. During the process, we discover the equivalence of the Newman-Watts (better known in the network science or physics community) and the Harary (better known in the graph theory or mathematics community) models under a specific condition of restricted parity in variables, which would bridge the two relatively independently developed models in different fields. Our result highlights the importance of each detailed step in constructing network models and the possibility of deeply related models, even if they might initially appear distinct in terms of the time period or the academic disciplines from which they emerged.

Apart from the model capacity, this ability is indirectly under the effect of how close the relaxed quantization is to the actual hard quantization. Optimizing the parameters of a rate-distortion variational autoencoder (R-D VAE) is ruled by this approximated quantization scheme. In this paper, we propose a feature-level frequency disentanglement to help the relaxed scalar quantization achieve lower bit rates by guiding the high entropy latent features to include most of the low-frequency texture of the image. In addition, to strengthen the de-correlating power of the transformer-based analysis/synthesis transform, an augmented self-attention score calculation based on the Hadamard product is utilized during both encoding and decoding. Channel-wise autoregressive entropy modeling takes advantage of the proposed frequency separation as it inherently directs high-informational low-frequency channels to the first chunks and conditions the future chunks on it. The proposed network not only outperforms hand-engineered codecs, but also neural network-based codecs built on computation-heavy spatially autoregressive entropy models. ",

One of the significant roadblocks to current research is the high level of visual variability across digital pathology images, causing models to generalise poorly to unseen data. Stain normalisation aims to standardise the visual profile of digital pathology images without changing the structural content of the images. In this chapter, we explore different techniques which have been used for stain normalisation in digital pathology, with a focus on approaches which utilise generative adversarial networks (GANs). Typically, GAN-based methods outperform non-generative approaches but at the cost of much greater computational requirements. However, it is not clear which method is best for stain normalisation in general, with different GAN and non-GAN approaches outperforming each other in different scenarios and according to different performance metrics. This is an ongoing field of study as researchers aim to identify a method which efficiently and effectively normalises pathology images to make AI models more robust and generalisable. ",

Multispectral QPI measures quantitative phase information across multiple spectral bands, permitting the examination of wavelength-specific phase and dispersion characteristics of samples. Here, we present the design of a diffractive processor that can all-optically perform multispectral quantitative phase imaging of transparent phase-only objects in a snapshot. Our design utilizes spatially engineered diffractive layers, optimized through deep learning, to encode the phase profile of the input object at a predetermined set of wavelengths into spatial intensity variations at the output plane, allowing multispectral QPI using a monochrome focal plane array. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate diffractive multispectral processors to simultaneously perform quantitative phase imaging at 9 and 16 target spectral bands in the visible spectrum. These diffractive multispectral processors maintain uniform performance across all the wavelength channels, revealing a decent QPI performance at each target wavelength. The generalization of these diffractive processor designs is validated through numerical tests on unseen objects, including thin Pap smear images. Due to its all-optical processing capability using passive dielectric diffractive materials, this diffractive multispectral QPI processor offers a compact and power-efficient solution for high-throughput quantitative phase microscopy and spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "Although deep learning (DL) methods are powerful for solving inverse problems, their reliance on high-quality training data is a major hurdle. This is significant in high-dimensional (dynamic/volumetric) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where acquisition of high-resolution fully sampled k-space data is impractical. We introduce a novel mathematical framework, dubbed k-band, that enables training DL models using only partial, limited-resolution k-space data. Specifically, we introduce training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over k-space subsets. In each training iteration, rather than using the fully sampled k-space for computing gradients, we use only a small k-space portion. This concept is compatible with different sampling strategies; here we demonstrate the method for k-space \"bands\", which have limited resolution in one dimension and can hence be acquired rapidly. We prove analytically that our method stochastically approximates the gradients computed in a fully-supervised setup, when two simple conditions are met: (i) the limited-resolution axis is chosen randomly-uniformly for every new scan, hence k-space is fully covered across the entire training set, and (ii) the loss function is weighed with a mask, derived here analytically, which facilitates accurate reconstruction of high-resolution details. Numerical experiments with raw MRI data indicate that k-band outperforms two other methods trained on limited-resolution data and performs comparably to state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on high-resolution data. k-band hence obtains SoTA performance, with the advantage of training using only limited-resolution data. This work hence introduces a practical, easy-to-implement, self-supervised training framework, which involves fast acquisition and self-supervised reconstruction and offers theoretical guarantees. ",

    "title": "Early Detection and Localization of Pancreatic Cancer by Label-Free  Tumor Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Early detection and localization of pancreatic cancer can increase the 5-year survival rate for patients from 8.5% to 20%. Artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially assist radiologists in detecting pancreatic tumors at an early stage. Training AI models require a vast number of annotated examples, but the availability of CT scans obtaining early-stage tumors is constrained. This is because early-stage tumors may not cause any symptoms, which can delay detection, and the tumors are relatively small and may be almost invisible to human eyes on CT scans. To address this issue, we develop a tumor synthesis method that can synthesize enormous examples of small pancreatic tumors in the healthy pancreas without the need for manual annotation. Our experiments demonstrate that the overall detection rate of pancreatic tumors, measured by Sensitivity and Specificity, achieved by AI trained on synthetic tumors is comparable to that of real tumors. More importantly, our method shows a much higher detection rate for small tumors. We further investigate the per-voxel segmentation performance of pancreatic tumors if AI is trained on a combination of CT scans with synthetic tumors and CT scans with annotated large tumors at an advanced stage. Finally, we show that synthetic tumors improve AI generalizability in tumor detection and localization when processing CT scans from different hospitals. Overall, our proposed tumor synthesis method has immense potential to improve the early detection of pancreatic cancer, leading to better patient outcomes. ",

    "abstract": "Prior studies in the automatic classification of voice quality have mainly studied the use of the acoustic speech signal as input. Recently, a few studies have been carried out by jointly using both speech and neck surface accelerometer (NSA) signals as inputs, and by extracting MFCCs and glottal source features. This study examines simultaneously-recorded speech and NSA signals in the classification of voice quality (breathy, modal, and pressed) using features derived from three self-supervised pre-trained models (wav2vec2-BASE, wav2vec2-LARGE, and HuBERT) and using a SVM as well as CNNs as classifiers. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the pre-trained models is compared in feature extraction between glottal source waveforms and raw signal waveforms for both speech and NSA inputs. Using two signal processing methods (quasi-closed phase (QCP) glottal inverse filtering and zero frequency filtering (ZFF)), glottal source waveforms are estimated from both speech and NSA signals. The study has three main goals: (1) to study whether features derived from pre-trained models improve classification accuracy compared to conventional features (spectrogram, mel-spectrogram, MFCCs, i-vector, and x-vector), (2) to investigate which of the two modalities (speech vs. NSA) is more effective in the classification task with pre-trained model-based features, and (3) to evaluate whether the deep learning-based CNN classifier can enhance the classification accuracy in comparison to the SVM classifier. The results revealed that the use of the NSA input showed better classification performance compared to the speech signal. Between the features, the pre-trained model-based features showed better classification accuracies, both for speech and NSA inputs compared to the conventional features. It was also found that the HuBERT features performed better than the wav2vec2-BASE and wav2vec2-LARGE features. ",

    "abstract": "Nucleus image segmentation is a crucial step in the analysis, pathological diagnosis, and classification, which heavily relies on the quality of nucleus segmentation. However, the complexity of issues such as variations in nucleus size, blurred nucleus contours, uneven staining, cell clustering, and overlapping cells poses significant challenges. Current methods for nucleus segmentation primarily rely on nuclear morphology or contour-based approaches. Nuclear morphology-based methods exhibit limited generalization ability and struggle to effectively predict irregular-shaped nuclei, while contour-based extraction methods face challenges in accurately segmenting overlapping nuclei. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dual-branch network using hybrid attention based residual U-blocks for nucleus instance segmentation. The network simultaneously predicts target information and target contours. Additionally, we introduce a post-processing method that combines the target information and target contours to distinguish overlapping nuclei and generate an instance segmentation image. Within the network, we propose a context fusion block (CF-block) that effectively extracts and merges contextual information from the network. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted to assess the performance of our method. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches on the BNS, MoNuSeg, CoNSeg, and CPM-17 datasets. ",

The distinguishing number of $G$, $D(G)$, is the smallest $c$ such that $G$ has a distinguishing $c$-labeling. We consider a compact version of Tyshkevich's graph decomposition theorem where trivial components are maximally combined to form a complete graph or a graph of isolated vertices. Suppose the compact canonical decomposition of $G$ is $G_{k} \\circ G_{k-1} \\circ \\cdots \\circ G_1 \\circ G_0$. We prove that $\\phi$ is a distinguishing labeling of $G$ if and only if $\\phi$ is a distinguishing labeling of $G_i$ when restricted to $V(G_i)$ for $i = 0, \\hdots, k$. Thus, $D(G) = \\max \\{D(G_i), i = 0, \\hdots, k \\}$. We then present an algorithm that computes the distinguishing number of a unigraph in linear time. ",

The proposed method significantly outperforms all existing visual quality features repurposed for audio, and even demonstrates a significant overall improvement of 7.8% and 2.0% of Pearson and Spearman rank correlation coefficient, respectively, over a dedicated audio quality metric (ViSQOL-v3 [4]) also inspired from the image domain.

Parametric approaches suffer from bias due to difficulty specifying the correct model, whereas ones with importance weight suffer from variance. To overcome these limitations, Marginalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (MIPS) was proposed to mitigate the estimator's variance via embeddings of an action. To make the estimator more accurate, we propose the doubly robust estimator of MIPS called the Marginalized Doubly Robust (MDR) estimator. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed estimator is unbiased under weaker assumptions than MIPS while maintaining variance reduction against IPS, which was the main advantage of MIPS. The empirical experiment verifies the supremacy of MDR against existing estimators. ",

    "abstract": "Lengthy evaluation times are common in many optimization problems such as direct policy search tasks, especially when they involve conducting evaluations in the physical world, e.g. in robotics applications. Often, when evaluating a solution over a fixed time period, it becomes clear that the objective value will not increase with additional computation time (for example, when a two-wheeled robot continuously spins on the spot). In such cases, it makes sense to stop the evaluation early to save computation time. However, most approaches to stop the evaluation are problem-specific and need to be specifically designed for the task at hand. Therefore, we propose an early stopping method for direct policy search. The proposed method only looks at the objective value at each time step and requires no problem-specific knowledge. We test the introduced stopping criterion in five direct policy search environments drawn from games, robotics, and classic control domains, and show that it can save up to 75% of the computation time. We also compare it with problem-specific stopping criteria and demonstrate that it performs comparably while being more generally applicable. ",

    "abstract": "As researchers strive to narrow the gap between machine intelligence and human through the development of artificial intelligence technologies, it is imperative that we recognize the critical importance of trustworthiness in open-world, which has become ubiquitous in all aspects of daily life for everyone. However, several challenges may create a crisis of trust in current artificial intelligence systems that need to be bridged: 1) Insufficient explanation of predictive results; 2) Inadequate generalization for learning models; 3) Poor adaptability to uncertain environments. Consequently, we explore a neural program to bridge trustworthiness and open-world learning, extending from single-modal to multi-modal scenarios for readers. 1) To enhance design-level interpretability, we first customize trustworthy networks with specific physical meanings; 2) We then design environmental well-being task-interfaces via flexible learning regularizers for improving the generalization of trustworthy learning; 3) We propose to increase the robustness of trustworthy learning by integrating open-world recognition losses with agent mechanisms. Eventually, we enhance various trustworthy properties through the establishment of design-level explainability, environmental well-being task-interfaces and open-world recognition programs. These designed open-world protocols are applicable across a wide range of surroundings, under open-world multimedia recognition scenarios with significant performance improvements observed. ",

The derived model captures the impact of line-of-sight (LOS) Nakagami-m fading channels, interference, and molecular absorption effects. We first derive the statistics of the interference-plus-molecular absorption noise ratio and demonstrate that it can be approximated by Gamma distribution using Welch-Satterthwaite approximation. Then, we show that the distribution of signal-to-interference-plus-molecular absorption noise ratio (SINR) follows a generalized Beta prime distribution. Based on this, a closed-form HO-aware rate outage expression is derived. Finally, we formulate and solve a CAVs' traffic flow maximization problem to optimize the base-stations (BSs) density and speed of CAVs with collision avoidance, rate outage, and CAVs' minimum traffic flow constraint. The CAVs' traffic flow is modeled using Log-Normal distribution. Our numerical results validate the accuracy of the derived expressions using Monte-Carlo simulations and discuss useful insights related to optimal BS density and CAVs' speed as a function of crash intensity level, THz molecular absorption effects, minimum road-traffic flow and rate requirements, and maximum speed and rate outage limits.
