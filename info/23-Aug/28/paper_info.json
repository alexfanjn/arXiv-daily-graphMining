    "title": "An approach based on Open Research Knowledge Graph for Knowledge  Acquisition from scientific papers",
    "abstract": "A scientific paper can be divided into two major constructs which are Metadata and Full-body text. Metadata provides a brief overview of the paper while the Full-body text contains key-insights that can be valuable to fellow researchers. To retrieve metadata and key-insights from scientific papers, knowledge acquisition is a central activity. It consists of gathering, analyzing and organizing knowledge embedded in scientific papers in such a way that it can be used and reused whenever needed. Given the wealth of scientific literature, manual knowledge acquisition is a cumbersome task. Thus, computer-assisted and (semi-)automatic strategies are generally adopted. Our purpose in this research was two fold: curate Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) with papers related to ontology learning and define an approach using ORKG as a computer-assisted tool to organize key-insights extracted from research papers. This approach was used to document the \"epidemiological surveillance systems design and implementation\" research problem and to prepare the related work of this paper. It is currently used to document \"food information engineering\", \"Tabular data to Knowledge Graph Matching\" and \"Question Answering\" research problems and \"Neuro-symbolic AI\" domain. ",

    "abstract": "Perimeter Control (PC) strategies have been proposed to address urban road network control in oversaturated situations by monitoring transfer flows of the Protected Network (PN). The uniform metering rate for cordon signals in existing studies ignores the variety of local traffic states at the intersection level, which may cause severe local traffic congestion and ruin the network stability. This paper introduces a semi-model dependent Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework to conduct PC with heterogeneous cordon signal behaviors. The proposed strategy integrates the MARL-based signal control method with centralized feedback PC policy and is applied to cordon signals of the PN. It operates as a two-stage system, with the feedback PC strategy detecting the overall traffic state within the PN and then distributing local instructions to cordon signals controlled by agents in the MARL framework. Each cordon signal acts independently and differently, creating a slack and distributed PC for the PN. The combination of the model-free and model-based methods is achieved by reconstructing the action-value function of the local agents with PC feedback reward without violating the integrity of the local signal control policy learned from the RL training process. Through numerical tests with different demand patterns in a microscopic traffic environment, the proposed PC strategy (a) is shown robustness, scalability, and transferability, (b) outperforms state-of-the-art model-based PC strategies in increasing network throughput, reducing cordon queue and carbon emission.

These sources cannot be consolidated into a single entity owing to privacy constraints, and the presence of missing values within them can potentially introduce bias to the causal estimands. We introduce a new approach for federated causal inference from incomplete data, enabling the estimation of causal effects from multiple decentralized and incomplete data sources. Our approach disentangles the loss function into multiple components, each corresponding to a specific data source with missing values. Our approach accounts for the missing data under the missing at random assumption, while also estimating higher-order statistics of the causal estimands. Our method recovers the conditional distribution of missing confounders given the observed confounders from the decentralized data sources to identify causal effects. Our framework estimates heterogeneous causal effects without the sharing of raw training data among sources, which helps to mitigate privacy risks. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through a collection of simulated and real-world instances, illustrating its potential and practicality. ",

    "abstract": "Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled and elegant approach for sequential decision making under uncertainty. Most notably, Bayesian agents do not face an exploration/exploitation dilemma, a major pathology of frequentist methods. A key challenge for Bayesian RL is the computational complexity of learning Bayes-optimal policies, which is only tractable in toy domains. In this paper we propose a novel model-free approach to address this challenge. Rather than modelling uncertainty in high-dimensional state transition distributions as model-based approaches do, we model uncertainty in a one-dimensional Bellman operator. Our theoretical analysis reveals that existing model-free approaches either do not propagate epistemic uncertainty through the MDP or optimise over a set of contextual policies instead of all history-conditioned policies. Both approximations yield policies that can be arbitrarily Bayes-suboptimal. To overcome these issues, we introduce the Bayesian exploration network (BEN) which uses normalising flows to model both the aleatoric uncertainty (via density estimation) and epistemic uncertainty (via variational inference) in the Bellman operator. In the limit of complete optimisation, BEN learns true Bayes-optimal policies, but like in variational expectation-maximisation, partial optimisation renders our approach tractable. Empirical results demonstrate that BEN can learn true Bayes-optimal policies in tasks where existing model-free approaches fail. ",

    "abstract": "The aspect ratio of a weighted graph $G$ is the ratio of its maximum edge weight to its minimum edge weight. Aspect ratio commonly arises as a complexity measure in graph algorithms, especially related to the computation of shortest paths. Popular paradigms are to interpolate between the settings of weighted and unweighted input graphs by incurring a dependence on aspect ratio, or by simply restricting attention to input graphs of low aspect ratio. This paper studies the effects of these paradigms, investigating whether graphs of low aspect ratio have more structured shortest paths than graphs in general. In particular, we raise the question of whether one can generally take a graph of large aspect ratio and \\emph{reweight} its edges, to obtain a graph with bounded aspect ratio while preserving the structure of its shortest paths. Our findings are: - Every weighted DAG on $n$ nodes has a shortest-paths preserving graph of aspect ratio $O(n)$. A simple lower bound shows that this is tight. - The previous result does not extend to general directed or undirected graphs; in fact, the answer turns out to be exponential in these settings. In particular, we construct directed and undirected $n$-node graphs for which any shortest-paths preserving graph has aspect ratio $2^{\\Omega(n)}$. We also consider the approximate version of this problem, where the goal is for shortest paths in $H$ to correspond to approximate shortest paths in $G$. We show that our exponential lower bounds extend even to this setting. We also show that in a closely related model, where approximate shortest paths in $H$ must also correspond to approximate shortest paths in $G$, even DAGs require exponential aspect ratio. ",

Intra- and inter-class similarity metrics, based on metric learning, are defined to guide the evaluation of these attributes toward achieving lightweight models. Evaluations made using these metrics are shown to require 30x less computation than running full inference tests.

We conjecture that in the cases where LLM succeed in doing causal inference, underlying was a respective meta SCM that exposed correlations between causal facts in natural language on whose data the LLM was ultimately trained. If our hypothesis holds true, then this would imply that LLMs are like parrots in that they simply recite the causal knowledge embedded in the data. Our empirical analysis provides favoring evidence that current LLMs are even weak `causal parrots.' ",

But these geo-distributed data centers (GDDCs) have a significant associated environmental impact due to their increasing carbon emissions and water usage, which needs to be curtailed.

This paper proposes a novel framework to co-optimize carbon emissions, water footprint, and energy costs of GDDCs, using a hybrid workload management framework called SHIELD that integrates machine learning guided local search with a decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm. Our framework considers geographical factors and time-based differences in power generation/use, costs, and environmental impacts to intelligently manage workload distribution across GDDCs and data center operation. Experimental results show that SHIELD can realize 34.4x speedup and 2.1x improvement in Pareto Hypervolume while reducing the carbon footprint by up to 3.7x, water footprint by up to 1.8x, energy costs by up to 1.3x, and a cumulative improvement across all objectives (carbon, water, cost) of up to 4.8x compared to the state-of-the-art.

The proposed model utilizes a population of chromosomes that represent the hyperparameters of the CNN model. The genetic algorithm is used for selecting and breeding the fittest chromosomes to generate new offspring. The hill climbing algorithm is then applied to the offspring to further optimize their hyperparameters. The mutation operation is introduced to diversify the population and to prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima. The Genetic Algorithm is used for global search and exploration of the search space, while Hill Climbing is used for local optimization of promising solutions. The objective function is the accuracy of the trained neural network on the CIFAR-100 test set. The performance of the hybrid model is evaluated by comparing it with the standard genetic algorithm and hill-climbing algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model achieves better accuracy with fewer generations compared to the standard algorithms.

In particular, we present a class of hybrid coupling rules depending only on local information to ensure uniform global practical or asymptotic synchronization, which is impossible to obtain by using the Kuramoto model customarily used in the literature. We further show that the synchronization set can be made uniformly globally prescribed finite-time stable by selecting the coupling function to be discontinuous at the origin. Novel mathematical tools on non-pathological functions and set-valued Lie derivatives are developed to carry out the stability analysis. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in simulations where we apply our synchronizing hybrid coupling rules to models of power grids previously used in the literature. ",

    "abstract": "Learning generalizable representation and classifier for class-imbalanced data is challenging for data-driven deep models. Most studies attempt to re-balance the data distribution, which is prone to overfitting on tail classes and underfitting on head classes. In this work, we propose Dual Compensation Residual Networks to better fit both tail and head classes. Firstly, we propose dual Feature Compensation Module (FCM) and Logit Compensation Module (LCM) to alleviate the overfitting issue. The design of these two modules is based on the observation: an important factor causing overfitting is that there is severe feature drift between training and test data on tail classes. In details, the test features of a tail category tend to drift towards feature cloud of multiple similar head categories. So FCM estimates a multi-mode feature drift direction for each tail category and compensate for it. Furthermore, LCM translates the deterministic feature drift vector estimated by FCM along intra-class variations, so as to cover a larger effective compensation space, thereby better fitting the test features. Secondly, we propose a Residual Balanced Multi-Proxies Classifier (RBMC) to alleviate the under-fitting issue. Motivated by the observation that re-balancing strategy hinders the classifier from learning sufficient head knowledge and eventually causes underfitting, RBMC utilizes uniform learning with a residual path to facilitate classifier learning. Comprehensive experiments on Long-tailed and Class-Incremental benchmarks validate the efficacy of our method. ",

Extensive experimental results show that existing top OVD models all fail on the new tasks except for simple object types, demonstrating the value of the proposed dataset in pinpointing the weakness of current OVD models and guiding future research.

However, these operations can lead to information loss and hinder the accurate determination of feature importance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel attention architecture that utilizes a bit-based attention structure that emphasizes the relationships between all bits in features, together with maximum and mean pooling. By considering the fine-grained interactions at the bit level, our method aims to capture intricate patterns and dependencies that might be overlooked by traditional pooling operations. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments have been conducted on three public datasets. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of the base models to achieve state-of-the-art results. ",

    "abstract": "Efficient networks, e.g., MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, etc, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy with lightweight computation. However, existing homomorphic encryption (HE)-based two-party computation (2PC) frameworks are not optimized for these networks and suffer from a high inference overhead. We observe the inefficiency mainly comes from the packing algorithm, which ignores the computation characteristics and the communication bottleneck of homomorphically encrypted depthwise convolutions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Falcon, an effective dense packing algorithm for HE-based 2PC frameworks. Falcon features a zero-aware greedy packing algorithm and a communication-aware operator tiling strategy to improve the packing density for depthwise convolutions. Compared to SOTA HE-based 2PC frameworks, e.g., CrypTFlow2, Iron and Cheetah, Falcon achieves more than 15.6x, 5.1x and 1.8x latency reduction, respectively, at operator level. Meanwhile, at network level, Falcon allows for 1.4% and 4.2% accuracy improvement over Cheetah on CIFAR-100 and TinyImagenet datasets with iso-communication, respecitvely. ",

    "abstract": "Hotspot detection using thermal imaging has recently become essential in several industrial applications, such as security applications, health applications, and equipment monitoring applications. Hotspot detection is of utmost importance in industrial safety where equipment can develop anomalies. Hotspots are early indicators of such anomalies. We address the problem of hotspot detection in thermal images by proposing a self-supervised learning approach. Self-supervised learning has shown potential as a competitive alternative to their supervised learning counterparts but their application to thermography has been limited. This has been due to lack of diverse data availability, domain specific pre-trained models, standardized benchmarks, etc. We propose a self-supervised representation learning approach followed by fine-tuning that improves detection of hotspots by classification. The SimSiam network based ensemble classifier decides whether an image contains hotspots or not. Detection of hotspots is followed by precise hotspot isolation. By doing so, we are able to provide a highly accurate and precise hotspot identification, applicable to a wide range of applications. We created a novel large thermal image dataset to address the issue of paucity of easily accessible thermal images. Our experiments with the dataset created by us and a publicly available segmentation dataset show the potential of our approach for hotspot detection and its ability to isolate hotspots with high accuracy. We achieve a Dice Coefficient of 0.736, the highest when compared with existing hotspot identification techniques. Our experiments also show self-supervised learning as a strong contender of supervised learning, providing competitive metrics for hotspot detection, with the highest accuracy of our approach being 97%.

    "abstract": "Simulating and modeling the long-term dynamics of multi-object physical systems is an essential and challenging task. Current studies model the physical systems utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with equivariant properties. Specifically, they model the dynamics as a sequence of discrete states with a fixed time interval and learn a direct mapping for all the two adjacent states. However, this direct mapping overlooks the continuous nature between the two states. Namely, we have verified that there are countless possible trajectories between two discrete dynamic states in current GNN-based direct mapping models. This issue greatly hinders the model generalization ability, leading to poor performance of the long-term simulation. In this paper, to better model the latent trajectory through discrete supervision signals, we propose a Physics-Inspired Neural Graph ODE (PINGO) algorithm. In PINGO, to ensure the uniqueness of the trajectory, we construct a Physics-Inspired Neural ODE framework to update the latent trajectory. Meanwhile, to effectively capture intricate interactions among objects, we use a GNN-based model to parameterize Neural ODE in a plug-and-play manner. Furthermore, we prove that the discrepancy between the learned trajectory of PIGNO and the true trajectory can be theoretically bounded. Extensive experiments verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our model yields an order-of-magnitude improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines, especially on long-term predictions and roll-out errors.

In this paper, we present a robust pipeline for generating high-fidelity 3D content with orthogonal-view image guidance. Specifically, we introduce a novel 2D diffusion model that generates an image consisting of four orthogonal-view sub-images for the given text prompt. The 3D content is then created with this diffusion model, which enhances 3D consistency and provides strong structured semantic priors. This addresses the infamous Janus problem and significantly promotes generation efficiency. Additionally, we employ a progressive 3D synthesis strategy that results in substantial improvement in the quality of the created 3D contents. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method demonstrates a significant improvement over previous text-to-3D techniques. ",

This two-stage association approach enables us to extract robust spatial and temporal-aware features and address the problem with fragmented tracklets. Furthermore, our model is designed for online tracking, making it suitable for real-world applications. Experimental results show that the proposed graph model is able to extract more discriminating features for object tracking, and our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets.

In particular, the search for communities with high-importance vertices has recently received a great deal of attention. However, existing works mainly focus on conventional homogeneous networks where vertices are of the same type, but are not applicable to heterogeneous information networks (HINs) composed of multi-typed vertices and different semantic relations, such as bibliographic networks. In this paper, we study the problem of high-importance community search in HINs. A novel community model is introduced, named heterogeneous significant community (HSC), to unravel the closely connected vertices of the same type with high attribute values through multiple semantic relationships. An HSC not only maximizes the exploration of indirect relationships across entities of the anchor-type but incorporates their significance. To search the HSCs, we first develop online algorithms by exploiting both segmented-based meta-path expansion and significance increment. Specially, a solution space reuse strategy based on structural nesting is designed to boost the efficiency. In addition, we further devise a two-level index to support searching HSCs in optimal time, based on which a space-efficient compact index is proposed. Extensive experiments on real-world large-scale HINs demonstrate that our solutions are effective and efficient for searching HSCs, and the index-based algorithms are 2-4 orders of magnitude faster than online algorithms.

However, memory for explicitly representing permutation matrices grows quadratically with the size of the problem, prohibiting large problem instances. In this work, we propose to tackle the curse of dimensionality of large permutation matrices by approximating them using low-rank matrix factorization, followed by a nonlinearity. To this end, we rely on the Kissing number theory to infer the minimal rank required for representing a permutation matrix of a given size, which is significantly smaller than the problem size. This leads to a drastic reduction in computation and memory costs, e.g., up to $3$ orders of magnitude less memory for a problem of size $n=20000$, represented using $8.4\\times10^5$ elements in two small matrices instead of using a single huge matrix with $4\\times 10^8$ elements. The proposed representation allows for accurate representations of large permutation matrices, which in turn enables handling large problems that would have been infeasible otherwise. We demonstrate the applicability and merits of the proposed approach through a series of experiments on a range of problems that involve predicting permutation matrices, from linear and quadratic assignment to shape matching problems.

Given each user's social connections and the severe lags in disseminating fresh PoI to all users, major LBSNs aim to enhance users' social PoI sharing by selecting a subset $k$ out of all $m$ users as hotspots and broadcasting their PoI information to the entire user community. This motivates us to study a new combinatorial optimization problem by integrating two urban sensing and online social networks. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and also renders existing approximation solutions not viable. Through analyzing the interplay effects between the sensing and social networks, we successfully transform the involved PoI-sharing process across two networks to matrix computations for deriving a closed-form objective and present a polynomial-time algorithm to ensure ($1-\\frac{m-2}{m}(\\frac{k-1}{k})^k$) approximation of the optimum. Furthermore, we allow each selected user to move around and sense more PoI information to share. To this end, we propose an augmentation-adaptive algorithm, which benefits from a resource-augmented technique and achieves bounded approximation, ranging from $\\frac{1}{k}(1-\\frac{1}{e})$ to $1-\\frac{1}{e}> 0.632$ by adjusting our augmentation factors. %Particularly when all sensing nodes are associated with users, we devise, by leveraging our augmentation-adaptive algorithm as a subroutine, an algorithm that eliminates the need for augmentation while still ensuring a satisfactory approximation $1-\\frac{m-2}{m}(\\frac{k-1}{k})^k$.

Therefore, we propose a method for knowledge transfer between clients where the server trains client-specific generators. Each generator generates samples for the corresponding client to remove the conflict with other clients' models.

Subsequent inbetweens (i.e., intermediate sketch frames) are crafted through manual interpolation for smooth animations, which is a labor-intensive process. Thus, the prospect of automatic animation sketch interpolation has become highly appealing. However, existing video interpolation methods are generally hindered by two key issues for sketch inbetweening: 1) limited texture and colour details in sketches, and 2) exaggerated alterations between two sketch keyframes. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel deep learning method, namely Fine-to-Coarse Sketch Interpolation Network (FC-SIN). This approach incorporates multi-level guidance that formulates region-level correspondence, sketch-level correspondence and pixel-level dynamics. A multi-stream U-Transformer is then devised to characterize sketch inbewteening patterns using these multi-level guides through the integration of both self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, to facilitate future research on animation sketch inbetweening, we constructed a large-scale dataset - STD-12K, comprising 30 sketch animation series in diverse artistic styles. Comprehensive experiments on this dataset convincingly show that our proposed FC-SIN surpasses the state-of-the-art interpolation methods. Our code and dataset will be publicly available. ",

The framework leverages self-training and domain adversarial learning to address the domain gap during adaptation. Specifically, a self-training strategy is proposed to select reliable landmark-level pseudo-labels of target domain data with dynamic thresholds, which makes the adaptation more effective. Furthermore, a domain adversarial learning module is designed to handle the unaligned data distributions of two domains by learning domain-invariant features via adversarial training. Our experiments on cephalometric and lung landmark detection show the effectiveness of the method, which reduces the domain gap by a large margin and outperforms other UDA methods consistently.

    "abstract": "Online professional social networking platforms provide opportunities to expand networks strategically for job opportunities and career advancement. A large body of research shows that women's offline networks are less advantageous than men's. How online platforms such as LinkedIn may reflect or reproduce gendered networking behaviours, or how online social connectivity may affect outcomes differentially by gender is not well understood. This paper analyses aggregate, anonymised data from almost 10 million LinkedIn users in the UK and US information technology (IT) sector collected from the site's advertising platform to explore how being connected to Big Tech companies ('social connectivity') varies by gender, and how gender, age, seniority and social connectivity shape the propensity to report job promotions or relocations. Consistent with previous studies, we find there are fewer women compared to men on LinkedIn in IT. Furthermore, female users are less likely to be connected to Big Tech companies than men. However, when we further analyse recent promotion or relocation reports, we find women are more likely than men to have reported a recent promotion at work, suggesting high-achieving women may be self-selecting onto LinkedIn. Even among this positively selected group, though, we find men are more likely to report a recent relocation. Social connectivity emerges as a significant predictor of promotion and relocation reports, with an interaction effect between gender and social connectivity indicating the payoffs to social connectivity for promotion and relocation reports are larger for women. This suggests that online networking has the potential for larger impacts for women, who experience greater disadvantage in traditional networking contexts, and calls for further research to understand differential impacts of online networking for socially disadvantaged groups.

    "abstract": "We study a new incentive problem of social information sharing for location-based services (e.g., Waze and Yelp). The problem aims to crowdsource a mass of mobile users to learn massive point-of-interest (PoI) information while traveling and share it with each other as a public good. Given that crowdsourced users mind their own travel costs and possess various preferences over the PoI information along different paths, we formulate the problem as a non-atomic routing game with positive network externalities. We first show by price of anarchy (PoA) analysis that, in the absence of any incentive design, users' selfish routing on the path with the lowest cost will limit information diversity and lead to an arbitrarily large efficiency loss from the social optimum. This motivates us to explore effective incentive mechanisms to remedy while upholding individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and budget balance to ensure practical feasibility. We start by presenting an adaptive information restriction (AIR) mechanism that dynamically customizes restriction fractions, depending on the real user flows along different paths, to govern users' access to the shared PoI aggregation. We show that AIR achieves a PoA of 0.25 for homogeneous users (of identical PoI preferences over paths) and 0.125 for heterogeneous users in a typical network of two parallel paths. Further, we propose a side-payment mechanism (ASP) that adaptively charges or rewards users along certain paths. With those charges and rewards well-tailored, ASP significantly improves the PoA to 1 (optimal) and 0.5 for homogeneous and heterogeneous users in the two-path network, respectively. For a generalized network of multiple parallel paths, we further advance ASP to be able to guarantee a PoA of 0.5. Additionally, our theoretical results are well corroborated by our numerical findings. ",

    "title": "Age of Information Diffusion on Social Networks: Optimizing Multi-Stage  Seeding Strategies",
    "abstract": "To promote viral marketing, major social platforms (e.g., Facebook Marketplace and Pinduoduo) repeatedly select and invite different users (as seeds) in online social networks to share fresh information about a product or service with their friends. Thereby, we are motivated to optimize a multi-stage seeding process of viral marketing in social networks and adopt the recent notions of the peak and the average age of information (AoI) to measure the timeliness of promotion information received by network users. Our problem is different from the literature on information diffusion in social networks, which limits to one-time seeding and overlooks AoI dynamics or information replacement over time. As a critical step, we manage to develop closed-form expressions that characterize and trace AoI dynamics over any social network. For the peak AoI problem, we first prove the NP-hardness of our multi-stage seeding problem by a highly non-straightforward reduction from the dominating set problem, and then present a new polynomial-time algorithm that achieves good approximation guarantees (e.g., less than 2 for linear network topology). To minimize the average AoI, we also prove that our problem is NP-hard by properly reducing it from the set cover problem. Benefiting from our two-side bound analysis on the average AoI objective, we build up a new framework for approximation analysis and link our problem to a much simplified sum-distance minimization problem. This intriguing connection inspires us to develop another polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a good approximation guarantee. Additionally, our theoretical results are well corroborated by experiments on a real social network. ",

    "abstract": "Code generation systems have been extensively developed in recent years to generate source code based on natural language instructions. However, despite their advancements, these systems still face robustness issues where even slightly different instructions can result in significantly different code semantics. Robustness is critical for code generation systems, as it can have significant impacts on software development, software quality, and trust in the generated code. Although existing testing techniques for general text-to-text software can detect some robustness issues, they are limited in effectiveness due to ignoring the characteristics of code generation systems. In this work, we propose a novel technique COCO to test the robustness of code generation systems. It exploits the usage scenario of code generation systems to make the original programming instruction more concrete by incorporating features known to be contained in the original code. A robust system should maintain code semantics for the concretized instruction, and COCO detects robustness inconsistencies when it does not. We evaluated COCO on eight advanced code generation systems, including commercial tools such as Copilot and ChatGPT, using two widely-used datasets. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of COCO in testing the robustness of code generation systems, outperforming two techniques adopted from general text-to-text software testing by 466.66% and 104.02%, respectively. Furthermore, concretized instructions generated by COCO can help reduce robustness inconsistencies by 18.35% to 53.91% through fine-tuning. ",

Due to the motion of objects and static/dynamic occlusion, temporal information plays an essential role in reinforcing perception by enhancing and completing single-frame knowledge. Previous approaches either directly stack historical frames to the current frame or build a 4D spatio-temporal neighborhood using KNN, which duplicates computation and hinders realtime performance. Based on our observation that stacking all the historical points would damage performance due to a large amount of redundant and misleading information, we propose the Sparse Voxel-Adjacent Query Network (SVQNet) for 4D LiDAR semantic segmentation. To take full advantage of the historical frames high-efficiently, we shunt the historical points into two groups with reference to the current points. One is the Voxel-Adjacent Neighborhood carrying local enhancing knowledge. The other is the Historical Context completing the global knowledge. Then we propose new modules to select and extract the instructive features from the two groups. Our SVQNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in LiDAR semantic segmentation of the SemanticKITTI benchmark and the nuScenes dataset. ",

However, external variations such as clothing changes and viewpoint differences pose significant challenges to gait recognition. Silhouette-based methods preserve body shape but neglect internal structure information, while skeleton-based methods preserve structure information but omit appearance. To fully exploit the complementary nature of the two modalities, a novel triple branch gait recognition framework, TriGait, is proposed in this paper. It effectively integrates features from the skeleton and silhouette data in a hybrid fusion manner, including a two-stream network to extract static and motion features from appearance, a simple yet effective module named JSA-TC to capture dependencies between all joints, and a third branch for cross-modal learning by aligning and fusing low-level features of two modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of TriGait for gait recognition. The proposed method achieves a mean rank-1 accuracy of 96.0% over all conditions on CASIA-B dataset and 94.3% accuracy for CL, significantly outperforming all the state-of-the-art methods.

We propose a method of inducing the global representations within channels to have better performance of the model. We propose SaEnet, Squeeze aggregated excitation network, for learning global channelwise representation in between layers. The proposed module takes advantage of passing important information after squeeze by having aggregated excitation before regaining its shape. We also introduce a new idea of having a multibranch linear(dense) layer in the network. This learns global representations from the condensed information which enhances the representational power of the network.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) tasks have been solved using machine learning algorithms in various domains and applications. The great majority of these algorithms use normal data to train a residual-based model, and assign anomaly scores to unseen samples based on their dissimilarity with the learned normal regime. The underlying assumption of these approaches is that anomaly-free data is available for training. This is, however, often not the case in real-world operational settings, where the training data may be contaminated with a certain fraction of abnormal samples. Training with contaminated data, in turn, inevitably leads to a deteriorated AD performance of the residual-based algorithms. In this paper we introduce a framework for a fully unsupervised refinement of contaminated training data for AD tasks. The framework is generic and can be applied to any residual-based machine learning model. We demonstrate the application of the framework to two public datasets of multivariate time series machine data from different application fields. We show its clear superiority over the naive approach of training with contaminated data without refinement. Moreover, we compare it to the ideal, unrealistic reference in which anomaly-free data would be available for training. Since the approach exploits information from the anomalies, and not only from the normal regime, it is comparable and often outperforms the ideal baseline as well. ",

Convolutional neural networks (CNN), a form of deep learning, are capable of generating highly accurate predictions from imaging data. Our objective was to predict mortality in SAH patients by processing the initial CT scan on a CNN based algorithm. METHODS: Retrospective multicentric study of a consecutive cohort of patients with SAH between 2011-2022. Demographic, clinical and radiological variables were analyzed. Pre-processed baseline CT scan images were used as the input for training a CNN using AUCMEDI Framework. Our model's architecture leverages the DenseNet-121 structure, employing transfer learning principles. The output variable was mortality in the first three months. Performance of the model was evaluated by statistical parameters conventionally used in studies involving artificial intelligence methods. RESULTS: Images from 219 patients were processed, 175 for training and validation of the CNN and 44 for its evaluation. 52%(115/219) of patients were female, and the median age was 58(SD=13.06) years. 18.5%(39/219) were idiopathic SAH. Mortality rate was 28.5%(63/219). The model showed good accuracy at predicting mortality in SAH patients exclusively using the images of the initial CT scan (Accuracy=74%, F1=75% and AUC=82%). CONCLUSION: Modern image processing techniques based on AI and CNN make possible to predict mortality in SAH patients with high accuracy using CT scan images as the only input. These models might be optimized by including more data and patients resulting in better training, development and performance on tasks which are beyond the skills of conventional clinical knowledge.

Recent methods focus on capturing the underlying patterns from one single domain (e.g. the time domain or the frequency domain), and have not taken a holistic view to process long-term time series from the time-frequency domains. In this paper, we propose a Time-Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Network (TFDNet) to capture both the long-term underlying patterns and temporal periodicity from the time-frequency domain. In TFDNet, we devise a multi-scale time-frequency enhanced encoder backbone and develop two separate trend and seasonal time-frequency blocks to capture the distinct patterns within the decomposed trend and seasonal components in multi-resolutions. Diverse kernel learning strategies of the kernel operations in time-frequency blocks have been explored, by investigating and incorporating the potential different channel-wise correlation patterns of multivariate time series. Experimental evaluation of eight datasets from five benchmark domains demonstrated that TFDNet is superior to state-of-the-art approaches in both effectiveness and efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "Whilst contrastive learning yields powerful representations by matching different augmented views of the same instance, it lacks the ability to capture the similarities between different instances. One popular way to address this limitation is by learning global features (after the global pooling) to capture inter-instance relationships based on knowledge distillation, where the global features of the teacher are used to guide the learning of the global features of the student. Inspired by cross-modality learning, we extend this existing framework that only learns from global features by encouraging the global features and intermediate layer features to learn from each other. This leads to our novel self-supervised framework: cross-context learning between global and hypercolumn features (CGH), that enforces the consistency of instance relations between low- and high-level semantics. Specifically, we stack the intermediate feature maps to construct a hypercolumn representation so that we can measure instance relations using two contexts (hypercolumn and global feature) separately, and then use the relations of one context to guide the learning of the other. This cross-context learning allows the model to learn from the differences between the two contexts. The experimental results on linear classification and downstream tasks show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. ",

We generalize $k$-planar drawings, by introducing the new family of min-$k$-planar drawings.

We prove a general upper bound on the number of edges of min-$k$-planar drawings, a finer upper bound for $k=3$, and tight upper bounds for $k=1,2$.

A major challenge for accurate glaucoma detection and progression forecasting is the bottleneck of limited labeled patients with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D retinal imaging data of optical coherence tomography (OCT). To address the data scarcity issue, this paper proposes two solutions. First, we develop a novel generalization-reinforced semi-supervised learning (SSL) model called pseudo supervisor to optimally utilize unlabeled data. Compared with SOTA models, the proposed pseudo supervisor optimizes the policy of predicting pseudo labels with unlabeled samples to improve empirical generalization. Our pseudo supervisor model is evaluated with two clinical tasks consisting of glaucoma detection and progression forecasting. The progression forecasting task is evaluated both unimodally and multimodally. Our pseudo supervisor model demonstrates superior performance than SOTA SSL comparison models. Moreover, our model also achieves the best results on the publicly available LAG fundus dataset. Second, we introduce the Harvard Glaucoma Detection and Progression (Harvard-GDP) Dataset, a multimodal multitask dataset that includes data from 1,000 patients with OCT imaging data, as well as labels for glaucoma detection and progression.

Consequently, numerous scholars are actively exploring improvements to algorithmic structures, operators, search patterns, etc., to enhance their optimization performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) integrated as a component in the EA framework has demonstrated superior performance in recent years. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the integration of reinforcement learning into the evolutionary algorithm, referred to as reinforcement learning-assisted evolutionary algorithm (RL-EA). Firstly, we introduce reinforcement learning and the evolutionary algorithm. We then provide a taxonomy of RL-EA. We then discuss the RL-EA integration method, the RL-assisted strategy adopted by RL-EA, and its applications according to the existing literature. The RL-assisted strategy is divided according to the implemented functions including the solution generation, learnable objective function, algorithm/operator/sub-population selection, parameter adaptation, and other strategies. Subsequently, other attribute settings of RL in RL-EA are discussed. Finally, we analyze potential directions for future research. This paper serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers who are interested in RL-EA as it provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art and highlights the associated challenges.

Since manual creation of these models is a time-consuming process, it is advantageous to learn them from data and represent them in a generic formalism like timed automata. However, these models - and by extension, the detected anomalies - can be challenging to interpret due to a lack of additional information about the system. This paper aims to improve model-based anomaly detection in CPPS by combining the learned timed automaton with a formal knowledge graph about the system. Both the model and the detected anomalies are described in the knowledge graph in order to allow operators an easier interpretation of the model and the detected anomalies.

    "abstract": "Tydi is an open specification for streaming dataflow designs in digital circuits, allowing designers to express how composite and variable-length data structures are transferred over streams using clear, data-centric types. These data types are extensively used in a many application domains, such as big data and SQL applications. This way, Tydi provides a higher-level method for defining interfaces between components as opposed to existing bit and byte-based interface specifications. In this paper, we introduce an open-source intermediate representation (IR) which allows for the declaration of Tydi's types. The IR enables creating and connecting components with Tydi Streams as interfaces, called Streamlets. It also lets backends for synthesis and simulation retain high-level information, such as documentation. Types and Streamlets can be easily reused between multiple projects, and Tydi's streams and type hierarchy can be used to define interface contracts, which aid collaboration when designing a larger system. The IR codifies the rules and properties established in the Tydi specification and serves to complement computation-oriented hardware design tools with a data-centric view on interfaces. To support different backends and targets, the IR is focused on expressing interfaces, and complements behavior described by hardware description languages and other IRs. Additionally, a testing syntax for the verification of inputs and outputs against abstract streams of data, and for substituting interdependent components, is presented which allows for the specification of behavior. To demonstrate this IR, we have created a grammar, parser, and query system, and paired these with a backend targeting VHDL. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), it remains challenging to train GNNs on large-scale graphs due to neighbor explosions. As a remedy, distributed computing becomes a promising solution by leveraging abundant computing resources (e.g., GPU). However, the node dependency of graph data increases the difficulty of achieving high concurrency in distributed GNN training, which suffers from the massive communication overhead. To address it, Historical value approximation is deemed a promising class of distributed training techniques. It utilizes an offline memory to cache historical information (e.g., node embedding) as an affordable approximation of the exact value and achieves high concurrency. However, such benefits come at the cost of involving dated training information, leading to staleness, imprecision, and convergence issues. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes SAT (Staleness-Alleviated Training), a novel and scalable distributed GNN training framework that reduces the embedding staleness adaptively. The key idea of SAT is to model the GNN's embedding evolution as a temporal graph and build a model upon it to predict future embedding, which effectively alleviates the staleness of the cached historical embedding. We propose an online algorithm to train the embedding predictor and the distributed GNN alternatively and further provide a convergence analysis. Empirically, we demonstrate that SAT can effectively reduce embedding staleness and thus achieve better performance and convergence speed on multiple large-scale graph datasets. ",

Although existing CD-FSS models focus on cross-domain feature transformation, relying exclusively on inter-domain knowledge transfer may lead to the loss of critical intra-domain information. To this end, we propose a novel residual transformation network (RestNet) that facilitates knowledge transfer while retaining the intra-domain support-query feature information. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Enhanced Anchor Transform (SEAT) module that maps features to a stable domain-agnostic space using advanced semantics. Additionally, an Intra-domain Residual Enhancement (IRE) module is designed to maintain the intra-domain representation of the original discriminant space in the new space. We also propose a mask prediction strategy based on prototype fusion to help the model gradually learn how to segment. Our RestNet can transfer cross-domain knowledge from both inter-domain and intra-domain without requiring additional fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on ISIC, Chest X-ray, and FSS-1000 show that our RestNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be available soon. ",

Although there exist a few datasets for program performance prediction, they target small sub-programs such as basic blocks or kernels. This paper introduces TpuGraphs, a performance prediction dataset on full tensor programs, represented as computational graphs, running on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Each graph in the dataset represents the main computation of a machine learning workload, e.g., a training epoch or an inference step. Each data sample contains a computational graph, a compilation configuration, and the execution time of the graph when compiled with the configuration. The graphs in the dataset are collected from open-source machine learning programs, featuring popular model architectures, e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, Mask R-CNN, and Transformer. TpuGraphs provides 25x more graphs than the largest graph property prediction dataset (with comparable graph sizes), and 770x larger graphs on average compared to existing performance prediction datasets on machine learning programs. This graph-level prediction task on large graphs introduces new challenges in learning, ranging from scalability, training efficiency, to model quality. ",

The disparity between the technological advancement of a few global languages and the lack of research on NMT for local languages in Chad is striking. End-to-end NMT trials on low-resource Chad languages have not been attempted. Additionally, there is a dearth of online and well-structured data gathering for research in Natural Language Processing, unlike some African languages. However, a guided approach for data gathering can produce bitext data for many Chadian language translation pairs with well-known languages that have ample data.

The approach is demonstrated on four different study cases being the Lorenz system, a modified version of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a streamwise-periodic 2D channel flow, and a confined cylinder flow. Neural networks are trained as models to capture the complex system dynamics and estimate equilibrium points through a Newton method, enabled by backpropagation. These neural network surrogate models (NNSMs) are leveraged to train a second neural network, which is designed to act as a stabilizing closed-loop controller. The training process employs a recurrent approach, whereby the NNSM and the neural network controller (NNC) are chained in closed loop along a finite time horizon. By cycling through phases of combined random open-loop actuation and closed-loop control, an iterative training process is introduced to overcome the lack of data near equilibrium points. This approach improves the accuracy of the models in the most critical region for achieving stabilization. Through the use of L1 regularization within loss functions, the NNSMs can also guide optimal sensor placement, reducing the number of sensors from an initial candidate set. The datasets produced during the iterative training process are also leveraged for conducting a linear stability analysis through a modified dynamic mode decomposition approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of computationally inexpensive neural networks in modeling, controlling, and enabling stability analysis of nonlinear systems, providing insights into the system behaviour and offering potential for stabilization of complex fluid systems.

AtmoRep uses large-scale representation learning from artificial intelligence to determine a general description of the highly complex, stochastic dynamics of the atmosphere from the best available estimate of the system's historical trajectory as constrained by observations. This is enabled by a novel self-supervised learning objective and a unique ensemble that samples from the stochastic model with a variability informed by the one in the historical record. The task-independent nature of AtmoRep enables skillful results for a diverse set of applications without specifically training for them and we demonstrate this for nowcasting, temporal interpolation, model correction, and counterfactuals. We also show that AtmoRep can be improved with additional data, for example radar observations, and that it can be extended to tasks such as downscaling. Our work establishes that large-scale neural networks can provide skillful, task-independent models of atmospheric dynamics.

However, these signals are prone to contamination from various sources of artifacts, notably the electrooculogram (EOG) artifacts caused by eye movements. The most effective approach to mitigate EOG artifacts involves recording EOG signals simultaneously with EEG and employing blind source separation techniques, such as independent component analysis (ICA). Nevertheless, the availability of EOG recordings is not always feasible, particularly in pre-recorded datasets. Objective: In this paper, we present a novel methodology that combines a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural network with ICA to address the challenge of EOG artifact removal from contaminated EEG signals. Approach: Our approach aims to accomplish two primary objectives: 1) estimate the horizontal and vertical EOG signals from the contaminated EEG data, and 2) employ ICA to eliminate the estimated EOG signals from the EEG, thereby producing an artifact-free EEG signal. Main results: To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on a publicly available dataset comprising recordings from 27 participants. We employed well-established metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean error to assess the quality of our artifact removal technique. Significance: Furthermore, we compared the performance of our approach with two state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods reported in the literature, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed methodology.

To address this issue, a Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Mechanism (QKSAM) is introduced, which combines the data representation benefit of Quantum Kernel Methods (QKM) with the efficient information extraction capability of SAM. A Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN) framework is built based on QKSAM, with Deferred Measurement Principle (DMP) and conditional measurement techniques, which releases half of the quantum resources with probabilistic measurements during computation. The Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Score (QKSAS) determines the measurement conditions and reflects the probabilistic nature of quantum systems. Finally, four QKSAN models are deployed on the Pennylane platform to perform binary classification on MNIST images. The best-performing among the four models is assessed for noise immunity and learning ability. Remarkably, the potential learning benefit of partial QKSAN models over classical deep learning is that they require few parameters for a high return of 98\\% $\\pm$ 1\\% test and train accuracy, even with highly compressed images.

    "abstract": "In these six lectures, we examine what can be learnt about the behavior of multi-layer neural networks from the analysis of linear models. We first recall the correspondence between neural networks and linear models via the so-called lazy regime. We then review four models for linearized neural networks: linear regression with concentrated features, kernel ridge regression, random feature model and neural tangent model. Finally, we highlight the limitations of the linear theory and discuss how other approaches can overcome them. ",

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach for finding multiple noisily embedded template graphs in a very large background graph. Our method builds upon the graph-matching-matched-filter technique proposed in Sussman et al., with the discovery of multiple diverse matchings being achieved by iteratively penalizing a suitable node-pair similarity matrix in the matched filter algorithm. In addition, we propose algorithmic speed-ups that greatly enhance the scalability of our matched-filter approach. We present theoretical justification of our methodology in the setting of correlated Erdos-Renyi graphs, showing its ability to sequentially discover multiple templates under mild model conditions. We additionally demonstrate our method's utility via extensive experiments both using simulated models and real-world dataset, include human brain connectomes and a large transactional knowledge base.
