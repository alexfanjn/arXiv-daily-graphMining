    "abstract": "Ensuring equitable privacy experiences remains a challenge, especially for marginalised and vulnerable populations (MVPs) who often hesitate to participate or use digital services due to concerns about the privacy of their sensitive information. In response, security research has emphasised the importance of inclusive security and privacy practices to facilitate meaningful engagement of MVPs online. However, research in this area is still in its early stages, with other MVPs yet to be considered (such as low-income groups, and refugees), novel engagement methods yet to be explored, and limited support for software developers in building applications and services for MVPs. In 2022, we initiated a UK Research Council funded Equitable Privacy project to address these gaps. Our goal is to prioritise the privacy needs and requirements of MVPs in the design and development of software applications and services. We design and implement a new participatory research approach -- community studybeds -- in collaboration with third-sector organisations that support MVPs to identify and tackle the challenges these groups encounter. In this paper, we share the initial reflections and experiences of the Equitable Privacy project, particularly emphasising the utilisation of our community studybeds. ",

    "abstract": "Attackers are now using sophisticated techniques, like polymorphism, to change the attack pattern for each new attack. Thus, the detection of novel attacks has become the biggest challenge for cyber experts and researchers. Recently, anomaly and hybrid approaches are used for the detection of network attacks. Detecting novel attacks, on the other hand, is a key enabler for a wide range of IoT applications. Novel attacks can easily evade existing signature-based detection methods and are extremely difficult to detect, even going undetected for years. Existing machine learning models have also failed to detect the attack and have a high rate of false positives. In this paper, a rule-based deep neural network technique has been proposed as a framework for addressing the problem of detecting novel attacks. The designed framework significantly improves respective benchmark results, including the CICIDS 2017 dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model keeps a good balance between attack detection, untruthful positive rates, and untruthful negative rates. For novel attacks, the model has an accuracy of more than 99%. During the automatic interaction between network-devices (IoT), security and privacy are the primary obstacles. Our proposed method can handle these obstacles efficiently and finally identify, and classify the different levels of threats. ",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection and its explanation is important in many research areas such as intrusion detection, fraud detection, unknown attack detection in network traffic and logs. It is challenging to identify the cause or explanation of why one instance is an anomaly? and the other is not due to its unbounded and lack of supervisory nature. The answer to this question is possible with the emerging technique of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). XAI provides tools and techniques to interpret and explain the output and working of complex models such as Deep Learning (DL). This paper aims to detect and explain network anomalies with XAI, kernelSHAP method. The same approach is used to improve the network anomaly detection model in terms of accuracy, recall, precision and f score. The experiment is conduced with the latest CICIDS2017 dataset. Two models are created (Model_1 and OPT_Model) and compared. The overall accuracy and F score of OPT_Model (when trained in unsupervised way) are 0.90 and 0.76, respectively. ",

A number of solutions have been implemented for Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) based NIDS.

The main aim of this research work is to study powerful adversarial attack algorithms and their defence method on DL-based NIDS. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and Carlini & Wagner (C&W) are four powerful adversarial attack methods implemented against the NIDS. As a defence method, Adversarial Training is used to increase the robustness of the NIDS model. The results are summarized in three phases, i.e., 1) before the adversarial attack, 2) after the adversarial attack, and 3) after the adversarial defence. The Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection System 2017 (CICIDS-2017) dataset is used for evaluation purposes with various performance measurements like f1-score, accuracy etc. ",

Most of the current algorithms consider a KG as a multidirectional labeled graph and lack the ability to capture the semantics underlying the schematic information. In a separate development, a vast amount of information has been captured within the Large Language Models (LLMs) which has revolutionized the field of Artificial Intelligence. KGs could benefit from these LLMs and vice versa. This vision paper discusses the existing algorithms for KG completion based on the variations for generating KG embeddings. It starts with discussing various KG completion algorithms such as transductive and inductive link prediction and entity type prediction algorithms. It then moves on to the algorithms utilizing type information within the KGs, LLMs, and finally to algorithms capturing the semantics represented in different description logic axioms.

We also release a simulated dataset, COB-3D-v2, that can be used to train shape completion models for real-word robotics applications, and use it to demonstrate that F-CON outperforms other state-of-the-art shape completion methods.

A general concern is whether or not the human's workload will be taxed to the breaking point. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's OFFsensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics program's field exercises that occurred at U.S. Army urban training sites provided the opportunity to understand the impact of achieving such swarm deployments. The Command and Control of Aggregate Swarm Tactics integrator team's swarm commander users the heterogeneous robot swarm to conduct relevant missions. During the final OFFSET program field exercise, the team collected objective and subjective metrics related to teh swarm commander's human performance. A multi-dimensional workload algorithm that estimates overall workload based on five components of workload was used to analyze the results. While the swarm commander's workload estimate did cross the overload threshold frequently, the swarm commander was able to successfully complete the missions, often under challenging operational conditions. The presented results demonstrate that a single human can deploy a swarm of 100 heterogeneous robots to conduct real-world missions. ",

    "abstract": "Datacenters are increasingly becoming heterogeneous, and are starting to include specialized hardware for networking, video processing, and especially deep learning. To leverage the heterogeneous compute capability of modern datacenters, we develop an approach for compiler-level partitioning of deep neural networks (DNNs) onto multiple interconnected hardware devices. We present a general framework for heterogeneous DNN compilation, offering automatic partitioning and device mapping. Our scheduler integrates both an exact solver, through a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, and a modularity-based heuristic for scalability. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical lower bound formula for the optimal solution, which enables the assessment of the heuristic solutions' quality. We evaluate our scheduler in optimizing both conventional DNNs and randomly-wired neural networks, subject to latency and throughput constraints, on a heterogeneous system comprised of a CPU and two distinct GPUs. Compared to na\\\"ively running DNNs on the fastest GPU, he proposed framework can achieve more than 3$\\times$ times lower latency and up to 2.9$\\times$ higher throughput by automatically leveraging both data and model parallelism to deploy DNNs on our sample heterogeneous server node. Moreover, our modularity-based \"splitting\" heuristic improves the solution runtime up to 395$\\times$ without noticeably sacrificing solution quality compared to an exact MILP solution, and outperforms all other heuristics by 30-60% solution quality. Finally, our case study shows how we can extend our framework to schedule large language models across multiple heterogeneous servers by exploiting symmetry in the hardware setup.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used as controllers in reactive systems. However, DNNs are highly opaque, which renders it difficult to explain and justify their actions. To mitigate this issue, there has been a surge of interest in explainable AI (XAI) techniques, capable of pinpointing the input features that caused the DNN to act as it did. Existing XAI techniques typically face two limitations: (i) they are heuristic, and do not provide formal guarantees that the explanations are correct; and (ii) they often apply to ``one-shot'' systems (where the DNN is invoked independently of past invocations), as opposed to reactive systems. Here, we begin bridging this gap, and propose a formal DNN-verification-based XAI technique for reasoning about multi-step, reactive systems. We suggest methods for efficiently calculating succinct explanations, by exploiting the system's transition constraints in order to curtail the search space explored by the underlying verifier. We evaluate our approach on two popular benchmarks from the domain of automated navigation; and observe that our methods allow the efficient computation of minimal and minimum explanations, while significantly outperforming the state of the art. We also demonstrate that our method produces formal explanations that are more reliable than competing, non-verification-based XAI techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Node classification is one of the core tasks on attributed graphs, but successful graph learning solutions require sufficiently labeled data. To keep annotation costs low, active graph learning focuses on selecting the most qualitative subset of nodes that maximizes label efficiency. However, deciding which heuristic is best suited for an unlabeled graph to increase label efficiency is a persistent challenge. Existing solutions either neglect aligning the learned model and the sampling method or focus only on limited selection aspects. They are thus sometimes worse or only equally good as random sampling. In this work, we introduce a novel active graph learning approach called DiffusAL, showing significant robustness in diverse settings. Toward better transferability between different graph structures, we combine three independent scoring functions to identify the most informative node samples for labeling in a parameter-free way: i) Model Uncertainty, ii) Diversity Component, and iii) Node Importance computed via graph diffusion heuristics. Most of our calculations for acquisition and training can be pre-processed, making DiffusAL more efficient compared to approaches combining diverse selection criteria and similarly fast as simpler heuristics. Our experiments on various benchmark datasets show that, unlike previous methods, our approach significantly outperforms random selection in 100% of all datasets and labeling budgets tested. ",

While the resulting in-domain models have shown promising results for many biomedical tasks, adverse drug event normalization on social media texts has so far remained challenging for them (Portelli et al., 2022). In this paper, we propose a new approach for adverse drug event normalization on social media relying on general-purpose model initialization via BioLORD (Remy et al., 2022) and a semantic-text-similarity fine-tuning named STS. Our experimental results on several social media datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, by achieving state-of-the-art performance. Based on its strong performance across all the tested datasets, we believe this work could emerge as a turning point for the task of adverse drug event normalization on social media and has the potential to serve as a benchmark for future research in the field.

The needed energy to control a network is often used to quantify its controllability, and controlling brain networks requires diverse energy depending on the selected input region. We use the theory of how input node placement affects the longest control chain (LCC) in the controllability of brain networks to study the role of the architecture of white matter fibers in the required control energy. We show that the energy needed to control human brain networks is related to the LCC, i.e., the longest distance between the input region and other regions in the network. We indicate that regions that control brain networks with lower energy have small LCCs. These regions align with areas that can steer the brain around the state space smoothly. By contrast, regions that need higher energy to move the brain toward different target states have larger LCCs. We also investigate the role of the number of paths between regions in the control energy. Our results show that the more paths between regions, the lower cost needed to control brain networks. We evaluate the number of paths by counting specific motifs in brain networks since determining all paths in graphs is a difficult problem. ",

Regarding generality, the experimental evaluation is composed of both offline and online detection modes. The offline detection utilizes full post-recovery data sets, which carries high-resolution information, to present detailed analysis of the anomaly and compare it with pilot logs. The online detection focuses on the real-time subsets of data transmitted from the glider at the surfacing events.

Expanding on these prior works, we introduce new methods for pose estimation of radiolucent objects using X-ray projections, and we demonstrate the critical role of optimal view synthesis in performing this task. We first develop an algorithm (DiffDRR) that efficiently computes Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) and leverages automatic differentiation within TensorFlow. In conjunction with classic CBCT reconstruction algorithms, we perform pose estimation by gradient descent using a loss function that quantifies the similarity of the DRR synthesized from a randomly initialized pose and the true fluoroscopic image at the target pose. We propose two novel methods for high-fidelity view synthesis, Neural Tuned Tomography (NeTT) and masked Neural Radiance Fields (mNeRF). Both methods rely on classic CBCT; NeTT directly optimizes the CBCT densities, while the non-zero values of mNeRF are constrained by a 3D mask of the anatomic region segmented from CBCT. We demonstrate that both NeTT and mNeRF distinctly improve pose estimation within our framework. By defining a successful pose estimate to be a 3D angle error of less than 3 deg, we find that NeTT and mNeRF can achieve similar results, both with overall success rates more than 93%. Furthermore, we show that a NeTT trained for a single subject can generalize to synthesize high-fidelity DRRs and ensure robust pose estimations for all other subjects. Therefore, we suggest that NeTT is an attractive option for robust pose estimation using fluoroscopic projections. ",

Existing algorithms that provide risk-awareness to NNs are complex and ad-hoc. Specifically, these methods require significant engineering changes, are often developed only for particular settings, and are not easily composable. Here we present capsa, a framework for extending models with risk-awareness. Capsa provides a methodology for quantifying multiple forms of risk and composing different algorithms together to quantify different risk metrics in parallel. We validate capsa by implementing state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation algorithms within the capsa framework and benchmarking them on complex perception datasets. We demonstrate capsa's ability to easily compose aleatoric uncertainty, epistemic uncertainty, and bias estimation together in a single procedure, and show how this approach provides a comprehensive awareness of NN risk.

To overcome the limitations of the reliance of previous systems on hand-tuned parameters, we present a genetic algorithm-based approach for automated tuning of these networks, substantially improving their usability. To provide challenging navigational scale ranges, we open source a flexible city-scale navigation simulator that adapts to any street network, enabling high throughput experimentation.

    "abstract": "Learning distance functions between complex objects, such as the Wasserstein distance to compare point sets, is a common goal in machine learning applications. However, functions on such complex objects (e.g., point sets and graphs) are often required to be invariant to a wide variety of group actions e.g. permutation or rigid transformation. Therefore, continuous and symmetric product functions (such as distance functions) on such complex objects must also be invariant to the product of such group actions. We call these functions symmetric and factor-wise group invariant (or SFGI functions in short). In this paper, we first present a general neural network architecture for approximating SFGI functions. The main contribution of this paper combines this general neural network with a sketching idea to develop a specific and efficient neural network which can approximate the $p$-th Wasserstein distance between point sets. Very importantly, the required model complexity is independent of the sizes of input point sets. On the theoretical front, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first result showing that there exists a neural network with the capacity to approximate Wasserstein distance with bounded model complexity. Our work provides an interesting integration of sketching ideas for geometric problems with universal approximation of symmetric functions. On the empirical front, we present a range of results showing that our newly proposed neural network architecture performs comparatively or better than other models (including a SOTA Siamese Autoencoder based approach). In particular, our neural network generalizes significantly better and trains much faster than the SOTA Siamese AE. Finally, this line of investigation could be useful in exploring effective neural network design for solving a broad range of geometric optimization problems (e.g., $k$-means in a metric space). ",

In many cases, such as in distance and bearing-based localization, the measurement model is a nonlinear function of the agents' positions, leading to pairwise interconnections between the agents. As the optimal solution for the WSN localization problem is known to be computationally expensive in these cases, an efficient approximation is desired. In this paper, we show that the inherent sparsity in this problem can be exploited to greatly reduce the computational effort of using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for large-scale WSN localization. In the proposed method, which we call the Low-Bandwidth Extended Kalman Filter (LB-EKF), the measurement information matrix is converted into a banded matrix by relabeling (permuting the order of) the vertices of the graph. Using a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, it is shown that typical WSN configurations (which can be modeled as random geometric graphs) can be localized in a scalable manner using the proposed LB-EKF approach.

    "abstract": "Learning from positive and unlabeled data is known as positive-unlabeled (PU) learning in literature and has attracted much attention in recent years. One common approach in PU learning is to sample a set of pseudo-negatives from the unlabeled data using ad-hoc thresholds so that conventional supervised methods can be applied with both positive and negative samples. Owing to the label uncertainty among the unlabeled data, errors of misclassifying unlabeled positive samples as negative samples inevitably appear and may even accumulate during the training processes. Those errors often lead to performance degradation and model instability. To mitigate the impact of label uncertainty and improve the robustness of learning with positive and unlabeled data, we propose a new robust PU learning method with a training strategy motivated by the nature of human learning: easy cases should be learned first. Similar intuition has been utilized in curriculum learning to only use easier cases in the early stage of training before introducing more complex cases. Specifically, we utilize a novel ``hardness'' measure to distinguish unlabeled samples with a high chance of being negative from unlabeled samples with large label noise. An iterative training strategy is then implemented to fine-tune the selection of negative samples during the training process in an iterative manner to include more ``easy'' samples in the early stage of training. Extensive experimental validations over a wide range of learning tasks show that this approach can effectively improve the accuracy and stability of learning with positive and unlabeled data.

Detecting repeating vulnerabilities like 1-day and N-day vulnerabilities is an important cyber security task. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art methods suffer from poor performance because they detect patch existence instead of vulnerability existence and infer the vulnerability signature directly from binary code. In this paper, we propose VulMatch to extract precise vulnerability-related binary instructions to generate the vulnerability-related signature. VulMatch detects vulnerability existence based on binary signatures. Unlike previous approaches, VulMatch accurately locates vulnerability-related instructions by utilizing source and binary codes. Our experiments were conducted using over 1000 vulnerable instances across seven open-source projects. VulMatch significantly outperformed the baseline tools Asm2vec and Palmtree. Besides the performance advantages over the baseline tools, VulMatch offers a better feature by providing explainable reasons during vulnerability detection. Our empirical studies demonstrate that VulMatch detects fine-grained vulnerability that the state-of-the-art tools struggle with. Our experiment on commercial firmware demonstrates VulMatch is able to find vulnerabilities in real-world scenario. ",

Due to the powerful noise-to-image denoising capability of denoising diffusion models, in this paper, we propose a diffusion-based framework for camouflaged object detection, termed diffCOD, a new framework that considers the camouflaged object segmentation task as a denoising diffusion process from noisy masks to object masks. Specifically, the object mask diffuses from the ground-truth masks to a random distribution, and the designed model learns to reverse this noising process. To strengthen the denoising learning, the input image prior is encoded and integrated into the denoising diffusion model to guide the diffusion process. Furthermore, we design an injection attention module (IAM) to interact conditional semantic features extracted from the image with the diffusion noise embedding via the cross-attention mechanism to enhance denoising learning. Extensive experiments on four widely used COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves favorable performance compared to the existing 11 state-of-the-art methods, especially in the detailed texture segmentation of camouflaged objects.

In this study, we propose a novel approach called GradOrth to facilitate OOD detection based on one intriguing observation that the important features to identify OOD data lie in the lower-rank subspace of in-distribution (ID) data. In particular, we identify OOD data by computing the norm of gradient projection on the subspaces considered important for the in-distribution data. A large orthogonal projection value (i.e. a small projection value) indicates the sample as OOD as it captures a weak correlation of the ID data. This simple yet effective method exhibits outstanding performance, showcasing a notable reduction in the average false positive rate at a 95% true positive rate (FPR95) of up to 8% when compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing instance-reweighted adversarial training (AT) methods heavily depend on heuristics and/or geometric interpretations to determine those importance weights, making these algorithms lack rigorous theoretical justification/guarantee. Moreover, recent research has shown that adversarial training suffers from a severe non-uniform robust performance across the training distribution, e.g., data points belonging to some classes can be much more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than others. To address both issues, in this paper, we propose a novel doubly-robust instance reweighted AT framework, which allows to obtain the importance weights via exploring distributionally robust optimization (DRO) techniques, and at the same time boosts the robustness on the most vulnerable examples. In particular, our importance weights are obtained by optimizing the KL-divergence regularized loss function, which allows us to devise new algorithms with a theoretical convergence guarantee. Experiments on standard classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms related state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of average robust performance, and at the same time improves the robustness against attacks on the weakest data points.

However, this approach can also cause adverse effects on ZSL since the conventional augmentation techniques that solely depend on single-label supervision is not able to maintain semantic information and result in the semantic distortion issue consequently. In other words, image argumentation may falsify the semantic (e.g., attribute) information of an image. To take the advantage of image augmentations while mitigating the semantic distortion issue, we propose a novel ZSL approach by Harnessing Adversarial Samples (HAS). HAS advances ZSL through adversarial training which takes into account three crucial aspects: (1) robust generation by enforcing augmentations to be similar to negative classes, while maintaining correct labels, (2) reliable generation by introducing a latent space constraint to avert significant deviations from the original data manifold, and (3) diverse generation by incorporating attribute-based perturbation by adjusting images according to each semantic attribute's localization. Through comprehensive experiments on three prominent zero-shot benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our adversarial samples approach in both ZSL and Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) scenarios.

Previous textual adversarial attacks adopt gradients or confidence scores to calculate word importance ranking and generate adversarial examples. However, this information is unavailable in the real world. Therefore, we focus on a more realistic and challenging setting, named hard-label attack, in which the attacker can only query the model and obtain a discrete prediction label. Existing hard-label attack algorithms tend to initialize adversarial examples by random substitution and then utilize complex heuristic algorithms to optimize the adversarial perturbation. These methods require a lot of model queries and the attack success rate is restricted by adversary initialization. In this paper, we propose a novel hard-label attack algorithm named LimeAttack, which leverages a local explainable method to approximate word importance ranking, and then adopts beam search to find the optimal solution. Extensive experiments show that LimeAttack achieves the better attacking performance compared with existing hard-label attack under the same query budget. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of LimeAttack on large language models, and results indicate that adversarial examples remain a significant threat to large language models. The adversarial examples crafted by LimeAttack are highly transferable and effectively improve model robustness in adversarial training. ",

    "abstract": "The harmonic balance method is the most commonly used method for solving periodic solutions of nonlinear dynamic systems, but the high-order approximation of nonlinear terms requires sophisticated formula derivation, which limits its ultra-high accuracy. The authors' team proposed the reconstruction harmonic balance (RHB) method through the equivalent reconstruction of the frequency domain nonlinear quantity in the time domain, which settled the problem of ultra-high-order calculation of the classical harmonic balance method. However, both methods require the dynamical system to be polynomial nonlinear, and cannot be directly used to solve the quasi-periodic solution of the nonlinear system. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a computational method that combines the RHB method and the recast technique for complex nonlinear systems. First, the general nonlinear problem is non-destructively recast into a polynomial nonlinear system, and then the RHB method is used for high-precision solutions. Aiming at computing the quasi-periodic response, the RHB method based on the idea of \"supplemental frequency\" is derived. By optimizing and selecting base frequencies, the fast and accurate capture of quasi-periodic response is achieved. The typical systems such as nonlinear pendulum, relativistic harmonic oscillator, and nonlinear coupling asymmetric pendulum are selected for simulation. The simulation results show that the accuracy of the RHB-recast method for solving nonpolynomial nonlinear systems is on the order of 10^(-12), reaching the computer accuracy, far exceeding state-of-the-art methods. The supplemental frequency RHB method achieves the efficient solution of quasi-periodic problems. ",

We introduce flying adversarial patches, where multiple images are mounted on at least one other flying robot and therefore can be placed anywhere in the field of view of a victim multirotor. By introducing the attacker robots, the system is extended to an adversarial multi-robot system. For an effective attack, we compare three methods that simultaneously optimize multiple adversarial patches and their position in the input image. We show that our methods scale well with the number of adversarial patches.

    "abstract": "The deep neural network has attained significant efficiency in image recognition. However, it has vulnerable recognition robustness under extensive data uncertainty in practical applications. The uncertainty is attributed to the inevitable ambient noise and, more importantly, the possible adversarial attack. Dynamic methods can effectively improve the defense initiative in the arms race of attack and defense of adversarial examples. Different from the previous dynamic method depend on input or decision, this work explore the dynamic attributes in model level through dynamic ensemble selection technology to further protect the model from white-box attacks and improve the robustness. Specifically, in training phase the Dirichlet distribution is apply as prior of sub-models' predictive distribution, and the diversity constraint in parameter space is introduced under the lightweight sub-models to construct alternative ensembel model spaces. In test phase, the certain sub-models are dynamically selected based on their rank of uncertainty value for the final prediction to ensure the majority accurate principle in ensemble robustness and accuracy. Compared with the previous dynamic method and staic adversarial traning model, the presented approach can achieve significant robustness results without damaging accuracy by combining dynamics and diversity property.

    "abstract": "Deviations from the approved design or processes during mass production can lead to unforeseen risks. However, these changes are sometimes necessary due to changes in the product design characteristics or an adaptation in the manufacturing process. A major challenge is to identify these risks early in the workflow so that failures leading to warranty claims can be avoided. We developed Fountain as a contextual assistant integrated in the deviation management workflow that helps in identifying the risks based on the description of the existing design and process criteria and the proposed deviation. In the manufacturing context, it is important that the assistant provides recommendations that are explainable and consistent. We achieve this through a combination of the following two components 1) language models finetuned for domain specific semantic similarity and, 2) knowledge representation in the form of a property graph derived from the bill of materials, Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and prior failures reported by customers. Here, we present the nuances of selecting and adapting pretrained language models for an engineering domain, continuous model updates based on user interaction with the contextual assistant and creating the causal chain for explainable recommendations based on the knowledge representation. Additionally, we demonstrate that the model adaptation is feasible using moderate computational infrastructure already available to most engineering teams in manufacturing organizations and inference can be performed on standard CPU only instances for integration with existing applications making these methods easily deployable.

    "abstract": "Shape completion, i.e., predicting the complete geometry of an object from a partial observation, is highly relevant for several downstream tasks, most notably robotic manipulation. When basing planning or prediction of real grasps on object shape reconstruction, an indication of severe geometric uncertainty is indispensable. In particular, there can be an irreducible uncertainty in extended regions about the presence of entire object parts when given ambiguous object views. To treat this important case, we propose two novel methods for predicting such uncertain regions as straightforward extensions of any method for predicting local spatial occupancy, one through postprocessing occupancy scores, the other through direct prediction of an uncertainty indicator. We compare these methods together with two known approaches to probabilistic shape completion. Moreover, we generate a dataset, derived from ShapeNet, of realistically rendered depth images of object views with ground-truth annotations for the uncertain regions. We train on this dataset and test each method in shape completion and prediction of uncertain regions for known and novel object instances and on synthetic and real data. While direct uncertainty prediction is by far the most accurate in the segmentation of uncertain regions, both novel methods outperform the two baselines in shape completion and uncertain region prediction, and avoiding the predicted uncertain regions increases the quality of grasps for all tested methods.

To this end, we propose a Counterfactual Graph Transformer (CGT) model with an instance-level explainer (e.g., finding the important subgraphs) specifically designed for TFP. We design a perturbation mask generator over input sensor features at the time dimension and the graph structure on the graph transformer module to obtain spatial and temporal counterfactual explanations. By searching the optimal perturbation masks on the input data feature and graph structures, we can obtain the concise and dominant data or graph edge links for the subsequent TFP task. After re-training the utilized graph transformer model after counterfactual perturbation, we can obtain improved and interpretable traffic flow prediction. Extensive results on three real-world public datasets show that CGT can produce reliable explanations and is promising for traffic flow prediction. ",

However, the link between online sharing of scientific work and citation impact for teams with different gender compositions remains understudied. Here we explore whether online visibility is helping women overcome the gender-based citation penalty. Our analyses cover the three broad research areas of Computer Science, Engineering, and Social Sciences, which have different gender representation, adoption of online science dissemination practices, and citation culture. We create a quasi-experimental setting by applying Coarsened Exact Matching, which enables us to isolate the effects of team gender composition and online visibility on the number of citations. We find that online visibility positively affects citations across research areas, while team gender composition interacts differently with visibility in these research areas. Our results provide essential insights into gendered citation patterns and online visibility, inviting informed discussions about decreasing the citation gap. ",

    "abstract": "As a special type of mobile ad hoc network (MANET), the flying ad hoc network (FANET) has the potential to enable a variety of emerging applications in both civilian wireless communications (e.g., 5G and 6G) and the defense industry. The routing protocol plays a pivotal role in FANET. However, when designing the routing protocol for FANET, it is conventionally assumed that the aerial nodes move randomly. This is clearly inappropriate for a mission-oriented FANET (MO-FANET), in which the aerial nodes typically move toward a given destination from given departure point(s), possibly along a roughly deterministic flight path while maintaining a well-established formation, in order to carry out certain missions. In this paper, a novel cyber-physical routing protocol exploiting the particular mobility pattern of an MO-FANET is proposed based on cross-disciplinary integration, which makes full use of the mission-determined trajectory dynamics to construct the time sequence of rejoining and separating, as well as the adjacency matrix for each node, as prior information. Compared with the existing representative routing protocols used in FANETs, our protocol achieves a higher packet-delivery ratio (PDR) at the cost of even lower overhead and lower average end-to-end latency, while maintaining a reasonably moderate and stable network jitter, as demonstrated by extensive ns-3-based simulations assuming realistic configurations in an MO-FANET.

Our algorithm first makes a coarse estimation of the position and mobility state of the nodes by using the prediction step of EKF. Then it utilizes the coarse estimate as the prior of STDF that relies on factor graph (FG), thus facilitates inferring a posteriori distributions of the agents' positions in a distributed manner. We approximate the nonlinear terms of the messages passed on the associated FG with high precision by exploiting the second-order Taylor polynomial and obtain closed-form representations of each message in the data fusion step, where temporal measurements by imperfect hardware are considered additionally. In the third stage, refinement of position estimate is performed by invoking the update step of EKF. Simulation results and analysis show that our EKF-STDF has a lower computational complexity than the state-of-the-art EKF-based algorithms, while achieving an even superior positioning performance in harsh environment.

At the present, the infrastructure is designed while only little about the intended operation is known. Hence, the timetable and the operation are adjusted to the infrastructure. Since space, time and money for extension measures of railway infrastructure are limited, each modification has to be done carefully and long lasting and should be appropriate for the future unknown demand. To take this into account, we present the robust network design problem for railway infrastructure under capacity constraints and uncertain timetables. Here, we plan the required expansion measures for an uncertain long-term timetable. We show that this problem is NP-hard even when restricted to bipartite graphs and very simple timetables and present easier solvable special cases. This problem corresponds to the fixed-charge network design problem where the expansion costs are minimized such that the timetable is conductible. We model this problem by an integer linear program using time expanded networks. To incorporate the uncertainty of the future timetable, we use a scenario-based approach. We define scenarios with individual departure and arrival times and optional trains. The network is then optimized such that a given percentage of the scenarios can be operated while minimizing the expansion costs and potential penalty costs for not scheduled optional trains. ",

    "abstract": "Sentences that present a complex syntax act as a major stumbling block for downstream Natural Language Processing applications whose predictive quality deteriorates with sentence length and complexity. The task of Text Simplification (TS) may remedy this situation. It aims to modify sentences in order to make them easier to process, using a set of rewriting operations, such as reordering, deletion, or splitting. State-of-the-art syntactic TS approaches suffer from two major drawbacks: first, they follow a very conservative approach in that they tend to retain the input rather than transforming it, and second, they ignore the cohesive nature of texts, where context spread across clauses or sentences is needed to infer the true meaning of a statement. To address these problems, we present a discourse-aware TS approach that splits and rephrases complex English sentences within the semantic context in which they occur. Based on a linguistically grounded transformation stage that uses clausal and phrasal disembedding mechanisms, complex sentences are transformed into shorter utterances with a simple canonical structure that can be easily analyzed by downstream applications. With sentence splitting, we thus address a TS task that has hardly been explored so far. Moreover, we introduce the notion of minimality in this context, as we aim to decompose source sentences into a set of self-contained minimal semantic units. To avoid breaking down the input into a disjointed sequence of statements that is difficult to interpret because important contextual information is missing, we incorporate the semantic context between the split propositions in the form of hierarchical structures and semantic relationships. In that way, we generate a semantic hierarchy of minimal propositions that leads to a novel representation of complex assertions that puts a semantic layer on top of the simplified sentences. ",

This behavior particularly degrades accuracy in groups of samples of the correlated class that are missing the spurious feature or samples of the opposite class but with the spurious feature present. The recently proposed Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) method improves accuracy of these worst groups. Based on the main argument that ERM mods can learn core features sufficiently well, DFR only needs to retrain the last layer of the classification model with a small group-balanced data set. In this work, we examine the applicability of DFR to realistic data in the medical domain. Furthermore, we investigate the reasoning behind the effectiveness of last-layer retraining and show that even though DFR has the potential to improve the accuracy of the worst group, it remains susceptible to spurious correlations.

    "abstract": "Spectral clustering methods are known for their ability to represent clusters of diverse shapes, densities etc. However, results of such algorithms, when applied e.g. to text documents, are hard to explain to the user, especially due to embedding in the spectral space which has no obvious relation to document contents. Therefore there is an urgent need to elaborate methods for explaining the outcome of the clustering. This paper presents a contribution towards this goal. We present a proposal of explanation of results of combinatorial Laplacian based graph spectral clustering. It is based on showing (approximate) equivalence of combinatorial Laplacian embedding, $K$-embedding (proposed in this paper) and term vector space embedding. Hence a bridge is constructed between the textual contents and the clustering results. We provide theoretical background for this approach. We performed experimental study showing that $K$-embedding approximates well Laplacian embedding under favourable block matrix conditions and show that approximation is good enough under other conditions.

As the the complexity of Integrated Circuits (ICs) increases, there is an increased demand for accurate routing quality prediction. Accurate congestion prediction aids in identifying design flaws early on, thereby accelerating circuit design and conserving resources. Despite the advancements in current congestion prediction methodologies, an essential aspect that has been largely overlooked is the spatial label-correlation between different grids in congestion prediction. The spatial label-correlation is a fundamental characteristic of circuit design, where the congestion status of a grid is not isolated but inherently influenced by the conditions of its neighboring grids. In order to fully exploit the inherent spatial label-correlation between neighboring grids, we propose a novel approach, {\\ours}, i.e., VAriational Label-Correlation Enhancement for Congestion Prediction, which considers the local label-correlation in the congestion map, associating the estimated congestion value of each grid with a local label-correlation weight influenced by its surrounding grids. {\\ours} leverages variational inference techniques to estimate this weight, thereby enhancing the regression model's performance by incorporating spatial dependencies.

In the considered model, video sensing devices must transmit video semantic information to an edge server, to facilitate ubiquitous video sensing services such as road environment monitoring at the edge server in autonomous driving scenario. However, due to the varying wireless network conditions, it is challenging to guarantee both low transmission delay and high semantic accuracy at the same time if devices continuously transmit a fixed bitrate video semantic information. To address this challenge, we develop an adaptive bitrate video semantic communication (ABRVSC) system, in which devices adaptively adjust the bitrate of video semantic information according to network conditions. Specifically, we first define the quality of experience (QoE) for video semantic communication. Subsequently, a swin transformer-based semantic codec is proposed to extract semantic information with considering the influence of QoE. Then, we propose an Actor-Critic based ABR algorithm for the semantic codec to enhance the robustness of the proposed ABRVSC scheme against network variations. Simulation results demonstrate that at low bitrates, the mean intersection over union (MIoU) of the proposed ABRVSC scheme is nearly twice that of the traditional scheme. Moreover, the proposed ABRVSC scheme, which increases the QoE in video semantic communication by 36.57%, exhibits more robustness against network variations compared to both the fixed bitrate schemes and traditional ABR schemes.

Vehicle trajectory prediction consists of two essential tasks, i.e., longitudinal position prediction and lateral position prediction. There is a significant correlation between driving intentions and vehicle motion. In existing work, the three tasks are often conducted separately without considering the relationships between the longitudinal position, lateral position, and driving intention. In this paper, we propose a novel Temporal Multi-Gate Mixture-of-Experts (TMMOE) model for simultaneously predicting the vehicle trajectory and driving intention. The proposed model consists of three layers: a shared layer, an expert layer, and a fully connected layer. In the model, the shared layer utilizes Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) to extract temporal features. Then the expert layer is built to identify different information according to the three tasks. Moreover, the fully connected layer is used to integrate and export prediction results. To achieve better performance, uncertainty algorithm is used to construct the multi-task loss function. Finally, the publicly available CitySim dataset validates the TMMOE model, demonstrating superior performance compared to the LSTM model, achieving the highest classification and regression results.

To deal with the widespread label scarcity issue in real-world applications, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is leveraged to train GNNs with limited or even no labels by maximizing the mutual information between nodes in its augmented views generated from the original graph. However, the distribution of graphs remains unconsidered in view generation, resulting in the ignorance of unseen edges in most existing literature, which is empirically shown to be able to improve GCL's performance in our experiments. To this end, we propose to incorporate graph generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn the distribution of views for GCL, in order to i) automatically capture the characteristic of graphs for augmentations, and ii) jointly train the graph GAN model and the GCL model. Specifically, we present GACN, a novel Generative Adversarial Contrastive learning Network for graph representation learning. GACN develops a view generator and a view discriminator to generate augmented views automatically in an adversarial style. Then, GACN leverages these views to train a GNN encoder with two carefully designed self-supervised learning losses, including the graph contrastive loss and the Bayesian personalized ranking Loss. Furthermore, we design an optimization framework to train all GACN modules jointly. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets show that GACN is able to generate high-quality augmented views for GCL and is superior to twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods. Noticeably, our proposed GACN surprisingly discovers that the generated views in data augmentation finally conform to the well-known preferential attachment rule in online networks. ",

The transient stability GEDF-based supervised contrastive learning (GEDF-SCL) model uses supervised contrastive learning to predict transient stability with GEDFs, considering power grid topology information. To evaluate the performance of the proposed GEDF-SCL model, power grids of varying topologies were generated based on the IEEE 39-bus system model. Transient operational data was obtained by simulating N-1 and N-$\\bm{m}$-1 contingencies on these generated power system topologies.

Despite its growing popularity, FL faces challenges in preserving the privacy of local datasets, its sensitivity to poisoning attacks by malicious users, and its communication overhead. The latter is additionally considerably dominant in large-scale networks. These limitations are often individually mitigated by local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms, robust aggregation, compression, and user selection techniques, which typically come at the cost of accuracy. In this work, we present compressed private aggregation (CPA), that allows massive deployments to simultaneously communicate at extremely low bit rates while achieving privacy, anonymity, and resilience to malicious users. CPA randomizes a codebook for compressing the data into a few bits using nested lattice quantizers, while ensuring anonymity and robustness, with a subsequent perturbation to hold LDP. The proposed CPA is proven to result in FL convergence in the same asymptotic rate as FL without privacy, compression, and robustness considerations, while satisfying both anonymity and LDP requirements. These analytical properties are empirically confirmed in a numerical study, where we demonstrate the performance gains of CPA compared with separate mechanisms for compression and privacy for training different image classification models, as well as its robustness in mitigating the harmful effects of malicious users.

However, the cost of labeling causes insufficient labeled samples. Also, the real fine-grained traffic shows a long-tailed distribution with great class imbalance. These two problems often appear simultaneously, posing serious challenges to fine-grained NIDS. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised fine-grained intrusion detection framework, SF-IDS, to achieve attack classification in the label-limited and highly class imbalanced case. We design a self-training backbone model called RI-1DCNN to boost the feature extraction by reconstructing the input samples into a multichannel image format. The uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels is evaluated and used as a reference for pseudo-label filtering in combination with the prediction probability. To mitigate the effects of fine-grained class imbalance, we propose a hybrid loss function combining supervised contrastive loss and multi-weighted classification loss to obtain more compact intra-class features and clearer inter-class intervals. Experiments show that the proposed SF-IDS achieves 3.01% and 2.71% Marco-F1 improvement on two classical datasets with 1% labeled, respectively. ",

Though Vision GNN (ViG) adopts graph-level features for complex images, it has some issues, such as inaccurate neighbor node selection, expensive node information aggregation calculation, and over-smoothing in the deep layers. To address the above problems, we propose a Progressive Vision Graph (PVG) architecture for vision recognition task. Compared with previous works, PVG contains three main components: 1) Progressively Separated Graph Construction (PSGC) to introduce second-order similarity by gradually increasing the channel of the global graph branch and decreasing the channel of local branch as the layer deepens; 2) Neighbor nodes information aggregation and update module by using Max pooling and mathematical Expectation (MaxE) to aggregate rich neighbor information; 3) Graph error Linear Unit (GraphLU) to enhance low-value information in a relaxed form to reduce the compression of image detail information for alleviating the over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of PVG over state-of-the-art methods, e.g., our PVG-S obtains 83.0% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K that surpasses GNN-based ViG-S by +0.9 with the parameters reduced by 18.5%, while the largest PVG-B obtains 84.2% that has +0.5 improvement than ViG-B.

However, within these application spaces, communication is often unreliable, causing inefficiencies or outright failures to arise in most MRS algorithms. Many researchers tackle this problem by requiring all robots to either maintain communication using proximity constraints or assuming that all robots will execute a predetermined plan over long periods of disconnection. The latter method allows for higher levels of efficiency in a MRS, but failures and environmental uncertainties can have cascading effects across the system, especially when a mission objective is complex or time-sensitive. To solve this, we propose an epistemic planning framework that allows robots to reason about the system state, leverage heterogeneous system makeups, and optimize information dissemination to disconnected neighbors. Dynamic epistemic logic formalizes the propagation of belief states, and epistemic task allocation and gossip is accomplished via a mixed integer program using the belief states for utility predictions and planning. The proposed framework is validated using simulations and experiments with heterogeneous vehicles. ",

Related methods such as multi-view clustering mainly project multi-modal features into a joint feature space.

As a result, these methods are not suitable for person clustering. In this paper, we propose a Relation-Aware Distribution representation Network (RAD-Net) to generate a distribution representation for multi-modal clues. The distribution representation of a clue is a vector consisting of the relation between this clue and all other clues from all modalities, thus being modality agnostic and good for person clustering. Accordingly, we introduce a graph-based method to construct distribution representation and employ a cyclic update policy to refine distribution representation progressively. Our method achieves substantial improvements of +6% and +8.2% in F-score on the Video Person-Clustering Dataset (VPCD) and VoxCeleb2 multi-view clustering dataset, respectively.

    "abstract": "Consensus algorithms facilitate agreement on and resolution of blockchain functions, such as smart contracts and transactions. Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which depends on financial incentives to ensure that validators perform certain duties and do not act maliciously. Should a validator attempt to defraud the system, legitimate validators will identify this and then staked cryptocurrency is `burned' through a process of slashing. In this paper, we show that an attacker who has compromised a set of validators could threaten to perform malicious actions that would result in slashing and thus, hold those validators to ransom. We use game theory to study how an attacker can coerce payment from a victim, for example by deploying a smart contract to provide a root of trust shared between attacker and victim during the extortion process. Our game theoretic model finds that it is in the interests of the validators to fully pay the ransom due to a lack of systemic protections for validators. Financial risk is solely placed on the victim during such an attack, with no mitigations available to them aside from capitulation (payment of ransom) in many scenarios. Such attacks could be disruptive to Ethereum and, likely, to many other PoS networks, if public trust in the validator system is eroded. We also discuss and evaluate potential mitigation measures arising from our analysis of the game theoretic model. ",

To further optimize the training process, a cost-sensitive neural network approach has been proposed in order to work with imbalanced datasets which has achieved almost 4% more accuracy than the conventional models used in our experiments. The cost-sensitive InceptionV3 (CS-InceptionV3) and CNN (CS-CNN) show a promising accuracy of 92.31% and a recall value of 1.00 respectively on an imbalanced dataset. The proposed models have shown great potential in improving tumor detection accuracy and must be further developed for application in practical solutions. We have provided the datasets and made our implementations publicly available at - https://github.com/shahariar-shibli/Explainable-Cost-Sensitive-Deep-Neural-Networks-for-Brain-Tumor-Detection-from-Brain-MRI-Images ",

    "abstract": "The atmospheric and water turbulence mitigation problems have emerged as challenging inverse problems in computer vision and optics communities over the years. However, current methods either rely heavily on the quality of the training dataset or fail to generalize over various scenarios, such as static scenes, dynamic scenes, and text reconstructions. We propose a general implicit neural representation for unsupervised atmospheric and water turbulence mitigation (NeRT). NeRT leverages the implicit neural representations and the physically correct tilt-then-blur turbulence model to reconstruct the clean, undistorted image, given only dozens of distorted input images. Moreover, we show that NeRT outperforms the state-of-the-art through various qualitative and quantitative evaluations of atmospheric and water turbulence datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of NeRT to eliminate uncontrolled turbulence from real-world environments. Lastly, we incorporate NeRT into continuously captured video sequences and demonstrate $48 \\times$ speedup. ",

In this work, we provide a short overview of the state of consumer-grade satellite networks including broadband satellites and future NTN services.

In Open Source realm, however, this is not the case. Although the objective with free software is to allow for access, free distribution and the rights to modify coding, having such audit trails can help to trace and understand how active members of these communities are and the type of activities they perform. In this paper, we propose using process mining to construct logs using as much data as can be found in open source repositories in order to produce a process model, also called a workflow net that graphical depicts the sequential occurrence of developers activities.

However, the increasing complexity of datasets and the demand for improved performance necessitate the exploration of innovative techniques. The present work proposes a new deep neural network (called as, T-Fusion Net) that augments multiple localizations based spatial attention. This attention mechanism allows the network to focus on relevant image regions, improving its discriminative power. A homogeneous ensemble of the said network is further used to enhance image classification accuracy. For ensembling, the proposed approach considers multiple instances of individual T-Fusion Net. The model incorporates fuzzy max fusion to merge the outputs of individual nets. The fusion process is optimized through a carefully chosen parameter to strike a balance on the contributions of the individual models. Experimental evaluations on benchmark Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2 CT scan) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed T-Fusion Net as well as its ensemble. The proposed T-Fusion Net and the homogeneous ensemble model exhibit better performance, as compared to other state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy of 97.59% and 98.4%, respectively. ",

Machine learning methods have been widely applied for automatically detecting potential risks and thus saving the cost of labor. However, the development in this field is lagging behind in recent years by the following two facts: 1) the algorithms used are somewhat outdated, especially in the context of the fast advance of generative AI and large language models (LLMs); 2) the lack of a unified and open-sourced financial benchmark has impeded the related research for years. To tackle these issues, we propose FinPT and FinBench: the former is a novel approach for financial risk prediction that conduct Profile Tuning on large pretrained foundation models, and the latter is a set of high-quality datasets on financial risks such as default, fraud, and churn. In FinPT, we fill the financial tabular data into the pre-defined instruction template, obtain natural-language customer profiles by prompting LLMs, and fine-tune large foundation models with the profile text to make predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FinPT by experimenting with a range of representative strong baselines on FinBench. The analytical studies further deepen the understanding of LLMs for financial risk prediction. ",

These methods require one to enumerate or sample small connected subgraphs of a network, which can be computationally intractable if naive methods are used. Efficient algorithms exists for both enumeration and uniform sampling of subgraphs, and here we generalize the ESU algorithm for a very general notion of multilayer networks. We show that multilayer network subnetwork enumeration introduces nontrivial complications to the existing algorithm, and present two different generalized algorithms that preserve the desired features of unbiased sampling and trivial parallelization. We evaluate these algorithms in synthetic networks and with real-world data, and show that neither of the algorithms is strictly more efficient but rather the choice depends on the features of the data. Having a general algorithm for finding subnetworks makes advanced multilayer network analysis possible, and enables researchers to apply a variety of methods to previously difficult-to-handle multilayer networks in a variety of domains and across many different types of multilayer networks.

    "abstract": "This thesis focuses on representation learning for sequence data over time or space, aiming to improve downstream sequence prediction tasks by using the learned representations. Supervised learning has been the most dominant approach for training deep neural networks for learning good sequential representations. However, one limiting factor to scale supervised learning is the lack of enough annotated data. Motivated by this challenge, it is natural to explore representation learning methods that can utilize large amounts of unlabeled and weakly labeled data, as well as an additional data modality. I describe my broad study of representation learning for speech data. Unlike most other works that focus on a single learning setting, this thesis studies multiple settings: supervised learning with auxiliary losses, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and multi-view learning. Besides different learning problems, I also explore multiple approaches for representation learning. Though I focus on speech data, the methods described in this thesis can also be applied to other domains. Overall, the field of representation learning is developing rapidly. State-of-the-art results on speech related tasks are typically based on Transformers pre-trained with large-scale self-supervised learning, which aims to learn generic representations that can benefit multiple downstream tasks. Since 2020, large-scale pre-training has been the de facto choice to achieve good performance. This delayed thesis does not attempt to summarize and compare with the latest results on speech representation learning; instead, it presents a unique study on speech representation learning before the Transformer era, that covers multiple learning settings. Some of the findings in this thesis can still be useful today. ",

Unfortunately, manual annotation of the vessel masks is challenging and resource-intensive due to subtle branches and complex structures. To overcome this issue, this paper presents a self-supervised vessel segmentation method, dubbed the contrastive diffusion adversarial representation learning (C-DARL) model. Our model is composed of a diffusion module and a generation module that learns the distribution of multi-domain blood vessel data by generating synthetic vessel images from diffusion latent. Moreover, we employ contrastive learning through a mask-based contrastive loss so that the model can learn more realistic vessel representations. To validate the efficacy, C-DARL is trained using various vessel datasets, including coronary angiograms, abdominal digital subtraction angiograms, and retinal imaging. Experimental results confirm that our model achieves performance improvement over baseline methods with noise robustness, suggesting the effectiveness of C-DARL for vessel segmentation. ",

To overcome this challenge, we propose SkullGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN), to create large datasets of synthetic skull CT slices, reducing reliance on real images and accelerating the integration of machine learning into healthcare. In our method, CT slices of 38 subjects were fed to SkullGAN, a neural network comprising over 200 million parameters. The synthetic skull images generated were evaluated based on three quantitative radiological features: skull density ratio (SDR), mean thickness, and mean intensity. They were further analyzed using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and by applying the SkullGAN discriminator as a classifier. The results showed that SkullGAN-generated images demonstrated similar key quantitative radiological features to real skulls. Further definitive analysis was undertaken by applying the discriminator of SkullGAN, where the SkullGAN discriminator classified 56.5% of a test set of real skull images and 55.9% of the SkullGAN-generated images as reals (the theoretical optimum being 50%), demonstrating that the SkullGAN-generated skull set is indistinguishable from the real skull set - within the limits of our nonlinear classifier. Therefore, SkullGAN makes it possible to generate large numbers of synthetic skull CT segments, necessary for training neural networks for medical applications involving the human skull. This mitigates challenges associated with preparing large, high-quality training datasets, such as access, capital, time, and the need for domain expertise. ",

Searching for alternative perovskites with high photovoltaic performances and thermally stabilities is urgent in this field. In this work, stimulated by the recently proposed materials-genome initiative project, firstly we build classical machine-learning algorithms for the models of formation energies, bangdaps and Deybe temperatures for hybrid organic-inorganic double perovskites, then we choose the high-precision models to screen a large scale of double-perovskite chemical space, to filter out good pervoskite candidates for solar cells. We also analyze features of importances for the the three target properties to reveal the underlying mechanisms and discover the typical characteristics of high-performances double perovskites. Secondly we adopt the Crystal graph convolution neural network (CGCNN), to build precise model for bandgaps of perovskites for further filtering. Finally we use the ab-initio method to verify the results predicted by the CGCNN method, and find that, six out of twenty randomly chosen (CH3)2NH2-based HOIDP candidates possess finite bandgaps, and especially, (CH3)2NH2AuSbCl6 and (CH3)2NH2CsPdF6 possess the bandgaps of 0.633 eV and 0.504 eV, which are appropriate for photovoltaic applications.

However, current prognostic prediction methods fail to explicitly and accurately investigate relationships between the tumor and nearby important vessels. This paper proposes a novel learnable neural distance that describes the precise relationship between the tumor and vessels in CT images of different patients, adopting it as a major feature for prognosis prediction. Besides, different from existing models that used CNNs or LSTMs to exploit tumor enhancement patterns on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT imaging, we improved the extraction of dynamic tumor-related texture features in multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT by fusing local and global features using CNN and transformer modules, further enhancing the features extracted across multi-phase CT images. We extensively evaluated and compared the proposed method with existing methods in the multi-center (n=4) dataset with 1,070 patients with PDAC, and statistical analysis confirmed its clinical effectiveness in the external test set consisting of three centers. The developed risk marker was the strongest predictor of overall survival among preoperative factors and it has the potential to be combined with established clinical factors to select patients at higher risk who might benefit from neoadjuvant therapy.

    "title": "Semisupervised Anomaly Detection using Support Vector Regression with  Quantum Kernel",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) involves identifying observations or events that deviate in some way from the rest of the data. Machine learning techniques have shown success in automating this process by detecting hidden patterns and deviations in large-scale data. The potential of quantum computing for machine learning has been widely recognized, leading to extensive research efforts to develop suitable quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms. In particular, the search for QML algorithms for near-term NISQ devices is in full swing. However, NISQ devices pose additional challenges due to their limited qubit coherence times, low number of qubits, and high error rates. Kernel methods based on quantum kernel estimation have emerged as a promising approach to QML on NISQ devices, offering theoretical guarantees, versatility, and compatibility with NISQ constraints. Especially support vector machines (SVM) utilizing quantum kernel estimation have shown success in various supervised learning tasks. However, in the context of AD, semisupervised learning is of great relevance, and yet there is limited research published in this area. This paper introduces an approach to semisupervised AD based on the reconstruction loss of a support vector regression (SVR) with quantum kernel. This novel model is an alternative to the variational quantum and quantum kernel one-class classifiers, and is compared to a quantum autoencoder as quantum baseline and a SVR with radial-basis-function (RBF) kernel as well as a classical autoencoder as classical baselines. The models are benchmarked extensively on 10 real-world AD data sets and one toy data set, and it is shown that our SVR model with quantum kernel performs better than the SVR with RBF kernel as well as all other models, achieving highest mean AUC over all data sets. In addition, our QSVR outperforms the quantum autoencoder on 9 out of 11 data sets. ",

    "abstract": "Agent-based simulations have been used in modeling transportation systems for traffic management and passenger flows. In this work, we hope to shed light on the complex factors that influence transportation mode decisions within developing countries, using Colombia as a case study. We model an ecosystem of human agents that decide at each time step on the mode of transportation they would take to work. Their decision is based on a combination of their personal satisfaction with the journey they had just taken, which is evaluated across a personal vector of needs, the information they crowdsource from their prevailing social network, and their personal uncertainty about the experience of trying a new transport solution. We simulate different network structures to analyze the social influence for different decision-makers. We find that in low/medium connected groups inquisitive people actively change modes cyclically over the years while imitators cluster rapidly and change less frequently. ",

Deep learning-based methods have proven highly advantageous in orientation recognition and prediction tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of imaging orientation in cardiac MRI and present a method that employs deep neural networks to categorize and standardize the orientation. To cater to multiple sequences and modalities of MRI, we propose a transfer learning strategy, enabling adaptation of our model from a single modality to diverse modalities. We conducted comprehensive experiments on CMR images from various modalities, including bSSFP, T2, and LGE. The validation accuracies achieved were 100.0\\%, 100.0\\%, and 99.4\\%, confirming the robustness and effectiveness of our model.
