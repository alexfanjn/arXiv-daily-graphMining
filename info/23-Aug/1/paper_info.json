    "title": "Identifying acute illness phenotypes via deep temporal interpolation and  clustering network on physiologic signatures",
    "abstract": "Initial hours of hospital admission impact clinical trajectory, but early clinical decisions often suffer due to data paucity. With clustering analysis for vital signs within six hours of admission, patient phenotypes with distinct pathophysiological signatures and outcomes may support early clinical decisions. We created a single-center, longitudinal EHR dataset for 75,762 adults admitted to a tertiary care center for 6+ hours. We proposed a deep temporal interpolation and clustering network to extract latent representations from sparse, irregularly sampled vital sign data and derived distinct patient phenotypes in a training cohort (n=41,502). Model and hyper-parameters were chosen based on a validation cohort (n=17,415). Test cohort (n=16,845) was used to analyze reproducibility and correlation with biomarkers. The training, validation, and testing cohorts had similar distributions of age (54-55 yrs), sex (55% female), race, comorbidities, and illness severity. Four clusters were identified. Phenotype A (18%) had most comorbid disease with higher rate of prolonged respiratory insufficiency, acute kidney injury, sepsis, and three-year mortality. Phenotypes B (33%) and C (31%) had diffuse patterns of mild organ dysfunction. Phenotype B had favorable short-term outcomes but second-highest three-year mortality. Phenotype C had favorable clinical outcomes. Phenotype D (17%) had early/persistent hypotension, high rate of early surgery, and substantial biomarker rate of inflammation but second-lowest three-year mortality. After comparing phenotypes' SOFA scores, clustering results did not simply repeat other acuity assessments. In a heterogeneous cohort, four phenotypes with distinct categories of disease and outcomes were identified by a deep temporal interpolation and clustering network. This tool may impact triage decisions and clinical decision-support under time constraints. ",

    "title": "Select and Augment: Enhanced Dense Retrieval Knowledge Graph  Augmentation",
    "abstract": "Injecting textual information into knowledge graph (KG) entity representations has been a worthwhile expedition in terms of improving performance in KG oriented tasks within the NLP community. External knowledge often adopted to enhance KG embeddings ranges from semantically rich lexical dependency parsed features to a set of relevant key words to entire text descriptions supplied from an external corpus such as wikipedia and many more. Despite the gains this innovation (Text-enhanced KG embeddings) has made, the proposal in this work suggests that it can be improved even further. Instead of using a single text description (which would not sufficiently represent an entity because of the inherent lexical ambiguity of text), we propose a multi-task framework that jointly selects a set of text descriptions relevant to KG entities as well as align or augment KG embeddings with text descriptions. Different from prior work that plugs formal entity descriptions declared in knowledge bases, this framework leverages a retriever model to selectively identify richer or highly relevant text descriptions to use in augmenting entities. Furthermore, the framework treats the number of descriptions to use in augmentation process as a parameter, which allows the flexibility of enumerating across several numbers before identifying an appropriate number. Experiment results for Link Prediction demonstrate a 5.5% and 3.5% percentage increase in the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@10 scores respectively, in comparison to text-enhanced knowledge graph augmentation methods using traditional CNNs.

    "abstract": "The paper introduces the application of information geometry to describe the ground states of Ising models. This is achieved by utilizing parity-check matrices of cyclic and quasi-cyclic codes on toric and spherical topologies. The approach establishes a connection between machine learning and error-correcting coding, specifically in terms of automorphism and the size of the circulant of the quasi-cyclic code. This proposed approach has implications for the development of new embedding methods based on trapping sets. Statistical physics and number geometry are utilized to optimize error-correcting codes, leading to these embedding and sparse factorization methods. The paper establishes a direct connection between DNN architecture and error-correcting coding by demonstrating how state-of-the-art DNN architectures (ChordMixer, Mega, Mega-chunk, CDIL, ...) from the long-range arena can be equivalent to specific types (Cage-graph, Repeat Accumulate) of block and convolutional LDPC codes. QC codes correspond to certain types of chemical elements, with the carbon element being represented by the mixed automorphism Shu-Lin-Fossorier QC-LDPC code. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) used in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising model can be seen as analogous to the back-propagation loss function landscape in training DNNs. This similarity creates a comparable problem with TS pseudo-codeword, resembling the belief propagation method. Additionally, the layer depth in QAOA correlates to the number of decoding belief propagation iterations in the Wiberg decoding tree. Overall, this work has the potential to advance multiple fields, from Information Theory, DNN architecture design (sparse and structured prior graph topology), efficient hardware design for Quantum and Classical DPU/TPU (graph, quantize and shift register architect.) to Materials Science and beyond.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is critical in the smart industry for preventing equipment failure, reducing downtime, and improving safety. Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled the collection of large volumes of data from industrial machinery, providing a rich source of information for Anomaly Detection. However, the volume and complexity of data generated by the Internet of Things ecosystems make it difficult for humans to detect anomalies manually. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can automate anomaly detection in industrial machinery by analyzing generated data. Besides, each technique has specific strengths and weaknesses based on the data nature and its corresponding systems. However, the current systematic mapping studies on Anomaly Detection primarily focus on addressing network and cybersecurity-related problems, with limited attention given to the industrial sector. Additionally, these studies do not cover the challenges involved in using ML for Anomaly Detection in industrial machinery within the context of the IoT ecosystems. This paper presents a systematic mapping study on Anomaly Detection for industrial machinery using IoT devices and ML algorithms to address this gap. The study comprehensively evaluates 84 relevant studies spanning from 2016 to 2023, providing an extensive review of Anomaly Detection research. Our findings identify the most commonly used algorithms, preprocessing techniques, and sensor types. Additionally, this review identifies application areas and points to future challenges and research opportunities. ",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting has received a lot of attention with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) being one of the widely used models due to their ability to handle sequential data. Prior studies of RNNs for time series forecasting yield inconsistent results with limited insights as to why the performance varies for different datasets. In this paper, we provide an approach to link the characteristics of time series with the components of RNNs via the versatile metric of distance correlation. This metric allows us to examine the information flow through the RNN activation layers to be able to interpret and explain their performance. We empirically show that the RNN activation layers learn the lag structures of time series well. However, they gradually lose this information over a span of a few consecutive layers, thereby worsening the forecast quality for series with large lag structures. We also show that the activation layers cannot adequately model moving average and heteroskedastic time series processes. Last, we generate heatmaps for visual comparisons of the activation layers for different choices of the network hyperparameters to identify which of them affect the forecast performance. Our findings can, therefore, aid practitioners in assessing the effectiveness of RNNs for given time series data without actually training and evaluating the networks. ",

More importantly, it cannot be assumed that all users sample from the same underlying distribution.

In this work we propose a simple model of heterogeneous user data that allows user data to differ in both distribution and quantity of data, and provide a method for estimating the population-level mean while preserving user-level differential privacy. We demonstrate asymptotic optimality of our estimator and also prove general lower bounds on the error achievable in the setting we introduce. ",

Each objective has been independently studied in the literature with the aim of reducing utility loss in achieving them. Despite the significant interest attracted from both academia and industry, there remains an immediate demand for more in-depth research to unravel how these two objectives can be simultaneously integrated into ML models. As opposed to well-accepted trade-offs, i.e., privacy-utility and fairness-utility, the interrelation between privacy and fairness is not well-understood. While some works suggest a trade-off between the two objective functions, there are others that demonstrate the alignment of these functions in certain scenarios. To fill this research gap, we provide a thorough review of privacy and fairness in ML, including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. After examining and consolidating the literature on both objectives, we present a holistic survey on the impact of privacy on fairness, the impact of fairness on privacy, existing architectures, their interaction in application domains, and algorithms that aim to achieve both objectives while minimizing the utility sacrificed. Finally, we identify research challenges in achieving privacy and fairness concurrently in ML, particularly focusing on large language models. ",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants have achieved unprecedented success in image synthesis. However, well-trained GANs are under the threat of illegal steal or leakage. The prior studies on remote ownership verification assume a black-box setting where the defender can query the suspicious model with specific inputs, which we identify is not enough for generation tasks. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel IP protection scheme for GANs where ownership verification can be done by checking outputs only, without choosing the inputs (i.e., box-free setting). Specifically, we make use of the unexploited potential of the discriminator to learn a hypersphere that captures the unique distribution learned by the paired generator. Extensive evaluations on two popular GAN tasks and more than 10 GAN architectures demonstrate our proposed scheme to effectively verify the ownership. Our proposed scheme shown to be immune to popular input-based removal attacks and robust against other existing attacks.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged to allow multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models on their private data. However, training and deploying large models for broader applications is challenging in resource-constrained environments. Fortunately, Split Federated Learning (SFL) offers an excellent solution by alleviating the computation and communication burden on the clients SFL often assumes labeled data for local training on clients, however, it is not the case in practice.Prior works have adopted semi-supervised techniques for leveraging unlabeled data in FL, but data non-IIDness poses another challenge to ensure training efficiency. Herein, we propose Pseudo-Clustering Semi-SFL, a novel system for training models in scenarios where labeled data reside on the server. By introducing Clustering Regularization, model performance under data non-IIDness can be improved. Besides, our theoretical and experimental investigations into model convergence reveal that the inconsistent training processes on labeled and unlabeled data impact the effectiveness of clustering regularization. Upon this, we develop a control algorithm for global updating frequency adaptation, which dynamically adjusts the number of supervised training iterations to mitigate the training inconsistency. Extensive experiments on benchmark models and datasets show that our system provides a 3.3x speed-up in training time and reduces the communication cost by about 80.1% while reaching the target accuracy, and achieves up to 6.9% improvement in accuracy under non-IID scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art.

DoS attacks increase the service time on the communication network and cause additional transmission delays, which consequently increase the risk of rear-end collisions of vehicles in the platoon. To counter DoS attacks, we propose a resilient control scheme that exploits polytopic overapproximations of the closed-loop dynamics under DoS attacks. This scheme allows synthesizing robust controllers that guarantee tracking of both the desired spacing policy and spatially varying reference velocity for all space-varying DoS attacks satisfying a hard upper bound on the attack duration. In addition, L2 string stability conditions are derived to ensure that external perturbations do not grow as they propagate through the platoon, thus ensuring the string stability. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. ",

We present a solar flare prediction model, which is trained using hourly full-disk line-of-sight magnetogram images and employs a binary prediction mode to forecast $\\geq$M-class flares that may occur within the following 24-hour period. To address the class imbalance, we employ a fusion of data augmentation and class weighting techniques; and evaluate the overall performance of our model using the true skill statistic (TSS) and Heidke skill score (HSS). Moreover, we applied three attribution methods, namely Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, Integrated Gradients, and Deep Shapley Additive Explanations, to interpret and cross-validate our model's predictions with the explanations. Our analysis revealed that full-disk prediction of solar flares aligns with characteristics related to active regions (ARs). In particular, the key findings of this study are: (1) our deep learning models achieved an average TSS=0.51 and HSS=0.35, and the results further demonstrate a competent capability to predict near-limb solar flares and (2) the qualitative analysis of the model explanation indicates that our model identifies and uses features associated with ARs in central and near-limb locations from full-disk magnetograms to make corresponding predictions. In other words, our models learn the shape and texture-based characteristics of flaring ARs even at near-limb areas, which is a novel and critical capability with significant implications for operational forecasting.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks, (DNNs, a.k.a. NNs), have been widely used in various tasks and have been proven to be successful. However, the accompanied expensive computing and storage costs make the deployments in resource-constrained devices a significant concern. To solve this issue, quantization has emerged as an effective way to reduce the costs of DNNs with little accuracy degradation by quantizing floating-point numbers to low-width fixed-point representations. Quantized neural networks (QNNs) have been developed, with binarized neural networks (BNNs) restricted to binary values as a special case. Another concern about neural networks is their vulnerability and lack of interpretability. Despite the active research on trustworthy of DNNs, few approaches have been proposed to QNNs. To this end, this paper presents an automata-theoretic approach to synthesizing BNNs that meet designated properties. More specifically, we define a temporal logic, called BLTL, as the specification language. We show that each BLTL formula can be transformed into an automaton on finite words. To deal with the state-explosion problem, we provide a tableau-based approach in real implementation. For the synthesis procedure, we utilize SMT solvers to detect the existence of a model (i.e., a BNN) in the construction process. Notably, synthesis provides a way to determine the hyper-parameters of the network before training.Moreover, we experimentally evaluate our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the individual fairness and local robustness of BNNs while maintaining accuracy to a great extent.

Fixed infrastructures, typically deployed by national institutes or tech giants, often fall short in meeting the requirements of diverse personalized scenarios, e.g., forecasting in areas without any existing infrastructure. Consequently, smaller institutes or companies with limited budgets are compelled to seek tailored solutions by introducing more flexible infrastructures for data collection. In this paper, we propose an expandable graph attention network (EGAT) model, which digests data collected from existing and newly-added infrastructures, with different spatial structures.

    "abstract": "A major driver of AI products today is the fact that new skills emerge in language models when their parameter set and training corpora are scaled up. This phenomenon is poorly understood, and a mechanistic explanation via mathematical analysis of gradient-based training seems difficult. The current paper takes a different approach, analysing emergence using the famous (and empirical) Scaling Laws of LLMs and a simple statistical framework. Contributions include: (a) A statistical framework that relates cross-entropy loss of LLMs to competence on the basic skills that underlie language tasks. (b) Mathematical analysis showing that the Scaling Laws imply a strong form of inductive bias that allows the pre-trained model to learn very efficiently. We informally call this {\\em slingshot generalization} since naively viewed it appears to give competence levels at skills that violate usual generalization theory. (c) A key example of slingshot generalization, that competence at executing tasks involving $k$-tuples of skills emerges essentially at the same scaling and same rate as competence on the elementary skills themselves.

    "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) in enabling effective multi-robot collaboration, particularly in social dilemmas where robots face a trade-off between self-interests and collective benefits. However, environmental factors such as miscommunication and adversarial robots can impact cooperation, making it crucial to explore how multi-robot communication can be manipulated to achieve different outcomes. This paper presents a novel approach, namely PIMbot, to manipulating the reward function in multi-robot collaboration through two distinct forms of manipulation: policy and incentive manipulation. Our work introduces a new angle for manipulation in recent multi-agent RL social dilemmas that utilize a unique reward function for incentivization. By utilizing our proposed PIMbot mechanisms, a robot is able to manipulate the social dilemma environment effectively. PIMbot has the potential for both positive and negative impacts on the task outcome, where positive impacts lead to faster convergence to the global optimum and maximized rewards for any chosen robot. Conversely, negative impacts can have a detrimental effect on the overall task performance. We present comprehensive experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in the Gazebo-simulated multi-robot environment. Our work provides insights into how inter-robot communication can be manipulated and has implications for various robotic applications. %, including robotics, transportation, and manufacturing. ",

    "abstract": "In a decentralized machine learning system, data is typically partitioned among multiple devices or nodes, each of which trains a local model using its own data. These local models are then shared and combined to create a global model that can make accurate predictions on new data. In this paper, we start exploring the role of the network topology connecting nodes on the performance of a Machine Learning model trained through direct collaboration between nodes. We investigate how different types of topologies impact the \"spreading of knowledge\", i.e., the ability of nodes to incorporate in their local model the knowledge derived by learning patterns in data available in other nodes across the networks. Specifically, we highlight the different roles in this process of more or less connected nodes (hubs and leaves), as well as that of macroscopic network properties (primarily, degree distribution and modularity). Among others, we show that, while it is known that even weak connectivity among network components is sufficient for information spread, it may not be sufficient for knowledge spread. More intuitively, we also find that hubs have a more significant role than leaves in spreading knowledge, although this manifests itself not only for heavy-tailed distributions but also when \"hubs\" have only moderately more connections than leaves. Finally, we show that tightly knit communities severely hinder knowledge spread. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) encounter significant computational challenges when handling large-scale graphs, which severely restricts their efficacy across diverse applications. To address this limitation, graph condensation has emerged as a promising technique, which constructs a small synthetic graph for efficiently training GNNs while retaining performance. However, due to the topology structure among nodes, graph condensation is limited to condensing only the observed training nodes and their corresponding structure, thus lacking the ability to effectively handle the unseen data. Consequently, the original large graph is still required in the inference stage to perform message passing to inductive nodes, resulting in substantial computational demands. To overcome this issue, we propose mapping-aware graph condensation (MCond), explicitly learning the one-to-many node mapping from original nodes to synthetic nodes to seamlessly integrate new nodes into the synthetic graph for inductive representation learning. This enables direct information propagation on the synthetic graph, which is much more efficient than on the original large graph. Specifically, MCond employs an alternating optimization scheme with innovative loss terms from transductive and inductive perspectives, facilitating the mutual promotion between graph condensation and node mapping learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in inductive inference. On the Reddit dataset, MCond achieves up to 121.5x inference speedup and 55.9x reduction in storage requirements compared with counterparts based on the original graph. ",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security of federated learning systems. However, existing research primarily focuses on backdoor attacks and defenses within the generic FL scenario, where all clients collaborate to train a single global model. \\citet{qin2023revisiting} conduct the first study of backdoor attacks in the personalized federated learning (pFL) scenario, where each client constructs a personalized model based on its local data. Notably, the study demonstrates that pFL methods with partial model-sharing can significantly boost robustness against backdoor attacks. In this paper, we whistleblow that pFL methods with partial model-sharing are still vulnerable to backdoor attacks in the absence of any defense. We propose three backdoor attack methods: BapFL, BapFL+, and Gen-BapFL, and we empirically demonstrate that they can effectively attack the pFL methods. Specifically, the key principle of BapFL lies in maintaining clean local parameters while implanting the backdoor into the global parameters. BapFL+ generalizes the attack success to benign clients by introducing Gaussian noise to the local parameters. Furthermore, we assume the collaboration of malicious clients and propose Gen-BapFL, which leverages meta-learning techniques to further enhances attack generalization. We evaluate our proposed attack methods against two classic pFL methods with partial model-sharing, FedPer and LG-FedAvg. Extensive experiments on four FL benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack methods. Additionally, we assess the defense efficacy of various defense strategies against our proposed attacks and find that Gradient Norm-Clipping is particularly effective. It is crucial to note that pFL method is not always secure in the presence of backdoor attacks, and we hope to inspire further research on attack and defense in pFL scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Gait recognition is one of the most promising video-based biometric technologies. The edge of silhouettes and motion are the most informative feature and previous studies have explored them separately and achieved notable results. However, due to occlusions and variations in viewing angles, their gait recognition performance is often affected by the predefined spatial segmentation strategy. Moreover, traditional temporal pooling usually neglects distinctive temporal information in gait. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel gait recognition framework, denoted as GaitASMS, which can effectively extract the adaptive structured spatial representations and naturally aggregate the multi-scale temporal information. The Adaptive Structured Representation Extraction Module (ASRE) separates the edge of silhouettes by using the adaptive edge mask and maximizes the representation in semantic latent space. Moreover, the Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation Module (MSTA) achieves effective modeling of long-short-range temporal information by temporally aggregated structure. Furthermore, we propose a new data augmentation, denoted random mask, to enrich the sample space of long-term occlusion and enhance the generalization of the model. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate the competitive advantage of proposed method, especially in complex scenes, i.e. BG and CL. On the CASIA-B dataset, GaitASMS achieves the average accuracy of 93.5\\% and outperforms the baseline on rank-1 accuracies by 3.4\\% and 6.3\\%, respectively, in BG and CL.

However, existing self-supervised methods have limited effectiveness on heterophilic graphs, due to the homophily assumption that results in similar node representations for connected nodes. In this work, we propose a multi-view contrastive learning model for heterophilic graphs, namely, MUSE. Specifically, we construct two views to capture the information of the ego node and its neighborhood by GNNs enhanced with contrastive learning, respectively. Then we integrate the information from these two views to fuse the node representations. Fusion contrast is utilized to enhance the effectiveness of fused node representations. Further, considering that the influence of neighboring contextual information on information fusion may vary across different ego nodes, we employ an information fusion controller to model the diversity of node-neighborhood similarity at both the local and global levels. Finally, an alternating training scheme is adopted to ensure that unsupervised node representation learning and information fusion controller can mutually reinforce each other. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of MUSE on 9 benchmark datasets. Our results show the effectiveness of MUSE on both node classification and clustering tasks. ",

To alleviate this issue, semi-supervised and self-supervised approaches have been proposed, but they are limited by the reliance on detection models or conventional ResNet backbones. In this paper, inspired by the rapid progress of Masked Image Modeling (MIM) in visual classification tasks, we propose a novel self-supervised pre-training strategy for regressing 3D hand mesh parameters. Our approach involves a unified and multi-granularity strategy that includes a pseudo keypoint alignment module in the teacher-student framework for learning pose-aware semantic class tokens. For patch tokens with detailed locality, we adopt a self-distillation manner between teacher and student network based on MIM pre-training. To better fit low-level regression tasks, we incorporate pixel reconstruction tasks for multi-level representation learning. Additionally, we design a strong pose estimation baseline using a simple vanilla vision Transformer (ViT) as the backbone and attach a PyMAF head after tokens for regression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach, named HandMIM, achieves strong performance on various hand mesh estimation tasks. Notably, HandMIM outperforms specially optimized architectures, achieving 6.29mm and 8.00mm PAVPE (Vertex-Point-Error) on challenging FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 test sets, respectively, establishing new state-of-the-art records on 3D hand mesh estimation.

By naturally modeling the skeleton structure of the human body as a graph, GCNs are able to capture the spatial relationships between joints and learn an efficient representation of the underlying pose. However, most GCN-based methods use a shared weight matrix, making it challenging to accurately capture the different and complex relationships between joints. In this paper, we introduce an iterative graph filtering framework for 3D human pose estimation, which aims to predict the 3D joint positions given a set of 2D joint locations in images. Our approach builds upon the idea of iteratively solving graph filtering with Laplacian regularization via the Gauss-Seidel iterative method. Motivated by this iterative solution, we design a Gauss-Seidel network (GS-Net) architecture, which makes use of weight and adjacency modulation, skip connection, and a pure convolutional block with layer normalization. Adjacency modulation facilitates the learning of edges that go beyond the inherent connections of body joints, resulting in an adjusted graph structure that reflects the human skeleton, while skip connections help maintain crucial information from the input layer's initial features as the network depth increases. We evaluate our proposed model on two standard benchmark datasets, and compare it with a comprehensive set of strong baseline methods for 3D human pose estimation. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline methods on both datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to analyze the contributions of different components of our model architecture and show that the skip connection and adjacency modulation help improve the model performance.

A system-optimal multimodal transit network is designed with minimum total door-to-door generalized costs of users and operators, while satisfying existing transit origin-destination demand within a pre-set infrastructure budget. Firstly, the geography, demand, and modes in each clustered zone are characterized with continuous approximation. Afterward, the decisions of network link investment and multimodal path flows in zonal connection optimization are formulated as a minimum-cost multi-commodity network flow (MCNF) problem and solved efficiently with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solver. Subsequently, the route generation problem is solved by expanding the MCNF formulation to minimize intramodal transfers. To demonstrate the framework efficiency, this study uses transit demand from the Chicago metropolitan area to redesign a multimodal transit network. The computational results present savings in travelers' journey time and operators' costs, demonstrating the potential benefits of collaboration between multimodal transit systems and SAMS. ",

Social data, e.g., tweets, is characterized by misspellings, incompleteness, ambiguity, and irregular language, as well as variation in aspects of opinions. Moreover, learning the evolving characteristics of the events utilizing limited contextual knowledge is almost infeasible for machine learning models. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework that exploits the lexical, semantic, and contextual representations of streaming social data. In particular, we leverage contextual knowledge to detect semantically related tweets in their earliest emergence and enhance the quality of produced clusters.

This customization is achieved by ``hardcoding'' additional constraints into NNR's architecture and/or training objectives: any change in the desired recommendation behavior thus requires the model to be retrained with a modified objective, impeding wide adoption of multi-aspect news recommenders. In this work, we introduce MANNeR, a modular framework for flexible multi-aspect (neural) news recommendation that supports ad-hoc customization over individual aspects at inference time. With metric-based learning at its core, MANNeR obtains aspect-specialized news encoders and then flexibly combines aspect-specific similarity scores for final ranking. Evaluation on two standard news recommendation benchmarks (one in English, one in Norwegian) shows that MANNeR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NNRs on both standard content-based recommendation and single- and multi-aspect customization. Moreover, with MANNeR we can trivially scale the importance and find the optimal trade-off between content-based recommendation performance and aspect-based diversity of recommendations.

In this work, we solidify the idea of representing adversarial attacks as a trainable function, without further gradient computation. We first motivate that the theoretical best attacks, under proper conditions, can be represented as smooth piece-wise functions (piece-wise H\\\"older functions). Then we obtain an approximation result of such functions by a neural network. Subsequently, we emulate the ideal attack process by a neural network and reduce the adversarial training to a mathematical game between an attack network and a training model (a defense network).

    "abstract": "Predicting human motion plays a crucial role in ensuring a safe and effective human-robot close collaboration in intelligent remanufacturing systems of the future. Existing works can be categorized into two groups: those focusing on accuracy, predicting a single future motion, and those generating diverse predictions based on observations. The former group fails to address the uncertainty and multi-modal nature of human motion, while the latter group often produces motion sequences that deviate too far from the ground truth or become unrealistic within historical contexts. To tackle these issues, we propose TransFusion, an innovative and practical diffusion-based model for 3D human motion prediction which can generate samples that are more likely to happen while maintaining a certain level of diversity. Our model leverages Transformer as the backbone with long skip connections between shallow and deep layers. Additionally, we employ the discrete cosine transform to model motion sequences in the frequency space, thereby improving performance. In contrast to prior diffusion-based models that utilize extra modules like cross-attention and adaptive layer normalization to condition the prediction on past observed motion, we treat all inputs, including conditions, as tokens to create a more lightweight model compared to existing approaches. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of our human motion prediction model. ",

An orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) system has been proposed and can effectively solve this problem. However, the pilot overhead and multiuser multiplexing overhead of the OTFS are relatively high. Therefore, a new modulation technology based on the discrete affine Fourier transform was proposed recently to address the above issues in OTFS, referred to the affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). The AFDM attains full diversity due to parameter adjustment according to the delay-Doppler profile of the channel and can achieve performance similar to the OTFS. Due to the limited research on the detection of AFDM currently, we propose a low-complexity yet efficient message passing (MP) algorithm for joint interference cancellation and detection, which takes advantage of the inherent channel sparsity. According to simulation results, the MP detection performs better than the minimum mean square error and maximal ratio combining detection. ",

While DuNets have been successfully applied to many linear inverse problems, nonlinear problems tend to impair the performance of the method. Inspired by momentum acceleration techniques that are often used in optimization algorithms, we propose a recurrent momentum acceleration (RMA) framework that uses a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) to simulate the momentum acceleration process. The RMA module leverages the ability of the LSTM-RNN to learn and retain knowledge from the previous gradients. We apply RMA to two popular DuNets -- the learned proximal gradient descent (LPGD) and the learned primal-dual (LPD) methods, resulting in LPGD-RMA and LPD-RMA respectively. We provide experimental results on two nonlinear inverse problems: a nonlinear deconvolution problem, and an electrical impedance tomography problem with limited boundary measurements. In the first experiment we have observed that the improvement due to RMA largely increases with respect to the nonlinearity of the problem. The results of the second example further demonstrate that the RMA schemes can significantly improve the performance of DuNets in strongly ill-posed problems. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal fusion has shown initial promising results for object detection of autonomous driving perception. However, many existing fusion schemes do not consider the quality of each fusion input and may suffer from adverse conditions on one or more sensors. While predictive uncertainty has been applied to characterize single-modal object detection performance at run time, incorporating uncertainties into the multi-modal fusion still lacks effective solutions due primarily to the uncertainty's cross-modal incomparability and distinct sensitivities to various adverse conditions. To fill this gap, this paper proposes Uncertainty-Encoded Mixture-of-Experts (UMoE) that explicitly incorporates single-modal uncertainties into LiDAR-camera fusion. UMoE uses individual expert network to process each sensor's detection result together with encoded uncertainty. Then, the expert networks' outputs are analyzed by a gating network to determine the fusion weights. The proposed UMoE module can be integrated into any proposal fusion pipeline. Evaluation shows that UMoE achieves a maximum of 10.67%, 3.17%, and 5.40% performance gain compared with the state-of-the-art proposal-level multi-modal object detectors under extreme weather, adversarial, and blinding attack scenarios.

In such systems, the massive memory requests from throughput-oriented accelerators significantly interfere with CPU memory requests.

In this paper, we demonstrate that parallel memory write requests of the iGPU and more specifically, the management policy of the write buffer in the memory controller (MC) can lead to significantly stalling CPU memory read requests in heterogeneous SoCs. We characterize the slowdown on the shared read and write buffers in the memory controller and exploit it to build a cross-processor covert channel in Intel-based integrated CPU-GPU systems.

Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated their strengths, but there are still drawbacks. Supervised learning methods have achieved high-quality results but may require further efforts to acquire 3D ground-truth labels. The existing self-supervised method requires pretraining using synthetic images with 3D supervision. This study aims to realize stable self-supervised learning of elevation angle estimation without pretraining using synthetic images. Failures during self-supervised learning may be caused by motion degeneracy problems. We first analyze the motion field of 2D forward-looking sonar, which is related to the main supervision signal. We utilize a modern learning framework and prove that if the training dataset is built with effective motions, the network can be trained in a self-supervised manner without the knowledge of synthetic data.

Recent emerging data-driven techniques greatly relieve human reliance by automatic modeling from simulation data. However, model discrepancy may occur due to unmodeled parasitics, deficient thermal and magnetic models, unpredictable ambient conditions, etc. These inaccurate data-driven models based on pure simulation cannot represent the practical performance in physical world, hindering their applications in power converter modeling. To alleviate model discrepancy and improve accuracy in practice, this paper proposes a novel data-driven modeling with experimental augmentation (D2EA), leveraging both simulation data and experimental data. In D2EA, simulation data aims to establish basic functional landscape, and experimental data focuses on matching actual performance in real world. The D2EA approach is instantiated for the efficiency optimization of a hybrid modulation for neutral-point-clamped dual-active-bridge (NPC-DAB) converter. The proposed D2EA approach realizes 99.92% efficiency modeling accuracy, and its feasibility is comprehensively validated in 2-kW hardware experiments, where the peak efficiency of 98.45% is attained. Overall, D2EA is data-light and can achieve highly accurate and highly practical data-driven models in one shot, and it is scalable to other applications, effortlessly. ",

State-of-the-art QA algorithms based on DNNs were successfully employed in various domains. However, QA in the genealogical domain is still underexplored, while researchers in this field (and other fields in humanities and social sciences) can highly benefit from the ability to ask questions in natural language, receive concrete answers and gain insights hidden within large corpora. While some research has been recently conducted for factual QA in the genealogical domain, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous research on the more challenging task of numerical aggregation QA (i.e., answering questions combining aggregation functions, e.g., count, average, max). Numerical aggregation QA is critical for distant reading and analysis for researchers (and the general public) interested in investigating cultural heritage domains. Therefore, in this study, we present a new end-to-end methodology for numerical aggregation QA for genealogical trees that includes: 1) an automatic method for training dataset generation; 2) a transformer-based table selection method, and 3) an optimized transformer-based numerical aggregation QA model. The findings indicate that the proposed architecture, GLOBE, outperforms the state-of-the-art models and pipelines by achieving 87% accuracy for this task compared to only 21% by current state-of-the-art models.

Though robustness is getting important in MARL deployment, little prior work has studied state uncertainties in MARL, neither in problem formulation nor algorithm design. Motivated by this robustness issue and the lack of corresponding studies, we study the problem of MARL with state uncertainty in this work. We provide the first attempt to the theoretical and empirical analysis of this challenging problem. We first model the problem as a Markov Game with state perturbation adversaries (MG-SPA) by introducing a set of state perturbation adversaries into a Markov Game. We then introduce robust equilibrium (RE) as the solution concept of an MG-SPA. We conduct a fundamental analysis regarding MG-SPA such as giving conditions under which such a robust equilibrium exists. Then we propose a robust multi-agent Q-learning (RMAQ) algorithm to find such an equilibrium, with convergence guarantees. To handle high-dimensional state-action space, we design a robust multi-agent actor-critic (RMAAC) algorithm based on an analytical expression of the policy gradient derived in the paper. Our experiments show that the proposed RMAQ algorithm converges to the optimal value function; our RMAAC algorithm outperforms several MARL and robust MARL methods in multiple multi-agent environments when state uncertainty is present.

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, large archives of paper-based historical documents, such as books and newspapers, have been digitized using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Unfortunately, this broadly used technology is error-prone, especially when an OCRed document was written hundreds of years ago. Neural networks have shown great success in solving various text processing tasks, including OCR post-correction. The main disadvantage of using neural networks for historical corpora is the lack of sufficiently large training datasets they require to learn from, especially for morphologically-rich languages like Hebrew. Moreover, it is not clear what are the optimal structure and values of hyperparameters (predefined parameters) of neural networks for OCR error correction in Hebrew due to its unique features. Furthermore, languages change across genres and periods. These changes may affect the accuracy of OCR post-correction neural network models. To overcome these challenges, we developed a new multi-phase method for generating artificial training datasets with OCR errors and hyperparameters optimization for building an effective neural network for OCR post-correction in Hebrew.

    "title": "Question Answering with Deep Neural Networks for Semi-Structured  Heterogeneous Genealogical Knowledge Graphs",
    "abstract": "With the rising popularity of user-generated genealogical family trees, new genealogical information systems have been developed. State-of-the-art natural question answering algorithms use deep neural network (DNN) architecture based on self-attention networks. However, some of these models use sequence-based inputs and are not suitable to work with graph-based structure, while graph-based DNN models rely on high levels of comprehensiveness of knowledge graphs that is nonexistent in the genealogical domain. Moreover, these supervised DNN models require training datasets that are absent in the genealogical domain. This study proposes an end-to-end approach for question answering using genealogical family trees by: 1) representing genealogical data as knowledge graphs, 2) converting them to texts, 3) combining them with unstructured texts, and 4) training a trans-former-based question answering model. To evaluate the need for a dedicated approach, a comparison between the fine-tuned model (Uncle-BERT) trained on the auto-generated genealogical dataset and state-of-the-art question-answering models was per-formed. The findings indicate that there are significant differences between answering genealogical questions and open-domain questions. Moreover, the proposed methodology reduces complexity while increasing accuracy and may have practical implications for genealogical research and real-world projects, making genealogical data accessible to experts as well as the general public.

In recent years, deep neural networks (DNN) dominate the field of automatic text analysis and natural language processing (NLP), in some cases presenting a super-human performance. DNNs are the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms solving many NLP tasks that are relevant for Digital Humanities (DH) research, such as spell checking, language detection, entity extraction, author detection, question answering, and other tasks. These supervised algorithms learn patterns from a large number of \"right\" and \"wrong\" examples and apply them to new examples. However, using DNNs for analyzing the text resources in DH research presents two main challenges: (un)availability of training data and a need for domain adaptation. This paper explores these challenges by analyzing multiple use-cases of DH studies in recent literature and their possible solutions and lays out a practical decision model for DH experts for when and how to choose the appropriate deep learning approaches for their research. Moreover, in this paper, we aim to raise awareness of the benefits of utilizing deep learning models in the DH community. ",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, large archives of paper-based documents such as books and newspapers have been digitized using Optical Character Recognition. This technology is error-prone, especially for historical documents. To correct OCR errors, post-processing algorithms have been proposed based on natural language analysis and machine learning techniques such as neural networks. Neural network's disadvantage is the vast amount of manually labeled data required for training, which is often unavailable. This paper proposes an innovative method for training a light-weight neural network for Hebrew OCR post-correction using significantly less manually created data. The main research goal is to develop a method for automatically generating language and task-specific training data to improve the neural network results for OCR post-correction, and to investigate which type of dataset is the most effective for OCR post-correction of historical documents. To this end, a series of experiments using several datasets was conducted. The evaluation corpus was based on Hebrew newspapers from the JPress project. An analysis of historical OCRed newspapers was done to learn common language and corpus-specific OCR errors. We found that training the network using the proposed method is more effective than using randomly generated errors. The results also show that the performance of the neural network for OCR post-correction strongly depends on the genre and area of the training data. Moreover, neural networks that were trained with the proposed method outperform other state-of-the-art neural networks for OCR post-correction and complex spellcheckers. These results may have practical implications for many digital humanities projects. ",

However, accurate segmentation of medical images is challenging due to several factors, such as the lack of high-quality annotation, imaging noise, and anatomical differences across patients. In addition, there is still a considerable gap in performance between the existing label-efficient methods and fully-supervised methods. To address the above challenges, we propose ScribbleVC, a novel framework for scribble-supervised medical image segmentation that leverages vision and class embeddings via the multimodal information enhancement mechanism. In addition, ScribbleVC uniformly utilizes the CNN features and Transformer features to achieve better visual feature extraction. The proposed method combines a scribble-based approach with a segmentation network and a class-embedding module to produce accurate segmentation masks. We evaluate ScribbleVC on three benchmark datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. The datasets and code are released on GitHub. ",

    "abstract": "Electric autonomous vehicles (EAVs) are getting attention in future autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems due to their economic and societal benefits. However, EAVs' unique charging patterns (long charging time, high charging frequency, unpredictable charging behaviors, etc.) make it challenging to accurately predict the EAVs supply in E-AMoD systems. Furthermore, the mobility demand's prediction uncertainty makes it an urgent and challenging task to design an integrated vehicle balancing solution under supply and demand uncertainties. Despite the success of reinforcement learning-based E-AMoD balancing algorithms, state uncertainties under the EV supply or mobility demand remain unexplored. In this work, we design a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based framework for EAVs balancing in E-AMoD systems, with adversarial agents to model both the EAVs supply and mobility demand uncertainties that may undermine the vehicle balancing solutions. We then propose a robust E-AMoD Balancing MARL (REBAMA) algorithm to train a robust EAVs balancing policy to balance both the supply-demand ratio and charging utilization rate across the whole city. Experiments show that our proposed robust method performs better compared with a non-robust MARL method that does not consider state uncertainties; it improves the reward, charging utilization fairness, and supply-demand fairness by 19.28%, 28.18%, and 3.97%, respectively. Compared with a robust optimization-based method, the proposed MARL algorithm can improve the reward, charging utilization fairness, and supply-demand fairness by 8.21%, 8.29%, and 9.42%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Pick-up and Delivery Route Prediction (PDRP), which aims to estimate the future service route of a worker given his current task pool, has received rising attention in recent years. Deep neural networks based on supervised learning have emerged as the dominant model for the task because of their powerful ability to capture workers' behavior patterns from massive historical data. Though promising, they fail to introduce the non-differentiable test criteria into the training process, leading to a mismatch in training and test criteria. Which considerably trims down their performance when applied in practical systems. To tackle the above issue, we present the first attempt to generalize Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the route prediction task, leading to a novel RL-based framework called DRL4Route. It combines the behavior-learning abilities of previous deep learning models with the non-differentiable objective optimization ability of reinforcement learning. DRL4Route can serve as a plug-and-play component to boost the existing deep learning models. Based on the framework, we further implement a model named DRL4Route-GAE for PDRP in logistic service. It follows the actor-critic architecture which is equipped with a Generalized Advantage Estimator that can balance the bias and variance of the policy gradient estimates, thus achieving a more optimal policy. Extensive offline experiments and the online deployment show that DRL4Route-GAE improves Location Square Deviation (LSD) by 0.9%-2.7%, and Accuracy@3 (ACC@3) by 2.4%-3.2% over existing methods on the real-world dataset.

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation typically necessitates a large and precisely annotated dataset. However, obtaining pixel-wise annotation is a labor-intensive task that requires significant effort from domain experts, making it challenging to obtain in practical clinical scenarios. In such situations, reducing the amount of annotation required is a more practical approach. One feasible direction is sparse annotation, which involves annotating only a few slices, and has several advantages over traditional weak annotation methods such as bounding boxes and scribbles, as it preserves exact boundaries. However, learning from sparse annotation is challenging due to the scarcity of supervision signals. To address this issue, we propose a framework that can robustly learn from sparse annotation using the cross-teaching of both 3D and 2D networks. Considering the characteristic of these networks, we develop two pseudo label selection strategies, which are hard-soft confidence threshold and consistent label fusion. Our experimental results on the MMWHS dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) semi-supervised segmentation methods. Moreover, our approach achieves results that are comparable to the fully-supervised upper bound result. ",

With these problems, comes the challenge of mitigating and responding to the aftereffects of disposal or the lack of proper disposal which leads to waste concentrating in locations and disturbing ecosystems for both plants and animals. As plastic debris levels continue to rise with the accumulation of waste in garbage patches in landfills and more hazardously in natural water bodies, swift action is necessary to plug or cease this flow. While manual sorting operations and detection can offer a solution, they can be augmented using highly advanced computer imagery linked with robotic appendages for removing wastes. The primary application of focus in this report are the much-discussed Computer Vision and Open Vision which have gained novelty for their light dependence on internet and ability to relay information in remote areas. These applications can be applied to the creation of edge-based mobility devices that can as a counter to the growing problem of plastic debris in oceans and rivers, demanding little connectivity and still offering the same results with reasonably timed maintenance. The principal findings of this project cover the various methods that were tested and deployed to detect waste in images, as well as comparing them against different waste types. The project has been able to produce workable models that can perform on time detection of sampled images using an augmented CNN approach. Latter portions of the project have also achieved a better interpretation of the necessary preprocessing steps required to arrive at the best accuracies, including the best hardware for expanding waste detection studies to larger environments.

In multiple fields ranging from image processing to natural language processing, self-supervised learning (SSL) from large amounts of unannotated data produces very effective representations for downstream tasks. However, there has only been limited use of SSL to learn effective representations of gait and movement, and it has not been applied to gait analysis with MMC. One SSL objective that has not been applied to gait is contrastive learning, which finds representations that place similar samples closer together in the learned space. If the learned similarity metric captures clinically meaningful differences, this could produce a useful representation for many downstream clinical tasks. Contrastive learning can also be combined with causal masking to predict future timesteps, which is an appealing SSL objective given the dynamical nature of gait. We applied these techniques to gait analyses performed with MMC in a rehabilitation hospital from a diverse clinical population. We find that contrastive learning on unannotated gait data learns a representation that captures clinically meaningful information. We probe this learned representation using the framework of biomarkers and show it holds promise as both a diagnostic and response biomarker, by showing it can accurately classify diagnosis from gait and is responsive to inpatient therapy, respectively. We ultimately hope these learned representations will enable predictive and prognostic gait-based biomarkers that can facilitate precision rehabilitation through greater use of MMC to quantify movement in rehabilitation.

Stateful defenses have emerged as an effective countermeasure, detecting potential attacks by maintaining a buffer of recent queries and detecting new queries that are too similar. However, these defenses fundamentally pose a trade-off between attack detection and false positive rates, and this trade-off is typically optimized by hand-picking feature extractors and similarity thresholds that empirically work well. There is little current understanding as to the formal limits of this trade-off and the exact properties of the feature extractors/underlying problem domain that influence it. This work aims to address this gap by offering a theoretical characterization of the trade-off between detection and false positive rates for stateful defenses. We provide upper bounds for detection rates of a general class of feature extractors and analyze the impact of this trade-off on the convergence of black-box attacks.

Given a testing example and a trained classifier, CP produces a prediction set of candidate labels with a user-specified coverage (i.e., true class label is contained with high probability). Almost all the existing work on CP assumes clean testing data and there is not much known about the robustness of CP algorithms w.r.t natural/adversarial perturbations to testing examples. This paper studies the problem of probabilistically robust conformal prediction (PRCP) which ensures robustness to most perturbations around clean input examples. PRCP generalizes the standard CP (cannot handle perturbations) and adversarially robust CP (ensures robustness w.r.t worst-case perturbations) to achieve better trade-offs between nominal performance and robustness. We propose a novel adaptive PRCP (aPRCP) algorithm to achieve probabilistically robust coverage. The key idea behind aPRCP is to determine two parallel thresholds, one for data samples and another one for the perturbations on data (aka \"quantile-of-quantile\" design). We provide theoretical analysis to show that aPRCP algorithm achieves robust coverage. Our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets using deep neural networks demonstrate that aPRCP achieves better trade-offs than state-of-the-art CP and adversarially robust CP algorithms.

    "title": "Benchmarking and Analyzing Robust Point Cloud Recognition: Bag of Tricks  for Defending Adversarial Examples",
    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud recognition are vulnerable to adversarial examples, threatening their practical deployment. Despite the many research endeavors have been made to tackle this issue in recent years, the diversity of adversarial examples on 3D point clouds makes them more challenging to defend against than those on 2D images. For examples, attackers can generate adversarial examples by adding, shifting, or removing points. Consequently, existing defense strategies are hard to counter unseen point cloud adversarial examples. In this paper, we first establish a comprehensive, and rigorous point cloud adversarial robustness benchmark to evaluate adversarial robustness, which can provide a detailed understanding of the effects of the defense and attack methods. We then collect existing defense tricks in point cloud adversarial defenses and then perform extensive and systematic experiments to identify an effective combination of these tricks. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid training augmentation methods that consider various types of point cloud adversarial examples to adversarial training, significantly improving the adversarial robustness. By combining these tricks, we construct a more robust defense framework achieving an average accuracy of 83.45\\% against various attacks, demonstrating its capability to enabling robust learners.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in the field of bearing fault diagnosis. However, this success comes with larger models and more complex computations, which cannot be transferred into industrial fields requiring models to be of high speed, strong portability, and low power consumption. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and deployable model for bearing fault diagnosis, referred to as BearingPGA-Net, to address these challenges. Firstly, aided by a well-trained large model, we train BearingPGA-Net via decoupled knowledge distillation. Despite its small size, our model demonstrates excellent fault diagnosis performance compared to other lightweight state-of-the-art methods. Secondly, we design an FPGA acceleration scheme for BearingPGA-Net using Verilog. This scheme involves the customized quantization and designing programmable logic gates for each layer of BearingPGA-Net on the FPGA, with an emphasis on parallel computing and module reuse to enhance the computational speed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of deploying a CNN-based bearing fault diagnosis model on an FPGA. Experimental results reveal that our deployment scheme achieves over 200 times faster diagnosis speed compared to CPU, while achieving a lower-than-0.4\\% performance drop in terms of F1, Recall, and Precision score on our independently-collected bearing dataset.

    "abstract": "With their remarkable ability to generate code, large language models (LLMs) are a transformative technology for computing education practice. They have created an urgent need for educators to rethink pedagogical approaches and teaching strategies for newly emerging skill sets. Traditional approaches to learning programming have focused on frequent and repeated practice at writing code. The ease with which code can now be generated has resulted in a shift in focus towards reading, understanding and evaluating LLM-generated code. In parallel with this shift, a new essential skill is emerging -- the ability to construct good prompts for code-generating models. This paper introduces a novel pedagogical concept known as a `Prompt Problem', designed to help students learn how to craft effective prompts for LLMs. A Prompt Problem challenges a student to create a natural language prompt that leads an LLM to produce the correct code for a specific problem. To support the delivery of Prompt Problems at scale, in this paper we also present a novel tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and automates the evaluation of prompt-generated code. We report empirical findings from a field study in which Promptly was deployed in a first-year Python programming course (n=54). We explore student interactions with the tool and their perceptions of the Prompt Problem concept. We found that Promptly was largely well-received by students for its ability to engage their computational thinking skills and expose them to new programming constructs. We also discuss avenues for future work, including variations on the design of Prompt Problems and the need to study their integration into the curriculum and teaching practice. ",

We name these architectures as \"bridge-architectures\" as they project from the image space to the text space. These models deviate from the traditional recipe of training transformer based multi-modal models, which involve using large-scale pre-training and complex multi-modal interactions through co or cross attention. However, the capabilities of bridge architectures have not been tested on complex visual reasoning tasks which require fine grained analysis about the image. In this project, we investigate the performance of these bridge-architectures on the NLVR2 dataset, and compare it to state-of-the-art transformer based architectures. We first extend the traditional bridge architectures for the NLVR2 dataset, by adding object level features to faciliate fine-grained object reasoning. Our analysis shows that adding object level features to bridge architectures does not help, and that pre-training on multi-modal data is key for good performance on complex reasoning tasks such as NLVR2. We also demonstrate some initial results on a recently bridge-architecture, LLaVA, in the zero shot setting and analyze its performance. ",

Existing work has shown that neural sub-word segmenters are better than Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), however, they are inefficient as they require parallel corpora, days to train and hours to decode. This paper introduces SelfSeg, a self-supervised neural sub-word segmentation method that is much faster to train/decode and requires only monolingual dictionaries instead of parallel corpora. SelfSeg takes as input a word in the form of a partially masked character sequence, optimizes the word generation probability and generates the segmentation with the maximum posterior probability, which is calculated using a dynamic programming algorithm. The training time of SelfSeg depends on word frequencies, and we explore several word frequency normalization strategies to accelerate the training phase. Additionally, we propose a regularization mechanism that allows the segmenter to generate various segmentations for one word. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct MT experiments in low-, middle- and high-resource scenarios, where we compare the performance of using different segmentation methods. The experimental results demonstrate that on the low-resource ALT dataset, our method achieves more than 1.2 BLEU score improvement compared with BPE and SentencePiece, and a 1.1 score improvement over Dynamic Programming Encoding (DPE) and Vocabulary Learning via Optimal Transport (VOLT) on average. The regularization method achieves approximately a 4.3 BLEU score improvement over BPE and a 1.2 BLEU score improvement over BPE-dropout, the regularized version of BPE. We also observed significant improvements on IWSLT15 Vi->En, WMT16 Ro->En and WMT15 Fi->En datasets, and competitive results on the WMT14 De->En and WMT14 Fr->En datasets. ",

Since the satellite network is optimized regarding the intensities of the base stations (BSs) and the users, it can control the terrestrial traffic. Numerical results show that an appropriate number of LEO satellites overcomes the limited coverage in a region with low intensity of the BSs and also the traffic congestion by controlling the traffic in a region that the intensity of the users increases.

Due to large-scale datasets, most existing methods use a network pretrained in other datasets to extract features, which are not suitable enough for WTAL. To address this problem, researchers design several modules for feature enhancement, which improve the performance of the localization module, especially modeling the temporal relationship between snippets. However, all of them neglect the adverse effects of ambiguous information, which would reduce the discriminability of others. Considering this phenomenon, we propose Discriminability-Driven Graph Network (DDG-Net), which explicitly models ambiguous snippets and discriminative snippets with well-designed connections, preventing the transmission of ambiguous information and enhancing the discriminability of snippet-level representations. Additionally, we propose feature consistency loss to prevent the assimilation of features and drive the graph convolution network to generate more discriminative representations.

However, previous works including CNN-based and Transformer-based approaches fail to exploit the nonstructural data, such as topology and correlation in fingerprints, which is essential to facilitate the identifiability and robustness of embedding. To address this challenge, we propose a novel paradigm for fingerprint embedding, called Minutiae Relation-Aware model over Graph Neural Network (MRA-GNN). Our proposed approach incorporates a GNN-based framework in fingerprint embedding to encode the topology and correlation of fingerprints into descriptive features, achieving fingerprint representation in the form of graph embedding. Specifically, we reinterpret fingerprint data and their relative connections as vertices and edges respectively, and introduce a minutia graph and fingerprint graph to represent the topological relations and correlation structures of fingerprints. We equip MRA-GNN with a Topological relation Reasoning Module (TRM) and Correlation-Aware Module (CAM) to learn the fingerprint embedding from these graphs successfully. To tackle the over-smoothing problem in GNN models, we incorporate Feed-Forward Module and graph residual connections into proposed modules. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various fingerprint datasets, indicating the effectiveness of our approach in exploiting nonstructural information of fingerprints.

Further, the paper covers the primary ingredients of causal inference namely, statistical methods such as Bayesian Causal Network, Granger Causality and jargon used thereof such as counterfactuals. The review also recommends some important directions for future research.

Nonetheless, securing an optimal head CT scan without deviation is challenging in clinical settings, owing to poor positioning by technicians, patient's physical constraints, or CT scanner tilt angle restrictions. Manual formatting and reconstruction not only introduce subjectivity but also strain time and labor resources. To address these issues, we propose an efficient automatic head CT images 3D reconstruction method, improving accuracy and repeatability, as well as diminishing manual intervention. Our approach employs a deep learning-based object detection algorithm, identifying and evaluating orbitomeatal line landmarks to automatically reformat the images prior to reconstruction. Given the dearth of existing evaluations of object detection algorithms in the context of head CT images, we compared ten methods from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. By exploring their precision, efficiency, and robustness, we singled out the lightweight YOLOv8 as the aptest algorithm for our task, with an mAP of 92.91% and impressive robustness against class imbalance. Our qualitative evaluation of standardized reconstruction results demonstrates the clinical practicability and validity of our method. ",

    "abstract": "Taxonomy building is a task that requires interpreting and classifying data within a given frame of reference, which comes to play in many areas of application that deal with knowledge and information organization. In this paper, we explore how taxonomy building can be supported with systems that integrate machine learning (ML). However, relying only on black-boxed ML-based systems to automate taxonomy building would sideline the users' expertise. We propose an approach that allows the user to iteratively take into account multiple model's outputs as part of their sensemaking process. We implemented our approach in two real-world use cases. The work is positioned in the context of HCI research that investigates the design of ML-based systems with an emphasis on enabling human-AI collaboration. ",

    "abstract": "The rise in popularity of text-to-image generative artificial intelligence (AI) has attracted widespread public interest. At the same time, backdoor attacks are well-known in machine learning literature for their effective manipulation of neural models, which is a growing concern among practitioners. We highlight this threat for generative AI by introducing a Backdoor Attack on text-to-image Generative Models (BAGM). Our attack targets various stages of the text-to-image generative pipeline, modifying the behaviour of the embedded tokenizer and the pre-trained language and visual neural networks. Based on the penetration level, BAGM takes the form of a suite of attacks that are referred to as surface, shallow and deep attacks in this article. We compare the performance of BAGM to recently emerging related methods. We also contribute a set of quantitative metrics for assessing the performance of backdoor attacks on generative AI models in the future. The efficacy of the proposed framework is established by targeting the state-of-the-art stable diffusion pipeline in a digital marketing scenario as the target domain. To that end, we also contribute a Marketable Foods dataset of branded product images. We hope this work contributes towards exposing the contemporary generative AI security challenges and fosters discussions on preemptive efforts for addressing those challenges.

In disaster management scenarios, UAV-based networks provide on-demand wireless connectivity when traditional infrastructures fail. In obstacle-rich environments like urban areas, reliable high-capacity communications links depend on Line-of-Sight (LoS) availability, especially at higher frequencies. Positioning UAVs to consider obstacles and enable LoS communications represents a promising solution that requires further exploration and development. The main contribution of this paper is the Traffic- and Obstacle-aware UAV Positioning Algorithm (TOPA). TOPA takes into account the users' traffic demand and the need for LoS between the UAV and the ground users in the presence of obstacles. The network performance achieved when using TOPA was evaluated through ns-3 simulations. The results show up to 100% improvement in the aggregate throughput without compromising fairness. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the domain differences and unbalanced disparity distribution across multiple datasets, current stereo matching approaches are commonly limited to a specific dataset and generalize poorly to others. Such domain shift issue is usually addressed by substantial adaptation on costly target-domain ground-truth data, which cannot be easily obtained in practical settings. In this paper, we propose to dig into uncertainty estimation for robust stereo matching. Specifically, to balance the disparity distribution, we employ a pixel-level uncertainty estimation to adaptively adjust the next stage disparity searching space, in this way driving the network progressively prune out the space of unlikely correspondences. Then, to solve the limited ground truth data, an uncertainty-based pseudo-label is proposed to adapt the pre-trained model to the new domain, where pixel-level and area-level uncertainty estimation are proposed to filter out the high-uncertainty pixels of predicted disparity maps and generate sparse while reliable pseudo-labels to align the domain gap. Experimentally, our method shows strong cross-domain, adapt, and joint generalization and obtains \\textbf{1st} place on the stereo task of Robust Vision Challenge 2020. Additionally, our uncertainty-based pseudo-labels can be extended to train monocular depth estimation networks in an unsupervised way and even achieves comparable performance with the supervised methods.

Existing channel prediction techniques are mainly designed for discrete channel prediction, which can only predict the future channel in a fixed time slot per frame, while the other intra-frame channels are usually recovered by interpolation.

To solve this challenging problem, we propose a tensor neural ordinary differential equation (TN-ODE) based continuous-time channel prediction scheme to realize the direct prediction of intra-frame channels. Specifically, inspired by the recently developed continuous mapping model named neural ODE in the field of machine learning, we first utilize the neural ODE model to predict future continuous-time channels. To improve the channel prediction accuracy and reduce computational complexity, we then propose the TN-ODE scheme to learn the structural characteristics of the high-dimensional channel by low dimensional learnable transform. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able to achieve higher intra-frame channel prediction accuracy than existing schemes. ",

We introduce three families of causal bias mechanisms stemming from disparities in prevalence, presentation, and annotation. Our causal analysis underscores how current mitigation methods tackle only a narrow and often unrealistic subset of scenarios.

This study explored several approaches to accurately predict customers' intent using both labelled and unlabelled textual data. While some approaches showed promise in specific datasets, the search for a single, universally applicable approach continues. The development of separate pipelines for intent detection and discovery has led to improved accuracy rates in detecting known intents, while further work is required to improve the accuracy of intent discovery for unknown intents.

Since text annotations are not available in current deepfakes datasets, VLFFD first generates the mixed forgery image with corresponding fine-grained prompts via Prompt Forgery Image Generator (PFIG). Then, the fine-grained mixed data and coarse-grained original data and is jointly trained with the Coarse-and-Fine Co-training framework (C2F), enabling the model to gain more generalization and interpretability.

This study proposes a novel approach called DiffProsody in which expressive speech is synthesized using a diffusion-based latent prosody generator and prosody conditional adversarial training. Our findings confirm the effectiveness of our prosody generator in generating a prosody vector. Furthermore, our prosody conditional discriminator significantly improves the quality of the generated speech by accurately emulating prosody. We use denoising diffusion generative adversarial networks to improve the prosody generation speed. Consequently, DiffProsody is capable of generating prosody 16 times faster than the conventional diffusion model.

    "abstract": "Video portrait segmentation (VPS), aiming at segmenting prominent foreground portraits from video frames, has received much attention in recent years. However, simplicity of existing VPS datasets leads to a limitation on extensive research of the task. In this work, we propose a new intricate large-scale Multi-scene Video Portrait Segmentation dataset MVPS consisting of 101 video clips in 7 scenario categories, in which 10,843 sampled frames are finely annotated at pixel level. The dataset has diverse scenes and complicated background environments, which is the most complex dataset in VPS to our best knowledge. Through the observation of a large number of videos with portraits during dataset construction, we find that due to the joint structure of human body, motion of portraits is part-associated, which leads that different parts are relatively independent in motion. That is, motion of different parts of the portraits is unbalanced. Towards this unbalance, an intuitive and reasonable idea is that different motion states in portraits can be better exploited by decoupling the portraits into parts. To achieve this, we propose a Part-Decoupling Network (PDNet) for video portrait segmentation. Specifically, an Inter-frame Part-Discriminated Attention (IPDA) module is proposed which unsupervisely segments portrait into parts and utilizes different attentiveness on discriminative features specified to each different part. In this way, appropriate attention can be imposed to portrait parts with unbalanced motion to extract part-discriminated correlations, so that the portraits can be segmented more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance with the comparison to state-of-the-art methods. ",

First, we use three physics-based criteria: the variance, skewness and flatness of the increments of the generated field that retrieve respectively the turbulent energy distribution, energy cascade and intermittency across scales. Second, the Generative Adversarial Network criterion, based on reproducing statistical distributions, is used on segments of different length of the generated field. Furthermore, to mimic multiscale decompositions frequently used in turbulence's studies, the model architecture is fully convolutional with kernel sizes varying along the multiple layers of the model.

This paper proposes a resource allocation scheme for NS based on the Fisher-market model and the Trading-post mechanism. The scheme aims to achieve efficient resource utilization while ensuring multi-level fairness, dynamic load conditions, and the protection of service level agreements (SLAs) for slice tenants. In the proposed scheme, each service provider (SP) is allocated a budget representing its infrastructure share or purchasing power in the market. SPs acquire different resources by spending their budgets to offer services to different classes of users, classified based on their service needs and priorities. The scheme assumes that SPs employ the $\\alpha$-fairness criteria to deliver services to their subscribers. The resource allocation problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem to find a market equilibrium (ME) solution that provides allocation and resource pricing. A privacy-preserving learning algorithm is developed to enable SPs to reach the ME in a decentralized manner. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, comparing it with the Social Optimal and Static Proportional sharing schemes. ",

Creating high-quality human-labelled datasets for this task is difficult and costly, especially because non-offensive posts are significantly more frequent than offensive ones. However, unlabelled data is abundant, easier, and cheaper to obtain. In this scenario, self-training methods, using weakly-labelled examples to increase the amount of training data, can be employed. Recent \"noisy\" self-training approaches incorporate data augmentation techniques to ensure prediction consistency and increase robustness against noisy data and adversarial attacks. In this paper, we experiment with default and noisy self-training using three different textual data augmentation techniques across five different pre-trained BERT architectures varying in size. We evaluate our experiments on two offensive/hate-speech datasets and demonstrate that (i) self-training consistently improves performance regardless of model size, resulting in up to +1.5% F1-macro on both datasets, and (ii) noisy self-training with textual data augmentations, despite being successfully applied in similar settings, decreases performance on offensive and hate-speech domains when compared to the default method, even with state-of-the-art augmentations such as backtranslation.

We formalize this generalization of CBO as Adversarial Causal Bayesian Optimization (ACBO) and introduce the first algorithm for ACBO with bounded regret: Causal Bayesian Optimization with Multiplicative Weights (CBO-MW). Our approach combines a classical online learning strategy with causal modeling of the rewards. To achieve this, it computes optimistic counterfactual reward estimates by propagating uncertainty through the causal graph. We derive regret bounds for CBO-MW that naturally depend on graph-related quantities. We further propose a scalable implementation for the case of combinatorial interventions and submodular rewards. Empirically, CBO-MW outperforms non-causal and non-adversarial Bayesian optimization methods on synthetic environments and environments based on real-word data. Our experiments include a realistic demonstration of how CBO-MW can be used to learn users' demand patterns in a shared mobility system and reposition vehicles in strategic areas. ",

    "abstract": "The language models, especially the basic text classification models, have been shown to be susceptible to textual adversarial attacks such as synonym substitution and word insertion attacks. To defend against such attacks, a growing body of research has been devoted to improving the model robustness. However, providing provable robustness guarantees instead of empirical robustness is still widely unexplored. In this paper, we propose Text-CRS, a generalized certified robustness framework for natural language processing (NLP) based on randomized smoothing. To our best knowledge, existing certified schemes for NLP can only certify the robustness against $\\ell_0$ perturbations in synonym substitution attacks. Representing each word-level adversarial operation (i.e., synonym substitution, word reordering, insertion, and deletion) as a combination of permutation and embedding transformation, we propose novel smoothing theorems to derive robustness bounds in both permutation and embedding space against such adversarial operations. To further improve certified accuracy and radius, we consider the numerical relationships between discrete words and select proper noise distributions for the randomized smoothing. Finally, we conduct substantial experiments on multiple language models and datasets. Text-CRS can address all four different word-level adversarial operations and achieve a significant accuracy improvement. We also provide the first benchmark on certified accuracy and radius of four word-level operations, besides outperforming the state-of-the-art certification against synonym substitution attacks. ",

The aim of the article is developing a novel approach to training a Siamese network to link the skills mentioned in the job ad with the title. It has been shown that the title normalization process can be based either on classification or similarity comparison approaches. While classification algorithms strive to classify a sample into predefined set of categories, similarity search algorithms take a more flexible approach, since they are designed to find samples that are similar to a given query sample, without requiring pre-defined classes and labels. In this article semantic similarity search to find candidates for title normalization has been used. A pre-trained language model has been adapted while teaching it to match titles and skills based on co-occurrence information. For the purpose of this research fifty billion title-descriptions pairs had been collected for training the model and thirty three thousand title-description-normalized title triplets, where normalized job title was picked up manually by job ad creator for testing purposes. As baselines FastText, BERT, SentenceBert and JobBert have been used. As a metric of the accuracy of the designed algorithm is Recall in top one, five and ten model's suggestions. It has been shown that the novel training objective lets it achieve significant improvement in comparison to other generic and specific text encoders. Two settings with treating titles as standalone strings, and with included skills as additional features during inference have been used and the results have been compared in this article. Improvements by 10% and 21.5% have been achieved using VacancySBERT and VacancySBERT (with skills) respectively.

    "title": "NEON: Living Needs Prediction System in Meituan",
    "abstract": "Living needs refer to the various needs in human's daily lives for survival and well-being, including food, housing, entertainment, etc. On life service platforms that connect users to service providers, such as Meituan, the problem of living needs prediction is fundamental as it helps understand users and boost various downstream applications such as personalized recommendation. However, the problem has not been well explored and is faced with two critical challenges. First, the needs are naturally connected to specific locations and times, suffering from complex impacts from the spatiotemporal context. Second, there is a significant gap between users' actual living needs and their historical records on the platform. To address these two challenges, we design a system of living NEeds predictiON named NEON, consisting of three phases: feature mining, feature fusion, and multi-task prediction. In the feature mining phase, we carefully extract individual-level user features for spatiotemporal modeling, and aggregated-level behavioral features for enriching data, which serve as the basis for addressing two challenges, respectively. Further, in the feature fusion phase, we propose a neural network that effectively fuses two parts of features into the user representation. Moreover, we design a multi-task prediction phase, where the auxiliary task of needs-meeting way prediction can enhance the modeling of spatiotemporal context. Extensive offline evaluations verify that our NEON system can effectively predict users' living needs. Furthermore, we deploy NEON into Meituan's algorithm engine and evaluate how it enhances the three downstream prediction applications, via large-scale online A/B testing. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have shown great promise in various healthcare monitoring applications. However, most healthcare datasets with high-quality (gold-standard) labels are small-scale, as directly collecting ground truth is often costly and time-consuming. As a result, models developed and validated on small-scale datasets often suffer from overfitting and do not generalize well to unseen scenarios. At the same time, large amounts of imprecise (silver-standard) labeled data, annotated by approximate methods with the help of modern wearables and in the absence of ground truth validation, are starting to emerge. However, due to measurement differences, this data displays significant label distribution shifts, which motivates the use of domain adaptation. To this end, we introduce UDAMA, a method with two key components: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Multidiscriminator Adversarial Training, where we pre-train on the silver-standard data and employ adversarial adaptation with the gold-standard data along with two domain discriminators. In particular, we showcase the practical potential of UDAMA by applying it to Cardio-respiratory fitness (CRF) prediction. CRF is a crucial determinant of metabolic disease and mortality, and it presents labels with various levels of noise (goldand silver-standard), making it challenging to establish an accurate prediction model. Our results show promising performance by alleviating distribution shifts in various label shift settings. Additionally, by using data from two free-living cohort studies (Fenland and BBVS), we show that UDAMA consistently outperforms up to 12% compared to competitive transfer learning and state-of-the-art domain adaptation models, paving the way for leveraging noisy labeled data to improve fitness estimation at scale.

We propose an attention mechanism that allows a graph to be constructed in a learned space that handles geometrically the flow of relevance, providing one solution to the Topology Problem.

    "abstract": "Preserving the topology from being inferred by external adversaries has become a paramount security issue for network systems (NSs), and adding random noises to the nodal states provides a promising way. Nevertheless, recent works have revealed that the topology cannot be preserved under i.i.d. noises in the asymptotic sense. How to effectively characterize the non-asymptotic preservation performance still remains an open issue. Inspired by the deviation quantification of concentration inequalities, this paper proposes a novel metric named trace-based variance-expectation ratio. This metric effectively captures the decaying rate of the topology inference error, where a slower rate indicates better non-asymptotic preservation performance. We prove that the inference error will always decay to zero asymptotically, as long as the added noises are non-increasing and independent (milder than the i.i.d. condition). Then, the optimal noise design that produces the slowest decaying rate for the error is obtained. More importantly, we amend the noise design by introducing one-lag time dependence, achieving the zero state deviation and the non-zero topology inference error in the asymptotic sense simultaneously. Extensions to a general class of noises with multi-lag time dependence are provided. Comprehensive simulations verify the theoretical findings. ",

    "abstract": "Navigation of terrestrial robots is typically addressed either with localization and mapping (SLAM) followed by classical planning on the dynamically created maps, or by machine learning (ML), often through end-to-end training with reinforcement learning (RL) or imitation learning (IL). Recently, modular designs have achieved promising results, and hybrid algorithms that combine ML with classical planning have been proposed. Existing methods implement these combinations with hand-crafted functions, which cannot fully exploit the complementary nature of the policies and the complex regularities between scene structure and planning performance. Our work builds on the hypothesis that the strengths and weaknesses of neural planners and classical planners follow some regularities, which can be learned from training data, in particular from interactions. This is grounded on the assumption that, both, trained planners and the mapping algorithms underlying classical planning are subject to failure cases depending on the semantics of the scene and that this dependence is learnable: for instance, certain areas, objects or scene structures can be reconstructed easier than others. We propose a hierarchical method composed of a high-level planner dynamically switching between a classical and a neural planner. We fully train all neural policies in simulation and evaluate the method in both simulation and real experiments with a LoCoBot robot, showing significant gains in performance, in particular in the real environment. We also qualitatively conjecture on the nature of data regularities exploited by the high-level planner. ",

In particular, we design a dual embedding layer, a GNN-based traffic graph encoder as well as a cross-gated feature fusion mechanism, which can first embed the header and payload bytes separately and then fuses them together to obtain a stronger feature representation. The experimental results on two real datasets demonstrate that TFE-GNN outperforms multiple state-of-the-art methods in fine-grained encrypted traffic classification tasks. ",

    "abstract": "The growth of systems complexity increases the need of automated techniques dedicated to different log analysis tasks such as Log-based Anomaly Detection (LAD). The latter has been widely addressed in the literature, mostly by means of different deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, the focus on deep learning techniques results in less attention being paid to traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques, which may perform well in many cases, depending on the context and the used datasets. Further, the evaluation of different ML techniques is mostly based on the assessment of their detection accuracy. However, this is is not enough to decide whether or not a specific ML technique is suitable to address the LAD problem. Other aspects to consider include the training and prediction time as well as the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study, in which we evaluate different supervised and semi-supervised, traditional and deep ML techniques w.r.t. four evaluation criteria: detection accuracy, time performance, sensitivity of detection accuracy as well as time performance to hyperparameter tuning. The experimental results show that supervised traditional and deep ML techniques perform very closely in terms of their detection accuracy and prediction time. Moreover, the overall evaluation of the sensitivity of the detection accuracy of the different ML techniques to hyperparameter tuning shows that supervised traditional ML techniques are less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning than deep learning techniques. Further, semi-supervised techniques yield significantly worse detection accuracy than supervised techniques. ",

The primary challenge of this task is to explore the relations between multi-spectral images for aligning and integrating multi-view scenes. Capitalizing on the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in modeling feature relationships, we propose a spatial graph reasoning based multi-spectral image stitching method that effectively distills the deformation and integration of multi-spectral images across different viewpoints. To accomplish this, we embed multi-scale complementary features from the same view position into a set of nodes. The correspondence across different views is learned through powerful dense feature embeddings, where both inter- and intra-correlations are developed to exploit cross-view matching and enhance inner feature disparity. By introducing long-range coherence along spatial and channel dimensions, the complementarity of pixel relations and channel interdependencies aids in the reconstruction of aligned multi-view features, generating informative and reliable wide FOV scenes. Moreover, we release a challenging dataset named ChaMS, comprising both real-world and synthetic sets with significant parallax, providing a new option for comprehensive evaluation.

Algorithms with predictions have already been used to improve on worst-case optimal bounds for online problems and for static graph problems. With this work, we initiate the study of the complexity of {\\em data structures with predictions}, with an emphasis on dynamic graph problems. Unlike the independent work of v.d.~Brand et al.~[arXiv:2307.09961] that aims at upper bounds, our investigation is focused on establishing conditional fine-grained lower bounds for various notions of predictions. Our lower bounds are conditioned on the Online Matrix Vector (OMv) hypothesis. First we show that a prediction-based algorithm for OMv provides a smooth transition between the known bounds, for the offline and the online setting, and then show that this algorithm is essentially optimal under the OMv hypothesis. Further, we introduce and study four different kinds of predictions. (1) For {\\em $\\varepsilon$-accurate predictions}, where $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$, we show that any lower bound from the non-prediction setting carries over, reduced by a factor of $1-\\varepsilon$. (2) For {\\em $L$-list accurate predictions}, we show that one can efficiently compute a $(1/L)$-accurate prediction from an $L$-list accurate prediction. (3) For {\\em bounded delay predictions} and {\\em bounded delay predictions with outliers}, we show that a lower bound from the non-prediction setting carries over, if the reduction fulfills a certain reordering condition (which is fulfilled by many reductions from OMv for dynamic graph problems). This is demonstrated by showing lower and almost tight upper bounds for a concrete, dynamic graph problem, called $\\# s \\textrm{-} \\triangle$, where the number of triangles that contain a fixed vertex $s$ must be reported.

Unfortunately, recent research has unveiled the vulnerability of NRMs to adversarial document manipulations, potentially exploited by malicious search engine optimization practitioners. While progress in adversarial attack strategies aids in identifying the potential weaknesses of NRMs before their deployment, the defensive measures against such attacks, like the detection of adversarial documents, remain inadequately explored. To mitigate this gap, this paper establishes a benchmark dataset to facilitate the investigation of adversarial ranking defense and introduces two types of detection tasks for adversarial documents. A comprehensive investigation of the performance of several detection baselines is conducted, which involve examining the spamicity, perplexity, and linguistic acceptability, and utilizing supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that a supervised classifier can effectively mitigate known attacks, but it performs poorly against unseen attacks. Furthermore, such classifier should avoid using query text to prevent learning the classification on relevance, as it might lead to the inadvertent discarding of relevant documents. ",

    "abstract": "With sufficient paired training samples, the supervised deep learning methods have attracted much attention in image denoising because of their superior performance. However, it is still very challenging to widely utilize the supervised methods in real cases due to the lack of paired noisy-clean images. Meanwhile, most self-supervised denoising methods are ineffective as well when applied to the real-world denoising tasks because of their strict assumptions in applications. For example, as a typical method for self-supervised denoising, the original blind spot network (BSN) assumes that the noise is pixel-wise independent, which is much different from the real cases. To solve this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised real image denoising framework named Sampling Difference As Perturbation (SDAP) based on Random Sub-samples Generation (RSG) with a cyclic sample difference loss. Specifically, we dig deeper into the properties of BSN to make it more suitable for real noise. Surprisingly, we find that adding an appropriate perturbation to the training images can effectively improve the performance of BSN. Further, we propose that the sampling difference can be considered as perturbation to achieve better results. Finally we propose a new BSN framework in combination with our RSG strategy. The results show that it significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods on real-world datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/p1y2z3/SDAP. ",

CroSSL introduces two novel concepts: masking intermediate embeddings from modality-specific encoders and aggregating them into a global embedding using a cross-modal aggregator. This enables the handling of missing modalities and end-to-end learning of cross-modal patterns without prior data preprocessing or time-consuming negative-pair sampling. We evaluate CroSSL on various multimodal time-series benchmarks, including both medical-grade and consumer biosignals. Our results demonstrate superior performance compared to previous SSL techniques and supervised benchmarks with minimal labeled data. We additionally analyze the impact of different masking ratios and strategies and assess the robustness of the learned representations to missing modalities. Overall, our work achieves state-of-the-art performance while highlighting the benefits of masking latent embeddings for cross-modal learning in temporal health data. ",

    "abstract": "The trustworthiness of machine learning has emerged as a critical topic in the field, encompassing various applications and research areas such as robustness, security, interpretability, and fairness. The last decade saw the development of numerous methods addressing these challenges. In this survey, we systematically review these advancements from a data-centric perspective, highlighting the shortcomings of traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) training in handling challenges posed by the data. Interestingly, we observe a convergence of these methods, despite being developed independently across trustworthy machine learning subfields. Pearl's hierarchy of causality offers a unifying framework for these techniques. Accordingly, this survey presents the background of trustworthy machine learning development using a unified set of concepts, connects this language to Pearl's causal hierarchy, and finally discusses methods explicitly inspired by causality literature. We provide a unified language with mathematical vocabulary to link these methods across robustness, adversarial robustness, interpretability, and fairness, fostering a more cohesive understanding of the field. Further, we explore the trustworthiness of large pretrained models. After summarizing dominant techniques like fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, prompting, and reinforcement learning with human feedback, we draw connections between them and the standard ERM. This connection allows us to build upon the principled understanding of trustworthy methods, extending it to these new techniques in large pretrained models, paving the way for future methods. Existing methods under this perspective are also reviewed. Lastly, we offer a brief summary of the applications of these methods and discuss potential future aspects related to our survey.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in many remote sensing (RS) applications. However, their vulnerability to the threat of adversarial perturbations should not be neglected. Unfortunately, current adversarial defense approaches in RS studies usually suffer from performance fluctuation and unnecessary re-training costs due to the need for prior knowledge of the adversarial perturbations among RS data. To circumvent these challenges, we propose a universal adversarial defense approach in RS imagery (UAD-RS) using pre-trained diffusion models to defend the common DNNs against multiple unknown adversarial attacks. Specifically, the generative diffusion models are first pre-trained on different RS datasets to learn generalized representations in various data domains. After that, a universal adversarial purification framework is developed using the forward and reverse process of the pre-trained diffusion models to purify the perturbations from adversarial samples. Furthermore, an adaptive noise level selection (ANLS) mechanism is built to capture the optimal noise level of the diffusion model that can achieve the best purification results closest to the clean samples according to their Frechet Inception Distance (FID) in deep feature space. As a result, only a single pre-trained diffusion model is needed for the universal purification of adversarial samples on each dataset, which significantly alleviates the re-training efforts for each attack setting and maintains high performance without the prior knowledge of adversarial perturbations. Experiments on four heterogeneous RS datasets regarding scene classification and semantic segmentation verify that UAD-RS outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial purification approaches with a universal defense against seven commonly existing adversarial perturbations.

There are several celebrated approximation results for this form of NNA that introduce novel model classes of functions on $\\Omega$ whose approximation rates avoid the curse of dimensionality. These novel classes include Barron classes, and classes based on sparsity or variation such as the Radon-domain BV classes. The present paper is concerned with the definition of these novel model classes on domains $\\Omega$. The current definition of these model classes does not depend on the domain $\\Omega$. A new and more proper definition of model classes on domains is given by introducing the concept of weighted variation spaces. These new model classes are intrinsic to the domain itself. The importance of these new model classes is that they are strictly larger than the classical (domain-independent) classes. Yet, it is shown that they maintain the same NNA rates. ",

It is a significant risk to people health and quality of life all across the globe since it is responsible for five of the top thirty leading causes of death. Among them are COVID 19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis, to name just a few. It is critical to diagnose lung diseases in their early stages. Several different models including machine learning and image processing have been developed for this purpose. The earlier a condition is diagnosed, the better the patient chances of making a full recovery and surviving into the long term. Thanks to deep learning algorithms, there is significant promise for the autonomous, rapid, and accurate identification of lung diseases based on medical imaging. Several different deep learning strategies, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), vanilla neural networks, visual geometry group based networks (VGG), and capsule networks , are used for the goal of making lung disease forecasts. The standard CNN has a poor performance when dealing with rotated, tilted, or other aberrant picture orientations. As a result of this, within the scope of this study, we have suggested a vision transformer based approach end to end framework for the diagnosis of lung disorders. In the architecture, data augmentation, training of the suggested models, and evaluation of the models are all included. For the purpose of detecting lung diseases such as pneumonia, Covid 19, lung opacity, and others, a specialised Compact Convolution Transformers (CCT) model have been tested and evaluated on datasets such as the Covid 19 Radiography Database. The model has achieved a better accuracy for both its training and validation purposes on the Covid 19 Radiography Database. ",

While this manifold is invariant for the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator, this invariance is typically not preserved for its eDMD-based approximation.

    "abstract": "Bias field, which is caused by imperfect MR devices or imaged objects, introduces intensity inhomogeneity into MR images and degrades the performance of MR image analysis methods. Many retrospective algorithms were developed to facilitate the bias correction, to which the deep learning-based methods outperformed. However, in the training phase, the supervised deep learning-based methods heavily rely on the synthesized bias field. As the formation of the bias field is extremely complex, it is difficult to mimic the true physical property of MR images by synthesized data. While bias field correction and image segmentation are strongly related, the segmentation map is precisely obtained by decoupling the bias field from the original MR image, and the bias value is indicated by the segmentation map in reverse. Thus, we proposed novel unsupervised decomposition networks that are trained only with biased data to obtain the bias-free MR images. Networks are made up of: a segmentation part to predict the probability of every pixel belonging to each class, and an estimation part to calculate the bias field, which are optimized alternately. Furthermore, loss functions based on the combination of fuzzy clustering and the multiplicative bias field are also devised. The proposed loss functions introduce the smoothness of bias field and construct the soft relationships among different classes under intra-consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately estimate bias fields and produce better bias correction results.

It is, however, challenging in the case of medical applications, and in particular for multiparametric datasets.

Therefore, dedicated image generation techniques are necessary in the medical field to, for example, mimic a given pathology realistically. This paper introduces a new data augmentation architecture that generates synthetic multiparametric (T1 arterial, T1 portal, and T2) magnetic resonance images (MRI) of massive macrotrabecular subtype hepatocellular carcinoma with their corresponding tumor masks through a generative deep learning approach. The proposed architecture creates liver tumor masks and abdominal edges used as input in a Pix2Pix network for synthetic data creation. The method's efficiency is demonstrated by training it on a limited multiparametric dataset of MRI triplets from $89$ patients with liver lesions to generate $1,000$ synthetic triplets and their corresponding liver tumor masks. The resulting Frechet Inception Distance score was $86.55$. The proposed approach was among the winners of the 2021 data augmentation challenge organized by the French Society of Radiology. ",

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) researchers have benefited from this trend and produced powerful neural networks that promise shorter simulation times. For example, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent-based (RNN) architectures can represent sub-grid physical effects, like turbulence. Implementing neural networks in CFD solvers is challenging because the programming languages used for machine learning and CFD are mostly non-overlapping, We present the roseNNa library, which bridges the gap between neural network inference and CFD. RoseNNa is a non-invasive, lightweight (1000 lines), and performant tool for neural network inference, with focus on the smaller networks used to augment PDE solvers, like those of CFD, which are typically written in C/C++ or Fortran. RoseNNa accomplishes this by automatically converting trained models from typical neural network training packages into a high-performance Fortran library with C and Fortran APIs. This reduces the effort needed to access trained neural networks and maintains performance in the PDE solvers that CFD researchers build and rely upon. Results show that RoseNNa reliably outperforms PyTorch (Python) and libtorch (C++) on MLPs and LSTM RNNs with less than 100 hidden layers and 100 neurons per layer, even after removing the overhead cost of API calls. Speedups range from a factor of about 10 and 2 faster than these established libraries for the smaller and larger ends of the neural network size ranges tested. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning models have been applied to neuroimaging data for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images provide structural and functional information about the brain, respectively. Combining these features leads to improved performance than using a single modality alone in building predictive models for AD diagnosis. However, current multi-modal approaches in deep learning, based on sMRI and PET, are mostly limited to convolutional neural networks, which do not facilitate integration of both image and phenotypic information of subjects. We propose to use graph neural networks (GNN) that are designed to deal with problems in non-Euclidean domains. In this study, we demonstrate how brain networks can be created from sMRI or PET images and be used in a population graph framework that can combine phenotypic information with imaging features of these brain networks. Then, we present a multi-modal GNN framework where each modality has its own branch of GNN and a technique is proposed to combine the multi-modal data at both the level of node vectors and adjacency matrices. Finally, we perform late fusion to combine the preliminary decisions made in each branch and produce a final prediction. As multi-modality data becomes available, multi-source and multi-modal is the trend of AD diagnosis. We conducted explorative experiments based on multi-modal imaging data combined with non-imaging phenotypic information for AD diagnosis and analyzed the impact of phenotypic information on diagnostic performance. Results from experiments demonstrated that our proposed multi-modal approach improves performance for AD diagnosis, and this study also provides technical reference and support the need for multivariate multi-modal diagnosis methods.

Compared to many approaches that use non-specialized architectures that neglect underlying physics principles and require very large numbers of parameters, PELICAN employs a fundamentally symmetry group-based architecture that demonstrates benefits in terms of reduced complexity, increased interpretability, and raw performance. When tested on the standard task of Lorentz-boosted top quark tagging, PELICAN outperforms existing competitors with much lower model complexity and high sample efficiency. On the less common and more complex task of four-momentum regression, PELICAN also outperforms hand-crafted algorithms. We discuss the implications of symmetry-restricted architectures for the wider field of machine learning for physics. ",

    "abstract": "Bayesian inference and kernel methods are well established in machine learning. The neural network Gaussian process in particular provides a concept to investigate neural networks in the limit of infinitely wide hidden layers by using kernel and inference methods. Here we build upon this limit and provide a field-theoretic formalism which covers the generalization properties of infinitely wide networks. We systematically compute generalization properties of linear, non-linear, and deep non-linear networks for kernel matrices with heterogeneous entries. In contrast to currently employed spectral methods we derive the generalization properties from the statistical properties of the input, elucidating the interplay of input dimensionality, size of the training data set, and variability of the data. We show that data variability leads to a non-Gaussian action reminiscent of a ($\\varphi^3+\\varphi^4$)-theory. Using our formalism on a synthetic task and on MNIST we obtain a homogeneous kernel matrix approximation for the learning curve as well as corrections due to data variability which allow the estimation of the generalization properties and exact results for the bounds of the learning curves in the case of infinitely many training data points.

    "title": "Classification with Deep Neural Networks and Logistic Loss",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with the logistic loss (i.e., the cross entropy loss) have made impressive advancements in various binary classification tasks. However, generalization analysis for binary classification with DNNs and logistic loss remains scarce. The unboundedness of the target function for the logistic loss is the main obstacle to deriving satisfying generalization bounds. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by establishing a novel and elegant oracle-type inequality, which enables us to deal with the boundedness restriction of the target function, and using it to derive sharp convergence rates for fully connected ReLU DNN classifiers trained with logistic loss. In particular, we obtain optimal convergence rates (up to log factors) only requiring the H\\\"older smoothness of the conditional class probability $\\eta$ of data. Moreover, we consider a compositional assumption that requires $\\eta$ to be the composition of several vector-valued functions of which each component function is either a maximum value function or a H\\\"older smooth function only depending on a small number of its input variables. Under this assumption, we derive optimal convergence rates (up to log factors) which are independent of the input dimension of data. This result explains why DNN classifiers can perform well in practical high-dimensional classification problems. Besides the novel oracle-type inequality, the sharp convergence rates given in our paper also owe to a tight error bound for approximating the natural logarithm function near zero (where it is unbounded) by ReLU DNNs. In addition, we justify our claims for the optimality of rates by proving corresponding minimax lower bounds. All these results are new in the literature and will deepen our theoretical understanding of classification with DNNs. ",

In particular, we relax two strong assumptions made in the existing literature, namely that the targets' own dynamics shows cohesive collective behaviour (e.g. flocking) in the absence of herders and that the herders possess global sensing capability. We find, for the first time, scaling laws linking the number of targets to be herd to the minimum number of herders that can solve the problem. Surprisingly we observe that, when limited sensing is present, the number of herders needed to successfully achieve the herding task significantly increases as the targets' density becomes lower than a critical threshold. We explain the existence of such a threshold in terms of the percolation of a suitably defined herdability graph. Exhaustive numerical experiments validate and confirm the effectiveness of our methodology. ",

In response to this challenge, we propose SPYCE, which is the first known solution to obfuscate quantum code and output to prevent the leaking of any confidential information over the cloud. SPYCE implements a lightweight, scalable, and effective solution based on the unique principles of quantum computing to achieve this task. ",

The Self-Optimization (SO) model adds to the Hopfield network by using a biologically founded Hebbian learning rule, in combination with repeated network resets to arbitrary initial states, for optimizing its own behavior towards some desirable goal state encoded in the network. In order to better understand that process, we demonstrate first that the SO model can solve concrete combinatorial problems in SAT form, using two examples of the Liars problem and the map coloring problem. In addition, we show how under some conditions critical information might get lost forever with the learned network producing seemingly optimal solutions that are in fact inappropriate for the problem it was tasked to solve. What appears to be an undesirable side-effect of the SO model, can provide insight into its process for solving intractable problems. ",
