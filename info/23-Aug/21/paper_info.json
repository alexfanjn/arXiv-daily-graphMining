    "title": "KMF: Knowledge-Aware Multi-Faceted Representation Learning for Zero-Shot  Node Classification",
    "abstract": "Recently, Zero-Shot Node Classification (ZNC) has been an emerging and crucial task in graph data analysis. This task aims to predict nodes from unseen classes which are unobserved in the training process. Existing work mainly utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to associate features' prototypes and labels' semantics thus enabling knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes. However, the multi-faceted semantic orientation in the feature-semantic alignment has been neglected by previous work, i.e. the content of a node usually covers diverse topics that are relevant to the semantics of multiple labels. It's necessary to separate and judge the semantic factors that tremendously affect the cognitive ability to improve the generality of models. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Multi-Faceted framework (KMF) that enhances the richness of label semantics via the extracted KG (Knowledge Graph)-based topics. And then the content of each node is reconstructed to a topic-level representation that offers multi-faceted and fine-grained semantic relevancy to different labels. Due to the particularity of the graph's instance (i.e., node) representation, a novel geometric constraint is developed to alleviate the problem of prototype drift caused by node information aggregation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several public graph datasets and design an application of zero-shot cross-domain recommendation. The quantitative results demonstrate both the effectiveness and generalization of KMF with the comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Whenever humans use tools human performance is enhanced. Cognitive systems are a new kind of tool continually increasing in cognitive capability and are now performing high level cognitive tasks previously thought to be explicitly human. Usage of such tools, known as cogs, are expected to result in ever increasing levels of human cognitive augmentation. In a human cog ensemble, a cooperative, peer to peer, and collaborative dialog between a human and a cognitive system, human cognitive capability is augmented as a result of the interaction. The human cog ensemble is therefore able to achieve more than just the human or the cog working alone. This article presents results from two studies designed to measure the effect information supplied by a cog has on cognitive accuracy, the ability to produce the correct result, and cognitive precision, the propensity to produce only the correct result. Both cognitive accuracy and cognitive precision are shown to be increased by information of different types (policies and rules, examples, and suggestions) and with different kinds of problems (inventive problem solving and puzzles). Similar effects shown in other studies are compared. ",

The skill set required for computer science jobs has evolved rapidly, creating challenges for those already in the workforce who need to adapt their skills quickly to meet industry demands. To stay ahead of the curve, it is essential to understand the hottest skills needed in the field. The article introduces a new method for analyzing job advertisements using social network analysis to identify the most critical skills required by employers in the market. In this research, to form the communication network of skills, first 5763 skills were collected from the LinkedIn social network, then the relationship between skills was collected and searched in 7777 computer science job advertisements, and finally, the balanced communication network of skills was formed. The study analyzes the formed communication network of skills in the computer science job market and identifies four distinct communities of skills: Generalists, Infrastructure and Security, Software Development, and Embedded Systems. The findings reveal that employers value both hard and soft skills, such as programming languages and teamwork. Communication skills were found to be the most important skill in the labor market. Additionally, certain skills were highlighted based on their centrality indices, including communication, English, SQL, Git, and business skills, among others. The study provides valuable insights into the current state of the computer science job market and can help guide individuals and organizations in making informed decisions about skills acquisition and hiring practices.

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of social media, a growing number of users search for and join group activities in their daily life. This develops a need for the study on the group identification (GI) task, i.e., recommending groups to users. The major challenge in this task is how to predict users' preferences for groups based on not only previous group participation of users but also users' interests in items. Although recent developments in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) accomplish embedding multiple types of objects in graph-based recommender systems, they, however, fail to address this GI problem comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Group Identification via Transitional Hypergraph Convolution with Graph Self-supervised Learning (GTGS). We devise a novel transitional hypergraph convolution layer to leverage users' preferences for items as prior knowledge when seeking their group preferences. To construct comprehensive user/group representations for GI task, we design the cross-view self-supervised learning to encourage the intrinsic consistency between item and group preferences for each user, and the group-based regularization to enhance the distinction among group embeddings. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets verify the superiority of GTGS. Additional detailed investigations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. ",

To track this problem, we propose a novel framework called pFedHR, which leverages heterogeneous model reassembly to achieve personalized federated learning. In particular, we approach the problem of heterogeneous model personalization as a model-matching optimization task on the server side. Moreover, pFedHR automatically and dynamically generates informative and diverse personalized candidates with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, our proposed heterogeneous model reassembly technique mitigates the adverse impact introduced by using public data with different distributions from the client data to a certain extent. Experimental results demonstrate that pFedHR outperforms baselines on three datasets under both IID and Non-IID settings. Additionally, pFedHR effectively reduces the adverse impact of using different public data and dynamically generates diverse personalized models in an automated manner. ",

The proposed solution utilizes the block coordinate descent approach and a combination of continuous and binary genetic algorithms. Moreover, for optimizing the UAV placement, Adam optimizer is used.

As such, sparsity is important to enable the future of spectral compression and analytics. It has been observed that environmental and atmospheric effects, including scattering, can produce nonlinear effects posing challenges for existing source separation and compression methods. We present a novel transformation into Hilbert spaces for pruning and constructing sparse representations via non-negative least squares minimization. Then we introduce max likelihood compression vectors to decrease information loss. Our approach is benchmarked against standard pruning and least squares as well as deep learning methods. Our methods are evaluated in terms of overall spectral reconstruction error and compression rate using real and synthetic data. We find that pruning least squares methods converge quickly unlike matching pursuit methods. We find that Hilbert space pruning can reduce error by as much as 40% of the error of standard pruning and also outperform neural network autoencoders. ",

    "abstract": "Dynamic response evaluation in structural engineering is the process of determining the response of a structure, such as member forces, node displacements, etc when subjected to dynamic loads such as earthquakes, wind, or impact. This is an important aspect of structural analysis, as it enables engineers to assess structural performance under extreme loading conditions and make informed decisions about the design and safety of the structure. Conventional methods for dynamic response evaluation involve numerical simulations using finite element analysis (FEA), where the structure is modeled using finite elements, and the equations of motion are solved numerically. Although effective, this approach can be computationally intensive and may not be suitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, recent advancements in machine learning, specifically artificial neural networks, have been applied to dynamic response evaluation in structural engineering. These techniques leverage large data sets and sophisticated algorithms to learn the complex relationship between inputs and outputs, making them ideal for such problems. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for evaluating the dynamic response of multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems using physics-informed recurrent neural networks. The focus of this paper is to evaluate the seismic (earthquake) response of nonlinear structures. The predicted response will be compared to state-of-the-art methods such as FEA to assess the efficacy of the physics-informed RNN model. ",

This work focuses on connectivity augmentation problems in the Steiner setting, where we are not interested in the connectivity between all nodes of the graph, but only the connectivity between a specified subset of terminals. We consider two related settings. In the Steiner Augmentation of a Graph problem ($k$-SAG), we are given a $k$-edge-connected subgraph $H$ of a graph $G$. The goal is to augment $H$ by including links and nodes from $G$ of minimum cost so that the edge-connectivity between nodes of $H$ increases by 1. In the Steiner Connectivity Augmentation Problem ($k$-SCAP), we are given a Steiner $k$-edge-connected graph connecting terminals $R$, and we seek to add links of minimum cost to create a Steiner $(k+1)$-edge-connected graph for $R$. Note that $k$-SAG is a special case of $k$-SCAP. All of the above problems can be approximated to within a factor of 2 using e.g. Jain's iterative rounding algorithm for Survivable Network Design. In this work, we leverage the framework of Traub and Zenklusen to give a $(1 + \\ln{2} +\\varepsilon)$-approximation for the Steiner Ring Augmentation Problem (SRAP): given a cycle $H = (V(H),E)$ embedded in a larger graph $G = (V, E \\cup L)$ and a subset of terminals $R \\subseteq V(H)$, choose a subset of links $S \\subseteq L$ of minimum cost so that $(V, E \\cup S)$ has 3 pairwise edge-disjoint paths between every pair of terminals. We show this yields a polynomial time algorithm with approximation ratio $(1 + \\ln{2} + \\varepsilon)$ for $2$-SCAP. We obtain an improved approximation guarantee of $(1.5+\\varepsilon)$ for SRAP in the case that $R = V(H)$, which yields a $(1.5+\\varepsilon)$-approximation for $k$-SAG for any $k$. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the development of communication technology and the rise of user network demand, a reasonable resource allocation for wireless networks is the key to guaranteeing regular operation and improving system performance. Various frequency bands exist in the natural network environment, and heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) has become a hot topic for current research. Meanwhile, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has become a key technology for developing next-generation wireless networks. By modifying the phase of the incident signal arriving at the RIS surface, RIS can improve the signal quality at the receiver and reduce co-channel interference. In this paper, we develop a RIS-assisted HCN model for a multi-base station (BS) multi-frequency network, which includes 4G, 5G, millimeter wave (mmwave), and terahertz networks, and considers the case of multiple network coverage users, which is more in line with the realistic network characteristics and the concept of 6G networks. We propose the optimization objective of maximizing the system sum rate, which is decomposed into two subproblems, i.e., the user resource allocation and the phase shift optimization problem of RIS components. Due to the NP-hard and coupling relationship, we use the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to alternately optimize the local solutions of the coalition game and the local discrete phase search algorithm to obtain the global solution. In contrast, most previous studies have used the coalition game algorithm to solve the resource allocation problem alone. Simulation results show that the algorithm performs better than the rest of the algorithms, effectively improves the system sum rate, and achieves performance close to the optimal solution of the traversal algorithm with low complexity.

Their efficient processing is important for many real-life applications that rely on graph or hierarchy traversal. Position-enabled column-stores offer a novel opportunity to improve run times for this type of queries. Such systems allow the engine to explicitly use data positions (row ids) inside its core and thus, enable novel efficient implementations of query plan operators. In this paper, we present an approach that significantly speeds up recursive query processing inside RDBMSes. Its core idea is to employ a particular aspect of column-store technology (late materialization) which enables the query engine to manipulate data positions during query execution. Based on it, we propose two sets of Volcano-style operators intended to process different query cases. In order validate our ideas, we have implemented the proposed approach in PosDB, an RDBMS column-store with SQL support. We experimentally demonstrate the viability of our approach by providing a comparison with PostgreSQL. Experiments show that for breadth-first search: 1) our position-based approach yields up to 6x better results than PostgreSQL, 2) our tuple-based one results in only 3x improvement when using a special rewriting technique, but it can work in a larger number of cases, and 3) both approaches can't be emulated in row-stores efficiently.

Recently, DNNs have been deployed in real-time systems, and lowering the energy consumption and response time has become the need of the hour. To address this scenario, researchers have proposed incorporating dynamic mechanism to static DNNs (SDNN) to create Dynamic Neural Networks (DyNNs) performing dynamic amounts of computation based on the input complexity. Although incorporating dynamic mechanism into SDNNs would be preferable in real-time systems, it also becomes important to evaluate how the introduction of dynamic mechanism impacts the robustness of the models. However, there has not been a significant number of works focusing on the robustness trade-off between SDNNs and DyNNs. To address this issue, we propose to investigate the robustness of dynamic mechanism in DyNNs and how dynamic mechanism design impacts the robustness of DyNNs. For that purpose, we evaluate three research questions. These evaluations are performed on three models and two datasets. Through the studies, we find that attack transferability from DyNNs to SDNNs is higher than attack transferability from SDNNs to DyNNs. Also, we find that DyNNs can be used to generate adversarial samples more efficiently than SDNNs. Then, through research studies, we provide insight into the design choices that can increase robustness of DyNNs against the attack generated using static model. Finally, we propose a novel attack to understand the additional attack surface introduced by the dynamic mechanism and provide design choices to improve robustness against the attack. ",

    "abstract": "As a vital stage of automated rule checking (ARC), rule interpretation of regulatory texts requires considerable effort. However, interpreting regulatory clauses with implicit properties or complex computational logic is still challenging due to the lack of domain knowledge and limited expressibility of conventional logic representations. Thus, LLM-FuncMapper, an approach to identifying predefined functions needed to interpret various regulatory clauses based on the large language model (LLM), is proposed. First, by systematically analysis of building codes, a series of atomic functions are defined to capture shared computational logics of implicit properties and complex constraints, creating a database of common blocks for interpreting regulatory clauses. Then, a prompt template with the chain of thought is developed and further enhanced with a classification-based tuning strategy, to enable common LLMs for effective function identification. Finally, the proposed approach is validated with statistical analysis, experiments, and proof of concept. Statistical analysis reveals a long-tail distribution and high expressibility of the developed function database, with which almost 100% of computer-processible clauses can be interpreted and represented as computer-executable codes. Experiments show that LLM-FuncMapper achieve promising results in identifying relevant predefined functions for rule interpretation. Further proof of concept in automated rule interpretation also demonstrates the possibility of LLM-FuncMapper in interpreting complex regulatory clauses. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to introduce LLM for understanding and interpreting complex regulatory clauses, which may shed light on further adoption of LLM in the construction domain.

Due to the evolving modern software architecture and maintenance methods, more research efforts have been devoted to automated log analysis. In particular, machine learning (ML) has been widely used in log analysis tasks. In ML-based log analysis tasks, converting textual log data into numerical feature vectors is a critical and indispensable step. However, the impact of using different log representation techniques on the performance of the downstream models is not clear, which limits researchers and practitioners' opportunities of choosing the optimal log representation techniques in their automated log analysis workflows. Therefore, this work investigates and compares the commonly adopted log representation techniques from previous log analysis research. Particularly, we select six log representation techniques and evaluate them with seven ML models and four public log datasets (i.e., HDFS, BGL, Spirit and Thunderbird) in the context of log-based anomaly detection. We also examine the impacts of the log parsing process and the different feature aggregation approaches when they are employed with log representation techniques. From the experiments, we provide some heuristic guidelines for future researchers and developers to follow when designing an automated log analysis workflow. We believe our comprehensive comparison of log representation techniques can help researchers and practitioners better understand the characteristics of different log representation techniques and provide them with guidance for selecting the most suitable ones for their ML-based log analysis workflow.

    "abstract": "Keyphrase extraction (KPE) is an important task in Natural Language Processing for many scenarios, which aims to extract keyphrases that are present in a given document. Many existing supervised methods treat KPE as sequential labeling, span-level classification, or generative tasks. However, these methods lack the ability to utilize keyphrase information, which may result in biased results. In this study, we propose Diff-KPE, which leverages the supervised Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to guide the text diffusion process for generating enhanced keyphrase representations. Diff-KPE first generates the desired keyphrase embeddings conditioned on the entire document and then injects the generated keyphrase embeddings into each phrase representation. A ranking network and VIB are then optimized together with rank loss and classification loss, respectively. This design of Diff-KPE allows us to rank each candidate phrase by utilizing both the information of keyphrases and the document. Experiments show that Diff-KPE outperforms existing KPE methods on a large open domain keyphrase extraction benchmark, OpenKP, and a scientific domain dataset, KP20K. ",

Different from existing neural RGB-D reconstruction methods lacking either flexibility with a single neural map or scalability due to extra storage of feature grids, we propose a pure neural representation tackling both difficulties with a divide-and-conquer design. In our method, neural submaps are incrementally allocated alongside the scanning trajectory and efficiently learned with local neural bundle adjustments. The submaps can be refined individually in a back-end optimization and optimized jointly to realize submap-level loop closure. Meanwhile, we propose a hybrid tracking approach combining randomized and gradient-based pose optimizations. For the first time, randomized optimization is made possible in neural tracking with several key designs to the learning process, enabling efficient and robust tracking even under fast camera motions. The extensive evaluation demonstrates that our method attains higher reconstruction quality than the state of the arts for large-scale scenes and under fast camera motions. ",

Instead, we predicts multimodal trajectories while maintaining cross-view consistency. We presented a cross-view trajectory prediction method using shared 3D Queries (XVTP3D). We employ a set of 3D queries shared across views to generate multi-goals that are cross-view consistent. We also proposed a random mask method and coarse-to-fine cross-attention to capture robust cross-view features. As far as we know, this is the first work that introduces the outstanding top-down paradigm in BEV detection field to a trajectory prediction problem.

The ML classifier was used to predict the condition of the tool after the cutting process, which was determined in a binary class form indicating if the cutting tool was available or failed. After the training process, the Shapley criterion was used to explain the predictions of the trained ML classifier. Specifically, the significance of each input feature in the decision-making and classification was identified to explain the reasoning of the ML classifier predictions. After implementing the Shapley criterion on all testing datasets, the tool temperature was identified as the most significant feature in determining the classification of available versus failed cutting tools.

    "abstract": "This paper considers a cyber-physical system under an active eavesdropping attack. A remote legitimate user estimates the state of a linear plant from the state information received from a sensor. Transmissions from the sensor occur via an insecure and unreliable network. An active eavesdropper may perform an attack during system operation. The eavesdropper intercepts transmissions from the sensor, whilst simultaneously sabotaging the data transfer from the sensor to the remote legitimate user to harm its estimation performance. To maintain state confidentiality, we propose an encoding scheme that is activated on the detection of an eavesdropper. Our scheme transmits noise based on a pseudo-random indicator, pre-arranged at the legitimate user and sensor. The transmission of noise harms the eavesdropper's performance, more than that of the legitimate user. Using the proposed encoding scheme, we impair the eavesdropper's expected estimation performance, whilst minimising expected performance degradation at the legitimate user. We explore the trade-off between state confidentiality and legitimate user performance degradation through selecting the probability that the sensor transmits noise. Under certain design choices, the trace of the expected estimation error covariance of the eavesdropper is greater than that of the legitimate user. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the proposed encoding scheme. ",

To address this issue, EV charging control strategies have been developed to manage the switch between vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) modes for EVs. In this context, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has proven its effectiveness in EV charging control. However, existing MADRL-based approaches fail to consider the natural power flow of EV charging/discharging in the distribution network and ignore driver privacy. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel approach that combines multi-EV charging/discharging with a radial distribution network (RDN) operating under optimal power flow (OPF) to distribute power flow in real time. A mathematical model is developed to describe the RDN load. The EV charging control problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to find an optimal charging control strategy that balances V2G profits, RDN load, and driver anxiety. To effectively learn the optimal EV charging control strategy, a federated deep reinforcement learning algorithm named FedSAC is further proposed. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed algorithm in terms of the diversity of the charging control strategy, the power fluctuations on RDN, the convergence efficiency, and the generalization ability.

    "abstract": "In the past few years, cybersecurity is becoming very important due to the rise in internet users. The internet attacks such as Denial of service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks severely harm a website or server and make them unavailable to other users. Network Monitoring and control systems have found it challenging to identify the many classes of DoS and DDoS attacks since each operates uniquely. Hence a powerful technique is required for attack detection. Traditional machine learning techniques are inefficient in handling extensive network data and cannot extract high-level features for attack detection. Therefore, an effective deep learning-based intrusion detection system is developed in this paper for DoS and DDoS attack classification. This model includes various phases and starts with the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) based technique to address the class imbalance issue in the dataset. Then a deep learning algorithm based on ResNet-50 extracts the critical features for each class in the dataset. After that, an optimized AlexNet-based classifier is implemented for detecting the attacks separately, and the essential parameters of the classifier are optimized using the Atom search optimization algorithm. The proposed approach was evaluated on benchmark datasets, CCIDS2019 and UNSW-NB15, using key classification metrics and achieved 99.37% accuracy for the UNSW-NB15 dataset and 99.33% for the CICIDS2019 dataset. The investigational results demonstrate that the suggested approach performs superior to other competitive techniques in identifying DoS and DDoS attacks. ",

    "abstract": "The primary focus of this thesis is to make Sanskrit manuscripts more accessible to the end-users through natural language technologies. The morphological richness, compounding, free word orderliness, and low-resource nature of Sanskrit pose significant challenges for developing deep learning solutions. We identify four fundamental tasks, which are crucial for developing a robust NLP technology for Sanskrit: word segmentation, dependency parsing, compound type identification, and poetry analysis. The first task, Sanskrit Word Segmentation (SWS), is a fundamental text processing task for any other downstream applications. However, it is challenging due to the sandhi phenomenon that modifies characters at word boundaries. Similarly, the existing dependency parsing approaches struggle with morphologically rich and low-resource languages like Sanskrit. Compound type identification is also challenging for Sanskrit due to the context-sensitive semantic relation between components. All these challenges result in sub-optimal performance in NLP applications like question answering and machine translation. Finally, Sanskrit poetry has not been extensively studied in computational linguistics. While addressing these challenges, this thesis makes various contributions: (1) The thesis proposes linguistically-informed neural architectures for these tasks. (2) We showcase the interpretability and multilingual extension of the proposed systems. (3) Our proposed systems report state-of-the-art performance. (4) Finally, we present a neural toolkit named SanskritShala, a web-based application that provides real-time analysis of input for various NLP tasks. Overall, this thesis contributes to making Sanskrit manuscripts more accessible by developing robust NLP technology and releasing various resources, datasets, and web-based toolkit. ",

Specifically, most existing methods assume all aggregating features to be helpful, ignoring the semantically negative effect between inter-class edges under the message-passing mechanism. In this work, we present Semantic-aware Active learning framework for Graphs (SAG) to mitigate the semantic confusion problem. Pairwise similarities and dissimilarities of nodes with semantic features are introduced to jointly evaluate the node influence. A new prototype-based criterion and query policy are also designed to maintain diversity and class balance of the selected nodes, respectively.

However, existing speech phase prediction methods are constrained to recovering phase spectra with short frame shifts, which are considerably smaller than the theoretical upper bound required for exact waveform reconstruction of short-time Fourier transform (STFT). To tackle this issue, we present a novel long-frame-shift neural speech phase prediction (LFS-NSPP) method which enables precise prediction of long-frame-shift phase spectra from long-frame-shift log amplitude spectra. The proposed method consists of three stages: interpolation, prediction and decimation. The short-frame-shift log amplitude spectra are first constructed from long-frame-shift ones through frequency-by-frequency interpolation to enhance the spectral continuity, and then employed to predict short-frame-shift phase spectra using an NSPP model, thereby compensating for interpolation errors. Ultimately, the long-frame-shift phase spectra are obtained from short-frame-shift ones through frame-by-frame decimation. Experimental results show that the proposed LFS-NSPP method can yield superior quality in predicting long-frame-shift phase spectra than the original NSPP model and other signal-processing-based phase estimation algorithms.

By introducing multi-view constraints, we can obtain accurate camera pose and depth estimation from a monocular dense SLAM framework. Additionally, by incorporating constraints on the camera relative pose, we can apply trimming strategies and robust pose averaging on the multi-view object poses, resulting in more accurate and robust estimations of category-level object poses even in the absence of direct depth readings. Furthermore, we introduce a novel NOCS prediction network that significantly improves performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of our proposed method, even comparable to state-of-the-art RGB-D methods across public dataset sequences.

    "abstract": "We show that the VC-dimension of a graph can be computed in time $n^{\\log d+1} d^{O(d)}$, where $d$ is the degeneracy of the input graph. The core idea of our algorithm is a data structure to efficiently query the number of vertices that see a specific subset of vertices inside of a (small) query set. The construction of this data structure takes time $O(d2^dn)$, afterwards queries can be computed efficiently using fast M\\\"obius inversion. This data structure turns out to be useful for a range of tasks, especially for finding bipartite patterns in degenerate graphs, and we outline an efficient algorithms for counting the number of times specific patterns occur in a graph. The largest factor in the running time of this algorithm is $O(n^c)$, where $c$ is a parameter of the pattern we call its left covering number. Concrete applications of this algorithm include counting the number of (non-induced) bicliques in linear time, the number of co-matchings in quadratic time, as well as a constant-factor approximation of the ladder index in linear time. Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with several implementations and run experiments on more than 200 real-world datasets -- the largest of which has 8 million edges -- where we obtain interesting insights into the VC-dimension of real-world networks.

    "abstract": "The problem of enabling the coexistence of heterogeneous services, e.g., different ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) services and/or enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services, in the uplink is studied. Each service has its own error probability and blocklength constraints and the longer transmission block suffers from heterogeneous interference. Due to the latency concern, the decoding of URLLC messages cannot leverage successive interference cancellation (SIC) and should always be performed before the decoding of eMBB messages. This can significantly degrade the achievable rates of URLLC users when the interference from other users is strong. To overcome this issue, we propose a new transmission scheme based on discrete signaling and treating interference as noise decoding, i.e., without SIC. Guided by the deterministic model, we provide a systematic way to construct discrete signaling for handling heterogeneous interference effectively. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that the proposed scheme can perform close to the benchmark scheme based on capacity-achieving Gaussian signaling with the assumption of perfect SIC. ",

Prior DG ReID methods employ limited labeled data for training due to the high cost of annotation, which restricts further advances. To overcome the barriers of data and annotation, we propose to utilize large-scale unsupervised data for training. The key issue lies in how to mine identity information. To this end, we propose an Identity-seeking Self-supervised Representation learning (ISR) method. ISR constructs positive pairs from inter-frame images by modeling the instance association as a maximum-weight bipartite matching problem. A reliability-guided contrastive loss is further presented to suppress the adverse impact of noisy positive pairs, ensuring that reliable positive pairs dominate the learning process. The training cost of ISR scales approximately linearly with the data size, making it feasible to utilize large-scale data for training. The learned representation exhibits superior generalization ability. \\textbf{Without human annotation and fine-tuning, ISR achieves 87.0\\% Rank-1 on Market-1501 and 56.4\\% Rank-1 on MSMT17}, outperforming the best supervised domain-generalizable method by 5.0\\% and 19.5\\%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Pain is a complex concept that can interconnect with other concepts such as a disorder that might cause pain, a medication that might relieve pain, and so on. To fully understand the context of pain experienced by either an individual or across a population, we may need to examine all concepts related to pain and the relationships between them. This is especially useful when modeling pain that has been recorded in electronic health records. Knowledge graphs represent concepts and their relations by an interlinked network, enabling semantic and context-based reasoning in a computationally tractable form. These graphs can, however, be too large for efficient computation. Knowledge graph embeddings help to resolve this by representing the graphs in a low-dimensional vector space. These embeddings can then be used in various downstream tasks such as classification and link prediction. The various relations associated with pain which are required to construct such a knowledge graph can be obtained from external medical knowledge bases such as SNOMED CT, a hierarchical systematic nomenclature of medical terms. A knowledge graph built in this way could be further enriched with real-world examples of pain and its relations extracted from electronic health records. This paper describes the construction of such knowledge graph embedding models of pain concepts, extracted from the unstructured text of mental health electronic health records, combined with external knowledge created from relations described in SNOMED CT, and their evaluation on a subject-object link prediction task. The performance of the models was compared with other baseline models. ",

More specifically, it has been show that deep learning detectors are vulnerable to small changes on the input file. Given this vulnerability of deep learning detectors, we propose a practical defense against adversarial malware examples inspired by randomized smoothing. In our work, instead of employing Gaussian or Laplace noise when randomizing inputs, we propose a randomized ablation-based smoothing scheme that ablates a percentage of the bytes within an executable. During training, our randomized ablation-based smoothing scheme trains a base classifier based on ablated versions of the executable files. At test time, the final classification for a given input executable is taken as the class most commonly predicted by the classifier on a set of ablated versions of the original executable. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach we have empirically evaluated the proposed ablation-based model against various state-of-the-art evasion attacks on the BODMAS dataset. Results show greater robustness and generalization capabilities to adversarial malware examples in comparison to a non-smoothed classifier. ",

    "abstract": "Massive key performance indicators (KPIs) are monitored as multivariate time series data (MTS) to ensure the reliability of the software applications and service system. Accurately detecting the abnormality of MTS is very critical for subsequent fault elimination. The scarcity of anomalies and manual labeling has led to the development of various self-supervised MTS anomaly detection (AD) methods, which optimize an overall objective/loss encompassing all metrics' regression objectives/losses. However, our empirical study uncovers the prevalence of conflicts among metrics' regression objectives, causing MTS models to grapple with different losses. This critical aspect significantly impacts detection performance but has been overlooked in existing approaches. To address this problem, by mimicking the design of multi-gate mixture-of-experts (MMoE), we introduce CAD, a Conflict-aware multivariate KPI Anomaly Detection algorithm. CAD offers an exclusive structure for each metric to mitigate potential conflicts while fostering inter-metric promotions. Upon thorough investigation, we find that the poor performance of vanilla MMoE mainly comes from the input-output misalignment settings of MTS formulation and convergence issues arising from expansive tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a straightforward yet effective task-oriented metric selection and p&s (personalized and shared) gating mechanism, which establishes CAD as the first practicable multi-task learning (MTL) based MTS AD model. Evaluations on multiple public datasets reveal that CAD obtains an average F1-score of 0.943 across three public datasets, notably outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Market making (MM) has attracted significant attention in financial trading owing to its essential function in ensuring market liquidity. With strong capabilities in sequential decision-making, Reinforcement Learning (RL) technology has achieved remarkable success in quantitative trading. Nonetheless, most existing RL-based MM methods focus on optimizing single-price level strategies which fail at frequent order cancellations and loss of queue priority. Strategies involving multiple price levels align better with actual trading scenarios. However, given the complexity that multi-price level strategies involves a comprehensive trading action space, the challenge of effectively training profitable RL agents for MM persists. Inspired by the efficient workflow of professional human market makers, we propose Imitative Market Maker (IMM), a novel RL framework leveraging both knowledge from suboptimal signal-based experts and direct policy interactions to develop multi-price level MM strategies efficiently. The framework start with introducing effective state and action representations adept at encoding information about multi-price level orders. Furthermore, IMM integrates a representation learning unit capable of capturing both short- and long-term market trends to mitigate adverse selection risk. Subsequently, IMM formulates an expert strategy based on signals and trains the agent through the integration of RL and imitation learning techniques, leading to efficient learning. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate that IMM outperforms current RL-based market making strategies in terms of several financial criteria. The findings of the ablation study substantiate the effectiveness of the model components. ",

Our entire network adopts a two-stage model, including a frequency-guided coarse localization stage and a detail-preserving fine localization stage. With the multi-level features extracted by the backbone, we design a flexible frequency perception module based on octave convolution for coarse positioning. Then, we design the correction fusion module to step-by-step integrate the high-level features through the prior-guided correction and cross-layer feature channel association, and finally combine them with the shallow features to achieve the detailed correction of the camouflaged objects.

Traditionally, these properties have been determined through theoretical calculations and simulations. However, it is not practical to perform such calculations on every single candidate material. Recently, a combination method of the theoretical calculation and machine learning has emerged, that involves training machine learning models on a subset of theoretical calculation results to construct a surrogate model that can be applied to the remaining materials. On the other hand, a technique called pre-training is used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. Pre-training involves training the model on pretext task, which is different from the target task, before training the model on the target task. This process aims to extract the input data features, stabilizing the learning process and improving its accuracy. However, in the case of molecular property prediction, there is a strong imbalance in the distribution of input data and features, which may lead to biased learning towards frequently occurring data during pre-training. In this study, we propose an effective pre-training method that addresses the imbalance in input data. We aim to improve the final accuracy by modifying the loss function of the existing representative pre-training method, node masking, to compensate the imbalance. We have investigated and assessed the impact of our proposed imbalance compensation on pre-training and the final prediction accuracy through experiments and evaluations using benchmark of molecular property prediction models.

To work with auxiliary tasks, we propose a novel auxiliary-adapted transformer, which can handle incomplete, corrupted motion data and achieve coordinate recovery via capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Through auxiliary tasks, the auxiliary-adapted transformer is promoted to capture more comprehensive spatial-temporal dependencies among body joints' coordinates, leading to better feature learning.

    "abstract": "In recent years, neural code translation has gained increasing attention. While most of the research focuses on improving model architectures and training processes, we notice that the evaluation process and benchmark for code translation models are severely limited: they primarily treat source code as natural languages and provide a holistic accuracy score while disregarding the full spectrum of model capabilities across different translation types and complexity. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of four state-of-the-art models and analyze in-depth the advantages and limitations of three existing benchmarks. Based on the empirical results, we develop a taxonomy that categorizes code translation tasks into four primary types according to their complexity and knowledge dependence: token level (type 1), syntactic level (type 2), library level (type 3), and algorithm level (type 4). We then conduct a thorough analysis of how existing approaches perform across these four categories. Our findings indicate that while state-of-the-art code translation models excel in type-1 and type-2 translations, they struggle with knowledge-dependent ones such as type-3 and type-4. Existing benchmarks are biased towards trivial translations, such as keyword mapping. To overcome these limitations, we construct G-TransEval, a new benchmark by manually curating type-3 and type-4 translation pairs and unit test cases. Results on our new benchmark suggest that G-TransEval can exhibit more comprehensive and finer-grained capability of code translation models and thus provide a more rigorous evaluation. Our studies also provide more insightful findings and suggestions for future research, such as building type-3 and type-4 training data and ensembling multiple pretraining approaches. ",

    "title": "CONVERT:Contrastive Graph Clustering with Reliable Augmentation",
    "abstract": "Contrastive graph node clustering via learnable data augmentation is a hot research spot in the field of unsupervised graph learning. The existing methods learn the sampling distribution of a pre-defined augmentation to generate data-driven augmentations automatically. Although promising clustering performance has been achieved, we observe that these strategies still rely on pre-defined augmentations, the semantics of the augmented graph can easily drift. The reliability of the augmented view semantics for contrastive learning can not be guaranteed, thus limiting the model performance. To address these problems, we propose a novel CONtrastiVe Graph ClustEring network with Reliable AugmenTation (COVERT). Specifically, in our method, the data augmentations are processed by the proposed reversible perturb-recover network. It distills reliable semantic information by recovering the perturbed latent embeddings. Moreover, to further guarantee the reliability of semantics, a novel semantic loss is presented to constrain the network via quantifying the perturbation and recovery. Lastly, a label-matching mechanism is designed to guide the model by clustering information through aligning the semantic labels and the selected high-confidence clustering pseudo labels. Extensive experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We release the code and appendix of CONVERT at https://github.com/xihongyang1999/CONVERT on GitHub. ",

This paper aims to enhance the generalization capabilities of PIML, facilitating practical, real-world applications where accurate predictions in unexplored regions are crucial. We leverage the inherent causality and temporal sequential characteristics of PDE solutions to fuse PIML models with recurrent neural architectures based on systems of ordinary differential equations, referred to as neural oscillators. Through effectively capturing long-time dependencies and mitigating the exploding and vanishing gradient problem, neural oscillators foster improved generalization in PIML tasks. Extensive experimentation involving time-dependent nonlinear PDEs and biharmonic beam equations demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach. Incorporating neural oscillators outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark problems across various metrics. Consequently, the proposed method improves the generalization capabilities of PIML, providing accurate solutions for extrapolation and prediction beyond the training data. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-View Stereo~(MVS) is a fundamental problem in geometric computer vision which aims to reconstruct a scene using multi-view images with known camera parameters. However, the mainstream approaches represent the scene with a fixed all-pixel depth range and equal depth interval partition, which will result in inadequate utilization of depth planes and imprecise depth estimation. In this paper, we present a novel multi-stage coarse-to-fine framework to achieve adaptive all-pixel depth range and depth interval. We predict a coarse depth map in the first stage, then an Adaptive Depth Range Prediction module is proposed in the second stage to zoom in the scene by leveraging the reference image and the obtained depth map in the first stage and predict a more accurate all-pixel depth range for the following stages. In the third and fourth stages, we propose an Adaptive Depth Interval Adjustment module to achieve adaptive variable interval partition for pixel-wise depth range. The depth interval distribution in this module is normalized by Z-score, which can allocate dense depth hypothesis planes around the potential ground truth depth value and vice versa to achieve more accurate depth estimation. Extensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets~(DTU, TnT, BlendedMVS, ETH 3D) demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and yields competitive generalization ability. Particularly, our method achieves the highest Acc and Overall on the DTU dataset, while attaining the highest Recall and $F_{1}$-score on the Tanks and Temples intermediate and advanced dataset. Moreover, our method also achieves the lowest $e_{1}$ and $e_{3}$ on the BlendedMVS dataset and the highest Acc and $F_{1}$-score on the ETH 3D dataset, surpassing all listed methods.Project website: https://github.com/zs670980918/ARAI-MVSNet ",

To learn fine-grained distortion representations, we then associate different image patches with their specific distortion patterns based on the fisheye model, and further subtly design an innovative unified distortion-aware pretext task for their learning. The transfer performance on the downstream rectification task is remarkably boosted, which verifies the effectiveness of the learned representations. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art algorithms as well as its strong generalization ability on real-world fisheye images.

The state-of-the art methods include Wavelet transform, Fourier transform, and Wavelet-neuro fuzzy methods-based system for fault detection and classification. However, the accuracy of these state-of-the-art methods diminishes during variable conditions such as changes in wind speed, high impedance faults, and the changes in the series compensation level. Specifically, in Wavelet transform based methods, the threshold values need to be adapted based on the variable field conditions. To solve this problem, this paper has proposed a Wavelet-ANN based fault detection method where Wavelet is used as an identifier and ANN is used as a classifier for detecting various fault cases. This methodology is also effective under SSR condition. The proposed methodology is evaluated on various fault and non-fault cases generated on an IEEE first benchmark model under varying compensation levels from 20% to 55%, impedance faults, and wind velocity from 6m/sec to 10m/sec using MATLAB/Simulink, OPALRT(OP4510) manufactured real-time digital simulator environment, Arduino board I/O ports communicating with external PC in which ANN model dumped, using Arduino support package of MATLAB.

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification is critical for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world applications. An Auxiliary Uncertainty Estimator (AuxUE) is one of the most effective means to estimate the uncertainty of the main task prediction without modifying the main task model. To be considered robust, an AuxUE must be capable of maintaining its performance and triggering higher uncertainties while encountering Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs, i.e., to provide robust aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. However, for vision regression tasks, current AuxUE designs are mainly adopted for aleatoric uncertainty estimates, and AuxUE robustness has not been explored. In this work, we propose a generalized AuxUE scheme for more robust uncertainty quantification on regression tasks. Concretely, to achieve a more robust aleatoric uncertainty estimation, different distribution assumptions are considered for heteroscedastic noise, and Laplace distribution is finally chosen to approximate the prediction error. For epistemic uncertainty, we propose a novel solution named Discretization-Induced Dirichlet pOsterior (DIDO), which models the Dirichlet posterior on the discretized prediction error. Extensive experiments on age estimation, monocular depth estimation, and super-resolution tasks show that our proposed method can provide robust uncertainty estimates in the face of noisy inputs and that it can be scalable to both image-level and pixel-wise tasks.

These UAM aircraft are conceived to operate from small airports called vertiports each comprising multiple take-off/landing and battery-recharging spots. Since they might be situated in dense urban areas and need to handle many aircraft landings and take-offs each hour, managing this schedule in real-time becomes challenging for a traditional air-traffic controller but instead calls for an automated solution. This paper provides a novel approach to this problem of Urban Air Mobility - Vertiport Schedule Management (UAM-VSM), which leverages graph reinforcement learning to generate decision-support policies. Here the designated physical spots within the vertiport's airspace and the vehicles being managed are represented as two separate graphs, with feature extraction performed through a graph convolutional network (GCN). Extracted features are passed onto perceptron layers to decide actions such as continue to hover or cruise, continue idling or take-off, or land on an allocated vertiport spot. Performance is measured based on delays, safety (no. of collisions) and battery consumption. Through realistic simulations in AirSim applied to scaled down multi-rotor vehicles, our results demonstrate the suitability of using graph reinforcement learning to solve the UAM-VSM problem and its superiority to basic reinforcement learning (with graph embeddings) or random choice baselines.

Moreover, we successfully test our proposal in a graph regression scenario where edge features are of fundamental importance, and we show that the learned edge representation provides substantial performance improvements against the original model on three link prediction tasks. By keeping the computational complexity linear in the number of edges, the proposed model is amenable to large-scale graph processing. ",

Unlike previous methods which aggregate 2D features into 3D voxels without considering geometry, ImGeoNet learns to induce geometry from multi-view images to alleviate the confusion arising from voxels of free space, and during the inference phase, only images from multiple views are required. Besides, a powerful pre-trained 2D feature extractor can be leveraged by our representation, leading to a more robust performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of ImGeoNet, we conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on three indoor datasets, namely ARKitScenes, ScanNetV2, and ScanNet200. The results demonstrate that ImGeoNet outperforms the current state-of-the-art multi-view image-based method, ImVoxelNet, on all three datasets in terms of detection accuracy. In addition, ImGeoNet shows great data efficiency by achieving results comparable to ImVoxelNet with 100 views while utilizing only 40 views. Furthermore, our studies indicate that our proposed image-induced geometry-aware representation can enable image-based methods to attain superior detection accuracy than the seminal point cloud-based method, VoteNet, in two practical scenarios: (1) scenarios where point clouds are sparse and noisy, such as in ARKitScenes, and (2) scenarios involve diverse object classes, particularly classes of small objects, as in the case in ScanNet200.

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) is expected to become a pervasive component in enabling shared virtual experiences. In order to facilitate collaboration among multiple users, it is crucial for multi-user AR applications to establish a consensus on the \"shared state\" of the virtual world and its augmentations, through which they interact within augmented reality spaces. Current methods to create and access shared state collect sensor data from devices (e.g., camera images), process them, and integrate them into the shared state. However, this process introduces new vulnerabilities and opportunities for attacks. Maliciously writing false data to \"poison\" the shared state is a major concern for the security of the downstream victims that depend on it. Another type of vulnerability arises when reading the shared state; by providing false inputs, an attacker can view hologram augmentations at locations they are not allowed to access. In this work, we demonstrate a series of novel attacks on multiple AR frameworks with shared states, focusing on three publicly-accessible frameworks. We show that these frameworks, while using different underlying implementations, scopes, and mechanisms to read from and write to the shared state, have shared vulnerability to a unified threat model. Our evaluation of these state-of-art AR applications demonstrates reliable attacks both on updating and accessing shared state across the different systems. To defend against such threats, we discuss a number of potential mitigation strategies that can help enhance the security of multi-user AR applications. ",

Despite the progress in natural language processing for social media mining, a gap remains in analyzing health-related texts on social discourse in the context of events.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to define event categories for characterizing information-seeking in OUD social discourse. Guided by domain experts, we develop TREAT-ISE, a novel multilabel treatment information-seeking event dataset to analyze online discourse on an event-based framework. This dataset contains Reddit posts on information-seeking events related to recovery from OUD, where each post is annotated based on the type of events. We also establish a strong performance benchmark (77.4% F1 score) for the task by employing several machine learning and deep learning classifiers.

Our experimental results showed that BERT generally outperformed the rest of the models regarding recall, followed by ADA, Gensim, FastText, and TFIDF. Our study provides insights into the effectiveness of different embedding methods for retrieving similar bug reports and highlights the impact of selecting the appropriate one for this task.

    "abstract": "Message passing neural networks have shown a lot of success on graph-structured data. However, there are many instances where message passing can lead to over-smoothing or fail when neighboring nodes belong to different classes. In this work, we introduce a simple yet general framework for improving learning in message passing neural networks. Our approach essentially upsamples edges in the original graph by adding \"slow nodes\" at each edge that can mediate communication between a source and a target node. Our method only modifies the input graph, making it plug-and-play and easy to use with existing models. To understand the benefits of slowing down message passing, we provide theoretical and empirical analyses. We report results on several supervised and self-supervised benchmarks, and show improvements across the board, notably in heterophilic conditions where adjacent nodes are more likely to have different labels. Finally, we show how our approach can be used to generate augmentations for self-supervised learning, where slow nodes are randomly introduced into different edges in the graph to generate multi-scale views with variable path lengths.

    "abstract": "Graph alignment refers to the task of finding the vertex correspondence between two positively correlated graphs. Extensive study has been done on polynomial-time algorithms for the graph alignment problem under the Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi graph pair model, where the two graphs are Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi graphs with edge probability $q_\\mathrm{u}$, correlated under certain vertex correspondence. To achieve exact recovery of the vertex correspondence, all existing algorithms at least require the edge correlation coefficient $\\rho_\\mathrm{u}$ between the two graphs to satisfy $\\rho_\\mathrm{u} > \\sqrt{\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha \\approx 0.338$ is Otter's tree-counting constant. Moreover, it is conjectured in [1] that no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve exact recovery under weak edge correlation $\\rho_\\mathrm{u}<\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. In this paper, we show that with a vanishing amount of additional attribute information, exact recovery is polynomial-time feasible under vanishing edge correlation $\\rho_\\mathrm{u} \\ge n^{-\\Theta(1)}$. We identify a local tree structure, which incorporates one layer of user information and one layer of attribute information, and apply the subgraph counting technique to such structures. A polynomial-time algorithm is proposed that recovers the vertex correspondence for all but a vanishing fraction of vertices. We then further refine the algorithm output to achieve exact recovery. The motivation for considering additional attribute information comes from the widely available side information in real-world applications, such as the user's birthplace and educational background on LinkedIn and Twitter social networks.

The primary objective centers on improving accuracy and robustness in detecting buoys across a spectrum of real-world scenarios. A diverse dataset sourced from mussel farms is captured and labeled for training, encompassing imagery taken from cameras mounted on both floating platforms and traversing vessels, capturing various lighting and weather conditions. To establish an effective deep learning model for buoy detection with a limited number of labeled data, we employ transfer learning techniques. This involves adapting a pre-trained object detection model to create a specialized deep learning buoy detection model. We explore different pre-trained models, including YOLO and its variants, alongside data diversity to investigate their effects on model performance. Our investigation demonstrates a significant enhancement in buoy detection performance through deep learning, accompanied by improved generalization across diverse weather conditions, highlighting the practical effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Camera-based 3D object detection in BEV (Bird's Eye View) space has drawn great attention over the past few years. Dense detectors typically follow a two-stage pipeline by first constructing a dense BEV feature and then performing object detection in BEV space, which suffers from complex view transformations and high computation cost. On the other side, sparse detectors follow a query-based paradigm without explicit dense BEV feature construction, but achieve worse performance than the dense counterparts. In this paper, we find that the key to mitigate this performance gap is the adaptability of the detector in both BEV and image space. To achieve this goal, we propose SparseBEV, a fully sparse 3D object detector that outperforms the dense counterparts. SparseBEV contains three key designs, which are (1) scale-adaptive self attention to aggregate features with adaptive receptive field in BEV space, (2) adaptive spatio-temporal sampling to generate sampling locations under the guidance of queries, and (3) adaptive mixing to decode the sampled features with dynamic weights from the queries. On the test split of nuScenes, SparseBEV achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 67.5 NDS. On the val split, SparseBEV achieves 55.8 NDS while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 23.5 FPS. Code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/SparseBEV. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, the community has made tremendous progress in developing effective methods for point cloud video understanding that learn from massive amounts of labeled data. However, annotating point cloud videos is usually notoriously expensive. Moreover, training via one or only a few traditional tasks (e.g., classification) may be insufficient to learn subtle details of the spatio-temporal structure existing in point cloud videos. In this paper, we propose a Masked Spatio-Temporal Structure Prediction (MaST-Pre) method to capture the structure of point cloud videos without human annotations. MaST-Pre is based on spatio-temporal point-tube masking and consists of two self-supervised learning tasks. First, by reconstructing masked point tubes, our method is able to capture the appearance information of point cloud videos. Second, to learn motion, we propose a temporal cardinality difference prediction task that estimates the change in the number of points within a point tube. In this way, MaST-Pre is forced to model the spatial and temporal structure in point cloud videos. Extensive experiments on MSRAction-3D, NTU-RGBD, NvGesture, and SHREC'17 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

Previous methods commonly conduct representation learning at the clip or frame level and cannot well capture fine-grained semantics. Instead of contrasting the representations of clips or frames, in this paper, we propose a unified self-supervised framework by conducting contrastive learning at the point level. Moreover, we introduce a new pretext task by achieving semantic alignment of superpoints, which further facilitates the representations to capture semantic cues at multiple scales. In addition, due to the high redundancy in the temporal dimension of dynamic point clouds, directly conducting contrastive learning at the point level usually leads to massive undesired negatives and insufficient modeling of positive representations. To remedy this, we propose a selection strategy to retain proper negatives and make use of high-similarity samples from other instances as positive supplements. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms supervised counterparts on a wide range of downstream tasks and demonstrates the superior transferability of the learned representations. ",

We describe and discuss randomized controlled trials and bandit-based approaches from the active category. We then describe classical approaches, such as matching and inverse probability weighting, in the passive category, followed by more recent deep learning based algorithms.

The framework locates actions in videos by detecting the action evolution process. To encode the action evolution, we quantify a complete action process into 101 ordered stages (0\\%, 1\\%, ..., 100\\%), referred to as action progressions. We then train a neural network to recognize the action progressions. The framework detects action boundaries by detecting complete action processes in the videos, e.g., a video segment with detected action progressions closely follow the sequence 0\\%, 1\\%, ..., 100\\%. The framework offers three major advantages: (1) Our neural networks are trained end-to-end, contrasting conventional methods that optimize modules separately; (2) The APN is trained using action frames exclusively, enabling models to be trained on action classification datasets and robust to videos with temporal background styles differing from those in training; (3) Our framework effectively avoids detecting incomplete actions and excels in detecting long-lasting actions due to the fine-grained and explicit encoding of the temporal structure of actions. Leveraging these advantages, the APN achieves competitive performance and significantly surpasses its counterparts in detecting long-lasting actions. With an IoU threshold of 0.5, the APN achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 58.3\\% on the THUMOS14 dataset and 98.9\\% mAP on the DFMAD70 dataset. ",

Each agent also has a bias parameter denoting her level of resistance to social pressure. At every step, the agents simultaneously update their declared opinions according to their neighbors' aggregate past declared opinions, their inherent beliefs, and their bias parameters. We study the asymptotic behavior of this opinion dynamics model and show that agents' declaration probabilities converge almost surely in the limit using Lyapunov theory and stochastic approximation techniques.

In this paper, we propose the first deep forgery detection approach for fingerprint images, which combines unique ridge features of fingerprint and generation artifacts of the GAN-generated images, to the best of our knowledge. Specifically, we firstly construct a ridge stream, which exploits the grayscale variations along the ridges to extract unique fingerprint-specific features. Then, we construct a generation artifact stream, in which the FFT-based spectrums of the input fingerprint images are exploited, to extract more robust generation artifact features. At last, the unique ridge features and generation artifact features are fused for binary classification (\\textit{i.e.}, real or fake). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective and robust with low complexities. ",

In this work, we investigate the importance of the transform layers to the reported success of transform based neural operators. In particular, we record the cost in terms of performance, if all the transform layers are replaced by learnable linear layers. Surprisingly, we observe that linear layers suffice to provide performance comparable to the best-known transform-based layers and seem to do so with a compute time advantage as well.

    "abstract": "The key to the success of few-shot segmentation (FSS) lies in how to effectively utilize support samples. Most solutions compress support foreground (FG) features into prototypes, but lose some spatial details. Instead, others use cross attention to fuse query features with uncompressed support FG. Query FG could be fused with support FG, however, query background (BG) cannot find matched BG features in support FG, yet inevitably integrates dissimilar features. Besides, as both query FG and BG are combined with support FG, they get entangled, thereby leading to ineffective segmentation. To cope with these issues, we design a self-calibrated cross attention (SCCA) block. For efficient patch-based attention, query and support features are firstly split into patches. Then, we design a patch alignment module to align each query patch with its most similar support patch for better cross attention. Specifically, SCCA takes a query patch as Q, and groups the patches from the same query image and the aligned patches from the support image as K&V. In this way, the query BG features are fused with matched BG features (from query patches), and thus the aforementioned issues will be mitigated. Moreover, when calculating SCCA, we design a scaled-cosine mechanism to better utilize the support features for similarity calculation. Extensive experiments conducted on PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i demonstrate the superiority of our model, e.g., the mIoU score under 5-shot setting on COCO-20^i is 5.6%+ better than previous state-of-the-arts.

By taking advantage of contrastive representation learning, We introduce an innovative end-to-end self-supervised deep learning framework carefully developed to identify anomalous patterns in both univariate and multivariate time series data. By taking advantage of contrastive representation learning, CARLA effectively generates robust representations for time series windows. It achieves this by 1) learning similar representations for temporally close windows and dissimilar representations for windows and their equivalent anomalous windows and 2) employing a self-supervised approach to classify normal/anomalous representations of windows based on their nearest/furthest neighbours in the representation space. Most of the existing models focus on learning normal behaviour. The normal boundary is often tightly defined, which can result in slight deviations being classified as anomalies, resulting in a high false positive rate and limited ability to generalise normal patterns. CARLA's contrastive learning methodology promotes the production of highly consistent and discriminative predictions, thereby empowering us to adeptly address the inherent challenges associated with anomaly detection in time series data. Through extensive experimentation on 7 standard real-world time series anomaly detection benchmark datasets, CARLA demonstrates F1 and AU-PR superior to existing state-of-the-art results. Our research highlights the immense potential of contrastive representation learning in advancing the field of time series anomaly detection, thus paving the way for novel applications and in-depth exploration in this domain.

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting; the loss of old knowledge upon acquiring new knowledge, is a pitfall faced by deep neural networks in real-world applications. Many prevailing solutions to this problem rely on storing exemplars (previously encountered data), which may not be feasible in applications with memory limitations or privacy constraints. Therefore, the recent focus has been on Non-Exemplar based Class Incremental Learning (NECIL) where a model incrementally learns about new classes without using any past exemplars. However, due to the lack of old data, NECIL methods struggle to discriminate between old and new classes causing their feature representations to overlap. We propose NAPA-VQ: Neighborhood Aware Prototype Augmentation with Vector Quantization, a framework that reduces this class overlap in NECIL. We draw inspiration from Neural Gas to learn the topological relationships in the feature space, identifying the neighboring classes that are most likely to get confused with each other. This neighborhood information is utilized to enforce strong separation between the neighboring classes as well as to generate old class representative prototypes that can better aid in obtaining a discriminative decision boundary between old and new classes. Our comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-Subset demonstrate that NAPA-VQ outperforms the State-of-the-art NECIL methods by an average improvement of 5%, 2%, and 4% in accuracy and 10%, 3%, and 9% in forgetting respectively.

While spectrograms have demonstrated their capability for anti-spoofing, complementary information presented in multi-order spectral patterns have not been well explored, which limits their effectiveness for varying spoofing attacks. Therefore, we propose a novel deep learning method with a spectral fusion-reconstruction strategy, namely S2pecNet, to utilise multi-order spectral patterns for robust audio anti-spoofing representations. Specifically, spectral patterns up to second-order are fused in a coarse-to-fine manner and two branches are designed for the fine-level fusion from the spectral and temporal contexts. A reconstruction from the fused representation to the input spectrograms further reduces the potential fused information loss.

    "title": "Rethinking Image Forgery Detection via Contrastive Learning and  Unsupervised Clustering",
    "abstract": "Image forgery detection aims to detect and locate forged regions in an image. Most existing forgery detection algorithms formulate classification problems to classify pixels into forged or pristine. However, the definition of forged and pristine pixels is only relative within one single image, e.g., a forged region in image A is actually a pristine one in its source image B (splicing forgery). Such a relative definition has been severely overlooked by existing methods, which unnecessarily mix forged (pristine) regions across different images into the same category. To resolve this dilemma, we propose the FOrensic ContrAstive cLustering (FOCAL) method, a novel, simple yet very effective paradigm based on contrastive learning and unsupervised clustering for the image forgery detection. Specifically, FOCAL 1) utilizes pixel-level contrastive learning to supervise the high-level forensic feature extraction in an image-by-image manner, explicitly reflecting the above relative definition; 2) employs an on-the-fly unsupervised clustering algorithm (instead of a trained one) to cluster the learned features into forged/pristine categories, further suppressing the cross-image influence from training data; and 3) allows to further boost the detection performance via simple feature-level concatenation without the need of retraining. Extensive experimental results over six public testing datasets demonstrate that our proposed FOCAL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competing algorithms by big margins: +24.3% on Coverage, +18.6% on Columbia, +17.5% on FF++, +14.2% on MISD, +13.5% on CASIA and +10.3% on NIST in terms of IoU. The paradigm of FOCAL could bring fresh insights and serve as a novel benchmark for the image forgery detection task. The code is available at https://github.com/HighwayWu/FOCAL. ",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in code completion. However, due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge, they may not be optimal in completing code that requires intensive domain knowledge for example completing the library names. Although there are several works that have confirmed the effectiveness of fine-tuning techniques to adapt language models for code completion in specific domains. They are limited by the need for constant fine-tuning of the model when the project is in constant iteration. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose $k$NM-LM, a retrieval-augmented language model (R-LM), that integrates domain knowledge into language models without fine-tuning. Different from previous techniques, our approach is able to automatically adapt to different language models and domains. Specifically, it utilizes the in-domain code to build the retrieval-based database decoupled from LM, and then combines it with LM through Bayesian inference to complete the code. The extensive experiments on the completion of intra-project and intra-scenario have confirmed that $k$NM-LM brings about appreciable enhancements when compared to CodeGPT and UnixCoder. A deep analysis of our tool including the responding speed, storage usage, specific type code completion, and API invocation completion has confirmed that $k$NM-LM provides satisfactory performance, which renders it highly appropriate for domain adaptive code completion. Furthermore, our approach operates without the requirement for direct access to the language model's parameters. As a result, it can seamlessly integrate with black-box code completion models, making it easy to integrate our approach as a plugin to further enhance the performance of these models. ",

    "abstract": "Learning per-point semantic features from the hierarchical feature pyramid is essential for point cloud semantic segmentation. However, most previous methods suffered from ambiguous region features or failed to refine per-point features effectively, which leads to information loss and ambiguous semantic identification. To resolve this, we propose Retro-FPN to model the per-point feature prediction as an explicit and retrospective refining process, which goes through all the pyramid layers to extract semantic features explicitly for each point. Its key novelty is a retro-transformer for summarizing semantic contexts from the previous layer and accordingly refining the features in the current stage. In this way, the categorization of each point is conditioned on its local semantic pattern. Specifically, the retro-transformer consists of a local cross-attention block and a semantic gate unit. The cross-attention serves to summarize the semantic pattern retrospectively from the previous layer. And the gate unit carefully incorporates the summarized contexts and refines the current semantic features. Retro-FPN is a pluggable neural network that applies to hierarchical decoders. By integrating Retro-FPN with three representative backbones, including both point-based and voxel-based methods, we show that Retro-FPN can significantly improve performance over state-of-the-art backbones. Comprehensive experiments on widely used benchmarks can justify the effectiveness of our design. The source is available at https://github.com/AllenXiangX/Retro-FPN ",

Towards this end, graph theory is used to allow us to synthesize the distributed controller with a stability guarantee. Due to the fact that the parameter uncertainties only arise in the vessels' dynamic model, the backstepping control technique is then employed. Subsequently, to overcome the difficulties in handling time-varying and unknown systems, an online learning procedure is developed in the proposed distributed formation control protocol. Moreover, modeling errors, environmental disturbances, and measurement noises are considered and tackled by introducing a neurodynamics model in the controller design to obtain a robust solution. Then, the stability analysis of the overall closed-loop system under the proposed scheme is provided to ensure the robust adaptive performance at the theoretical level. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are conducted to further verify the efficacy of the presented distributed control protocol. ",

To address this issue, we propose Audio-Visual Glance Network (AVGN), which leverages the commonly available audio and visual modalities to efficiently process the spatio-temporally important parts of a video. AVGN firstly divides the video into snippets of image-audio clip pair and employs lightweight unimodal encoders to extract global visual features and audio features. To identify the important temporal segments, we use an Audio-Visual Temporal Saliency Transformer (AV-TeST) that estimates the saliency scores of each frame. To further increase efficiency in the spatial dimension, AVGN processes only the important patches instead of the whole images. We use an Audio-Enhanced Spatial Patch Attention (AESPA) module to produce a set of enhanced coarse visual features, which are fed to a policy network that produces the coordinates of the important patches. This approach enables us to focus only on the most important spatio-temporally parts of the video, leading to more efficient video recognition. Moreover, we incorporate various training techniques and multi-modal feature fusion to enhance the robustness and effectiveness of our AVGN. By combining these strategies, our AVGN sets new state-of-the-art performance in multiple video recognition benchmarks while achieving faster processing speed. ",

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of modern computing systems has led to a growing interest in informative run-time logs. Various log-based anomaly detection techniques have been proposed to ensure software reliability. However, their implementation in the industry has been limited due to the lack of high-quality public log resources as training datasets. While some log datasets are available for anomaly detection, they suffer from limitations in (1) comprehensiveness of log events; (2) scalability over diverse systems; and (3) flexibility of log utility. To address these limitations, we propose AutoLog, the first automated log generation methodology for anomaly detection. AutoLog uses program analysis to generate run-time log sequences without actually running the system. AutoLog starts with probing comprehensive logging statements associated with the call graphs of an application. Then, it constructs execution graphs for each method after pruning the call graphs to find log-related execution paths in a scalable manner. Finally, AutoLog propagates the anomaly label to each acquired execution path based on human knowledge. It generates flexible log sequences by walking along the log execution paths with controllable parameters. Experiments on 50 popular Java projects show that AutoLog acquires significantly more (9x-58x) log events than existing log datasets from the same system, and generates log messages much faster (15x) with a single machine than existing passive data collection approaches. We hope AutoLog can facilitate the benchmarking and adoption of automated log analysis techniques. ",

To address this problem, this paper develops a novel consensus based optimal coordination protocol and a robust controller, which adopts a hierarchical architecture. On the top layer, the spherical coordinate transform is introduced to tackle the nonholonomic constraint, and then a distributed optimal motion coordination strategy is developed. As a result, the optimal formation tracking of UUVs fleet can be achieved, and the constraints are fulfilled. To realize the generated optimal commands better and, meanwhile, deal with the underactuation, at the lower-level control loop a neurodynamics based robust backstepping controller is designed, and in particular, the issue of \"explosion of terms\" appearing in conventional backstepping based controllers is avoided and control activities are improved. The stability of the overall UUVs formation system is established to ensure that all the states of the UUVs are uniformly ultimately bounded in the presence of unknown disturbances. Finally, extensive simulation comparisons are made to illustrate the superiority and effectiveness of the derived optimal formation tracking protocol. ",

Recent works regard it as a deep matching problem and have made significant progress.

In this work, we propose a multi-scale target-aware framework to couple feature extraction and correlation matching in a unified pipeline. In contrast to previous methods, we design a target-aware attention mechanism that jointly learns features and performs correlation matching between the probe and donor images. Our approach can effectively promote the collaborative learning of related patches, and perform mutual promotion of feature learning and correlation matching. Additionally, in order to handle scale transformations, we introduce a multi-scale projection method, which can be readily integrated into our target-aware framework that enables the attention process to be conducted between tokens containing information of varying scales. Our experiments demonstrate that our model, which uses a unified pipeline, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets and is robust against scale transformations. ",

In this paper, we consider a novel risk-sensitive perspective to enhance the robustness of legged locomotion. Specifically, we employ a distributional value function learned by quantile regression to model the aleatoric uncertainty of environments, and perform risk-averse policy learning by optimizing the worst-case scenarios via a risk distortion measure. Extensive experiments in both simulation environments and a real Aliengo robot demonstrate that our method is efficient in handling various external disturbances, and the resulting policy exhibits improved robustness in harsh and uncertain situations in legged locomotion.

    "abstract": "In the field of monocular 3D detection, it is common practice to utilize scene geometric clues to enhance the detector's performance. However, many existing works adopt these clues explicitly such as estimating a depth map and back-projecting it into 3D space. This explicit methodology induces sparsity in 3D representations due to the increased dimensionality from 2D to 3D, and leads to substantial information loss, especially for distant and occluded objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose MonoNeRD, a novel detection framework that can infer dense 3D geometry and occupancy. Specifically, we model scenes with Signed Distance Functions (SDF), facilitating the production of dense 3D representations. We treat these representations as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and then employ volume rendering to recover RGB images and depth maps. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce volume rendering for M3D, and demonstrates the potential of implicit reconstruction for image-based 3D perception. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI-3D benchmark and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MonoNeRD. Codes are available at https://github.com/cskkxjk/MonoNeRD. ",

Classical iterative deconvolution approaches amplify noise and require careful parameter selection for an optimal trade-off between sharpness and grain. Deep learning methods allow for flexible parametrization of the noise and learning its properties directly from the data. Recently, self-supervised blind-spot neural networks were successfully adopted for image deconvolution by including a known point-spread function in the end-to-end training. However, their practical application has been limited to 2D images in the biomedical domain because it implies large kernels that are poorly optimized. We tackle this problem with Fast Fourier Transform convolutions that provide training speed-up in 3D microscopy deconvolution tasks. Further, we propose to adopt a Siamese invariance loss for deconvolution and empirically identify its optimal position in the neural network between blind-spot and full image branches. The experimental results show that our improved framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art deconvolution methods with a known point spread function. ",

    "abstract": "With easier access to powerful compute resources, there is a growing trend in the field of AI for software development to develop larger and larger language models (LLMs) to address a variety of programming tasks. Even LLMs applied to tasks from the high-performance computing (HPC) domain are huge in size (e.g., billions of parameters) and demand expensive compute resources for training. We found this design choice confusing - why do we need large LLMs trained on natural languages and programming languages unrelated to HPC for HPC-specific tasks? In this line of work, we aim to question design choices made by existing LLMs by developing smaller LLMs for specific domains - we call them domain-specific LLMs. Specifically, we start off with HPC as a domain and propose a novel tokenizer named Tokompiler, designed specifically for preprocessing code in HPC and compilation-centric tasks. Tokompiler leverages knowledge of language primitives to generate language-oriented tokens, providing a context-aware understanding of code structure while avoiding human semantics attributed to code structures completely. We applied Tokompiler to pre-train two state-of-the-art models, SPT-Code and Polycoder, for a Fortran code corpus mined from GitHub. We evaluate the performance of these models against the conventional LLMs. Results demonstrate that Tokompiler significantly enhances code completion accuracy and semantic understanding compared to traditional tokenizers in normalized-perplexity tests, down to ~1 perplexity score. This research opens avenues for further advancements in domain-specific LLMs, catering to the unique demands of HPC and compilation tasks. ",

However, numerous studies have indicated that the privacy-preserving capability of Split Learning is insufficient. In this paper, we primarily focus on label inference attacks in Split Learning under regression setting, which are mainly implemented through the gradient inversion method. To defend against label inference attacks, we propose Random Label Extension (RLE), where labels are extended to obfuscate the label information contained in the gradients, thereby preventing the attacker from utilizing gradients to train an attack model that can infer the original labels. To further minimize the impact on the original task, we propose Model-based adaptive Label Extension (MLE), where original labels are preserved in the extended labels and dominate the training process. The experimental results show that compared to the basic defense methods, our proposed defense methods can significantly reduce the attack model's performance while preserving the original task's performance.

    "abstract": "With the success of self-supervised learning, multimodal foundation models have rapidly adapted a wide range of downstream tasks driven by vision and language (VL) pretraining. State-of-the-art methods achieve impressive performance by pre-training on large-scale datasets. However, bridging the semantic gap between the two modalities remains a nonnegligible challenge for VL tasks. In this work, we propose an efficient computation framework for multimodal alignment by introducing a novel visual semantic module to further improve the performance of the VL tasks. Specifically, we propose a flexible model, namely Artificial-Spiking Hierarchical Networks (ASH-Nets), which combines the complementary advantages of Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and Spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enrich visual semantic representations. In particular, a visual concrete encoder and a semantic abstract encoder are constructed to learn continuous and discrete latent variables to enhance the flexibility of semantic encoding. Considering the spatio-temporal properties of SNNs modeling, we introduce a contrastive learning method to optimize the inputs of similar samples. This can improve the computational efficiency of the hierarchical network, while the augmentation of hard samples is beneficial to the learning of visual representations. Furthermore, the Spiking to Text Uni-Alignment Learning (STUA) pre-training method is proposed, which only relies on text features to enhance the encoding ability of abstract semantics. We validate the performance on multiple well-established downstream VL tasks. Experiments show that the proposed ASH-Nets achieve competitive results. ",

    "abstract": "This dissertation explores the impact of bias in deep neural networks and presents methods for reducing its influence on model performance. The first part begins by categorizing and describing potential sources of bias and errors in data and models, with a particular focus on bias in machine learning pipelines. The next chapter outlines a taxonomy and methods of Explainable AI as a way to justify predictions and control and improve the model. Then, as an example of a laborious manual data inspection and bias discovery process, a skin lesion dataset is manually examined. A Global Explanation for the Bias Identification method is proposed as an alternative semi-automatic approach to manual data exploration for discovering potential biases in data. Relevant numerical methods and metrics are discussed for assessing the effects of the identified biases on the model. Whereas identifying errors and bias is critical, improving the model and reducing the number of flaws in the future is an absolute priority. Hence, the second part of the thesis focuses on mitigating the influence of bias on ML models. Three approaches are proposed and discussed: Style Transfer Data Augmentation, Targeted Data Augmentations, and Attribution Feedback. Style Transfer Data Augmentation aims to address shape and texture bias by merging a style of a malignant lesion with a conflicting shape of a benign one. Targeted Data Augmentations randomly insert possible biases into all images in the dataset during the training, as a way to make the process random and, thus, destroy spurious correlations. Lastly, Attribution Feedback is used to fine-tune the model to improve its accuracy by eliminating obvious mistakes and teaching it to ignore insignificant input parts via an attribution loss. The goal of these approaches is to reduce the influence of bias on machine learning models, rather than eliminate it entirely. ",

To mitigate this, we introduce the Vision rElation TransfOrmer (VETO), consisting of a novel local-level entity relation encoder. We further observe that many existing SGG methods claim to be unbiased, but are still biased towards either head or tail classes. To overcome this bias, we introduce a Mutually Exclusive ExperT (MEET) learning strategy that captures important relation features without bias towards head or tail classes. Experimental results on the VG and GQA datasets demonstrate that VETO + MEET boosts the predictive performance by up to 47 percentage over the state of the art while being 10 times smaller. ",

It serves as the building block to facilitate surgical robot navigation and surgical education for the next generation of operating intelligence. Although existing methods have achieved accurate instrument segmentation results, they simultaneously generate segmentation masks for all instruments, without the capability to specify a target object and allow an interactive experience. This work explores a new task of Referring Surgical Video Instrument Segmentation (RSVIS), which aims to automatically identify and segment the corresponding surgical instruments based on the given language expression. To achieve this, we devise a novel Video-Instrument Synergistic Network (VIS-Net) to learn both video-level and instrument-level knowledge to boost performance, while previous work only used video-level information. Meanwhile, we design a Graph-based Relation-aware Module (GRM) to model the correlation between multi-modal information (i.e., textual description and video frame) to facilitate the extraction of instrument-level information. We are also the first to produce two RSVIS datasets to promote related research. Our method is verified on these datasets, and experimental results exhibit that the VIS-Net can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art referring segmentation methods.

Hence, the concept of clean-label attacks was introduced, which is more dangerous as it doesn't require changing the labels of injected data. To the best of our knowledge, the existing clean-label backdoor attacks largely relies on an understanding of the entire training set or a portion of it. However, in practice, it is very difficult for attackers to have it because of training datasets often collected from multiple independent sources. Unlike all current clean-label attacks, we propose a novel clean label method called 'Poison Dart Frog'. Poison Dart Frog does not require access to any training data; it only necessitates knowledge of the target class for the attack, such as 'frog'. On CIFAR10, Tiny-ImageNet, and TSRD, with a mere 0.1\\%, 0.025\\%, and 0.4\\% poisoning rate of the training set size, respectively, Poison Dart Frog achieves a high Attack Success Rate compared to LC, HTBA, BadNets, and Blend. Furthermore, compared to the state-of-the-art attack, NARCISSUS, Poison Dart Frog achieves similar attack success rates without any training data. Finally, we demonstrate that four typical backdoor defense algorithms struggle to counter Poison Dart Frog. ",

Considering the resource-intensive nature of training on vast datasets, many applications opt for models that have already been trained.

However, the adoption of these open-source models carries inherent privacy and security risks that are often overlooked. To provide a concrete example, an inconspicuous model may conceal hidden functionalities that, when triggered by specific input patterns, can manipulate the behavior of the system, such as instructing self-driving cars to ignore the presence of other vehicles. The implications of successful privacy and security attacks encompass a broad spectrum, ranging from relatively minor damage like service interruptions to highly alarming scenarios, including physical harm or the exposure of sensitive user data. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of common privacy and security threats associated with the use of open-source models.

    "abstract": "Graph representation learning (GRL) methods, such as graph neural networks and graph transformer models, have been successfully used to analyze graph-structured data, mainly focusing on node classification and link prediction tasks. However, the existing studies mostly only consider local connectivity while ignoring long-range connectivity and the roles of nodes. In this paper, we propose Unified Graph Transformer Networks (UGT) that effectively integrate local and global structural information into fixed-length vector representations. First, UGT learns local structure by identifying the local substructures and aggregating features of the $k$-hop neighborhoods of each node. Second, we construct virtual edges, bridging distant nodes with structural similarity to capture the long-range dependencies. Third, UGT learns unified representations through self-attention, encoding structural distance and $p$-step transition probability between node pairs. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised learning task that effectively learns transition probability to fuse local and global structural features, which could then be transferred to other downstream tasks. Experimental results on real-world benchmark datasets over various downstream tasks showed that UGT significantly outperformed baselines that consist of state-of-the-art models. In addition, UGT reaches the expressive power of the third-order Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test (3d-WL) in distinguishing non-isomorphic graph pairs.

This workshop was organized to share research that explores unique applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as foundational capabilities for the pursuit of adaptive cyber defense. The cyber domain cannot currently be reliably and effectively defended without extensive reliance on human experts. Skilled cyber defenders are in short supply and often cannot respond fast enough to cyber threats. Building on recent advances in AI and ML the Cyber defense research community has been motivated to develop new dynamic and sustainable defenses through the adoption of AI and ML techniques to cyber settings. Bridging critical gaps between AI and Cyber researchers and practitioners can accelerate efforts to create semi-autonomous cyber defenses that can learn to recognize and respond to cyber attacks or discover and mitigate weaknesses in cooperation with other cyber operation systems and human experts. Furthermore, these defenses are expected to be adaptive and able to evolve over time to thwart changes in attacker behavior, changes in the system health and readiness, and natural shifts in user behavior over time. The workshop was comprised of invited keynote talks, technical presentations and a panel discussion about how AI/ML can enable autonomous mitigation of current and future cyber attacks. Workshop submissions were peer reviewed by a panel of domain experts with a proceedings consisting of six technical articles exploring challenging problems of critical importance to national and global security. Participation in this workshop offered new opportunities to stimulate research and innovation in the emerging domain of adaptive and autonomous cyber defense. ",

As a key tool for realizing more cybersecure ecosystems, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have evolved tremendously in recent years by integrating machine learning (ML) techniques for the detection of increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks hidden in big data. However, these approaches have traditionally been based on centralized learning architectures, in which data from end nodes are shared with data centers for analysis. Recently, the application of federated learning (FL) in this context has attracted great interest to come up with collaborative intrusion detection approaches where data does not need to be shared. Due to the recent rise of this field, this work presents a complete, contemporary taxonomy for FL-enabled IDS approaches that stems from a comprehensive survey of the literature in the time span from 2018 to 2022. Precisely, our discussion includes an analysis of the main ML models, datasets, aggregation functions, as well as implementation libraries, which are employed by the proposed FL-enabled IDS approaches. On top of everything else, we provide a critical view of the current state of the research around this topic, and describe the main challenges and future directions based on the analysis of the literature and our own experience in this area.

    "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed the immense success of object detection, while current excellent detectors struggle on tackling size-limited instances. Concretely, the well-known challenge of low overlaps between the priors and object regions leads to a constrained sample pool for optimization, and the paucity of discriminative information further aggravates the recognition. To alleviate the aforementioned issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework tailored for small object detection based on the Coarse-to-fine pipeline and Feature Imitation learning. Firstly, we introduce Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to ensure sufficient and high-quality proposals for small objects through the dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regression. Then, we equip the conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate the region representations of size-limited instances that perplex the model in an imitation manner. Moreover, an auxiliary imitation loss following supervised contrastive learning paradigm is devised to optimize this branch. When integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale small object detection benchmarks, SODA-D and SODA-A, underscoring its superiority over baseline detector and other mainstream detection approaches.

The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) has standardized interpretation of prostate MRI by defining a score for lesion malignancy.

    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) provides diverse audio-to-text services for humans to communicate with machines. However, recent research reveals ASR systems are vulnerable to various malicious audio attacks. In particular, by removing the non-essential frequency components, a new spectrum reduction attack can generate adversarial audios that can be perceived by humans but cannot be correctly interpreted by ASR systems. It raises a new challenge for content moderation solutions to detect harmful content in audio and video available on social media platforms. In this paper, we propose an acoustic compensation system named ACE to counter the spectrum reduction attacks over ASR systems. Our system design is based on two observations, namely, frequency component dependencies and perturbation sensitivity. First, since the Discrete Fourier Transform computation inevitably introduces spectral leakage and aliasing effects to the audio frequency spectrum, the frequency components with similar frequencies will have a high correlation. Thus, considering the intrinsic dependencies between neighboring frequency components, it is possible to recover more of the original audio by compensating for the removed components based on the remaining ones. Second, since the removed components in the spectrum reduction attacks can be regarded as an inverse of adversarial noise, the attack success rate will decrease when the adversarial audio is replayed in an over-the-air scenario. Hence, we can model the acoustic propagation process to add over-the-air perturbations into the attacked audio. We implement a prototype of ACE and the experiments show ACE can effectively reduce up to 87.9% of ASR inference errors caused by spectrum reduction attacks. Also, by analyzing residual errors, we summarize six general types of ASR inference errors and investigate the error causes and potential mitigation solutions. ",

Specifically, there is still a lack of investigation into how developers typically refactor test code and its effects on test code quality and effectiveness. Objective. This paper presents a research agenda aimed to bridge this gap of knowledge by investigating (1) whether test refactoring actually targets test classes affected by quality and effectiveness concerns and (2) the extent to which refactoring contributes to the improvement of test code quality and effectiveness.

We plan to conduct an exploratory mining software repository study to collect test refactoring data of open-source Java projects from GitHub and statistically analyze them in combination with quality metrics, test smells, and code/mutation coverage indicators.

These query vectors are progressively refined to stable meaningful representations through a sequence of decoder layers, and then used to directly predict object locations and categories with simple FFN heads. In this paper, we present a new query-based object detector (DEQDet) by designing a deep equilibrium decoder. Our DEQ decoder models the query vector refinement as the fixed point solving of an {implicit} layer and is equivalent to applying {infinite} steps of refinement. To be more specific to object decoding, we use a two-step unrolled equilibrium equation to explicitly capture the query vector refinement. Accordingly, we are able to incorporate refinement awareness into the DEQ training with the inexact gradient back-propagation (RAG). In addition, to stabilize the training of our DEQDet and improve its generalization ability, we devise the deep supervision scheme on the optimization path of DEQ with refinement-aware perturbation~(RAP). Our experiments demonstrate DEQDet converges faster, consumes less memory, and achieves better results than the baseline counterpart (AdaMixer). In particular, our DEQDet with ResNet50 backbone and 300 queries achieves the $49.5$ mAP and $33.0$ AP$_s$ on the MS COCO benchmark under $2\\times$ training scheme (24 epochs). ",

    "abstract": "In the past, the dichotomy between homophily and heterophily has inspired research contributions toward a better understanding of Deep Graph Networks' inductive bias. In particular, it was believed that homophily strongly correlates with better node classification predictions of message-passing methods. More recently, however, researchers pointed out that such dichotomy is too simplistic as we can construct node classification tasks where graphs are completely heterophilic but the performances remain high. Most of these works have also proposed new quantitative metrics to understand when a graph structure is useful, which implicitly or explicitly assume the correlation between node features and target labels. Our work empirically investigates what happens when this strong assumption does not hold, by formalising two generative processes for node classification tasks that allow us to build and study ad-hoc problems. To quantitatively measure the influence of the node features on the target labels, we also use a metric we call Feature Informativeness. We construct six synthetic tasks and evaluate the performance of six models, including structure-agnostic ones. Our findings reveal that previously defined metrics are not adequate when we relax the above assumption. Our contribution to the workshop aims at presenting novel research findings that could help advance our understanding of the field. ",

In real-world applications, we commonly need to combine formal PDE models with (potentially noisy) observations. This is especially relevant in settings where we lack information about boundary or initial conditions, or where we need to identify unknown model parameters. In recent years, Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become a popular tool for problems of this kind. In high-dimensional settings, however, PINNs often suffer from computational problems because they usually require dense collocation points over the entire computational domain. To address this problem, we present Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets) as a data-driven approach for solving PDEs in one dimension less than the original problem space. PIBI-Nets only need collocation points at the computational domain boundary, while still achieving highly accurate results, and in several practical settings, they clearly outperform PINNs. Exploiting elementary properties of fundamental solutions of linear differential operators, we present a principled and simple way to handle point sources in inverse problems. We demonstrate the excellent performance of PIBI-Nets for the Laplace and Poisson equations, both on artificial data sets and within a real-world application concerning the reconstruction of groundwater flows.

Contrary to the existing works which concentrated on reducing resource sharing and encryption and decryption of data before transfer for improving cybersecurity which raises computational cost overhead, the proposed model operates diversely for efficiently serving the same purpose. This paper proposes a novel Multiple Risks Analysis based VM Threat Prediction Model (MR-TPM) to secure computational data and minimize adversary breaches by proactively estimating the VMs threats. It considers multiple cybersecurity risk factors associated with the configuration and management of VMs, along with analysis of users' behaviour. All these threat factors are quantified for the generation of respective risk score values and fed as input into a machine learning based classifier to estimate the probability of threat for each VM. The performance of MR-TPM is evaluated using benchmark Google Cluster and OpenNebula VM threat traces. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently computes the cybersecurity risks and learns the VM threat patterns from historical and live data samples. The deployment of MR-TPM with existing VM allocation policies reduces cybersecurity threats up to 88.9%. ",

    "abstract": "Robustly cooperating with unseen agents and human partners presents significant challenges due to the diverse cooperative conventions these partners may adopt. Existing Ad Hoc Teamwork (AHT) methods address this challenge by training an agent with a population of diverse teammate policies obtained through maximizing specific diversity metrics. However, these heuristic diversity metrics do not always maximize the agent's robustness in all cooperative problems. In this work, we first propose that maximizing an AHT agent's robustness requires it to emulate policies in the minimum coverage set (MCS), the set of best-response policies to any partner policies in the environment. We then introduce the L-BRDiv algorithm that generates a set of teammate policies that, when used for AHT training, encourage agents to emulate policies from the MCS. L-BRDiv works by solving a constrained optimization problem to jointly train teammate policies for AHT training and approximating AHT agent policies that are members of the MCS. We empirically demonstrate that L-BRDiv produces more robust AHT agents than state-of-the-art methods in a broader range of two-player cooperative problems without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning for its objectives. Our study shows that L-BRDiv outperforms the baseline methods by prioritizing discovering distinct members of the MCS instead of repeatedly finding redundant policies. ",

To this end, we propose two new GNN-agnostic interventions namely, (i) PFR-AX which decreases the separability between nodes in protected and non-protected groups, and (ii) PostProcess which updates model predictions based on a blackbox policy to minimize differences between error rates across demographic groups. Through a large set of experiments on four datasets, we frame the efficacies of our approaches (and three variants) in terms of their algorithmic fairness-accuracy tradeoff and benchmark our results against three strong baseline interventions on three state-of-the-art GNN models. Our results show that no single intervention offers a universally optimal tradeoff, but PFR-AX and PostProcess provide granular control and improve model confidence when correctly predicting positive outcomes for nodes in protected groups.

We propose to utilize the original graph cuts such as Ratio, Normalized or Cheeger Cut in order to detect clusters in weighted undirected graphs by restricting the graph cut minimization to the subset of $st$-MinCut partitions. Incorporating a vertex selection technique and restricting optimization to tightly connected clusters, we therefore combine the efficient computability of $st$-MinCuts and the intrinsic properties of Gomory-Hu trees with the cut quality of the original graph cuts, leading to linear runtime in the number of vertices and quadratic in the number of edges. Already in simple scenarios, the resulting algorithm Xist is able to approximate graph cut values better empirically than spectral clustering or comparable algorithms, even for large network datasets. We showcase its applicability by segmenting images from cell biology and provide empirical studies of runtime and classification rate. ",

Significantly, Far3D demonstrates SoTA performance on the challenging Argoverse 2 dataset, covering a wide range of 150 meters, surpassing several LiDAR-based approaches.

From a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) perspective, the straightforward way of training translation models is to use sign language phrase-spoken language sentence pairs. However, human interpreters heavily rely on the context to understand the conveyed information, especially for sign language interpretation, where the vocabulary size may be significantly smaller than their spoken language equivalent. Taking direct inspiration from how humans translate, we propose a novel multi-modal transformer architecture that tackles the translation task in a context-aware manner, as a human would. We use the context from previous sequences and confident predictions to disambiguate weaker visual cues. To achieve this we use complementary transformer encoders, namely: (1) A Video Encoder, that captures the low-level video features at the frame-level, (2) A Spotting Encoder, that models the recognized sign glosses in the video, and (3) A Context Encoder, which captures the context of the preceding sign sequences. We combine the information coming from these encoders in a final transformer decoder to generate spoken language translations. We evaluate our approach on the recently published large-scale BOBSL dataset, which contains ~1.2M sequences, and on the SRF dataset, which was part of the WMT-SLT 2022 challenge. We report significant improvements on state-of-the-art translation performance using contextual information, nearly doubling the reported BLEU-4 scores of baseline approaches. ",

In addition, a Kalman filter and a second-order sliding-mode observer based on generalized momenta are compared in terms of error and detection time. Gearless direct drives with low friction improve external force estimation and enable low impedance. The experimental validation is performed with two force-torque sensors and a kinetostatic model. This allows a new identification method of the motor torque constant of an assembled parallel robot to estimate external forces from the motor current and via a dynamics model. A Cartesian impedance control scheme for compliant robot-environmental dynamics with stiffness from 0.1-2N/mm and the force observation for low forces over the entire structure are validated.

Successful analysis of time series data captures patterns such as trends, cyclicity and irregularity, which are crucial for decision making in research, business, and governance. However, missing values in time series data occur often and present obstacles to successful analysis, thus they need to be filled with alternative values, a process called imputation. Although various approaches have been attempted for robust imputation of time series data, even the most advanced methods still face challenges including limited scalability, poor capacity to handle heterogeneous data types and inflexibility due to requiring strong assumptions of data missing mechanisms. Moreover, the imputation accuracy of these methods still has room for improvement. In this study, I developed tsDataWig (time-series DataWig) by modifying DataWig, a neural network-based method that possesses the capacity to process large datasets and heterogeneous data types but was designed for non-time series data imputation. Unlike the original DataWig, tsDataWig can directly handle values of time variables and impute missing values in complex time series datasets. Using one simulated and three different complex real-world time series datasets, I demonstrated that tsDataWig outperforms the original DataWig and the current state-of-the-art methods for time series data imputation and potentially has broad application due to not requiring strong assumptions of data missing mechanisms. This study provides a valuable solution for robustly imputing missing values in challenging time series datasets, which often contain millions of samples, high dimensional variables, and heterogeneous data types.

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods estimate the model's confidence per prediction, informing decision-making by considering the effect of randomness and model misspecification. Despite the advances of state-of-the-art UQ methods, they are computationally expensive or produce conservative prediction sets/intervals. We introduce MC-CP, a novel hybrid UQ method that combines a new adaptive Monte Carlo (MC) dropout method with conformal prediction (CP). MC-CP adaptively modulates the traditional MC dropout at runtime to save memory and computation resources, enabling predictions to be consumed by CP, yielding robust prediction sets/intervals. Throughout comprehensive experiments, we show that MC-CP delivers significant improvements over advanced UQ methods, like MC dropout, RAPS and CQR, both in classification and regression benchmarks. MC-CP can be easily added to existing models, making its deployment simple. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning with masked autoencoders has recently gained popularity for its ability to produce effective image or textual representations, which can be applied to various downstream tasks without retraining. However, we observe that the current masked autoencoder models lack good generalization ability on graph data. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel graph masked autoencoder framework called GiGaMAE. Different from existing masked autoencoders that learn node presentations by explicitly reconstructing the original graph components (e.g., features or edges), in this paper, we propose to collaboratively reconstruct informative and integrated latent embeddings. By considering embeddings encompassing graph topology and attribute information as reconstruction targets, our model could capture more generalized and comprehensive knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a mutual information based reconstruction loss that enables the effective reconstruction of multiple targets. This learning objective allows us to differentiate between the exclusive knowledge learned from a single target and common knowledge shared by multiple targets. We evaluate our method on three downstream tasks with seven datasets as benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GiGaMAE against state-of-the-art baselines. We hope our results will shed light on the design of foundation models on graph-structured data. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sycny/GiGaMAE. ",

We present the \\textit{Multi-Hypothesis \\textbf{P}ose \\textbf{Syn}thesis \\textbf{D}omain \\textbf{A}daptation} (\\textbf{PoSynDA}) framework to overcome this issue without extensive target domain annotation. Utilizing a diffusion-centric structure, PoSynDA simulates the 3D pose distribution in the target domain, filling the data diversity gap. By incorporating a multi-hypothesis network, it creates diverse pose hypotheses and aligns them with the target domain. Target-specific source augmentation obtains the target domain distribution data from the source domain by decoupling the scale and position parameters. The teacher-student paradigm and low-rank adaptation further refine the process. PoSynDA demonstrates competitive performance on benchmarks, such as Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW, even comparable with the target-trained MixSTE model~\\cite{zhang2022mixste}.

The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information (\"LLM thoughts\") are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT, while simultaneously reducing costs by >31%. We ensure that GoT is extensible with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new prompting schemes.

A standard sampling-to-counting reduction then yields a polynomial-time exact sampler that generates an omega-colorable labeled chordal graph on n vertices uniformly at random. Our counting algorithm improves upon the previous best result by Wormald (1985), which computes the number of labeled chordal graphs on n vertices in time exponential in n. An implementation of the polynomial-time counting algorithm gives the number of labeled chordal graphs on up to 30 vertices in less than three minutes on a standard desktop computer.

We achieve this by exploiting the efficacy of existing methods under perfect settings. Therefore, we provide valid training signals independently of what is in the input. First, we generate a set of complex samples corresponding to the normal training ones. Then, we train the model by guiding its self- or full-supervision by feeding the generated samples and computing the standard losses on the corresponding original images. Doing so enables a single model to recover information across diverse conditions without modifications at inference time.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of deep learning models often attributes to their ability to leverage massive training data. In contrast, such privilege has not yet fully benefited 3D deep learning, mainly due to the limited availability of large-scale 3D datasets. Merging multiple available data sources and letting them collaboratively train a single model is a potential solution. However, due to the large domain gap between 3D point cloud datasets, such mixed supervision could adversely affect the model's performance and lead to degenerated performance (i.e., negative transfer) compared to single-dataset training. In view of this challenge, we introduce Point Prompt Training (PPT), a novel framework for multi-dataset synergistic learning in the context of 3D representation learning that supports multiple pre-training paradigms. Based on this framework, we propose Prompt-driven Normalization, which adapts the model to different datasets with domain-specific prompts and Language-guided Categorical Alignment that decently unifies the multiple-dataset label spaces by leveraging the relationship between label text. Extensive experiments verify that PPT can overcome the negative transfer associated with synergistic learning and produce generalizable representations. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on each dataset using a single weight-shared model with supervised multi-dataset training. Moreover, when served as a pre-training framework, it outperforms other pre-training approaches regarding representation quality and attains remarkable state-of-the-art performance across over ten diverse downstream tasks spanning both indoor and outdoor 3D scenarios.

In order to take advantage of it, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) backend to mine latent relationships among embeddings for classification. We assume all the embeddings as nodes on a graph, and their edges are computed based on some similarity function, such as cosine, LDA+cosine, or LDA+PLDA. We study different graph settings and explore variants of GNN to find a better message passing and aggregation way to accomplish the recognition task.

Different environments, such as different sizes of rooms, different reverberation times, and different background noise, may be reasons for a learning-based system to fail. On the other hand, acquiring annotated spatial sound event samples, which include onset and offset time stamps, class types of sound events, and direction-of-arrival (DOA) of sound sources is very expensive. In addition, deploying a SELD system in a new environment often poses challenges due to time-consuming training and fine-tuning processes. To address these issues, we propose Meta-SELD, which applies meta-learning methods to achieve fast adaptation to new environments. More specifically, based on Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), the proposed Meta-SELD aims to find good meta-initialized parameters to adapt to new environments with only a small number of samples and parameter updating iterations. We can then quickly adapt the meta-trained SELD model to unseen environments. Our experiments compare fine-tuning methods from pre-trained SELD models with our Meta-SELD on the Sony-TAU Realistic Spatial Soundscapes 2023 (STARSSS23) dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of Meta-SELD when adapting to new environments. ",

    "title": "Eosinophils Instance Object Segmentation on Whole Slide Imaging Using  Multi-label Circle Representation",
    "abstract": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic and relapsing disease characterized by esophageal inflammation. Symptoms of EoE include difficulty swallowing, food impaction, and chest pain which significantly impact the quality of life, resulting in nutritional impairments, social limitations, and psychological distress. The diagnosis of EoE is typically performed with a threshold (15 to 20) of eosinophils (Eos) per high-power field (HPF). Since the current counting process of Eos is a resource-intensive process for human pathologists, automatic methods are desired. Circle representation has been shown as a more precise, yet less complicated, representation for automatic instance cell segmentation such as CircleSnake approach. However, the CircleSnake was designed as a single-label model, which is not able to deal with multi-label scenarios. In this paper, we propose the multi-label CircleSnake model for instance segmentation on Eos. It extends the original CircleSnake model from a single-label design to a multi-label model, allowing segmentation of multiple object types. Experimental results illustrate the CircleSnake model's superiority over the traditional Mask R-CNN model and DeepSnake model in terms of average precision (AP) in identifying and segmenting eosinophils, thereby enabling enhanced characterization of EoE. This automated approach holds promise for streamlining the assessment process and improving diagnostic accuracy in EoE analysis.

Most data augmentation techniques used in medical imaging focus on spatial and intensity transformations to improve the diversity of training images. They are often designed at the image level, augmenting the full image, and do not pay attention to specific abnormalities within the image. Here, we present LesionMix, a novel and simple lesion-aware data augmentation method. It performs augmentation at the lesion level, increasing the diversity of lesion shape, location, intensity and load distribution, and allowing both lesion populating and inpainting. Experiments on different modalities and different lesion datasets, including four brain MR lesion datasets and one liver CT lesion dataset, demonstrate that LesionMix achieves promising performance in lesion image segmentation, outperforming several recent Mix-based data augmentation methods.

    "abstract": "In this study, formant tracking is investigated by refining the formants tracked by an existing data-driven tracker, DeepFormants, using the formants estimated in a model-driven manner by linear prediction (LP)-based methods. As LP-based formant estimation methods, conventional covariance analysis (LP-COV) and the recently proposed quasi-closed phase forward-backward (QCP-FB) analysis are used. In the proposed refinement approach, the contours of the three lowest formants are first predicted by the data-driven DeepFormants tracker, and the predicted formants are replaced frame-wise with local spectral peaks shown by the model-driven LP-based methods. The refinement procedure can be plugged into the DeepFormants tracker with no need for any new data learning. Two refined DeepFormants trackers were compared with the original DeepFormants and with five known traditional trackers using the popular vocal tract resonance (VTR) corpus. The results indicated that the data-driven DeepFormants trackers outperformed the conventional trackers and that the best performance was obtained by refining the formants predicted by DeepFormants using QCP-FB analysis. In addition, by tracking formants using VTR speech that was corrupted by additive noise, the study showed that the refined DeepFormants trackers were more resilient to noise than the reference trackers. In general, these results suggest that LP-based model-driven approaches, which have traditionally been used in formant estimation, can be combined with a modern data-driven tracker easily with no further training to improve the tracker's performance.

Despite years of data collection and curation efforts by research organizations worldwide, bioactivity data remains sparse and heterogeneous, thus hampering efforts to build predictive models that are accurate, transferable and robust. The intrinsic variability of the experimental data is further compounded by data aggregation practices that neglect heterogeneity to overcome sparsity. Here we discuss the limitations of these practices and present a hierarchical meta-learning framework that exploits the information synergy across disparate assays by successfully accounting for assay heterogeneity. We show that the model achieves a drastic improvement in affinity prediction across diverse protein targets and assay types compared to conventional baselines. It can quickly adapt to new target contexts using very few observations, thus enabling large-scale virtual screening in early-phase drug discovery. ",

    "abstract": "Network complexity and computational efficiency have become increasingly significant aspects of deep learning. Sparse deep learning addresses these challenges by recovering a sparse representation of the underlying target function by reducing heavily over-parameterized deep neural networks. Specifically, deep neural architectures compressed via structured sparsity (e.g. node sparsity) provide low latency inference, higher data throughput, and reduced energy consumption. In this paper, we explore two well-established shrinkage techniques, Lasso and Horseshoe, for model compression in Bayesian neural networks. To this end, we propose structurally sparse Bayesian neural networks which systematically prune excessive nodes with (i) Spike-and-Slab Group Lasso (SS-GL), and (ii) Spike-and-Slab Group Horseshoe (SS-GHS) priors, and develop computationally tractable variational inference including continuous relaxation of Bernoulli variables. We establish the contraction rates of the variational posterior of our proposed models as a function of the network topology, layer-wise node cardinalities, and bounds on the network weights. We empirically demonstrate the competitive performance of our models compared to the baseline models in prediction accuracy, model compression, and inference latency. ",

Furthermore, the proposed spectral information criterion (SIC) is also more general than the other information criteria, e.g., since the knowledge of a likelihood function is not strictly required. SIC extracts geometric features of the error curve and, as a consequence, it can be considered an automatic elbow detector. SIC provides a subset of all possible models, with a cardinality that often is much smaller than the total number of possible models. The elements of this subset are elbows of the error curve. A practical rule for selecting a unique model within the sets of elbows is suggested as well. Theoretical invariance properties of SIC are analyzed. Moreover, we test SIC in ideal scenarios where provides always the optimal expected results. We also test SIC in several numerical experiments: some involving synthetic data, and two experiments involving real datasets. They are all real-world applications such as clustering, variable selection, or polynomial order selection, to name a few. The results show the benefits of the proposed scheme. Matlab code related to the experiments is also provided. Possible future research lines are finally discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based surrogate models have been widely applied in geological carbon storage (GCS) problems to accelerate the prediction of reservoir pressure and CO2 plume migration. Large amounts of data from physics-based numerical simulators are required to train a model to accurately predict the complex physical behaviors associated with this process. In practice, the available training data are always limited in large-scale 3D problems due to the high computational cost. Therefore, we propose to use a multi-fidelity Fourier Neural Operator to solve large-scale GCS problems with more affordable multi-fidelity training datasets. The Fourier Neural Operator has a desirable grid-invariant property, which simplifies the transfer learning procedure between datasets with different discretization. We first test the model efficacy on a GCS reservoir model being discretized into 110k grid cells. The multi-fidelity model can predict with accuracy comparable to a high-fidelity model trained with the same amount of high-fidelity data with 81% less data generation costs. We further test the generalizability of the multi-fidelity model on a same reservoir model with a finer discretization of 1 million grid cells. This case was made more challenging by employing high-fidelity and low-fidelity datasets generated by different geostatistical models and reservoir simulators. We observe that the multi-fidelity FNO model can predict pressure fields with reasonable accuracy even when the high-fidelity data are extremely limited. ",

Yet, vision is most commonly modelled by convolutional neural networks that ignore topography by learning identical features across space. Here, we overcome this limitation by developing All-Topographic Neural Networks (All-TNNs). Trained on visual input, several features of primate topography emerge in All-TNNs: smooth orientation maps and cortical magnification in their first layer, and category-selective areas in their final layer. In addition, we introduce a novel dataset of human spatial biases in object recognition, which enables us to directly link models to behaviour. We demonstrate that All-TNNs significantly better align with human behaviour than previous state-of-the-art convolutional models due to their topographic nature. All-TNNs thereby mark an important step forward in understanding the spatial organisation of the visual brain and how it mediates visual behaviour. ",
