We fine-tune pre-existing LLMs on Verilog datasets compiled from GitHub and Verilog textbooks. We evaluate the functional correctness of the generated Verilog code using a specially designed test suite, featuring a custom problem set and testing benches. Here, our fine-tuned open-source CodeGen-16B model outperforms the commercial state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-turbo model with a 1.1% overall increase. Upon testing with a more diverse and complex problem set, we find that the fine-tuned model shows competitive performance against state-of-the-art gpt-3.5-turbo, excelling in certain scenarios. Notably, it demonstrates a 41% improvement in generating syntactically correct Verilog code across various problem categories compared to its pre-trained counterpart, highlighting the potential of smaller, in-house LLMs in hardware design automation.

    "abstract": "As natural language interfaces enable users to express increasingly complex natural language queries, there is a parallel explosion of user review content that can allow users to better find items such as restaurants, books, or movies that match these expressive queries. While Neural Information Retrieval (IR) methods have provided state-of-the-art results for matching queries to documents, they have not been extended to the task of Reviewed-Item Retrieval (RIR), where query-review scores must be aggregated (or fused) into item-level scores for ranking. In the absence of labeled RIR datasets, we extend Neural IR methodology to RIR by leveraging self-supervised methods for contrastive learning of BERT embeddings for both queries and reviews. Specifically, contrastive learning requires a choice of positive and negative samples, where the unique two-level structure of our item-review data combined with meta-data affords us a rich structure for the selection of these samples. For contrastive learning in a Late Fusion scenario, we investigate the use of positive review samples from the same item and/or with the same rating, selection of hard positive samples by choosing the least similar reviews from the same anchor item, and selection of hard negative samples by choosing the most similar reviews from different items. We also explore anchor sub-sampling and augmenting with meta-data. For a more end-to-end Early Fusion approach, we introduce contrastive item embedding learning to fuse reviews into single item embeddings. Experimental results show that Late Fusion contrastive learning for Neural RIR outperforms all other contrastive IR configurations, Neural IR, and sparse retrieval baselines, thus demonstrating the power of exploiting the two-level structure in Neural RIR approaches as well as the importance of preserving the nuance of individual review content via Late Fusion methods.

    "abstract": "Motifs, which have been established as building blocks for network structure, move beyond pair-wise connections to capture longer-range correlations in connections and activity. In spite of this, there are few generative graph models that consider higher-order network structures and even fewer that focus on using motifs in models of dynamic graphs. Most existing generative models for temporal graphs strictly grow the networks via edge addition, and the models are evaluated using static graph structure metrics -- which do not adequately capture the temporal behavior of the network. To address these issues, in this work we propose DYnamic MOtif-NoDes (DYMOND) -- a generative model that considers (i) the dynamic changes in overall graph structure using temporal motif activity and (ii) the roles nodes play in motifs (e.g., one node plays the hub role in a wedge, while the remaining two act as spokes). We compare DYMOND to three dynamic graph generative model baselines on real-world networks and show that DYMOND performs better at generating graph structure and node behavior similar to the observed network. We also propose a new methodology to adapt graph structure metrics to better evaluate the temporal aspect of the network. These metrics take into account the changes in overall graph structure and the individual nodes' behavior over time. ",

While recent methods primarily focus on controlling facial attributes such as identity and expression, they often overlook the crucial aspect of modeling eyeball rotation, which holds importance for various downstream tasks. In this paper, we aim to learn a face NeRF model that is sensitive to eye movements from multi-view images. We address two key challenges in eye-aware face NeRF learning: how to effectively capture eyeball rotation for training and how to construct a manifold for representing eyeball rotation. To accomplish this, we first fit FLAME, a well-established parametric face model, to the multi-view images considering multi-view consistency. Subsequently, we introduce a new Dynamic Eye-aware NeRF (DeNeRF). DeNeRF transforms 3D points from different views into a canonical space to learn a unified face NeRF model. We design an eye deformation field for the transformation, including rigid transformation, e.g., eyeball rotation, and non-rigid transformation. Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our model is capable of generating high-fidelity images with accurate eyeball rotation and non-rigid periocular deformation, even under novel viewing angles. Furthermore, we show that utilizing the rendered images can effectively enhance gaze estimation performance. ",

    "abstract": "Energy efficiency and low latency are crucial requirements for designing wearable AI-empowered human activity recognition systems, due to the hard constraints of battery operations and closed-loop feedback. While neural network models have been extensively compressed to match the stringent edge requirements, spiking neural networks and event-based sensing are recently emerging as promising solutions to further improve performance due to their inherent energy efficiency and capacity to process spatiotemporal data in very low latency. This work aims to evaluate the effectiveness of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic processors in human activity recognition for wearable applications. The case of workout recognition with wrist-worn wearable motion sensors is used as a study. A multi-threshold delta modulation approach is utilized for encoding the input sensor data into spike trains to move the pipeline into the event-based approach. The spikes trains are then fed to a spiking neural network with direct-event training, and the trained model is deployed on the research neuromorphic platform from Intel, Loihi, to evaluate energy and latency efficiency. Test results show that the spike-based workouts recognition system can achieve a comparable accuracy (87.5\\%) comparable to the popular milliwatt RISC-V bases multi-core processor GAP8 with a traditional neural network ( 88.1\\%) while achieving two times better energy-delay product (0.66 \\si{\\micro\\joule\\second} vs. 1.32 \\si{\\micro\\joule\\second}).

In the context of vision, we hypothesize that an important contributor to the robustness of human visual perception is constant exposure to low-fidelity visual stimuli in our peripheral vision. To investigate this hypothesis, we develop \\RBlur, an image transform that simulates the loss in fidelity of peripheral vision by blurring the image and reducing its color saturation based on the distance from a given fixation point. We show that compared to DNNs trained on the original images, DNNs trained on images transformed by \\RBlur are substantially more robust to adversarial attacks, as well as other, non-adversarial, corruptions, achieving up to 25\\% higher accuracy on perturbed data.

However, the conventional FL method can introduce security risks when dealing with diverse client data, potentially compromising privacy and data integrity. To address these challenges, we present a differential privacy (DP) federated deep learning framework in medical image segmentation. In this paper, we extend our similarity weight aggregation (SimAgg) method to DP-SimAgg algorithm, a differentially private similarity-weighted aggregation algorithm for brain tumor segmentation in multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our DP-SimAgg method not only enhances model segmentation capabilities but also provides an additional layer of privacy preservation. Extensive benchmarking and evaluation of our framework, with computational performance as a key consideration, demonstrate that DP-SimAgg enables accurate and robust brain tumor segmentation while minimizing communication costs during model training. This advancement is crucial for preserving the privacy of medical image data and safeguarding sensitive information. In conclusion, adding a differential privacy layer in the global weight aggregation phase of the federated brain tumor segmentation provides a promising solution to privacy concerns without compromising segmentation model efficacy. By leveraging DP, we ensure the protection of client data against adversarial attacks and malicious participants. ",

These tools provide a simplified perspective on network performance and facilitate systematic investigations through simulations. In this paper, we propose utilizing the framework of stochastic processes, which has been underutilized thus far. Our approach models activation patterns of thresholded nodes in (deep) artificial neural networks as stochastic processes. We focus solely on activation frequency, leveraging neuroscience techniques used for real neuron spike trains. During a classification task, we extract spiking activity and use an arrival process following the Poisson distribution. We examine observed data from various artificial neural networks in image recognition tasks, fitting the proposed model's assumptions. Through this, we derive parameters describing activation patterns in each network. Our analysis covers randomly initialized, generalizing, and memorizing networks, revealing consistent differences across architectures and training sets. Calculating Mean Firing Rate, Mean Fano Factor, and Variances, we find stable indicators of memorization during learning, providing valuable insights into network behavior. The proposed model shows promise in describing activation patterns and could serve as a general framework for future investigations. It has potential applications in theoretical simulations, pruning, and transfer learning. ",

This study developed two devices for acquisition of real-time, continuous in-session pain scores and gathering of ANS-modulated endodermal activity (EDA).The experiment recruited N = 24 subjects who underwent a post-exercise circulatory occlusion (PECO) with stretch, inducing discomfort. Subject data were stored in a custom pain platform, facilitating extraction of time-domain EDA features and in-session ground truth scores. Moreover, post-experiment visual analog scale (VAS) scores were collected from each subject. Machine learning models, namely Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF), were trained using corresponding objective EDA features combined with in-session scores and post-session scores, respectively. Over a 10-fold cross-validation, the macro-averaged geometric mean score revealed MLP and RF models trained with objective EDA features and in-session scores achieved superior performance (75.9% and 78.3%) compared to models trained with post-session scores (70.3% and 74.6%) respectively. This pioneering study demonstrates that using continuous in-session ground truth scores significantly enhances ML performance in pain intensity characterization, overcoming ground truth sparsity-related issues, data imbalance, and high variance.

They have resemblance to Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), but break free from some limitations of PGMs. By aiming to provide expressive methods for representation learning instead of computing marginals or most likely configurations, GNNs provide flexibility in the choice of information flowing rules while maintaining good performance. Despite their success and inspirations, they lack efficient ways to represent and learn higher-order relations among variables/nodes. More expressive higher-order GNNs which operate on k-tuples of nodes need increased computational resources in order to process higher-order tensors. We propose Factor Graph Neural Networks (FGNNs) to effectively capture higher-order relations for inference and learning. To do so, we first derive an efficient approximate Sum-Product loopy belief propagation inference algorithm for discrete higher-order PGMs. We then neuralize the novel message passing scheme into a Factor Graph Neural Network (FGNN) module by allowing richer representations of the message update rules; this facilitates both efficient inference and powerful end-to-end learning. We further show that with a suitable choice of message aggregation operators, our FGNN is also able to represent Max-Product belief propagation, providing a single family of architecture that can represent both Max and Sum-Product loopy belief propagation. Our extensive experimental evaluation on synthetic as well as real datasets demonstrates the potential of the proposed model. ",

This paper introduces Tango which re-thinks quantization challenges and opportunities for graph neural network training on GPUs with three contributions: Firstly, we introduce efficient rules to maintain accuracy during quantized GNN training. Secondly, we design and implement quantization-aware primitives and inter-primitive optimizations that can speed up GNN training.

Additionally, these methods neglect to explore the potential of self-discrepancy among intra-class relations in the colonoscopic polyp dataset, which remains an open research problem in the medical community. To solve this dilemma, we propose a simple but effective training method named Colo-ReID, which can help our model to learn more general and discriminative knowledge based on the meta-learning strategy in scenarios with fewer samples. Based on this, a dynamic Meta-Learning Regulation mechanism called MLR is introduced to further boost the performance of polyp re-identification.

In many crucial Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications such as healthcare and defense, the early detection of security attacks plays a significant role in protecting huge resources. An intrusion detection system is used to address this problem. The signature-based approaches fail to detect zero-day attacks. So anomaly-based detection particularly AI tools, are becoming popular. In addition, the imbalanced dataset leads to biased results. In Machine Learning (ML) models, F1 score is an important metric to measure the accuracy of class-level correct predictions. The model may fail to detect the target samples if the F1 is considerably low. It will lead to unrecoverable consequences in sensitive applications such as healthcare and defense. So, any improvement in the F1 score has significant impact on the resource protection. In this paper, we present a framework for ML-based intrusion detection system for an imbalanced dataset. In this study, the most recent dataset, namely CICIoT2023 is considered. The random forest (RF) algorithm is used in the proposed framework. The proposed approach improves 3.72%, 3.75% and 4.69% in precision, recall and F1 score, respectively, with the existing method. Additionally, for unsaturated classes (i.e., classes with F1 score < 0.99), F1 score improved significantly by 7.9%. As a result, the proposed approach is more suitable for IoT security applications for efficient detection of intrusion and is useful in further studies. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the broad application of Machine Learning models as a Service (MLaaS), they are vulnerable to model stealing attacks. These attacks can replicate the model functionality by using the black-box query process without any prior knowledge of the target victim model. Existing stealing defenses add deceptive perturbations to the victim's posterior probabilities to mislead the attackers. However, these defenses are now suffering problems of high inference computational overheads and unfavorable trade-offs between benign accuracy and stealing robustness, which challenges the feasibility of deployed models in practice. To address the problems, this paper proposes Isolation and Induction (InI), a novel and effective training framework for model stealing defenses. Instead of deploying auxiliary defense modules that introduce redundant inference time, InI directly trains a defensive model by isolating the adversary's training gradient from the expected gradient, which can effectively reduce the inference computational cost. In contrast to adding perturbations over model predictions that harm the benign accuracy, we train models to produce uninformative outputs against stealing queries, which can induce the adversary to extract little useful knowledge from victim models with minimal impact on the benign performance. Extensive experiments on several visual classification datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR10) demonstrate the superior robustness (up to 48% reduction on stealing accuracy) and speed (up to 25.4x faster) of our InI over other state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "In the context of autonomous forklifts, ensuring non-collision during travel, pick, and place operations is crucial. To accomplish this, the forklift must be able to detect and locate areas of free space and potential obstacles in its environment. However, this is particularly challenging in highly dynamic environments, such as factory sites and production halls, due to numerous industrial trucks and workers moving throughout the area. In this paper, we present a novel method for free space detection, which consists of the following steps. We introduce a novel technique for surface normal estimation relying on spherical projected LiDAR data. Subsequently, we employ the estimated surface normals to detect free space. The presented method is a heuristic approach that does not require labeling and can ensure real-time application due to high processing speed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through its application to a real-world dataset obtained on a factory site both indoors and outdoors, and its evaluation on the Semantic KITTI dataset [2]. We achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score of 50.90 % on the benchmark dataset, with a processing speed of 105 Hz. In addition, we evaluated our approach on our factory site dataset. Our method achieved a mIoU score of 63.30 % at 54 Hz ",

    "abstract": "Bibliometric studies based on the Web of Science (WOS) database have become an increasingly popular method for analysing the structure of scientific research. So do network approaches, which, based on empirical data, make it possible to characterize the emergence of topological structures over time and across multiple research areas. Our paper is a contribution to interweaving these two lines of research that have progressed in separate ways but whose common applications have been increasingly more frequent. Among other attributes, Author Keywords and Keywords Plus are used as units of analysis that enable us to identify changes in the topics of interest and related bibliography. By considering the co-occurrence of those keywords with the Author Keyword \\texttt{Complexity}, we provide an overview of the evolution of studies on Complexity Sciences, and compare this evolution in seven scientific fields. The results show a considerable increase in the number of papers dealing with complexity, as well as a general tendency across different disciplines for this literature to move from a more foundational, general and conceptual to a more applied and specific set of co-occurring keywords. Moreover, we provide evidence of changing topologies of networks of co-occurring keywords, which are described through the computation of some topological coefficients. In so doing, we emphasize the distinguishing structures that characterize the networks of the seven research areas. ",

    "abstract": "Supervised 3D Object Detection models have been displaying increasingly better performance in single-domain cases where the training data comes from the same environment and sensor as the testing data. However, in real-world scenarios data from the target domain may not be available for finetuning or for domain adaptation methods. Indeed, 3D object detection models trained on a source dataset with a specific point distribution have shown difficulties in generalizing to unseen datasets. Therefore, we decided to leverage the information available from several annotated source datasets with our Multi-Dataset Training for 3D Object Detection (MDT3D) method to increase the robustness of 3D object detection models when tested in a new environment with a different sensor configuration. To tackle the labelling gap between datasets, we used a new label mapping based on coarse labels. Furthermore, we show how we managed the mix of datasets during training and finally introduce a new cross-dataset augmentation method: cross-dataset object injection. We demonstrate that this training paradigm shows improvements for different types of 3D object detection models.

    "abstract": "Time series analysis is a fundamental task in various application domains, and deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable performance in this area. However, many real-world time series data exhibit significant periodic or quasi-periodic dynamics that are often not adequately captured by existing deep learning-based solutions. This results in an incomplete representation of the underlying dynamic behaviors of interest. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised method called Floss that automatically regularizes learned representations in the frequency domain. The Floss method first automatically detects major periodicities from the time series. It then employs periodic shift and spectral density similarity measures to learn meaningful representations with periodic consistency. In addition, Floss can be easily incorporated into both supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning frameworks. We conduct extensive experiments on common time series classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of Floss. We incorporate Floss into several representative deep learning solutions to justify our design choices and demonstrate that it is capable of automatically discovering periodic dynamics and improving state-of-the-art deep learning models.

To improve this trade-off, we make three contributions: (i) Incorporating a self-knowledge distillation loss can enhance the accuracy of the network; (ii) Sampling semi-hard outlier data for training can improve OOD detection performance with minimal impact on accuracy; (iii) The introduction of our novel supervised contrastive learning can simultaneously improve OOD detection performance and the accuracy of the network. By incorporating all three factors, our approach enhances both accuracy and OOD detection performance by addressing the trade-off between classification and OOD detection. Our method achieves improvements over previous approaches in both performance metrics. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). Recent success all assumes that users will not notice or disrupt the attack process despite the existence of music/noise-like sounds and spontaneous responses from voice assistants. Nonetheless, in practical user-present scenarios, user awareness may nullify existing attack attempts that launch unexpected sounds or ASR usage. In this paper, we seek to bridge the gap in existing research and extend the attack to user-present scenarios. We propose VRIFLE, an inaudible adversarial perturbation (IAP) attack via ultrasound delivery that can manipulate ASRs as a user speaks. The inherent differences between audible sounds and ultrasounds make IAP delivery face unprecedented challenges such as distortion, noise, and instability. In this regard, we design a novel ultrasonic transformation model to enhance the crafted perturbation to be physically effective and even survive long-distance delivery. We further enable VRIFLE's robustness by adopting a series of augmentation on user and real-world variations during the generation process. In this way, VRIFLE features an effective real-time manipulation of the ASR output from different distances and under any speech of users, with an alter-and-mute strategy that suppresses the impact of user disruption. Our extensive experiments in both digital and physical worlds verify VRIFLE's effectiveness under various configurations, robustness against six kinds of defenses, and universality in a targeted manner. We also show that VRIFLE can be delivered with a portable attack device and even everyday-life loudspeakers. ",

    "abstract": "Multispectral pedestrian detection achieves better visibility in challenging conditions and thus has a broad application in various tasks, for which both the accuracy and computational cost are of paramount importance. Most existing approaches treat RGB and infrared modalities equally, typically adopting two symmetrical CNN backbones for multimodal feature extraction, which ignores the substantial differences between modalities and brings great difficulty for the reduction of the computational cost as well as effective crossmodal fusion. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient framework named WCCNet that is able to differentially extract rich features of different spectra with lower computational complexity and semantically rearranges these features for effective crossmodal fusion. Specifically, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) allowing fast inference and training speed is embedded to construct a dual-stream backbone for efficient feature extraction. The DWT layers of WCCNet extract frequency components for infrared modality, while the CNN layers extract spatial-domain features for RGB modality. This methodology not only significantly reduces the computational complexity, but also improves the extraction of infrared features to facilitate the subsequent crossmodal fusion. Based on the well extracted features, we elaborately design the crossmodal rearranging fusion module (CMRF), which can mitigate spatial misalignment and merge semantically complementary features of spatially-related local regions to amplify the crossmodal complementary information. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on KAIST and FLIR benchmarks, in which WCCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods with considerable computational efficiency and competitive accuracy. We also perform the ablation study and analyze thoroughly the impact of different components on the performance of WCCNet. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we make the first attempt to apply the boundary integrated neural networks (BINNs) for the numerical solution of two-dimensional (2D) elastostatic and piezoelectric problems. BINNs combine artificial neural networks with the well-established boundary integral equations (BIEs) to effectively solve partial differential equations (PDEs). The BIEs are utilized to map all the unknowns onto the boundary, after which these unknowns are approximated using artificial neural networks and resolved via a training process. In contrast to traditional neural network-based methods, the current BINNs offer several distinct advantages. First, by embedding BIEs into the learning procedure, BINNs only need to discretize the boundary of the solution domain, which can lead to a faster and more stable learning process (only the boundary conditions need to be fitted during the training). Second, the differential operator with respect to the PDEs is substituted by an integral operator, which effectively eliminates the need for additional differentiation of the neural networks (high-order derivatives of neural networks may lead to instability in learning). Third, the loss function of the BINNs only contains the residuals of the BIEs, as all the boundary conditions have been inherently incorporated within the formulation. Therefore, there is no necessity for employing any weighing functions, which are commonly used in traditional methods to balance the gradients among different objective functions. Moreover, BINNs possess the ability to tackle PDEs in unbounded domains since the integral representation remains valid for both bounded and unbounded domains. Extensive numerical experiments show that BINNs are much easier to train and usually give more accurate learning solutions as compared to traditional neural network-based methods. ",

However, existing graph anomaly detection algorithms focus on distinguishing individual entities (nodes or graphs) and overlook the possibility of anomalous groups within the graph. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel unsupervised framework for a new task called Group-level Graph Anomaly Detection (Gr-GAD). The proposed framework first employs a variant of Graph AutoEncoder (GAE) to locate anchor nodes that belong to potential anomaly groups by capturing long-range inconsistencies. Subsequently, group sampling is employed to sample candidate groups, which are then fed into the proposed Topology Pattern-based Graph Contrastive Learning (TPGCL) method. TPGCL utilizes the topology patterns of groups as clues to generate embeddings for each candidate group and thus distinct anomaly groups. The experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework shows superior performance in identifying and localizing anomaly groups, highlighting it as a promising solution for Gr-GAD.

Capturing macroscopic traffic phenomena remains a challenge for microscopic models, especially in complex road sections such as on-ramps. In this paper, we propose a microscopic model for on-ramps derived from a macroscopic network flow model calibrated to real traffic data. The microscopic flow-based model requires additional assumptions regarding the acceleration and the merging behavior on the on-ramp to maintain consistency with the mean speeds, traffic flow and density predicted by the macroscopic model. To evaluate the model's performance, we conduct traffic simulations assessing speeds, accelerations, lane change positions, and risky behavior. Our results show that, although the proposed model may not fully capture all traffic phenomena of on-ramps accurately, it performs better than the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) in most evaluated aspects. While the IDM is almost completely free of conflicts, the proposed model evokes a realistic amount and severity of conflicts and can therefore be used for safety analysis. ",

    "title": "Spatio-Temporal Branching for Motion Prediction using Motion Increments",
    "abstract": "Human motion prediction (HMP) has emerged as a popular research topic due to its diverse applications, but it remains a challenging task due to the stochastic and aperiodic nature of future poses. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and machine learning techniques, which often struggle to model the complex dynamics of human motion. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved success by learning spatio-temporal representations of motion, but these models often overlook the reliability of motion data. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies of skeleton nodes are distinct. The temporal relationship captures motion information over time, while the spatial relationship describes body structure and the relationships between different nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal branching network using incremental information for HMP, which decouples the learning of temporal-domain and spatial-domain features, extracts more motion information, and achieves complementary cross-domain knowledge learning through knowledge distillation. Our approach effectively reduces noise interference and provides more expressive information for characterizing motion by separately extracting temporal and spatial features. We evaluate our approach on standard HMP benchmarks and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Recently there has been a series of studies in knowledge graph embedding (KGE), which attempts to learn the embeddings of the entities and relations as numerical vectors and mathematical mappings via machine learning (ML). However, there has been limited research that applies KGE for industrial problems in manufacturing. This paper investigates whether and to what extent KGE can be used for an important problem: quality monitoring for welding in manufacturing industry, which is an impactful process accounting for production of millions of cars annually. The work is in line with Bosch research of data-driven solutions that intends to replace the traditional way of destroying cars, which is extremely costly and produces waste. The paper tackles two very challenging questions simultaneously: how large the welding spot diameter is; and to which car body the welded spot belongs to. The problem setting is difficult for traditional ML because there exist a high number of car bodies that should be assigned as class labels. We formulate the problem as link prediction, and experimented popular KGE methods on real industry data, with consideration of literals. Our results reveal both limitations and promising aspects of adapted KGE methods. ",

Here feasibility is given whenever (i) vertices labeled $\\pm{}1$ have at least one neighbor with label in $\\{2,3\\}$; (ii) each vertex labeled $-1$ has one $3$-labeled neighbor or at least two $2$-labeled neighbors; and (iii) the sum of labels over the closed neighborhood of any vertex is positive. The cumulative weight of an optimal labeling is called signed double Roman domination number (SDRDN). In this work, we first consider the problem on general cubic graphs of order $n$ for which we present a sharp $n/2+\\Theta(1)$ lower bound for the SDRDN by means of the discharging method. Moreover, we derive a new best upper bound. Observing that we are often able to minimize the SDRDN over the class of cubic graphs of a fixed order, we then study in this context generalized Petersen graphs for independent interest, for which we propose a constraint programming guided proof. We then use these insights to determine the SDRDNs of subcubic $2\\times m$ grid graphs, among other results. ",

The presented scheme is applied in offline handwritten signature verification (OffSV) which, akin to other biometric applications, suffers from inherent data limitations due to regulatory restrictions. The proposed Student-Teacher (S-T) configuration utilizes feature-based knowledge distillation (FKD), combining graph-based similarity for local activations with global similarity measures to supervise student's training, using only handwritten text data. Remarkably, the models trained using this technique exhibit comparable, if not superior, performance to the teacher model across three popular signature datasets. More importantly, these results are attained without employing any signatures during the feature extraction training process. This study demonstrates the efficacy of leveraging existing expert models to overcome data scarcity challenges in OffSV and potentially other related domains. ",

The proposed algorithm adds artificial noise to the shared information to ensure privacy and dynamically allocates the time-varying noise variance to minimize an upper bound of the optimization error subject to a predefined privacy budget constraint. This allows for an arbitrarily large but finite number of iterations to achieve both privacy protection and utility up to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, removing the need for tuning the number of iterations.

While the InfoNCE loss has been shown to impose penalties based on hardness, the temperature hyper-parameter is the key to regulating the penalties and the trade-off between uniformity and tolerance. In this work, we focus our attention to improve the performance of InfoNCE loss in SSL by studying the effect of temperature hyper-parameter values. We propose a cosine similarity-dependent temperature scaling function to effectively optimize the distribution of the samples in the feature space. We further analyze the uniformity and tolerance metrics to investigate the optimal regions in the cosine similarity space for better optimization. Additionally, we offer a comprehensive examination of the behavior of local and global structures in the feature space throughout the pre-training phase, as the temperature varies. Experimental evidence shows that the proposed framework outperforms or is at par with the contrastive loss-based SSL algorithms. We believe our work (DySTreSS) on temperature scaling in SSL provides a foundation for future research in contrastive learning. ",

    "abstract": "Change detection (CD) by comparing two bi-temporal images is a crucial task in remote sensing. With the advantages of requiring no cumbersome labeled change information, unsupervised CD has attracted extensive attention in the community. However, existing unsupervised CD approaches rarely consider the seasonal and style differences incurred by the illumination and atmospheric conditions in multi-temporal images. To this end, we propose a change detection with domain shift setting for remote sensing images. Furthermore, we present a novel unsupervised CD method using a light-weight transformer, called UCDFormer. Specifically, a transformer-driven image translation composed of a light-weight transformer and a domain-specific affinity weight is first proposed to mitigate domain shift between two images with real-time efficiency. After image translation, we can generate the difference map between the translated before-event image and the original after-event image. Then, a novel reliable pixel extraction module is proposed to select significantly changed/unchanged pixel positions by fusing the pseudo change maps of fuzzy c-means clustering and adaptive threshold. Finally, a binary change map is obtained based on these selected pixel pairs and a binary classifier. Experimental results on different unsupervised CD tasks with seasonal and style changes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UCDFormer. For example, compared with several other related methods, UCDFormer improves performance on the Kappa coefficient by more than 12\\%. In addition, UCDFormer achieves excellent performance for earthquake-induced landslide detection when considering large-scale applications.

    "abstract": "We present a novel method for a multi-party, zero-trust validator infrastructure deployment arrangement via smart contracts to secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains. The proposed arrangement architecture employs a combination of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a treasury contract, and validator smart contract wallets to facilitate trustless participation in staking mechanisms. The NFT minting process allows depositors to exchange their capital for an NFT representing their stake in a validator, while the treasury contract manages the registry of NFT holders and handles rewards distribution. Validator smart contract wallets are employed to create a trustless connection between the validator operator and the treasury, enabling autonomous staking and unstaking processes based on predefined conditions. In addition, the proposed system incorporates protection mechanisms for depositors, such as triggered exits in case of non-payment of rewards and a penalty payout from the validator operator. The arrangement benefits from the extensibility and interoperability of web3 technologies, with potential applications in the broader digital ecosystem. This zero-trust staking mechanism aims to serve users who desire increased privacy, trust, and flexibility in managing their digital wealth, while promoting greater decentralization and transparency in the PoS ecosystem.

Music mastering engineers have used limiters to heavily compress and make music louder, which can induce ear fatigue and hearing loss in listeners. In this paper, we introduce music de-limiter networks that estimate uncompressed music from heavily compressed signals. Inspired by the principle of a limiter, which performs sample-wise gain reduction of a given signal, we propose the framework of sample-wise gain inversion (SGI). We also present the musdb-XL-train dataset, consisting of 300k segments created by applying a commercial limiter plug-in for training real-world friendly de-limiter networks.

However, LLMs' performance in code clone detection is unclear and needs more study for accurate assessment.In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for clone detection, covering different clone types, languages, and prompts. We find advanced LLMs excel in detecting complex semantic clones, surpassing existing methods. Adding intermediate reasoning steps via chain-of-thought prompts noticeably enhances performance. Additionally, representing code as vector embeddings, especially with text encoders, effectively aids clone detection.Lastly, the ability of LLMs to detect code clones differs among various programming languages. Our study suggests that LLMs have potential for clone detection due to their language capabilities, offering insights for developing robust LLM-based methods to enhance software engineering. ",

    "abstract": "DNN accelerators have been widely deployed in many scenarios to speed up the inference process and reduce the energy consumption. One big concern about the usage of the accelerators is the confidentiality of the deployed models: model inference execution on the accelerators could leak side-channel information, which enables an adversary to preciously recover the model details. Such model extraction attacks can not only compromise the intellectual property of DNN models, but also facilitate some adversarial attacks. Although previous works have demonstrated a number of side-channel techniques to extract models from DNN accelerators, they are not practical for two reasons. (1) They only target simplified accelerator implementations, which have limited practicality in the real world. (2) They require heavy human analysis and domain knowledge. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents Mercury, the first automated remote side-channel attack against the off-the-shelf Nvidia DNN accelerator. The key insight of Mercury is to model the side-channel extraction process as a sequence-to-sequence problem. The adversary can leverage a time-to-digital converter (TDC) to remotely collect the power trace of the target model's inference. Then he uses a learning model to automatically recover the architecture details of the victim model from the power trace without any prior knowledge. The adversary can further use the attention mechanism to localize the leakage points that contribute most to the attack. Evaluation results indicate that Mercury can keep the error rate of model extraction below 1%. ",

To alleviate these issues, we propose a general policy gradient optimization framework, named Conflict-aware Gradient Agreement Augmentation (CG2A), and better integrate augmentation combination into visual RL algorithms to address the generalization bias. In particular, CG2A develops a Gradient Agreement Solver to adaptively balance the varying gradient magnitudes, and introduces a Soft Gradient Surgery strategy to alleviate the gradient conflicts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CG2A significantly improves the generalization performance and sample efficiency of visual RL algorithms. ",

Most existing BIA studies analyze guests personalized behavior at item granularity. A category-based model may be more appropriate in such scenarios. We propose a recommendation system called a hierarchical PCIC model that consists of a personalized category model (PC model) and a personalized item model within categories (IC model). PC model generates a personalized list of categories that customers are likely to purchase again. IC model ranks items within categories that guests are likely to consume within a category. The hierarchical PCIC model captures the general consumption rate of products using survival models. Trends in consumption are captured using time series models. Features derived from these models are used in training a category-grained neural network. We compare PCIC to twelve existing baselines on four standard open datasets. PCIC improves NDCG up to 16 percent while improving recall by around 2 percent. We were able to scale and train (over 8 hours) PCIC on a large dataset of 100M guests and 3M items where repeat categories of a guest out number repeat items. PCIC was deployed and AB tested on the site of a major retailer, leading to significant gains in guest engagement. ",

The problem is formulated in the space-domain with a realistic description of the nonlinear electric powertrain model and motion dynamics to yield a convex optimal control problem (OCP). The OCP is approached by a robust model predictive control (RMPC) method, which handles various uncertainties due to the modelling mismatch and inaccurate information of the leading vehicle. The RMPC problem is solved by semi-definite programming relaxation and single linear matrix inequality (sLMI) techniques for further enhanced computational efficiency. The performance of the proposed real-time robust ecological-adaptive cruise control (REACC) method is evaluated by utilising an urban driving cycle experimentally collected on a real-world route in London UK with practical disturbances including modelling mismatches on air-drag coefficients, tyre-rolling resistance coefficients, and road slope angles. Its robustness is verified through the comparison with a nominal MPC which is shown to result in speed limit constraint violations. The energy economy of the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art time-domain RMPC scheme, as a more precisely fitted convex powertrain model can be integrated into the space-domain scheme. The additional comparison with a traditional constant distance following strategy (CDFS) further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed REACC. Finally, it is verified that the REACC can be potentially implemented in real-time owing to the sLMI and resulting convex algorithm. ",

Existing works well for cyber-attacks such as simple-mode but become a higher false alarm with a resource-limited environment required when the attack is concealed within a contextual feature. In this paper, we present a lightweight intrusion detection model based on semantic fusion, named LSF-IDM. Our motivation is based on the observation that, when injected the malicious packets to the in-vehicle networks (IVNs), the packet log presents a strict order of context feature because of the periodicity and broadcast nature of the CAN bus. Therefore, this model first captures the context as the semantic feature of messages by the BERT language framework. Thereafter, the lightweight model (e.g., BiLSTM) learns the fused feature from an input packet's classification and its output distribution in BERT based on knowledge distillation. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in defending against several representative attacks from IVNs. We also perform the difference analysis of the proposed method with lightweight models and Bert to attain a deeper understanding of how the model balance detection performance and model complexity.

    "abstract": "In this work, we evaluate 10 open-source instructed LLMs on four representative code comprehension and generation tasks. We have the following main findings. First, for the zero-shot setting, instructed LLMs are very competitive on code comprehension and generation tasks and sometimes even better than small SOTA models specifically fine-tuned on each downstream task. We also find that larger instructed LLMs are not always better on code-related tasks. Second, for the few-shot setting, we find that adding demonstration examples substantially helps instructed LLMs perform better on most code comprehension and generation tasks; however, the examples would sometimes induce unstable or even worse performance. Furthermore, we find widely-used BM25-based shot selection strategy significantly outperforms the basic random selection or fixed selection only on generation problems. Third, for the fine-tuning setting, we find that fine-tuning could further improve the model performance on downstream code comprehension and generation tasks compared to the zero-shot/one-shot performance. In addition, after being fine-tuned on the same downstream task dataset, instructed LLMs outperform both the small SOTA models and similar-scaled LLMs without instruction tuning. Based on our findings, we further present practical implications on model and usage recommendation, performance and cost trade-offs, and future direction. ",

    "abstract": "As a harzard disaster, landslide often brings tremendous losses to humanity, so it's necessary to achieve reliable detection of landslide. However, the problems of visual blur and small-sized dataset cause great challenges for old landslide detection task when using remote sensing data. To reliably extract semantic features, a hyper-pixel-wise contrastive learning augmented segmentation network (HPCL-Net) is proposed, which augments the local salient feature extraction from the boundaries of landslides through HPCL and fuses the heterogeneous infromation in the semantic space from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images and Digital Elevation Model Data data. For full utilization of the precious samples, a global hyper-pixel-wise sample pair queues-based contrastive learning method, which includes the construction of global queues that store hyper-pixel-wise samples and the updating scheme of a momentum encoder, is developed, reliably enhancing the extraction ability of semantic features. The proposed HPCL-Net is evaluated on a Loess Plateau old landslide dataset and experiment results show that the model greatly improves the reliablity of old landslide detection compared to the previous old landslide segmentation model, where mIoU metric is increased from 0.620 to 0.651, Landslide IoU metric is increased from 0.334 to 0.394 and F1-score metric is increased from 0.501 to 0.565.

Using the top communities on Reddit (i.e. subreddits), we first contribute a taxonomy of behavior-based rule categories across Reddit. Then, we use a network analysis perspective to discover how changing implementation of different rule categories affects subreddits' user interaction and discussion networks over a 1.5 year period. Our study find several significant effects, including greater clustering among users when subreddits increase rules focused on structural regulation and how restricting allowable content surprisingly leads to more interactions between users.

    "abstract": "Motivated by that DETR-based approaches have established new records on COCO detection and segmentation benchmarks, many recent endeavors show increasing interest in how to further improve DETR-based approaches by pre-training the Transformer in a self-supervised manner while keeping the backbone frozen. Some studies already claimed significant improvements in accuracy. In this paper, we take a closer look at their experimental methodology and check if their approaches are still effective on the very recent state-of-the-art such as $\\mathcal{H}$-Deformable-DETR. We conduct thorough experiments on COCO object detection tasks to study the influence of the choice of pre-training datasets, localization, and classification target generation schemes. Unfortunately, we find the previous representative self-supervised approach such as DETReg, fails to boost the performance of the strong DETR-based approaches on full data regimes. We further analyze the reasons and find that simply combining a more accurate box predictor and Objects$365$ benchmark can significantly improve the results in follow-up experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving strong object detection results of AP=$59.3\\%$ on COCO val set, which surpasses $\\mathcal{H}$-Deformable-DETR + Swin-L by +$1.4\\%$. Last, we generate a series of synthetic pre-training datasets by combining the very recent image-to-text captioning models (LLaVA) and text-to-image generative models (SDXL). Notably, pre-training on these synthetic datasets leads to notable improvements in object detection performance. Looking ahead, we anticipate substantial advantages through the future expansion of the synthetic pre-training dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Successful deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly in safety-critical systems, requires their validation with an adequate test set to ensure a sufficient degree of confidence in test outcomes. Mutation analysis, one of the main techniques for measuring test adequacy in traditional software, has been adapted to DNNs in recent years. This technique is based on generating mutants that aim to be representative of actual faults and thus can be used for test adequacy assessment. In this paper, we investigate for the first time whether mutation operators that directly modify the trained DNN model (i.e., post-training) can be used for reliably assessing the test inputs of DNNs. We propose and evaluate TEASMA, an approach based on post-training mutation for assessing the adequacy of DNN's test sets. In practice, TEASMA allows engineers to decide whether they will be able to trust test results and thus validate the DNN before its deployment. Based on a DNN model's training set, TEASMA provides a methodology to build accurate prediction models of the Fault Detection Rate (FDR) of a test set from its mutation score, thus enabling its assessment. Our large empirical evaluation, across multiple DNN models, shows that predicted FDR values have a strong linear correlation (R2 >= 0.94) with actual values. Consequently, empirical evidence suggests that TEASMA provides a reliable basis for confidently deciding whether to trust test results or improve the test set. ",

    "abstract": "Testing deep learning-based systems is crucial but challenging due to the required time and labor for labeling collected raw data. To alleviate the labeling effort, multiple test selection methods have been proposed where only a subset of test data needs to be labeled while satisfying testing requirements. However, we observe that such methods with reported promising results are only evaluated under simple scenarios, e.g., testing on original test data. This brings a question to us: are they always reliable? In this paper, we explore when and to what extent test selection methods fail for testing. Specifically, first, we identify potential pitfalls of 11 selection methods from top-tier venues based on their construction. Second, we conduct a study on five datasets with two model architectures per dataset to empirically confirm the existence of these pitfalls. Furthermore, we demonstrate how pitfalls can break the reliability of these methods. Concretely, methods for fault detection suffer from test data that are: 1) correctly classified but uncertain, or 2) misclassified but confident. Remarkably, the test relative coverage achieved by such methods drops by up to 86.85%. On the other hand, methods for performance estimation are sensitive to the choice of intermediate-layer output. The effectiveness of such methods can be even worse than random selection when using an inappropriate layer. ",

In this paper, we theoretically show that gradient of entropy (available at decoder side) is correlated with the gradient of the reconstruction error (which is not available at decoder side). We then demonstrate experimentally that this gradient can be used on various compression methods, leading to a $1-2\\%$ rate savings for the same quality.

Of the many ways of ensuring privacy, label differential privacy is a widely used measure of an algorithm's privacy guarantee, which might encourage participants to share responses without running the risk of de-anonymization. Many differentially private mechanisms inject noise into the original data-set to achieve this privacy guarantee, which increases the variance of most statistical estimators and makes the precise measurement of causal effects difficult: there exists a fundamental privacy-variance trade-off to performing causal analyses from differentially private data. With the aim of achieving lower variance for stronger privacy guarantees, we suggest a new differential privacy mechanism, \"Cluster-DP\", which leverages any given cluster structure of the data while still allowing for the estimation of causal effects. We show that, depending on an intuitive measure of cluster quality, we can improve the variance loss while maintaining our privacy guarantees. We compare its performance, theoretically and empirically, to that of its unclustered version and a more extreme uniform-prior version which does not use any of the original response distribution, both of which are special cases of the \"Cluster-DP\" algorithm.

However, due to the inherent local limitations of convolution, a fully convolutional segmentation network with U-shaped architecture struggles to effectively extract global context information, which is vital for the precise localization of lesions. While hybrid architectures combining CNNs and Transformers can address these issues, their application in real medical scenarios is limited due to the computational resource constraints imposed by the environment and edge devices. In addition, the convolutional inductive bias in lightweight networks adeptly fits the scarce medical data, which is lacking in the Transformer based network. In order to extract global context information while taking advantage of the inductive bias, we propose CMUNeXt, an efficient fully convolutional lightweight medical image segmentation network, which enables fast and accurate auxiliary diagnosis in real scene scenarios. CMUNeXt leverages large kernel and inverted bottleneck design to thoroughly mix distant spatial and location information, efficiently extracting global context information. We also introduce the Skip-Fusion block, designed to enable smooth skip-connections and ensure ample feature fusion. Experimental results on multiple medical image datasets demonstrate that CMUNeXt outperforms existing heavyweight and lightweight medical image segmentation networks in terms of segmentation performance, while offering a faster inference speed, lighter weights, and a reduced computational cost.
