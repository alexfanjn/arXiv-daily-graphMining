    "abstract": "This research paper presents AMaizeD: An End to End Pipeline for Automatic Maize Disease Detection, an automated framework for early detection of diseases in maize crops using multispectral imagery obtained from drones. A custom hand-collected dataset focusing specifically on maize crops was meticulously gathered by expert researchers and agronomists. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of maize varieties, cultivation practices, and environmental conditions, capturing various stages of maize growth and disease progression. By leveraging multispectral imagery, the framework benefits from improved spectral resolution and increased sensitivity to subtle changes in plant health. The proposed framework employs a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as feature extractors and segmentation techniques to identify both the maize plants and their associated diseases. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in detecting a range of maize diseases, including powdery mildew, anthracnose, and leaf blight. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the custom hand-collected dataset and contributes to the field of automated disease detection in agriculture, offering a practical solution for early identification of diseases in maize crops advanced machine learning techniques and deep learning architectures.

    "title": "GeoTransformer: Fast and Robust Point Cloud Registration with Geometric  Transformer",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of extracting accurate correspondences for point cloud registration. Recent keypoint-free methods have shown great potential through bypassing the detection of repeatable keypoints which is difficult to do especially in low-overlap scenarios. They seek correspondences over downsampled superpoints, which are then propagated to dense points. Superpoints are matched based on whether their neighboring patches overlap. Such sparse and loose matching requires contextual features capturing the geometric structure of the point clouds. We propose Geometric Transformer, or GeoTransformer for short, to learn geometric feature for robust superpoint matching. It encodes pair-wise distances and triplet-wise angles, making it invariant to rigid transformation and robust in low-overlap cases. The simplistic design attains surprisingly high matching accuracy such that no RANSAC is required in the estimation of alignment transformation, leading to $100$ times acceleration. Extensive experiments on rich benchmarks encompassing indoor, outdoor, synthetic, multiway and non-rigid demonstrate the efficacy of GeoTransformer. Notably, our method improves the inlier ratio by $18{\\sim}31$ percentage points and the registration recall by over $7$ points on the challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark.

    "abstract": "Visual Saliency refers to the innate human mechanism of focusing on and extracting important features from the observed environment. Recently, there has been a notable surge of interest in the field of automotive research regarding the estimation of visual saliency. While operating a vehicle, drivers naturally direct their attention towards specific objects, employing brain-driven saliency mechanisms that prioritize certain elements over others. In this investigation, we present an intelligent system that combines a drowsiness detection system for drivers with a scene comprehension pipeline based on saliency. To achieve this, we have implemented a specialized 3D deep network for semantic segmentation, which has been pretrained and tailored for processing the frames captured by an automotive-grade external camera. The proposed pipeline was hosted on an embedded platform utilizing the STA1295 core, featuring ARM A7 dual-cores, and embeds an hardware accelerator. Additionally, we employ an innovative biosensor embedded on the car steering wheel to monitor the driver drowsiness, gathering the PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) signal of the driver. A dedicated 1D temporal deep convolutional network has been devised to classify the collected PPG time-series, enabling us to assess the driver level of attentiveness. Ultimately, we compare the determined attention level of the driver with the corresponding saliency-based scene classification to evaluate the overall safety level. The efficacy of the proposed pipeline has been validated through extensive experimental results. ",

    "abstract": "Since the advent of Neural Radiance Fields, novel view synthesis has received tremendous attention. The existing approach for the generalization of radiance field reconstruction primarily constructs an encoding volume from nearby source images as additional inputs. However, these approaches cannot efficiently encode the geometric information of real scenes with various scale objects/structures. In this work, we propose constructing multi-scale encoding volumes and providing multi-scale geometry information to NeRF models. To make the constructed volumes as close as possible to the surfaces of objects in the scene and the rendered depth more accurate, we propose to perform depth prediction and radiance field reconstruction simultaneously. The predicted depth map will be used to supervise the rendered depth, narrow the depth range, and guide points sampling. Finally, the geometric information contained in point volume features may be inaccurate due to occlusion, lighting, etc. To this end, we propose enhancing the point volume feature from depth-guided neighbor feature fusion. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both novel view synthesis and dense geometry modeling without per-scene optimization. ",

Many recent works have created probabilistic models of graphs that are capable of representing not only entity interactions but also their attributes. However, given a generative model of random attributed graph(s), the general conditions that establish goodness of fit are not clear a-priori. In this paper, we define goodness of fit in terms of the mean square contingency coefficient for random binary networks. For this statistic, we outline a procedure for assessing the quality of the structure of a learned attributed graph by ensuring that the discrepancy of the mean square contingency coefficient (constant, or random) is minimal with high probability. We apply these criteria to verify the representation capability of a probabilistic generative model for various popular types of graph models. ",

We show several immediate consequences of this: adversarial attacks that change the resulting class based on their intensity, and scale-independent adversarial examples. To demonstrate the redundancy and richness of class decision boundaries in the pixel space, we look for its two-dimensional sections that trace images and spell words using particular classes.

However, most of the previous works in activity and sensor stream analysis have been focusing on one aspect of the data, e.g. only recognizing the type of the activity or only identifying the person who performed the activity. We instead propose an approach that uses a weakly supervised multi-output siamese network that learns to map the data into multiple representation spaces, where each representation space focuses on one aspect of the data. The representation vectors of the data samples are positioned in the space such that the data with the same semantic meaning in that aspect are closely located to each other. Therefore, as demonstrated with a set of experiments, the trained model can provide metrics for clustering data based on multiple aspects, allowing it to address multiple tasks simultaneously and even to outperform single task supervised methods in many situations. In addition, further experiments are presented that in more detail analyze the effect of the architecture and of using multiple tasks within this framework, that investigate the scalability of the model to include additional tasks, and that demonstrate the ability of the framework to combine data for which only partial relationship information with respect to the target tasks is available.

In this exploratory study, we proposed an experimental framework to investigate and model male/female differences in attitudes towards online privacy and anonymity among Israeli students. Our aim was to comparatively model men and women's online privacy attitudes, and to assess the online privacy gender gap. Method. Various factors related to the user's online privacy and anonymity were considered, such as awareness of anonymous threats made online, concern for protecting personal information on the Internet, online privacy self-efficacy, online privacy literacy and users' tendency to engage in privacy paradox behaviour, i.e., personal data disclosure despite the awareness of anonymity and privacy threats. Analysis. A user study was carried out among 169 Israeli academic students through a quantitative method using closed-ended questionnaires. The subjects' responses were analysed using standard statistical measures. We then proposed a summarized comparative model for the two sexes' online privacy behaviour. Results. We found that a digital gap still exists between men and women regarding technological knowledge and skills used to protect their identity and personal information on the Web. Interestingly, users' tendency to engage in privacy paradox behaviour was not higher among men despite their higher level of technological online privacy literacy compared to women. Conclusions. Women's relatively high online privacy self-efficacy level and their low awareness of technological threat do not match their relatively low technological online privacy literacy level. This leads to a lower ability to protect their identity and personal information as compared to men. We conclude that further steps should be taken to eliminate the inter-gender technological gap in online privacy and anonymity awareness and literacy. ",

Comprehending the behaviors of flow is a formidable task, due to the intricate interplay between the distribution of seeds that initiate flow propagation, the propagation model, and the topology of the graph. The study of networks encompasses a diverse range of academic disciplines, including mathematics, physics, social science, and computer science. This interdisciplinary nature of network research is characterized by a high degree of specialization and compartmentalization, and the cooperation facilitated by them is inadequate. From a machine learning standpoint, there is a deficiency in a cohesive platform for assessing algorithms across various domains. One of the primary obstacles to current research in this field is the absence of a comprehensive curated benchmark suite to study the flow behaviors under network scenarios. To address this disparity, we propose the implementation of a novel benchmark suite that encompasses a variety of tasks, baseline models, graph datasets, and evaluation tools. In addition, we present a comprehensive analytical framework that offers a generalized approach to numerous flow-related tasks across diverse domains, serving as a blueprint and roadmap. Drawing upon the outcomes of our empirical investigation, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of current foundational models, and we underscore potential avenues for further study.

As an important pre-processing step, it has many potential applications in multimedia and vision tasks. With the advance of imaging devices, SOD with high-resolution images is of great demand, recently. However, traditional SOD methods are largely limited to low-resolution images, making them difficult to adapt to the development of High-Resolution SOD (HRSOD). Although some HRSOD methods emerge, there are no large enough datasets for training and evaluating. Besides, current HRSOD methods generally produce incomplete object regions and irregular object boundaries. To address above issues, in this work, we first propose a new HRS10K dataset, which contains 10,500 high-quality annotated images at 2K-8K resolution. As far as we know, it is the largest dataset for the HRSOD task, which will significantly help future works in training and evaluating models. Furthermore, to improve the HRSOD performance, we propose a novel Recurrent Multi-scale Transformer (RMFormer), which recurrently utilizes shared Transformers and multi-scale refinement architectures. Thus, high-resolution saliency maps can be generated with the guidance of lower-resolution predictions. Extensive experiments on both high-resolution and low-resolution benchmarks show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.

These models are rapidly being employed in commercial AI-based developer tools, such as GitHub CoPilot. However, measuring and explaining their effectiveness on programming tasks is a challenging proposition, given their size and complexity. The methods for evaluating and explaining LLMs for code are inextricably linked. That is, in order to explain a model's predictions, they must be reliably mapped to fine-grained, understandable concepts. Once this mapping is achieved, new methods for detailed model evaluations are possible. However, most current explainability techniques and evaluation benchmarks focus on model robustness or individual task performance, as opposed to interpreting model predictions. To this end, this paper introduces ASTxplainer, an explainability method specific to LLMs for code that enables both new methods for LLM evaluation and visualizations of LLM predictions that aid end-users in understanding model predictions. At its core, ASTxplainer provides an automated method for aligning token predictions with AST nodes, by extracting and aggregating normalized model logits within AST structures. To demonstrate the practical benefit of ASTxplainer, we illustrate the insights that our framework can provide by performing an empirical evaluation on 12 popular LLMs for code using a curated dataset of the most popular GitHub projects. Additionally, we perform a user study examining the usefulness of an ASTxplainer-derived visualization of model predictions aimed at enabling model users to explain predictions. The results of these studies illustrate the potential for ASTxplainer to provide insights into LLM effectiveness, and aid end-users in understanding predictions. ",

For instance, the ITS/AIS can better personalize itself to correct specific misconceptions that are indicated by incorrect strategies, specific problems can be designed to improve strategies and frustration can be minimized by adapting to a student's natural way of thinking rather than trying to fit a standard strategy for all. While it may be possible for human experts to identify strategies manually in classroom settings with sufficient student interaction, it is not possible to scale this up to big data. Therefore, we leverage advances in Machine Learning and AI methods to perform scalable strategy prediction that is also fair to students at all skill levels. Specifically, we develop an embedding called MVec where we learn a representation based on the mastery of students. We then cluster these embeddings with a non-parametric clustering method where we progressively learn clusters such that we group together instances that have approximately symmetrical strategies. The strategy prediction model is trained on instances sampled from these clusters. This ensures that we train the model over diverse strategies and also that strategies from a particular group do not bias the DNN model, thus allowing it to optimize its parameters over all groups. Using real world large-scale student interaction datasets from MATHia, we implement our approach using transformers and Node2Vec for learning the mastery embeddings and LSTMs for predicting strategies. We show that our approach can scale up to achieve high accuracy by training on a small sample of a large dataset and also has predictive equality, i.e., it can predict strategies equally well for learners at diverse skill levels.

This paper introduces a method for reconstructing an approximate developable surface from a neural implicit surface. The central idea of our method involves incorporating a regularization term that operates on the second-order derivatives of the neural implicits, effectively promoting zero Gaussian curvature. Implicit surfaces offer the advantage of smoother deformation with infinite resolution, overcoming the high polygonal constraints of state-of-the-art methods using discrete representations. We draw inspiration from the properties of surface curvature and employ rank minimization techniques derived from compressed sensing.

We can model the bias with the average of the data series and the average of the points drawn along the line. This bias might arise because higher variability leads to stronger weighting in the average calculation, either due to the longer line segments (even though those segments contain the same number of data values) or line segments with higher variability being otherwise more visually salient. Understanding and predicting this bias is important for visualization design guidelines, recommendation systems, and tool builders, as the bias can adversely affect estimates of averages and trends.

    "abstract": "Nonlinear materials are often difficult to model with classical state model theory because they have a complex and sometimes inaccurate physical and mathematical description or we simply do not know how to describe such materials in terms of relations between external and internal variables. In many disciplines, Neural Network methods have arisen as powerful tools to identify very complex and non-linear correlations. In this work, we use the very recently developed concept of Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables (PGNNIV) to discover constitutive laws using a model-free approach and training solely with measured force-displacement data. PGNNIVs make a particular use of the physics of the problem to enforce constraints on specific hidden layers and are able to make predictions without internal variable data. We demonstrate that PGNNIVs are capable of predicting both internal and external variables under unseen load scenarios, regardless of the nature of the material considered (linear, with hardening or softening behavior and hyperelastic), unravelling the constitutive law of the material hence explaining its nature altogether, placing the method in what is known as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

    "abstract": "Methods: Through an innovative approach, we construct ontology-based knowledge graphs from authentic medical literature and AI-generated content. Our goal is to distinguish factual information from unverified data. We compiled two datasets: one from biomedical literature using a \"human disease and symptoms\" query, and another generated by ChatGPT, simulating articles. With these datasets (PubMed and ChatGPT), we curated 10 sets of 250 abstracts each, selected randomly with a specific seed. Our method focuses on utilizing disease ontology (DOID) and symptom ontology (SYMP) to build knowledge graphs, robust mathematical models that facilitate unbiased comparisons. By employing our fact-checking algorithms and network centrality metrics, we conducted GPT disease-symptoms link analysis to quantify the accuracy of factual knowledge amid noise, hypotheses, and significant findings. Results: The findings obtained from the comparison of diverse ChatGPT knowledge graphs with their PubMed counterparts revealed some interesting observations. While PubMed knowledge graphs exhibit a wealth of disease-symptom terms, it is surprising to observe that some ChatGPT graphs surpass them in the number of connections. Furthermore, some GPT graphs are demonstrating supremacy of the centrality scores, especially for the overlapping nodes. This striking contrast indicates the untapped potential of knowledge that can be derived from AI-generated content, awaiting verification. Out of all the graphs, the factual link ratio between any two graphs reached its peak at 60%. Conclusions: An intriguing insight from our findings was the striking number of links among terms in the knowledge graph generated from ChatGPT datasets, surpassing some of those in its PubMed counterpart. This early discovery has prompted further investigation using universal network metrics to unveil the new knowledge the links may hold. ",

This paper presents a novel and efficient AWB correction method that achieves at least 35 times faster processing with equivalent or superior performance on high-resolution images for the current state-of-the-art methods. Inspired by deterministic color style transfer, our approach introduces deterministic illumination color mapping, leveraging learnable projection matrices for both canonical illumination form and AWB-corrected output. It involves feeding high-resolution images and corresponding latent representations into a mapping module to derive a canonical form, followed by another mapping module that maps the pixel values to those for the corrected version. This strategy is designed as resolution-agnostic and also enables seamless integration of any pre-trained AWB network as the backbone. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach, revealing significant performance improvements and reduced time complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method provides an efficient deep learning-based AWB correction solution, promising real-time, high-quality color correction for digital imaging applications.

Once trained, GraPhSyM provides accurate visibility of final design metrics to early EDA stages, such as logic synthesis, without running the slow physical synthesis flow, enabling global co-optimization across stages. Additionally, the swift and precise feedback provided by GraPhSym is instrumental for machine-learning-based EDA optimization frameworks. Given a gate-level netlist of a circuit represented as a graph, GraPhSyM utilizes graph structure, connectivity, and electrical property features to predict the impact of physical synthesis transformations such as buffer insertion and gate sizing. When trained on a dataset of 6000 prefix adder designs synthesized at an aggressive delay target, GraPhSyM can accurately predict the post-synthesis delay (98.3%) and area (96.1%) metrics of unseen adders with a fast 0.22s inference time. Furthermore, we illustrate the compositionality of GraPhSyM by employing the model trained on a fixed delay target to accurately anticipate post-synthesis metrics at a variety of unseen delay targets. Lastly, we report promising generalization capabilities of the GraPhSyM model when it is evaluated on circuits different from the adders it was exclusively trained on. The results show the potential for GraPhSyM to serve as a powerful tool for advanced optimization techniques and as an oracle for EDA machine learning frameworks. ",

On the other hand, human perception, which DNNs are supposed to emulate, is highly robust to such perturbations, indicating that there may be certain features of the human perception that make it robust but are not represented in the current class of DNNs. One such feature is that the activity of biological neurons is correlated and the structure of this correlation tends to be rather rigid over long spans of times, even if it hampers performance and learning. We hypothesize that integrating such constraints on the activations of a DNN would improve its adversarial robustness, and, to test this hypothesis, we have developed the Self-Consistent Activation (SCA) layer, which comprises of neurons whose activations are consistent with each other, as they conform to a fixed, but learned, covariability pattern. When evaluated on image and sound recognition tasks, the models with a SCA layer achieved high accuracy, and exhibited significantly greater robustness than multi-layer perceptron models to state-of-the-art Auto-PGD adversarial attacks \\textit{without being trained on adversarially perturbed data ",

So far, many methods have been proposed, with recent focus on leveraging Deep Learning to solve this problem. However, we observe that most of the efforts has been paid to having better representation of entities, rather than improving entity matching from the learned representations. In fact, how to efficiently infer the entity pairs from this similarity matrix, which is essentially a matching problem, has been largely ignored by the community. Motivated by this observation, we conduct an in-depth analysis on existing algorithms that are particularly designed for solving this matching problem, and propose a novel matching method, named Bidirectional Matching (BMat). Our extensive experimental results on public datasets indicate that there is currently no single silver bullet solution for EA. In other words, different classes of entity similarity estimation may require different matching algorithms to reach the best EA results for each class. We finally conclude that using PARIS, the state-of-the-art EA approach, with BMat gives the best combination in terms of EA performance and the algorithm's time and space complexity. ",

However, most existing platooning systems assume the availability of pre-determined plans, which is not feasible in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we address this issue in time-dependent networks by formulating a Markov decision process at each junction, aiming to minimize travel time and fuel consumption. Initially, we analyze coordinated platooning without routing to explore the cooperation among controllers on an identical path. We propose two novel approaches based on approximate dynamic programming, offering suboptimal control in the context of a stochastic finite horizon problem. The results demonstrate the superiority of the approximation in the policy space. Furthermore, we investigate platooning in a network setting, where speed profiles and routes are determined simultaneously. To simplify the problem, we decouple the action space by prioritizing routing decisions based on travel time estimation. We subsequently employ the aforementioned policy approximation to determine speed profiles, considering essential parameters such as travel times. Our simulation results in SUMO indicate that our method yields better performance than conventional approaches, leading to potential travel cost savings of up to 40%. Additionally, we evaluate the resilience of our approach in dynamically changing networks, affirming its ability to maintain efficient platooning operations. ",

However, optimal partitioning is challenging, especially in statistical inference as the cost to be optimised is dependent on both nodes within a cluster, and the mapping of clusters connected via parent and/or child nodes, which we call dependent clusters. We propose a novel algorithm called DCMAP for optimal cluster mapping with dependent clusters. Given an arbitrarily defined, positive cost function based on the DAG and cluster mappings, we show that DCMAP converges to find all optimal clusters, and returns near-optimal solutions along the way. Empirically, we find that the algorithm is time-efficient for a DBN model of a seagrass complex system using a computation cost function. For a 25 and 50-node DBN, the search space size was $9.91\\times 10^9$ and $1.51\\times10^{21}$ possible cluster mappings, respectively, but near-optimal solutions with 88\\% and 72\\% similarity to the optimal solution were found at iterations 170 and 865, respectively.

Previous works mainly rely on contrastive learning or masked motion modeling paradigm to model the skeleton relations. However, the sequence-level and joint-level representation learning cannot be effectively and simultaneously handled by these methods. As a result, the learned representations fail to generalize to different downstream tasks. Moreover, combining these two paradigms in a naive manner leaves the synergy between them untapped and can lead to interference in training. To address these problems, we propose Prompted Contrast with Masked Motion Modeling, PCM$^{\\rm 3}$, for versatile 3D action representation learning. Our method integrates the contrastive learning and masked prediction tasks in a mutually beneficial manner, which substantially boosts the generalization capacity for various downstream tasks. Specifically, masked prediction provides novel training views for contrastive learning, which in turn guides the masked prediction training with high-level semantic information. Moreover, we propose a dual-prompted multi-task pretraining strategy, which further improves model representations by reducing the interference caused by learning the two different pretext tasks. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks under three large-scale datasets are conducted, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of PCM$^{\\rm 3}$ compared to the state-of-the-art works.

They profoundly influence building design and urban planning as major environmental impacts. Understanding local microclimates is essential for cities to prepare for climate change and effectively implement resilience measures. However, analyzing urban microclimates requires considering a complex array of outdoor parameters within computational domains at the city scale over a longer period than indoors. As a result, numerical methods like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) become computationally expensive when evaluating the impact of urban microclimates. The rise of deep learning techniques has opened new opportunities for accelerating the modeling of complex non-linear interactions and system dynamics. Recently, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has been shown to be very promising in accelerating solving the Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and modeling fluid dynamic systems. In this work, we apply the FNO network for real-time three-dimensional (3D) urban wind field simulation. The training and testing data are generated from CFD simulation of the urban area, based on the semi-Lagrangian approach and fractional stepping method to simulate urban microclimate features for modeling large-scale urban problems. Numerical experiments show that the FNO model can accurately reconstruct the instantaneous spatial velocity field. We further evaluate the trained FNO model on unseen data with different wind directions, and the results show that the FNO model can generalize well on different wind directions. More importantly, the FNO approach can make predictions within milliseconds on the graphics processing unit, making real-time simulation of 3D dynamic urban microclimate possible. ",

The original architecture of the YOLOv5s was modified by replacing the C3 module with the C2f module in the backbone network, which provided a better feature gradient flow. Secondly, the Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast in the final layer of the backbone network of YOLOv5s was combined with Cross Stage Partial Net to improve the generalization ability over the strawberry dataset in this study. The proposed architecture was named YOLOv5s-Straw. The RGB images dataset of the strawberry canopy with three maturity classes (immature, nearly mature, and mature) was collected in open-field environment and augmented through a series of operations including brightness reduction, brightness increase, and noise adding. To verify the superiority of the proposed method for strawberry detection in open-field environment, four competitive detection models (YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5s-C2f, and YOLOv8s) were trained, and tested under the same computational environment and compared with YOLOv5s-Straw. The results showed that the highest mean average precision of 80.3% was achieved using the proposed architecture whereas the same was achieved with YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5s-C2f, and YOLOv8s were 73.4%, 77.8%, 79.8%, 79.3%, respectively. Specifically, the average precision of YOLOv5s-Straw was 82.1% in the immature class, 73.5% in the nearly mature class, and 86.6% in the mature class, which were 2.3% and 3.7%, respectively, higher than that of the latest YOLOv8s.

Two-stage methods following retrieve-and-rerank paradigm have achieved excellent performance, but their separate local and global modules are inefficient to real-world applications. To better trade-off retrieval efficiency and accuracy, some approaches fuse global and local feature into a joint representation to perform single-stage image retrieval. However, they are still challenging due to various situations to tackle, $e.g.$, background, occlusion and viewpoint. In this work, we design a Coarse-to-Fine framework to learn Compact Discriminative representation (CFCD) for end-to-end single-stage image retrieval-requiring only image-level labels. Specifically, we first design a novel adaptive softmax-based loss which dynamically tunes its scale and margin within each mini-batch and increases them progressively to strengthen supervision during training and intra-class compactness. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism which attentively selects prominent local descriptors and infuse fine-grained semantic relations into the global representation by a hard negative sampling strategy to optimize inter-class distinctiveness at a global scale. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art single-stage image retrieval performance on benchmarks such as Revisited Oxford and Revisited Paris.

    "abstract": "Estimating causal effects from observational network data is a significant but challenging problem. Existing works in causal inference for observational network data lack an analysis of the generalization bound, which can theoretically provide support for alleviating the complex confounding bias and practically guide the design of learning objectives in a principled manner. To fill this gap, we derive a generalization bound for causal effect estimation in network scenarios by exploiting 1) the reweighting schema based on joint propensity score and 2) the representation learning schema based on Integral Probability Metric (IPM). We provide two perspectives on the generalization bound in terms of reweighting and representation learning, respectively. Motivated by the analysis of the bound, we propose a weighting regression method based on the joint propensity score augmented with representation learning. Extensive experimental studies on two real-world networks with semi-synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of distributed target tracking via underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) with fading channels. The degradation of signal quality due to wireless channel fading can significantly impact network reliability and subsequently reduce the tracking accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a modified distributed unscented Kalman filter (DUKF) named DUKF-Fc, which takes into account the effects of measurement fluctuation and transmission failure induced by channel fading. The channel estimation error is also considered when designing the estimator and a sufficient condition is established to ensure the stochastic boundedness of the estimation error. The proposed filtering scheme is versatile and possesses wide applicability to numerous real-world scenarios, e.g., tracking a maneuvering underwater target with acoustic sensors. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filtering algorithm. In addition, considering the constraints of network energy resources, the issue of investigating a trade-off between tracking performance and energy consumption is discussed accordingly. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning based medical image recognition systems often require a substantial amount of training data with expert annotations, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Recently, synthetic augmentation techniques have been proposed to mitigate the issue by generating realistic images conditioned on class labels. However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the representation capability of the trained generative model, which cannot be guaranteed without sufficient labeled training data. To further reduce the dependency on annotated data, we propose a synthetic augmentation method called HistoDiffusion, which can be pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets and later applied to a small-scale labeled dataset for augmented training. In particular, we train a latent diffusion model (LDM) on diverse unlabeled datasets to learn common features and generate realistic images without conditional inputs. Then, we fine-tune the model with classifier guidance in latent space on an unseen labeled dataset so that the model can synthesize images of specific categories. Additionally, we adopt a selective mechanism to only add synthetic samples with high confidence of matching to target labels. We evaluate our proposed method by pre-training on three histopathology datasets and testing on a histopathology dataset of colorectal cancer (CRC) excluded from the pre-training datasets. With HistoDiffusion augmentation, the classification accuracy of a backbone classifier is remarkably improved by 6.4% using a small set of the original labels.

Accurately quantifying gene expression requires image registration to a brain template, which is difficult due to the diversity of patterns causing variations in visible anatomical brain structures. Our approach uses implicit networks in combination with an image exclusion loss to jointly perform the registration and decompose the image into a support and residual image. The support image aligns well with the template, while the residual image captures individual image characteristics that diverge from the template. In experiments, our method provided excellent results and outperformed other registration techniques. ",

However, how to effectively leverage rich temporal cues and fuse two heterogeneous visual streams remains a challenging endeavor. To address this challenge, we propose a novel streaming object detector with Transformer, namely SODFormer, which first integrates events and frames to continuously detect objects in an asynchronous manner. Technically, we first build a large-scale multimodal neuromorphic object detection dataset (i.e., PKU-DAVIS-SOD) over 1080.1k manual labels. Then, we design a spatiotemporal Transformer architecture to detect objects via an end-to-end sequence prediction problem, where the novel temporal Transformer module leverages rich temporal cues from two visual streams to improve the detection performance. Finally, an asynchronous attention-based fusion module is proposed to integrate two heterogeneous sensing modalities and take complementary advantages from each end, which can be queried at any time to locate objects and break through the limited output frequency from synchronized frame-based fusion strategies. The results show that the proposed SODFormer outperforms four state-of-the-art methods and our eight baselines by a significant margin. We also show that our unifying framework works well even in cases where the conventional frame-based camera fails, e.g., high-speed motion and low-light conditions.

In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of far-field 3D detection using the long-range detection dataset Argoverse 2.0 to better understand the problem, and share the following insight: near-field LiDAR measurements are dense and optimally encoded by small voxels, while far-field measurements are sparse and are better encoded with large voxels. We exploit this observation to build a collection of range experts tuned for near-vs-far field detection, and propose simple techniques to efficiently ensemble models for long-range detection that improve efficiency by 33% and boost accuracy by 3.2% CDS.

We derive two upper bounds for the robust risk and propose a regularization term for unlabeled data motivated by these two upper bounds. Then, we develop a semi-supervised adversarial training algorithm that combines the proposed regularization term with knowledge distillation using a semi-supervised teacher (i.e., a teacher model trained using a semi-supervised learning algorithm). Our experiments show that our proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant margins compared to existing algorithms. In particular, compared to supervised learning algorithms, performance of our proposed algorithm is not much worse even when the amount of labeled data is very small. For example, our algorithm with only 8\\% labeled data is comparable to supervised adversarial training algorithms that use all labeled data, both in terms of standard and robust accuracies on CIFAR-10.

In this work, we reveal the connection between the optimization difficulty of PINNs and activation functions. Specifically, we show that PINNs exhibit high sensitivity to activation functions when solving PDEs with distinct properties. Existing works usually choose activation functions by inefficient trial-and-error. To avoid the inefficient manual selection and to alleviate the optimization difficulty of PINNs, we introduce adaptive activation functions to search for the optimal function when solving different problems. We compare different adaptive activation functions and discuss their limitations in the context of PINNs. Furthermore, we propose to tailor the idea of learning combinations of candidate activation functions to the PINNs optimization, which has a higher requirement for the smoothness and diversity on learned functions. This is achieved by removing activation functions which cannot provide higher-order derivatives from the candidate set and incorporating elementary functions with different properties according to our prior knowledge about the PDE at hand. We further enhance the search space with adaptive slopes. The proposed adaptive activation function can be used to solve different PDE systems in an interpretable way.

We provide the first empirical study of the extent of vote revelation under several possible election-reporting regimes, ranging from precinct-level results to the individual ballot records known as cast vote records. Using Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study, we find that cast vote records could reveal less than 0.2% of any voters' choices in the 2020 general election. Perhaps counterintuitively, releasing cast vote records coded by precinct and vote method are no more revelatory than releasing aggregate vote tallies for each precinct and vote method. We conclude that cast vote records are sufficiently privacy-protecting, and suggest how the privacy violations that do remain could be reduced. ",

However, if evaluation times vary significantly, many worker nodes (i.e.,\\ compute clients) are idle much of the time, waiting for the next generation to be created. Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS), a class of EAs that optimizes the architecture and hyperparameters of deep neural networks, is particularly vulnerable to this issue. This paper proposes a generic asynchronous evaluation strategy (AES) that is then adapted to work with ENAS. AES increases throughput by maintaining a queue of upto $K$ individuals ready to be sent to the workers for evaluation and proceeding to the next generation as soon as $M<<K$ individuals have been evaluated by the workers. A suitable value for $M$ is determined experimentally, balancing diversity and efficiency. To showcase the generality and power of AES, it was first evaluated in 11-bit multiplexer design (a single-population verifiable discovery task) and then scaled up to ENAS for image captioning (a multi-population open-ended-optimization task). In both problems, a multifold performance improvement was observed, suggesting that AES is a promising method for parallelizing the evolution of complex systems with long and variable evaluation times, such as those in ENAS.

    "abstract": "Reliable and robust evaluation methods are a necessary first step towards developing machine learning models that are themselves robust and reliable. Unfortunately, current evaluation protocols typically used to assess classifiers fail to comprehensively evaluate performance as they tend to rely on limited types of test data, and ignore others. For example, using the standard test data fails to evaluate the predictions made by the classifier to samples from classes it was not trained on. On the other hand, testing with data containing samples from unknown classes fails to evaluate how well the classifier can predict the labels for known classes. This article advocates bench-marking performance using a wide range of different types of data and using a single metric that can be applied to all such data types to produce a consistent evaluation of performance. Using such a benchmark it is found that current deep neural networks, including those trained with methods that are believed to produce state-of-the-art robustness, are extremely vulnerable to making mistakes on certain types of data. This means that such models will be unreliable in real-world scenarios where they may encounter data from many different domains, and that they are insecure as they can easily be fooled into making the wrong decisions. It is hoped that these results will motivate the wider adoption of more comprehensive testing methods that will, in turn, lead to the development of more robust machine learning methods in the future.

However, these models mainly rely on the classification loss to implicitly regularize the class-level data distributions, and they may face difficulties when handling classes with diverse visual patterns. We argue that the incorporation of the structural information between data samples may improve this situation. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a framework termed \\textbf{C}lass-level Structural Relation Modeling and Smoothing for Visual Representation Learning (CSRMS), which includes the Class-level Relation Modelling, Class-aware Graph Sampling, and Relational Graph-Guided Representation Learning modules to model a relational graph of the entire dataset and perform class-aware smoothing and regularization operations to alleviate the issue of intra-class visual diversity and inter-class similarity. Specifically, the Class-level Relation Modelling module uses a clustering algorithm to learn the data distributions in the feature space and identify three types of class-level sample relations for the training set; Class-aware Graph Sampling module extends typical training batch construction process with three strategies to sample dataset-level sub-graphs; and Relational Graph-Guided Representation Learning module employs a graph convolution network with knowledge-guided smoothing operations to ease the projection from different visual patterns to the same class. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of structured knowledge modelling for enhanced representation learning and show that CSRMS can be incorporated with any state-of-the-art visual representation learning models for performance gains.

In the case of classical Sound Source Localization (SSL) algorithms, information from a high dimensional, multichannel audio signals received by many distributed microphones is combined with information describing acoustic properties of the scene, such as the microphones' coordinates in space, to estimate the position of a sound source. We introduce Dual Input Neural Networks (DI-NNs) as a simple and effective way to model these two data types in a neural network. We train and evaluate our proposed DI-NN on scenarios of varying difficulty and realism and compare it against an alternative architecture, a classical Least-Squares (LS) method as well as a classical Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN). Our results show that the DI-NN significantly outperforms the baselines, achieving a five times lower localization error than the LS method and two times lower than the CRNN in a test dataset of real recordings.

    "abstract": "In the last decades, people have been consuming and combining more drugs than before, increasing the number of Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs). To predict unknown DDIs, recently, studies started incorporating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) since they are able to capture the relationships among entities providing better drug representations than using a single drug property. In this paper, we propose the medicX end-to-end framework that integrates several drug features from public drug repositories into a KG and embeds the nodes in the graph using various translation, factorisation and Neural Network (NN) based KG Embedding (KGE) methods. Ultimately, we use a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm that predicts unknown DDIs. Among the different translation and factorisation-based KGE models, we found that the best performing combination was the ComplEx embedding method with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which obtained an F1-score of 95.19% on a dataset based on the DDIs found in DrugBank version 5.1.8. This score is 5.61% better than the state-of-the-art model DeepDDI. Additionally, we also developed a graph auto-encoder model that uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which achieved an F1-score of 91.94%. Consequently, GNNs have demonstrated a stronger ability to mine the underlying semantics of the KG than the ComplEx model, and thus using higher dimension embeddings within the GNN can lead to state-of-the-art performance.

However, they have limited generalizability in some practical scenarios, where the copy-move objects may not appear in the training images or cloned regions are from the background. To address the above issues, in this work, we propose a novel end-to-end CMFD framework by integrating merits from both conventional and deep methods. Specifically, we design a deep cross-scale patchmatch method tailored for CMFD to localize copy-move regions. In contrast to existing deep models, our scheme aims to seek explicit and reliable point-to-point matching between source and target regions using features extracted from high-resolution scales. Further, we develop a manipulation region location branch for source/target separation. The proposed CMFD framework is completely differentiable and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the high generalizability of our method to different copy-move contents, and the proposed scheme achieves significantly better performance than existing approaches.

Graph Deep Learning (GDL) has emerged as a promising field for tasks like scene interpretation, leveraging flexible graph structures to concisely describe complex features and relationships. As traditional explainability methods used in eXplainable AI (XAI) cannot be directly applied to such structures, graph-specific approaches are introduced. Attention mechanisms have demonstrated their efficacy in estimating the importance of input features in deep learning models and thus have been previously employed to provide feature-based explanations for GNN predictions. Building upon these insights, we extend existing attention-based graph-explainability methods investigating the use of attention weights as importance indicators of semantically sorted feature sets. Through analysing the behaviour of predicted attention-weights distribution in correlation with model accuracy, we gain valuable insights into feature importance with respect to the behaviour of the GNN model. We apply our methodology to a lidar pointcloud estimation model successfully identifying key semantic classes that contribute to enhanced performance effectively generating reliable post-hoc semantic explanations.

Devices have access to data, previously not used for training, and can communicate to the server over a common wireless channel. If the devices have no access to the new input, can communication from devices to the server enhance the quality of the inference decision at the server? Recent work has introduced federated conformal prediction (CP), which leverages devices-to-server communication to improve the reliability of the server's decision. With federated CP, devices communicate to the server information about the loss accrued by the shared pre-trained model on the local data, and the server leverages this information to calibrate a decision interval, or set, so that it is guaranteed to contain the correct answer with a pre-defined target reliability level. Previous work assumed noise-free communication, whereby devices can communicate a single real number to the server. In this paper, we study for the first time federated CP in a wireless setting. We introduce a novel protocol, termed wireless federated conformal prediction (WFCP), which builds on type-based multiple access (TBMA) and on a novel quantile correction strategy. WFCP is proved to provide formal reliability guarantees in terms of coverage of the predicted set produced by the server. Using numerical results, we demonstrate the significant advantages of WFCP against digital implementations of existing federated CP schemes, especially in regimes with limited communication resources and/or large number of devices.

Second, robustness guarantees are derived for the estimation of time-varying parameters in the presence of measurement noise and regressor noise. These robustness guarantees are presented in terms of global uniform ultimate boundedness of the parameter estimation error.

Prior works mainly focus on the observed structure or sequence of cascades, trying to predict to whom this cascade will be infected passively. In this study, we argue that user intent understanding is also a key part of information diffusion prediction. We thereby propose a novel Multi-scale Context-enhanced Dynamic Attention Network (MCDAN) to predict which user will most likely join the observed current cascades. Specifically, to consider the global interactive relationship among users, we take full advantage of user friendships and global cascading relationships, which are extracted from the social network and historical cascades, respectively. To refine the model's ability to understand the user's preference for the current cascade, we propose a multi-scale sequential hypergraph attention module to capture the dynamic preference of users at different time scales. Moreover, we design a contextual attention enhancement module to strengthen the interaction of user representations within the current cascade. Finally, to engage the user's own susceptibility, we construct a susceptibility label for each user based on user susceptibility analysis and use the rank of this label for auxiliary prediction. We conduct experiments over four widely used datasets and show that MCDAN significantly overperforms the state-of-the-art models. The average improvements are up to 10.61% in terms of Hits@100 and 9.71% in terms of MAP@100, respectively. ",

As semantic communication relies on deep learning to extract meaning from raw messages, it is vulnerable to attacks targeting deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce the model inversion eavesdropping attack (MIEA) to reveal the risk of privacy leaks in the semantic communication system. In MIEA, the attacker first eavesdrops the signal being transmitted by the semantic communication system and then performs model inversion attack to reconstruct the raw message, where both the white-box and black-box settings are considered. Evaluation results show that MIEA can successfully reconstruct the raw message with good quality under different channel conditions. We then propose a defense method based on random permutation and substitution to defend against MIEA in order to achieve secure semantic communication. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defense method in preventing MIEA. ",

Next we propose a distributed matrix computation scheme which meets this exact lower bound on the weight of the coding. Further, we develop controllable trade-off between worker computation time and the privacy constraint for sparse input matrices in settings where the worker nodes are honest but curious. Numerical experiments conducted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) validate our assertions regarding straggler mitigation and computation speed for sparse matrices. ",

Current researchers usually transform the event streams into images, graphs, or voxels, and adopt deep neural networks for event-based classification. Although good performance can be achieved on simple event recognition datasets, however, their results may be still limited due to the following two issues. Firstly, they adopt spatial sparse event streams for recognition only, which may fail to capture the color and detailed texture information well. Secondly, they adopt either Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) for energy-efficient recognition with suboptimal results, or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for energy-intensive, high-performance recognition. However, seldom of them consider achieving a balance between these two aspects. In this paper, we formally propose to recognize patterns by fusing RGB frames and event streams simultaneously and propose a new RGB frame-event recognition framework to address the aforementioned issues. The proposed method contains four main modules, i.e., memory support Transformer network for RGB frame encoding, spiking neural network for raw event stream encoding, multi-modal bottleneck fusion module for RGB-Event feature aggregation, and prediction head. Due to the scarce of RGB-Event based classification dataset, we also propose a large-scale PokerEvent dataset which contains 114 classes, and 27102 frame-event pairs recorded using a DVS346 event camera. Extensive experiments on two RGB-Event based classification datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We hope this work will boost the development of pattern recognition by fusing RGB frames and event streams.

For instance, considering image-based applications, adversarial examples consist of imperceptibly perturbed images (to the human eye) misclassified by the local model, which can be later presented to a victim node's counterpart model to replicate the attack. To mitigate such malicious probing, we introduce Pelta, a novel shielding mechanism leveraging trusted hardware. By harnessing the capabilities of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Pelta masks part of the back-propagation chain rule, otherwise typically exploited by attackers for the design of malicious samples.

A common solution for this is event abstraction, i.e., converting low-level logs into more abstract high-level logs before running discovery algorithms. ECS logs come with special characteristics that have so far not been fully addressed by existing event abstraction approaches. We aim to close this gap with a tailored ECS event abstraction (ECSEA) approach that trains a model by comparing recorded actual user activities (high-level traces) with the system-generated low-level traces (extracted from the ECS). The model allows us to automatically convert future low-level traces into an abstracted high-level log that can be used for PM. Our evaluation shows that the algorithm produces accurate results. ECSEA is a preprocessing method that is essential for the interpretation of collaborative work activity in ECS, which we call Social Process Mining. ",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks pose a significant security risk to graph learning models. Backdoors can be embedded into the target model by inserting backdoor triggers into the training dataset, causing the model to make incorrect predictions when the trigger is present. To counter backdoor attacks, backdoor detection has been proposed. An emerging detection strategy in the vision and NLP domains is based on an intriguing phenomenon: when training models on a mixture of backdoor and clean samples, the loss on backdoor samples drops significantly faster than on clean samples, allowing backdoor samples to be easily detected by selecting samples with the lowest loss values. However, the ignorance of topological feature information on graph data limits its detection effectiveness when applied directly to the graph domain. To this end, we propose an explanation-guided backdoor detection method to take advantage of the topological information. Specifically, we train a helper model on the graph dataset, feed graph samples into the model, and then adopt explanation methods to attribute model prediction to an important subgraph. We observe that backdoor samples have distinct attribution distribution than clean samples, so the explanatory subgraph could serve as more discriminative features for detecting backdoor samples. Comprehensive experiments on multiple popular datasets and attack methods demonstrate the effectiveness and explainability of our method.

    "abstract": "Hash-based Proof-of-Work (PoW) used in the Bitcoin Blockchain leads to high energy consumption and resource wastage. In this paper, we aim to re-purpose the energy by replacing the hash function with real-life problems having commercial utility. We propose Chrisimos, a useful Proof-of-Work where miners are required to find a minimal dominating set for real-life graph instances. A miner who is able to output the smallest dominating set for the given graph within the block interval time wins the mining game. We also propose a new chain selection rule that ensures the security of the scheme. Thus our protocol also realizes a decentralized minimal dominating set solver for any graph instance. We provide formal proof of correctness and show via experimental results that the block interval time is within feasible bounds of hash-based PoW. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a highly performant 3D object detector for point clouds using the DETR framework. The prior attempts all end up with suboptimal results because they fail to learn accurate inductive biases from the limited scale of training data. In particular, the queries often attend to points that are far away from the target objects, violating the locality principle in object detection. To address the limitation, we introduce a novel 3D Vertex Relative Position Encoding (3DV-RPE) method which computes position encoding for each point based on its relative position to the 3D boxes predicted by the queries in each decoder layer, thus providing clear information to guide the model to focus on points near the objects, in accordance with the principle of locality. In addition, we systematically improve the pipeline from various aspects such as data normalization based on our understanding of the task. We show exceptional results on the challenging ScanNetV2 benchmark, achieving significant improvements over the previous 3DETR in $\\rm{AP}_{25}$/$\\rm{AP}_{50}$ from 65.0\\%/47.0\\% to 77.8\\%/66.0\\%, respectively. In addition, our method sets a new record on ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D datasets.Code will be released at this http URL ",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated impressive performance in vision and graphics tasks, such as novel view synthesis and immersive reality. However, the shape-radiance ambiguity of radiance fields remains a challenge, especially in the sparse viewpoints setting. Recent work resorts to integrating depth priors into outdoor NeRF training to alleviate the issue. However, the criteria for selecting depth priors and the relative merits of different priors have not been thoroughly investigated. Moreover, the relative merits of selecting different approaches to use the depth priors is also an unexplored problem. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study and evaluation of employing depth priors to outdoor neural radiance fields, covering common depth sensing technologies and most application ways. Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments with two representative NeRF methods equipped with four commonly-used depth priors and different depth usages on two widely used outdoor datasets. Our experimental results reveal several interesting findings that can potentially benefit practitioners and researchers in training their NeRF models with depth priors.

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of natural deterioration and man-made damage on the surfaces of ancient stele in the first instance is essential for their preventive conservation. Existing methods for cultural heritage preservation are not able to achieve this goal perfectly due to the difficulty of balancing accuracy, efficiency, timeliness, and cost. This paper presents a deep-learning method to automatically detect above mentioned emergencies on ancient stone stele in real time, employing autoencoder (AE) and generative adversarial network (GAN). The proposed method overcomes the limitations of existing methods by requiring no extensive anomaly samples while enabling comprehensive detection of unpredictable anomalies. the method includes stages of monitoring, data acquisition, pre-processing, model structuring, and post-processing. Taking the Longmen Grottoes' stone steles as a case study, an unsupervised learning model based on AE and GAN architectures is proposed and validated with a reconstruction accuracy of 99.74\\%. The method's evaluation revealed the proficient detection of seven artificially designed anomalies and demonstrated precision and reliability without false alarms. This research provides novel ideas and possibilities for the application of deep learning in the field of cultural heritage. ",

    "title": "Generative Models for Anomaly Detection and Design-Space Dimensionality  Reduction in Shape Optimization",
    "abstract": "Our work presents a novel approach to shape optimization, that has the twofold objective to improve the efficiency of global optimization algorithms while promoting the generation of high-quality designs during the optimization process free of geometrical anomalies. This is accomplished by reducing the number of the original design variables defining a new reduced subspace where the geometrical variance is maximized and modeling the underlying generative process of the data via probabilistic linear latent variable models such as Factor Analysis and Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis. We show that the data follows approximately a Gaussian distribution when the shape modification method is linear and the design variables are sampled uniformly at random, due to the direct application of the central limit theorem. The model uncertainty is measured in terms of Mahalanobis distance, and the paper demonstrates that anomalous designs tend to exhibit a high value of this metric. This enables the definition of a new optimization model where anomalous geometries are penalized and consequently avoided during the optimization loop. The procedure is demonstrated for hull shape optimization of the DTMB 5415 model, extensively used as an international benchmark for shape optimization problems. The global optimization routine is carried out using Bayesian Optimization and the DIRECT algorithm. From the numerical results, the new framework improves the convergence of global optimization algorithms, while only designs with high-quality geometrical features are generated through the optimization routine thereby avoiding the wastage of precious computationally expensive simulations.

    "abstract": "Power grid, communications, computer and product reticulation networks are frequently layered or subdivided by design. The layering divides responsibilities and can be driven by operational, commercial, regulatory and privacy concerns. From a control context, a layer, or part of a layer, in a network isolates the authority to manage, i.e. control, a dynamic system with connections into unknown parts of the network. The topology of these connections is fully prescribed but the interconnecting signals, currents in the case of power grids and bandwidths in communications, are largely unavailable, through lack of sensing and even prohibition. Accordingly, one is driven to simultaneous input and state estimation methods. We study a class of algorithms for this joint task, which has the unfortunate issue of inverting a subsystem, which if it has unstable transmission zeros leads to an unstable and unimplementable estimator. Two modifications to the algorithm to ameliorate this problem were recently proposed involving replacing the troublesome subsystem with its outer factor from its inner-outer factorization or using a high-variance white signal model for the unknown inputs. Here, we establish the connections between the original estimation problem for state and input signal and the estimates from the algorithm applied solely to the outer factor. It is demonstrated that the state of the outer factor and that of the original system asymptotically coincide and that the estimate of the input signal to the outer factor has asymptotically stationary second-order statistics which are in one-to-one correspondence with those of the input signal to the original system, when this signal is itself stationary. Thus, the simultaneous input and state estimation algorithm applied just to the outer factor yields an unbiased state estimate for control and the statistics of the interface signals. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel low-cost method to predict: i) the vascular age of a healthy young person, ii) whether or not a person is a smoker, using only the lead-I of the electrocardiogram (ECG). We begin by collecting (lead-I) ECG data from 42 healthy subjects (male, female, smoker, non-smoker) aged 18 to 30 years, using our custom-built low-cost single-lead ECG module, and anthropometric data, e.g., body mass index, smoking status, blood pressure etc. Under our proposed method, we first pre-process our dataset by denoising the ECG traces, followed by baseline drift removal, followed by z-score normalization. Next, we divide ECG traces into overlapping segments of five-second duration, which leads to a 145-fold increase in the size of the dataset. We then feed our dataset to a number of machine learning models, a 1D convolutional neural network, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and ResNet18 transfer learning model. For vascular ageing prediction problem, Random Forest method outperforms all other methods with an R2 score of 0.99, and mean squared error of 0.07. For the binary classification problem that aims to differentiate between a smoker and a non-smoker, XGBoost method stands out with an accuracy of 96.5%. Finally, for the 4-class classification problem that aims to differentiate between male smoker, female smoker, male non-smoker, and female non-smoker, MLP method achieves the best accuracy of 97.5%. This work is aligned with the sustainable development goals of the United Nations which aim to provide low-cost but quality healthcare solutions to the unprivileged population. ",

    "abstract": "Causal inference is a crucial goal of science, enabling researchers to arrive at meaningful conclusions regarding the predictions of hypothetical interventions using observational data. Path models, Structural Equation Models (SEMs), and, more generally, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), provide a means to unambiguously specify assumptions regarding the causal structure underlying a phenomenon. Unlike DAGs, which make very few assumptions about the functional and parametric form, SEM assumes linearity. This can result in functional misspecification which prevents researchers from undertaking reliable effect size estimation. In contrast, we propose Super Learner Equation Modeling, a path modeling technique integrating machine learning Super Learner ensembles. We empirically demonstrate its ability to provide consistent and unbiased estimates of causal effects, its competitive performance for linear models when compared with SEM, and highlight its superiority over SEM when dealing with non-linear relationships. We provide open-source code, and a tutorial notebook with example usage, accentuating the easy-to-use nature of the method. ",
