    "title": "Generating tabular datasets under differential privacy",
    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is accelerating progress across fields and industries, but relies on accessible and high-quality training data. Some of the most important datasets are found in biomedical and financial domains in the form of spreadsheets and relational databases. But this tabular data is often sensitive in nature. Synthetic data generation offers the potential to unlock sensitive data, but generative models tend to memorise and regurgitate training data, which undermines the privacy goal. To remedy this, researchers have incorporated the mathematical framework of Differential Privacy (DP) into the training process of deep neural networks. But this creates a trade-off between the quality and privacy of the resulting data. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the dominant paradigm for synthesising tabular data under DP, but suffer from unstable adversarial training and mode collapse, which are exacerbated by the privacy constraints and challenging tabular data modality. This work optimises the quality-privacy trade-off of generative models, producing higher quality tabular datasets with the same privacy guarantees. We implement novel end-to-end models that leverage attention mechanisms to learn reversible tabular representations. We also introduce TableDiffusion, the first differentially-private diffusion model for tabular data synthesis. Our experiments show that TableDiffusion produces higher-fidelity synthetic datasets, avoids the mode collapse problem, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on privatised tabular data synthesis. By implementing TableDiffusion to predict the added noise, we enabled it to bypass the challenges of reconstructing mixed-type tabular data. Overall, the diffusion paradigm proves vastly more data and privacy efficient than the adversarial paradigm, due to augmented re-use of each data batch and a smoother iterative training process. ",

Traditionally, researchers have used pre-defined network-based user features, such as degree, and centrality measures, and/or content-based features, such as posts and reposts. However, these measures may not capture the complex characteristics of social media users. In this study, we propose a user embedding method based on the URL domain co-occurrence network, which is simple but effective for representing social media users in competing events. We assessed the performance of this method in binary classification tasks using benchmark datasets that included Twitter users related to COVID-19 infodemic topics (QAnon, Biden, Ivermectin). Our results revealed that user embeddings generated directly from the retweet network, and those based on language, performed below expectations. In contrast, our domain-based embeddings outperformed these methods while reducing computation time. These findings suggest that the domain-based user embedding can serve as an effective tool to characterize social media users participating in competing events, such as political campaigns and public health crises.

Verification approaches centered around reachability analysis fail to scale, and purely statistical approaches are constrained by the distributional assumptions about the sampling process. Instead, we pose a distributionally robust version of the statistical verification problem for black-box systems, where our performance guarantees hold over a large family of distributions. This paper proposes a novel approach based on a combination of active learning, uncertainty quantification, and neural network verification. A central piece of our approach is an ensemble technique called Imprecise Neural Networks, which provides the uncertainty to guide active learning.

CommonGraph converts all deletions to additions by finding a common graph that exists across all snapshots. After computing the query on this graph, to reach any snapshot, we simply need to add the missing edges and incrementally update the query results. CommonGraph also allows sharing of common additions among snapshots that require them, and breaks the sequential dependency inherent in the traditional streaming approach where snapshots are processed in sequence, enabling additional opportunities for parallelism. We incorporate the CommonGraph approach by extending the KickStarter streaming framework. CommonGraph achieves 1.38x-8.17x improvement in performance over Kickstarter across multiple benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Oblivious Reconfigurable Networks (ORNs) use rapidly reconfiguring switches to create a dynamic time-varying topology. Prior theoretical work on ORNs has focused on the tradeoff between maximum latency and guaranteed throughput. This work shows that by relaxing the notion of guaranteed throughput to an achievable rate with high probability, one can achieve a significant improvement in the latency/throughput tradeoff. For a fixed maximum latency, we show that almost twice the maximum possible guaranteed throughput rate can be achieved with high probability. Alternatively for a fixed throughput value, relaxing to achievement with high probability decreases the maximum latency to almost the square root of the latency required to guarantee the throughput rate. We first give a lower bound on the best maximum latency possible given an achieved throughput rate with high probability. This is done using an LP duality style argument. We then give a family of ORN designs which achieves these tradeoffs. The connection schedule is based on the Vandermonde Basis Scheme of Amir, Wilson, Shrivastav, Weatherspoon, Kleinberg, and Agarwal, although the period and routing scheme differ significantly. We prove achievable throughput with high probability by interpreting the amount of flow on each edge as a sum of negatively associated variables, and applying a Chernoff bound. This gives us a design with maximum latency that is tight with our lower bound (up to a log factor) for almost all constant throughput values. ",

The developed algorithm transfers features from a model pre-trained by the original authors and fine-tunes them for the downstream task of activity recognition in construction. The model was pre-trained on Kinetics-400, a large-scale video-based human activity recognition dataset with 400 distinct classes. The model was fine-tuned and tested using videos captured from manual material handling (MMH) activities found on YouTube.

Existing methods for modeling 3D humans from depth data have limitations in terms of computational efficiency, mesh coherency, and flexibility in resolution and topology. For instance, reconstructing shapes using implicit functions and extracting explicit meshes per frame is computationally expensive and cannot ensure coherent meshes across frames. Moreover, predicting per-vertex deformations on a pre-designed human template with a discrete surface lacks flexibility in resolution and topology. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method `\\keyfeature: Neural Surface Fields' for modeling 3D clothed humans from monocular depth. NSF defines a neural field solely on the base surface which models a continuous and flexible displacement field. NSF can be adapted to the base surface with different resolution and topology without retraining at inference time.

This problem was first studied by Akitaya et al. (2021) and Br\\\"uning et al. (2022).

While image-level representations typically lack robustness to natural image corruptions, the robustness of object-centric methods remains largely untested. To address this gap, we present the RobustCLEVR benchmark dataset and evaluation framework. Our framework takes a novel approach to evaluating robustness by enabling the specification of causal dependencies in the image generation process grounded in expert knowledge and capable of producing a wide range of image corruptions unattainable in existing robustness evaluations. Using our framework, we define several causal models of the image corruption process which explicitly encode assumptions about the causal relationships and distributions of each corruption type. We generate dataset variants for each causal model on which we evaluate state-of-the-art object-centric methods. Overall, we find that object-centric methods are not inherently robust to image corruptions. Our causal evaluation approach exposes model sensitivities not observed using conventional evaluation processes, yielding greater insight into robustness differences across algorithms. Lastly, while conventional robustness evaluations view corruptions as out-of-distribution, we use our causal framework to show that even training on in-distribution image corruptions does not guarantee increased model robustness. This work provides a step towards more concrete and substantiated understanding of model performance and deterioration under complex corruption processes of the real-world. ",

Traditional approaches in this area have favored frame-level dynamic programming algorithms, such as dynamic time warping, because they require no supervision, but they are limited in performance and efficiency. As an alternative, acoustic word embeddings -- fixed-dimensional vector representations of variable-length spoken word segments -- have begun to be considered for such tasks as well. However, the current space of such discriminative embedding models, training approaches, and their application to real-world downstream tasks is limited. We start by considering ``single-view\" training losses where the goal is to learn an acoustic word embedding model that separates same-word and different-word spoken segment pairs. Then, we consider ``multi-view\" contrastive losses. In this setting, acoustic word embeddings are learned jointly with embeddings of character sequences to generate acoustically grounded embeddings of written words, or acoustically grounded word embeddings. In this thesis, we contribute new discriminative acoustic word embedding (AWE) and acoustically grounded word embedding (AGWE) approaches based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We improve model training in terms of both efficiency and performance. We take these developments beyond English to several low-resource languages and show that multilingual training improves performance when labeled data is limited. We apply our embedding models, both monolingual and multilingual, to the downstream tasks of query-by-example speech search and automatic speech recognition.

This limits the generalization potential of these models to unseen environments, and the meaningfulness of their reported results. We propose a method to improve the generalization performance of RL social navigation methods using curriculum learning. By employing multiple environment types and by modeling pedestrians using multiple dynamics models, we are able to progressively diversify and escalate difficulty in training. Our results show that the use of curriculum learning in training can be used to achieve better generalization performance than previous training methods. We also show that results presented in many existing state-of-the art RL social navigation works do not evaluate their methods outside of their training environments, and thus do not reflect their policies' failure to adequately generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios. In response, we validate our training approach on larger and more crowded testing environments than those used in training, allowing for more meaningful measurements of model performance. ",

We introduce a quantization based approach for all stages of GNNs, from message passing in training to node classification, compressing the model and enabling efficient processing. The proposed GNN quantizer learns quantization ranges and reduces the model size with comparable accuracy even under low-bit quantization. To scale with the number of layers, we devise a message propagation mechanism in training that controls layer-wise changes of similarities between neighboring nodes. This objective is incorporated into a Lagrangian function with constraints and a differential multiplier method is utilized to iteratively find optimal embeddings. This mitigates oversmoothing and suppresses the quantization error to a bound. Significant improvements are demonstrated over state-of-the-art quantization methods and deep GNN approaches in both full-precision and quantized models. The proposed quantizer demonstrates superior performance in INT2 configurations across all stages of GNN, achieving a notable level of accuracy. In contrast, existing quantization approaches fail to generate satisfactory accuracy levels.

We introduce an efficient technique for representing and processing spatially correlated random fields in robust topology optimisation of lattice structures. Robust optimisation considers the statistics of the structural response to obtain a design whose performance is less sensitive to the specific realisation of the random field. We represent Gaussian random fields on lattices by leveraging the established link between random fields and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). It is known that the precision matrix, i.e. the inverse of the covariance matrix, of a random field with Mat\\'ern covariance is equal to the finite element stiffness matrix of a possibly fractional PDE with a second-order elliptic operator. We consider the discretisation of the PDE on the lattice to obtain a random field which, by design, considers its geometry and connectivity. The so-obtained random field can be interpreted as a physics-informed prior by the hypothesis that the elliptic SPDE models the physical processes occurring during manufacturing, like heat and mass diffusion. Although the proposed approach is general, we demonstrate its application to lattices modelled as pin-jointed trusses with uncertainties in member Young's moduli. We consider as a cost function the weighted sum of the expectation and standard deviation of the structural compliance. To compute the expectation and standard deviation and their gradients with respect to member cross-sections we use a first-order Taylor series approximation. The cost function and its gradient are computed using only sparse matrix operations. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach using several lattice examples with isotropic, anisotropic and non-stationary random fields and up to eighty thousand random and optimisation variables.

    "abstract": "Currently, style augmentation is capturing attention due to convolutional neural networks (CNN) being strongly biased toward recognizing textures rather than shapes. Most existing styling methods either perform a low-fidelity style transfer or a weak style representation in the embedding vector. This paper outlines a style augmentation algorithm using stochastic-based sampling with noise addition to improving randomization on a general linear transformation for style transfer. With our augmentation strategy, all models not only present incredible robustness against image stylizing but also outperform all previous methods and surpass the state-of-the-art performance for the STL-10 dataset. In addition, we present an analysis of the model interpretations under different style variations. At the same time, we compare comprehensive experiments demonstrating the performance when applied to deep neural architectures in training settings. ",

    "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graphs, representing the dynamic relationships and interactions between entities over time, have been identified as a promising approach for event forecasting. However, a limitation of most temporal knowledge graph reasoning methods is their heavy reliance on the recurrence or periodicity of events, which brings challenges to inferring future events related to entities that lack historical interaction. In fact, the current state of affairs is often the result of a combination of historical information and underlying factors that are not directly observable. To this end, we investigate the limits of historical information for temporal knowledge graph extrapolation and propose a new event forecasting model called Contrastive Event Network (CENET) based on a novel training framework of historical contrastive learning. CENET learns both the historical and non-historical dependency to distinguish the most potential entities that best match the given query. Simultaneously, by launching contrastive learning, it trains representations of queries to probe whether the current moment is more dependent on historical or non-historical events. These representations further help train a binary classifier, whose output is a boolean mask, indicating the related entities in the search space. During the inference process, CENET employs a mask-based strategy to generate the final results. We evaluate our proposed model on five benchmark graphs. The results demonstrate that CENET significantly outperforms all existing methods in most metrics, achieving at least 8.3% relative improvement of Hits@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines on event-based datasets.

    "abstract": "We present PBFormer, an efficient yet powerful scene text detector that unifies the transformer with a novel text shape representation Polynomial Band (PB). The representation has four polynomial curves to fit a text's top, bottom, left, and right sides, which can capture a text with a complex shape by varying polynomial coefficients. PB has appealing features compared with conventional representations: 1) It can model different curvatures with a fixed number of parameters, while polygon-points-based methods need to utilize a different number of points. 2) It can distinguish adjacent or overlapping texts as they have apparent different curve coefficients, while segmentation-based or points-based methods suffer from adhesive spatial positions. PBFormer combines the PB with the transformer, which can directly generate smooth text contours sampled from predicted curves without interpolation. A parameter-free cross-scale pixel attention (CPA) module is employed to highlight the feature map of a suitable scale while suppressing the other feature maps. The simple operation can help detect small-scale texts and is compatible with the one-stage DETR framework, where no postprocessing exists for NMS. Furthermore, PBFormer is trained with a shape-contained loss, which not only enforces the piecewise alignment between the ground truth and the predicted curves but also makes curves' positions and shapes consistent with each other. Without bells and whistles about text pre-training, our method is superior to the previous state-of-the-art text detectors on the arbitrary-shaped text datasets. ",

However, most existing few-shot object detection methods focus on extracting the features of a few samples of novel classes that lack diversity. Hence, they may not be sufficient to capture the data distribution. To address that limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel approach in which we train a generator to generate synthetic data for novel classes. Still, directly training a generator on the novel class is not effective due to the lack of novel data. To overcome that issue, we leverage the large-scale dataset of base classes. Our overarching goal is to train a generator that captures the data variations of the base dataset. We then transform the captured variations into novel classes by generating synthetic data with the trained generator. To encourage the generator to capture data variations on base classes, we propose to train the generator with an optimal transport loss that minimizes the optimal transport distance between the distributions of real and synthetic data. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art. Source code will be available. ",

Most CTR prediction models have relied on a single fusion and interaction learning strategy. The few CTR prediction models that have utilized multiple interaction modelling strategies have treated each interaction to be self-contained. In this paper, we propose a novel model named STEC that reaps the benefits of multiple interaction learning approaches in a single unified architecture. Additionally, our model introduces residual connections from different orders of interactions which boosts the performance by allowing lower level interactions to directly affect the predictions.

Most existing works share the pipeline of training a coarse pose estimator with rendered images at first, followed by a joint optimization of estimated poses and neural radiance field. However, as the pose estimator is trained with only rendered images, the pose estimation is usually biased or inaccurate for real images due to the domain gap between real images and rendered images, leading to poor robustness for the pose estimation of real images and further local minima in joint optimization. We design IR-NeRF, an innovative pose-free NeRF that introduces implicit pose regularization to refine pose estimator with unposed real images and improve the robustness of the pose estimation for real images. With a collection of 2D images of a specific scene, IR-NeRF constructs a scene codebook that stores scene features and captures the scene-specific pose distribution implicitly as priors. Thus, the robustness of pose estimation can be promoted with the scene priors according to the rationale that a 2D real image can be well reconstructed from the scene codebook only when its estimated pose lies within the pose distribution. Extensive experiments show that IR-NeRF achieves superior novel view synthesis and outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently across multiple synthetic and real datasets. ",

Existing methods mainly focus on learning a shared feature space to reduce the modality discrepancy between visible and infrared modalities, which still leave two problems underexplored: information redundancy and modality complementarity. To this end, properly eliminating the identity-irrelevant information as well as making up for the modality-specific information are critical and remains a challenging endeavor. To tackle the above problems, we present a novel mutual information and modality consensus network, namely CMInfoNet, to extract modality-invariant identity features with the most representative information and reduce the redundancies. The key insight of our method is to find an optimal representation to capture more identity-relevant information and compress the irrelevant parts by optimizing a mutual information bottleneck trade-off. Besides, we propose an automatically search strategy to find the most prominent parts that identify the pedestrians. To eliminate the cross- and intra-modality variations, we also devise a modality consensus module to align the visible and infrared modalities for task-specific guidance. Moreover, the global-local feature representations can also be acquired for key parts discrimination. Experimental results on four benchmarks, i.e., SYSU-MM01, RegDB, Occluded-DukeMTMC, Occluded-REID, Partial-REID and Partial\\_iLIDS dataset, have demonstrated the effectiveness of CMInfoNet. ",

The evaluations conducted on the MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach, particularly in terms of object classes.To evaluate generalizability, we generate a simulated dataset comprising anomalies with diverse characteristics since the original test samples only include specific types of anomalies and may lead to biased evaluations.

Indeed, deep neural networks are not equipped with any explicit guarantees that can be used to certify the system's performance, especially in highly varying uncontrolled environments such as the ones typically faced in computer vision for agriculture.Fortunately, certain methods developed in other communities can prove to be important for agricultural applications. This article presents the conformal prediction framework that provides valid statistical guarantees on the predictive performance of any black box prediction machine, with almost no assumptions, applied to the problem of deep visual classification of weeds and crops in real-world conditions. The framework is exposed with a focus on its practical aspects and special attention accorded to the Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) approach that delivers marginal guarantees on the model's coverage. Marginal results are then shown to be insufficient to guarantee performance on all groups of individuals in the population as characterized by their environmental and pedo-climatic auxiliary data gathered during image acquisition.To tackle this shortcoming, group-conditional conformal approaches are presented: the ''classical'' method that consists of iteratively applying the APS procedure on all groups, and a proposed elegant reformulation and implementation of the procedure using quantile regression on group membership indicators. Empirical results showing the validity of the proposed approach are presented and compared to the marginal APS then discussed. ",

Recent work has shown that marking parts of a dataflow circuit for static scheduling can save resources and improve performance (hybrid scheduling), but the dynamic part of the circuit still bottlenecks the critical path. We propose instead to selectively introduce dynamic scheduling into static HLS. This paper presents an algorithm for identifying code regions amenable to dynamic scheduling and shows a methodology for introducing dynamically scheduled basic blocks, loops, and memory operations into static HLS. Our algorithm is informed by modulo-scheduling and can be integrated into any modulo-scheduled HLS tool. On a set of ten benchmarks, we show that our approach achieves on average an up to 3.7$\\times$ and 3$\\times$ speedup against dynamic and hybrid scheduling, respectively, with an area overhead of 1.3$\\times$ and frequency degradation of 0.74$\\times$ when compared to static HLS.

The optimization problems are challenging due to the non-convexity arising from the semi-infinite constraints (SICs) and the coupled transceiver variables. In an effort to tackle the former difficulty, S-procedure and Bernstein-type inequality are introduced for converting the SICs into finite convex linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and second-order cone constraints. A robust alternating optimization framework referred to alternating double-checking is developed for decoupling the transceiver design problem into feasibility-checking transmitter- and receiver-side subproblems, transforming the rank-one constraints into a set of LMIs, and verifying the feasibility of beamforming by invoking the matrix-lifting scheme.

By leveraging the high-performance capabilities of modern hardware, our approach achieves remarkable efficiency gains. In particular, our method surpasses existing CPU and GPU-based methods in constructing the proximity graph, demonstrating higher throughput in both large- and small-batch searches while maintaining compatible accuracy. In graph construction time, our method, CAGRA, is 2.2~27x faster than HNSW, which is one of the CPU SOTA implementations. In large-batch query throughput in the 90% to 95% recall range, our method is 33~77x faster than HNSW, and is 3.8~8.8x faster than the SOTA implementations for GPU. For a single query, our method is 3.4~53x faster than HNSW at 95% recall. ",

    "abstract": "As recent advances in AI are causing the decline of conventional diagnostic methods, the realization of end-to-end diagnosis is fast approaching. Ultrasound image segmentation is an important step in the diagnostic process. An accurate and robust segmentation model accelerates the process and reduces the burden of sonographers. In contrast to previous research, we take two inherent features of ultrasound images into consideration: (1) different organs and tissues vary in spatial sizes, (2) the anatomical structures inside human body form a relatively constant spatial relationship. Based on those two ideas, we propose a new image segmentation model combining Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Spatial Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN). We discuss why we use FPN to extract anatomical structures of different scales and how SRNN is implemented to extract the spatial context features in abdominal ultrasound images. ",

Although blockchains have attracted a great scale of attention in the recent years by disrupting the traditional financial systems, the transaction privacy is still a challenging issue that needs to be addressed and analysed. We propose a Private Token Transfer System (PTTS) for the Ethereum public blockchain in the first part of this paper. For the proposed framework, zero-knowledge based protocol has been designed using Zokrates and integrated into our private token smart contract. With the help of web user interface designed, the end users can interact with the smart contract without any third-party setup. In the second part of the paper, we provide security and privacy analysis including the replay attack and the balance range privacy attack which has been modelled as a network flow problem. It is shown that in case some balance ranges are deliberately leaked out to particular organizations or adversial entities, it is possible to extract meaningful information about the user balances by employing minimum cost flow network algorithms that have polynomial complexity. The experimental study reports the Ethereum gas consumption and proof generation times for the proposed framework. It also reports network solution times and goodness rates for a subset of addresses under the balance range privacy attack with respect to number of addresses, number of transactions and ratio of leaked transfer transaction amounts.

To facilitate hands-on SE awareness training as one component of broader SE awareness campaigns, we created a SE tabletop game called Tabletop As Social Engineering Prevention (TASEP) in two editions for (a) small and medium enterprises and (b) large corporations, respectively. Its game design is inspired by Dungeons & Dragons role-playing games and facilitates LEGO models of the in-game target organizations.

However, existing distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms suffer from insufficient utilization of computational resources and poor convergence in heterogeneous clusters. In this paper, we propose a delayed synchronous SGD algorithm with adaptive batch size (ABS-SGD) for heterogeneous GPU clusters. In ABS-SGD, workers perform global synchronization to accumulate delayed gradients and use the accumulated delayed gradients to update parameters. While workers are performing global synchronization for delayed gradients, they perform the computation of the next batch without specifying batch size in advance, which lasts until the next global synchronization starts, realizing the full utilization of computational resources. Since the gradient delay is only one iteration, the stale gradient problem can be alleviated. We theoretically prove the convergence of ABS-SGD in heterogeneous clusters. Extensive experiments in three types of heterogeneous clusters demonstrate that ABS-SGD can make full use of computational resources and accelerate model convergence: When training ResNet18 network with 4 workers, ABS-SGD increases the convergence speed by 1.30x on average compared with the best baseline algorithm.

Unlike existing intention recognition tasks, which are based on obvious visual representations to identify common intentions for normal behavior, HID focuses on discovering hidden intentions when humans try to hide their intentions for abnormal behavior. HID presents a unique challenge in that hidden intentions lack the obvious visual representations to distinguish them from normal intentions. Fortunately, from a sociological and psychological perspective, we find that the difference between hidden and normal intentions can be reasoned from multiple micro-behaviors, such as gaze, attention, and facial expressions. Therefore, we first discover the relationship between micro-behavior and hidden intentions and use graph structure to reason about hidden intentions. To facilitate research in the field of HID, we also constructed a seminal dataset containing a hidden intention annotation of a typical theft scenario for HID. Extensive experiments show that the proposed network improves performance on the HID task by 9.9\\% over the state-of-the-art method SBP. ",

We provide a fuller, more nuanced and refined exploration of the triggering hypothesis, based on five large datasets in three language pairs, reflecting both spoken and written bilingual interactions. Our results show that words that are assumed to reside in a mental lexicon shared by both languages indeed trigger code-switching; that the tendency to switch depends on the distance of the trigger from the switch point; and on whether the trigger precedes or succeeds the switch; but not on the etymology of the trigger words. We thus provide strong, robust, evidence-based confirmation to several hypotheses on the relationships between lexical triggers and code-switching. ",

    "abstract": "The growth of open-source software has increased the risk of hidden vulnerabilities that can affect downstream software applications. This concern is further exacerbated by software vendors' practice of silently releasing security patches without explicit warnings or common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) notifications. This lack of transparency leaves users unaware of potential security threats, giving attackers an opportunity to take advantage of these vulnerabilities. In the complex landscape of software patches, grasping the nuanced semantics of a patch is vital for ensuring secure software maintenance. To address this challenge, we introduce a multilevel Semantic Embedder for security patch detection, termed MultiSEM. This model harnesses word-centric vectors at a fine-grained level, emphasizing the significance of individual words, while the coarse-grained layer adopts entire code lines for vector representation, capturing the essence and interrelation of added or removed lines. We further enrich this representation by assimilating patch descriptions to obtain a holistic semantic portrait. This combination of multi-layered embeddings offers a robust representation, balancing word complexity, understanding code-line insights, and patch descriptions. Evaluating MultiSEM for detecting patch security, our results demonstrate its superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art models with promising margins: a 22.46\\% improvement on PatchDB and a 9.21\\% on SPI-DB in terms of the F1 metric.

However, these methods often lead to computational and memory inefficiencies, posing a significant challenge to their real-world applicability. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach, the Hyperbolic Code QA Matching (HyCoQA). This approach leverages the unique properties of Hyperbolic space to express connections between code fragments and their corresponding queries, thereby obviating the necessity for intricate interaction layers. The process commences with a reimagining of the code retrieval challenge, framed within a question-answering (QA) matching framework, constructing a dataset with triple matches characterized as \\texttt{<}negative code, description, positive code\\texttt{>}. These matches are subsequently processed via a static BERT embedding layer, yielding initial embeddings. Thereafter, a hyperbolic embedder transforms these representations into hyperbolic space, calculating distances between the codes and descriptions. The process concludes by implementing a scoring layer on these distances and leveraging hinge loss for model training. Especially, the design of HyCoQA inherently facilitates self-organization, allowing for the automatic detection of embedded hierarchical patterns during the learning phase. Experimentally, HyCoQA showcases remarkable effectiveness in our evaluations: an average performance improvement of 3.5\\% to 4\\% compared to state-of-the-art code retrieval techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Cyclostationarity involves periodic statistical variations in signals and processes, commonly used in signal analysis and network security. In the context of attacks, cyclostationarity helps detect malicious behaviors within network traffic, such as traffic patterns in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks or hidden communication channels in malware. This approach enhances security by identifying abnormal patterns and informing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) to recognize potential attacks, enhancing protection against both known and novel threats. This research focuses on identifying cyclostationary malware behavior and its detection. The main goal is to pinpoint essential cyclostationary features used in NIDSs. These features are extracted using algorithms such as Boruta and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and then categorized to find the most significant cyclostationary patterns. The aim of this article is to reveal periodically changing malware behaviors through cyclostationarity. The study highlights the importance of spotting cyclostationary malware in NIDSs by using established datasets like KDD99, NSL-KDD, and the UGRansome dataset. The UGRansome dataset is designed for anomaly detection research and includes both normal and abnormal network threat categories of zero-day attacks. A comparison is made using the Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, while also evaluating the effectiveness of Boruta and PCA. The findings show that PCA is more promising than using Boruta alone for extracting cyclostationary network feature patterns. Additionally, the analysis identifies the internet protocol as the most noticeable cyclostationary feature pattern used by malware. Notably, the UGRansome dataset outperforms the KDD99 and NSL-KDD, achieving 99% accuracy in signature malware detection using the RF algorithm and 98% with the SVM. ",

    "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein carefully crafted perturbations of the input can mislead the target model. In this paper, we introduce ACT, a novel adversarial attack framework against NMT systems guided by a classifier. In our attack, the adversary aims to craft meaning-preserving adversarial examples whose translations by the NMT model belong to a different class than the original translations in the target language. Unlike previous attacks, our new approach has a more substantial effect on the translation by altering the overall meaning, which leads to a different class determined by a classifier. To evaluate the robustness of NMT models to this attack, we propose enhancements to existing black-box word-replacement-based attacks by incorporating output translations of the target NMT model and the output logits of a classifier within the attack process. Extensive experiments in various settings, including a comparison with existing untargeted attacks, demonstrate that the proposed attack is considerably more successful in altering the class of the output translation and has more effect on the translation. This new paradigm can show the vulnerabilities of NMT systems by focusing on the class of translation rather than the mere translation quality as studied traditionally. ",

When working with artistic images, we need to take into account further considerations compared to classical image processing. This is because such artistic paintings change drastically depending on the author, the scene depicted, and their artistic style. This can result in features that perform very well in a given task but do not grasp the whole of the visual and symbolic information contained in a painting. In this paper, we show how the features obtained from different tasks in artistic image classification are suitable to solve other ones of similar nature. We present different methods to improve the generalization capabilities and performance of artistic classification systems. Furthermore, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence method to map known visual traits of an image with the features used by the deep learning model considering fuzzy rules. These rules show the patterns and variables that are relevant to solve each task and how effective is each of the patterns found. Our results show that our proposed context-aware features can achieve up to $6\\%$ and $26\\%$ more accurate results than other context- and non-context-aware solutions, respectively, depending on the specific task.

By controlling the edge lengths of the corners of the simplex, the volume of the latent space can be systematically controlled. Thereby communities are revealed as the space becomes more constrained, with hard memberships being recovered as the simplex volume goes to zero. We further explore a recent likelihood formulation for signed networks utilizing the Skellam distribution to account for signed weighted networks and extend the HM-LDM to the signed Hybrid Membership-Latent Distance Model (sHM-LDM). Importantly, the induced likelihood function explicitly attracts nodes with positive links and deters nodes from having negative interactions. We demonstrate the utility of HM-LDM and sHM-LDM on several real networks. We find that the procedures successfully identify prominent distinct structures, as well as how nodes relate to the extracted aspects providing favorable performances in terms of link prediction when compared to prominent baselines. Furthermore, the learned soft memberships enable easily interpretable network visualizations highlighting distinct patterns. ",

SCTD is an important component of assistive planning tools, and a challenge for commonsense reasoning systems. We probe how accurately SCTD can be done with the knowledge extracted from Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce a high-quality human-annotated dataset for this problem and novel metrics to fairly assess performance of LLMs against several baselines. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are able to decompose complex tasks into individual steps effectively, with a relative improvement of 15% to 280% over the best baseline. We also propose a number of approaches to further improve their performance, with a relative improvement of 7% to 37% over the base model. However, we find that LLMs still struggle to predict pairwise temporal dependencies, which reveals a gap in their understanding of complex tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) attracts a lot of research interest and drives widespread applications, where only anomaly-free samples are available for training. Some UAD applications intend to further locate the anomalous regions without any anomaly information. Although the absence of anomalous samples and annotations deteriorates the UAD performance, an inconspicuous yet powerful statistics model, the normalizing flows, is appropriate for anomaly detection and localization in an unsupervised fashion. The flow-based probabilistic models, only trained on anomaly-free data, can efficiently distinguish unpredictable anomalies by assigning them much lower likelihoods than normal data. Nevertheless, the size variation of unpredictable anomalies introduces another inconvenience to the flow-based methods for high-precision anomaly detection and localization. To generalize the anomaly size variation, we propose a novel Multi-Scale Flow-based framework dubbed MSFlow composed of asymmetrical parallel flows followed by a fusion flow to exchange multi-scale perceptions. Moreover, different multi-scale aggregation strategies are adopted for image-wise anomaly detection and pixel-wise anomaly localization according to the discrepancy between them. The proposed MSFlow is evaluated on three anomaly detection datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods. Notably, on the challenging MVTec AD benchmark, our MSFlow achieves a new state-of-the-art with a detection AUORC score of up to 99.7%, localization AUCROC score of 98.8%, and PRO score of 97.1%.

We investigate the possibility of third parties tracking users when clicking on ads by analyzing first-party storage, redirection domain paths, and requests sent before, when, and after the clicks. Our results show that privacy-focused search engines fail to protect users' privacy when clicking ads. Users' requests are sent through redirectors on 4% of ad clicks on Bing, 86% of ad clicks on Qwant, and 100% of ad clicks on Google, DuckDuckGo, and StartPage. Even worse, advertising systems collude with advertisers across all search engines by passing unique IDs to advertisers in most ad clicks. These IDs allow redirectors to aggregate users' activity on ads' destination websites in addition to the activity they record when users are redirected through them. Overall, we observe that both privacy-focused and traditional search engines engage in privacy-harming behaviors allowing cross-site tracking, even in privacy-enhanced browsers. ",

To address this potential weakness, we propose a spatio-temporal network architecture composed of a joint-mixing multi-layer perceptron block that facilitates communication among different joints and a graph weighted Jacobi network block that enables communication among various feature channels. The major novelty of our approach lies in a new weighted Jacobi feature propagation rule obtained through graph filtering with implicit fairing. We leverage temporal information from the 2D pose sequences, and integrate weight modulation into the model to enable untangling of the feature transformations of distinct nodes. We also employ adjacency modulation with the aim of learning meaningful correlations beyond defined linkages between body joints by altering the graph topology through a learnable modulation matrix. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods for 3D human pose estimation. ",

Previous methods generally work well for uncovered faces, however overlook the facial occlusion and ignore some contextual area outside a single face, especially when facial occlusion has become a common situation during the COVID-19 epidemic. Inspired by the illumination theory of image, we propose a novel homogeneous tanh-transforms for image preprocessing, which made up of four tanh-transforms, that fuse the central vision and the peripheral vision together. Our proposed method addresses the dilemma of face parsing under occlusion and compresses more information of surrounding context. Based on homogeneous tanh-transforms, we propose an occlusion-aware convolutional neural network for occluded face parsing. It combines the information both in Tanh-polar space and Tanh-Cartesian space, capable of enhancing receptive fields. Furthermore, we introduce an occlusion-aware loss to focus on the boundaries of occluded regions. The network is simple and flexible, and can be trained end-to-end. To facilitate future research of occluded face parsing, we also contribute a new cleaned face parsing dataset, which is manually purified from several academic or industrial datasets, including CelebAMask-HQ, Short-video Face Parsing as well as Helen dataset and will make it public. Experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-art methods of face parsing under occlusion. ",

The research in AEs has been active, and many adversarial attacks and explanations have been proposed since they were discovered in 2014. The mystery of the AE's existence is still an open question, and many studies suggest that DNN training algorithms have blind spots. The salient objects usually do not overlap with boundaries; hence, the boundaries are not the DNN model's attention. Nevertheless, recent studies show that the boundaries can dominate the behavior of the DNN models. Hence, this study aims to look at the AEs from a different perspective and proposes an imperceptible adversarial attack that systemically attacks the input image boundary for finding the AEs. The experimental results have shown that the proposed boundary attacking method effectively attacks six CNN models and the ViT using only 32% of the input image content (from the boundaries) with an average success rate (SR) of 95.2% and an average peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.37 dB. Correlation analyses are conducted, including the relation between the adversarial boundary's width and the SR and how the adversarial boundary changes the DNN model's attention. This paper's discoveries can potentially advance the understanding of AEs and provide a different perspective on how AEs can be constructed. ",

    "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for securing face recognition systems. However, existing FAS methods with handcrafted binary or pixel-wise labels have limitations due to diverse presentation attacks (PAs). In this paper, we propose an attack type robust face anti-spoofing framework under light flash, called ATR-FAS. Due to imaging differences caused by various attack types, traditional FAS methods based on single binary classification network may result in excessive intra-class distance of spoof faces, leading to a challenge of decision boundary learning. Therefore, we employed multiple networks to reconstruct multi-frame depth maps as auxiliary supervision, and each network experts in one type of attack. A dual gate module (DGM) consisting of a type gate and a frame-attention gate is introduced, which perform attack type recognition and multi-frame attention generation, respectively. The outputs of DGM are utilized as weight to mix the result of multiple expert networks. The multi-experts mixture enables ATR-FAS to generate spoof-differentiated depth maps, and stably detects spoof faces without being affected by different types of PAs. Moreover, we design a differential normalization procedure to convert original flash frames into differential frames. This simple but effective processing enhances the details in flash frames, aiding in the generation of depth maps. To verify the effectiveness of our framework, we collected a large-scale dataset containing 12,660 live and spoof videos with diverse PAs under dynamic flash from the smartphone screen. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ATR-FAS significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Every Hamiltonian system contains two essential ingredients: the Poisson bracket and the Hamiltonian. Hamiltonian systems with symmetries, whose paradigm examples are the Lie-Poisson systems, have been shown to describe a broad category of physical phenomena, from satellite motion to underwater vehicles, fluids, geophysical applications, complex fluids, and plasma physics. The Poisson bracket in these systems comes from the symmetries, while the Hamiltonian comes from the underlying physics. We view the symmetry of the system as primary, hence the Lie-Poisson bracket is known exactly, whereas the Hamiltonian is regarded as coming from physics and is considered not known, or known approximately. Using this approach, we develop a network based on transformations that exactly preserve the Poisson bracket and the special functions of the Lie-Poisson systems (Casimirs) to machine precision. We present two flavors of such systems: one, where the parameters of transformations are computed from data using a dense neural network (LPNets), and another, where the composition of transformations is used as building blocks (G-LPNets). We also show how to adapt these methods to a larger class of Poisson brackets. We apply the resulting methods to several examples, such as rigid body (satellite) motion, underwater vehicles, a particle in a magnetic field, and others. The methods developed in this paper are important for the construction of accurate data-based methods for simulating the long-term dynamics of physical systems. ",

However, the performance of most object detection models degrades when applied to images subjected to corruptions, since they are usually trained and evaluated on clean datasets. Enhancing the robustness of object detection models is of utmost importance, especially for those designed for aerial images, which feature complex backgrounds, substantial variations in scales and orientations of objects. This paper addresses the challenge of assessing the robustness of object detection models in aerial images, with a specific emphasis on scenarios where images are affected by clouds. In this study, we introduce two novel benchmarks based on DOTA-v1.0. The first benchmark encompasses 19 prevalent corruptions, while the second focuses on cloud-corrupted images-a phenomenon uncommon in natural pictures yet frequent in aerial photography. We systematically evaluate the robustness of mainstream object detection models and perform numerous ablation experiments. Through our investigations, we find that enhanced model architectures, larger networks, well-crafted modules, and judicious data augmentation strategies collectively enhance the robustness of aerial object detection models.

Research has shown that WTA circuits are capable of approximating hierarchical Bayesian models via Expectation Maximization (EM). So far, research in this direction has focused on bottom up processes. This is contrary to neuroscientific evidence that shows that, besides bottom up processes, top down processes too play a key role in information processing by the human brain. Several functions ascribed to top down processes include direction of attention, adjusting for expectations, facilitation of encoding and recall of learned information, and imagery. This paper explores whether WTA circuits are suitable for further integrating information represented in separate WTA networks. Furthermore, it explores whether, and under what circumstances, top down processes can improve WTA network performance with respect to inference and learning. The results show that WTA circuits are capable of integrating the probabilistic information represented by other WTA networks, and that top down processes can improve a WTA network's inference and learning performance. Notably, it is able to do this according to key neuromorphic principles, making it ideal for low-latency and energy efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware. ",

    "abstract": "In drug discovery, mapping interactions between genes within cellular systems is a crucial early step. This helps formulate hypotheses regarding molecular mechanisms that could potentially be targeted by future medicines. The CausalBench Challenge was an initiative to invite the machine learning community to advance the state of the art in constructing gene-gene interaction networks. These networks, derived from large-scale, real-world datasets of single cells under various perturbations, are crucial for understanding the causal mechanisms underlying disease biology. Using the framework provided by the CausalBench benchmark, participants were tasked with enhancing the capacity of the state of the art methods to leverage large-scale genetic perturbation data. This report provides an analysis and summary of the methods submitted during the challenge to give a partial image of the state of the art at the time of the challenge. The winning solutions significantly improved performance compared to previous baselines, establishing a new state of the art for this critical task in biology and medicine. ",

    "abstract": "Color is the most important intrinsic sensory feature that has a powerful impact on product sales. Color is even responsible for raising the aesthetic senses in our brains. Account for individual differences is crucial in color aesthetics. It requires user-driven mechanisms for various e-commerce applications. We propose a method for quantitative evaluation of all types of perceptual responses to color(s): distinct color preference, color harmony, and color combination preference. Preference for color schemes can be predicted by combining preferences for the basic colors and ratings of color harmony. Harmonious pallets are extracted from big data set using comparison algorithms based on fuzzy similarity and grouping. The proposed model results in useful predictions of harmony and preference of multicolored images. For example, in the context of apparel coordination, it allows predicting a preference for a look based on clothing colors. Our approach differs from standard aesthetic models, since in accounts for a personal variation. In addition, it can process not only lower-order color pairs, but also groups of several colors. ",

    "abstract": "Data in the real-world classification problems are always imbalanced or long-tailed, wherein the majority classes have the most of the samples that dominate the model training. In such setting, the naive model tends to have poor performance on the minority classes. Previously, a variety of loss modifications have been proposed to address the long-tailed leaning problem, while these methods either treat the samples in the same class indiscriminatingly or lack a theoretical guarantee. In this paper, we propose two novel approaches based on CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) to improve the performance of long-tailed learning with a solid theoretical ground. Specifically, we firstly introduce a Label-Aware Bounded CVaR (LAB-CVaR) loss to overcome the pessimistic result of the original CVaR, and further design the optimal weight bounds for LAB-CVaR theoretically. Based on LAB-CVaR, we additionally propose a LAB-CVaR with logit adjustment (LAB-CVaR-logit) loss to stabilize the optimization process, where we also offer the theoretical support. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with long-tailed label distributions verify the superiority of our proposed methods. ",

    "abstract": "In the $t$-online-erasure model in property testing, an adversary is allowed to erase $t$ values of a queried function for each query the tester makes. This model was recently formulated by Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova andVarma, who showed that the properties of linearity of functions as well as quadraticity can be tested in$O_t(1)$ many queries: $O(\\log (t))$ for linearity and $2^{2^{O(t)}}$ for quadraticity. They asked whether the more general property of low-degreeness can be tested in the online erasure model, whether better testers exist for quadraticity, and if similar results hold when ``erasures'' are replaced with ``corruptions''. We show that, in the $t$-online-erasure model, for a prime power $q$, given query access to a function $f: \\mathbb{F}_q^n \\xrightarrow[]{} \\mathbb{F}_q$, one can distinguish in $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log^{d+q}(t)/\\delta)$ queries between the case that $f$ is degree at most $d$, and the case that $f$ is $\\delta$-far from any degree $d$ function (with respect to the fractional hamming distance). This answers the aforementioned questions and brings the query complexity to nearly match the query complexity of low-degree testing in the classical property testing model. Our results are based on the observation that the property of low-degreeness admits a large and versatile family of query efficient testers. Our testers operates by querying a uniformly random, sufficiently large set of points in a large enough affine subspace, and finding a tester for low-degreeness that only utilizes queries from that set of points. We believe that this tester may find other applications to algorithms in the online-erasure model or other related models, and may be of independent interest. ",

Experimental evaulations demonstrate the strength of our framework by detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) from over 882 MR image slices from the ADNI database. We take advantage of the high interpretability of tabular data and our novel tabular attention approach and through attribution of the attention scores for each row of the table, we note and rank the most predominant features.

    "abstract": "Graphs are fundamental objects that find widespread applications across computer science and beyond. Graph Theory has yielded deep insights about structural properties of various families of graphs, which are leveraged in the design and analysis of algorithms for graph optimization problems and other computational optimization problems. These insights have also proved helpful in understanding the limits of efficient computation by providing constructions of hard problem instances. At the same time, algorithmic tools and techniques provide a fresh perspective on graph theoretic problems, often leading to novel discoveries. In this thesis, we exploit this symbiotic relationship between graph theory and algorithms for graph optimization problems and beyond. This thesis consists of three parts. In the first part, we study a graph routing problem called the Node-Disjoint Paths (NDP) problem. Given a graph and a set of source-destination pairs of its vertices, the goal is to route the maximum number of pairs via node-disjoint paths. We come close to resolving the approximability of NDP by showing that it is $n^{\\Omega(1/poly\\log\\log n)}$-hard to approximate, even on grid graphs, where n is the number of vertices. In the second part of this thesis, we use graph decomposition techniques developed for efficient algorithms to derive a graph theoretic result. We show that for every n-vertex expander graph G, if H is any graph with at most $O(n/\\log n)$ vertices and edges, then H is a minor of G. In the last part, we show that the graph theoretic tools and graph algorithmic techniques can shed light on problems seemingly unrelated to graphs. We show that the randomized space complexity of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem in the streaming model is intrinsically tied to the query-complexity of the Non-Crossing Matching problem on graphs in a new model of computation that we define.

Current efforts have proposed using pretrained image encoders with either transfer learning from natural image datasets or self-supervised pretraining on publicly-available histopathology datasets, but have not been extensively developed and evaluated across diverse tissue types at scale. We introduce UNI, a general-purpose self-supervised model for pathology, pretrained using over 100 million tissue patches from over 100,000 diagnostic haematoxylin and eosin-stained WSIs across 20 major tissue types, and evaluated on 33 representative CPath clinical tasks in CPath of varying diagnostic difficulties. In addition to outperforming previous state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate new modeling capabilities in CPath such as resolution-agnostic tissue classification, slide classification using few-shot class prototypes, and disease subtyping generalization in classifying up to 108 cancer types in the OncoTree code classification system. UNI advances unsupervised representation learning at scale in CPath in terms of both pretraining data and downstream evaluation, enabling data-efficient AI models that can generalize and transfer to a gamut of diagnostically-challenging tasks and clinical workflows in anatomic pathology.

Specializing to neural network structure, we gain insights into how the features and thus the kernel function change, providing additional nuance to the phenomenon of kernel alignment when the target function is poorly represented using tangent features. In addition to verifying our theoretical observations in real neural networks on a simple regression problem, we empirically show that an adaptive feature implementation of tangent feature classification has an order of magnitude lower sample complexity than the fixed tangent feature model on MNIST and CIFAR-10.

This problem becomes even more severe for dense tasks, such as 3D semantic segmentation, where points of non-standard objects can be confidently associated to the wrong class. In this work, we focus on improving the generalization to out-of-domain data. We achieve this by augmenting the training set with adversarial examples. First, we learn a set of vectors that deform the objects in an adversarial fashion. To prevent the adversarial examples from being too far from the existing data distribution, we preserve their plausibility through a series of constraints, ensuring sensor-awareness and shapes smoothness. Then, we perform adversarial augmentation by applying the learned sample-independent vectors to the available objects when training a model. We conduct extensive experiments across a variety of scenarios on data from KITTI, Waymo, and CrashD for 3D object detection, and on data from SemanticKITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes for 3D semantic segmentation. Despite training on a standard single dataset, our approach substantially improves the robustness and generalization of both 3D object detection and 3D semantic segmentation methods to out-of-domain data.

Although recently the unsupervised detection of phases of matter using machine learning has raised significant interest, the full prediction power of network science has not yet been systematically explored in this context. Here we fill this gap by providing an in-depth statistical, combinatorial, geometrical and topological characterization of 2D Ising snapshot networks (IsingNets) extracted from Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D Ising model at different temperatures, going across the phase transition. Our analysis reveals the complex organization properties of IsingNets in both the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases and demonstrates the significant deviations of the IsingNets with respect to randomized null models. In particular percolation properties of the IsingNets reflect the existence of the symmetry between configurations with opposite magnetization below the critical temperature and the very compact nature of the two emerging giant clusters revealed by our persistent homology analysis of the IsingNets. Moreover, the IsingNets display a very broad degree distribution and significant degree-degree correlations and weight-degree correlations demonstrating that they encode relevant information present in the configuration space of the 2D Ising model. The geometrical organization of the critical IsingNets is reflected in their spectral properties deviating from the one of the null model. This work reveals the important insights that network science can bring to the characterization of phases of matter.

However, in order to obtain reliable correlation values, these methods necessitate a long decision window, resulting in a long detection latency. Humans have a remarkable ability to recognize and follow a known speaker, regardless of the spoken content. In this paper, we seek to detect the attended speaker among the pre-enrolled speakers from the elicited EEG signals. In this manner, we avoid relying on the speech stimuli for AAD at run-time. In doing so, we propose a novel EEG-based attended speaker detection (E-ASD) task. \\textit{Methods:} We encode a speaker's voice with a fixed dimensional vector, known as speaker embedding, and project it to an audio-derived voice signature, which characterizes the speaker's unique voice regardless of the spoken content. We hypothesize that such a voice signature also exists in the listener's brain that can be decoded from the elicited EEG signals, referred to as EEG-derived voice signature. By comparing the audio-derived voice signature and the EEG-derived voice signature, we are able to effectively detect the attended speaker in the listening brain. \\textit{Results:} Experiments show that E-ASD can effectively detect the attended speaker from the 0.5s EEG decision windows, achieving 99.78\\% AAD accuracy, 99.94\\% AUC, and 0.27\\% EER. \\textit{Conclusion:} We conclude that it is possible to derive the attended speaker's voice signature from the EEG signals so as to detect the attended speaker in a listening brain. \\textit{Significance:} We present the first proof of concept for detecting the attended speaker from the elicited EEG signals in a cocktail party environment.

To answer the question which ML methodology performs best at materials discovery, our initial release explores a variety of models including random forests, graph neural networks (GNN), one-shot predictors, iterative Bayesian optimizers and universal interatomic potentials (UIP).

    "abstract": "Given their potential to demonstrate near-term quantum advantage, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been extensively studied. Although numerous techniques have been developed for VQA parameter optimization, it remains a significant challenge. A practical issue is the high sensitivity of quantum noise to environmental changes, and its propensity to shift in real time. This presents a critical problem as an optimized VQA ansatz may not perform effectively under a different noise environment. For the first time, we explore how to optimize VQA parameters to be robust against unknown shifted noise. We model the noise level as a random variable with an unknown probability density function (PDF), and we assume that the PDF may shift within an uncertainty set. This assumption guides us to formulate a distributionally robust optimization problem, with the goal of finding parameters that maintain effectiveness under shifted noise. We utilize a distributionally robust Bayesian optimization solver for our proposed formulation. This provides numerical evidence in both the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with hardware-efficient ansatz, indicating that we can identify parameters that perform more robustly under shifted noise. We regard this work as the first step towards improving the reliability of VQAs influenced by real-time noise. ",

    "abstract": "Asymptotic separation index is a parameter that measures how easily a Borel graph can be approximated by its subgraphs with finite components. In contrast to the more classical notion of hyperfiniteness, asymptotic separation index is well-suited for combinatorial applications in the Borel setting. The main result of this paper is a Borel version of the Lov\\'asz Local Lemma -- a powerful general-purpose tool in probabilistic combinatorics -- under a finite asymptotic separation index assumption. As a consequence, we show that locally checkable labeling problems that are solvable by efficient randomized distributed algorithms admit Borel solutions on bounded degree Borel graphs with finite asymptotic separation index. From this we derive a number of corollaries, for example a Borel version of Brooks's theorem for graphs with finite asymptotic separation index. ",

    "abstract": "Diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) are composed of successive transmissive layers optimized using supervised deep learning to all-optically implement various computational tasks between an input and output field-of-view (FOV). Here, we present a pyramid-structured diffractive optical network design (which we term P-D2NN), optimized specifically for unidirectional image magnification and demagnification. In this P-D2NN design, the diffractive layers are pyramidally scaled in alignment with the direction of the image magnification or demagnification. Our analyses revealed the efficacy of this P-D2NN design in unidirectional image magnification and demagnification tasks, producing high-fidelity magnified or demagnified images in only one direction, while inhibiting the image formation in the opposite direction - confirming the desired unidirectional imaging operation. Compared to the conventional D2NN designs with uniform-sized successive diffractive layers, P-D2NN design achieves similar performance in unidirectional magnification tasks using only half of the diffractive degrees of freedom within the optical processor volume. Furthermore, it maintains its unidirectional image magnification/demagnification functionality across a large band of illumination wavelengths despite being trained with a single illumination wavelength. With this pyramidal architecture, we also designed a wavelength-multiplexed diffractive network, where a unidirectional magnifier and a unidirectional demagnifier operate simultaneously in opposite directions, at two distinct illumination wavelengths. The efficacy of the P-D2NN architecture was also validated experimentally using monochromatic terahertz illumination, successfully matching our numerical simulations. P-D2NN offers a physics-inspired strategy for designing task-specific visual processors. ",

    "abstract": "Most of the intracranial aneurysms (ICA) occur on a specific portion of the cerebral vascular tree named the Circle of Willis (CoW). More particularly, they mainly arise onto fifteen of the major arterial bifurcations constituting this circular structure. Hence, for an efficient and timely diagnosis it is critical to develop some methods being able to accurately recognize each Bifurcation of Interest (BoI). Indeed, an automatic extraction of the bifurcations presenting the higher risk of developing an ICA would offer the neuroradiologists a quick glance at the most alarming areas. Due to the recent efforts on Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning turned out to be the best performing technology for many pattern recognition tasks. Moreover, various methods have been particularly designed for medical image analysis purposes. This study intends to assist the neuroradiologists to promptly locate any bifurcation presenting a high risk of ICA occurrence. It can be seen as a Computer Aided Diagnosis scheme, where the Artificial Intelligence facilitates the access to the regions of interest within the MRI. In this work, we propose a method for a fully automatic detection and recognition of the bifurcations of interest forming the Circle of Willis. Several neural networks architectures have been tested, and we thoroughly evaluate the bifurcation recognition rate. ",

With high flexibility, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) has been widely adopted to offer intuitive visual interpretation of various deep learning models' reasoning processes in computer-assisted diagnosis. However, despite the popularity of the technique, there is still a lack of systematic study on Grad-CAM's performance on different deep learning architectures. In this study, we investigate its robustness and effectiveness across different popular deep learning models, with a focus on the impact of the networks' depths and architecture types, by using a case study of automatic pneumothorax diagnosis in X-ray scans. Our results show that deeper neural networks do not necessarily contribute to a strong improvement of pneumothorax diagnosis accuracy, and the effectiveness of GradCAM also varies among different network architectures.

    "abstract": "Thyroid nodule segmentation is a crucial step in the diagnostic procedure of physicians and computer-aided diagnosis systems. Mostly, current studies treat segmentation and diagnosis as independent tasks without considering the correlation between these tasks. The sequence steps of these independent tasks in computer-aided diagnosis systems may lead to the accumulation of errors. Therefore, it is worth combining them as a whole through exploring the relationship between thyroid nodule segmentation and diagnosis. According to the thyroid imaging reporting and data system (TI-RADS), the assessment of shape and margin characteristics is the prerequisite for the discrimination of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. These characteristics can be observed in the thyroid nodule segmentation masks. Inspired by the diagnostic procedure of TI-RADS, this paper proposes a shape-margin knowledge augmented network (SkaNet) for simultaneously thyroid nodule segmentation and diagnosis. Due to the similarity in visual features between segmentation and diagnosis, SkaNet shares visual features in the feature extraction stage and then utilizes a dual-branch architecture to perform thyroid nodule segmentation and diagnosis tasks simultaneously. To enhance effective discriminative features, an exponential mixture module is devised, which incorporates convolutional feature maps and self-attention maps by exponential weighting. Then, SkaNet is jointly optimized by a knowledge augmented multi-task loss function with a constraint penalty term. It embeds shape and margin characteristics through numerical computation and models the relationship between the thyroid nodule diagnosis results and segmentation masks. ",

In this work we will show that every quantum error-correcting code, including Pauli stabilizer codes and subsystem codes, has a similar structure, in that the code can be stabilized by commutative ``Paulian'' operators which share many features with Pauli operators and which form a \\textbf{Paulian stabilizer group}. By facilitating a controlled gate we can measure these Paulian operators to acquire the error syndrome. Examples concerning codeword stabilized codes and bosonic codes will be presented; specifically, one of the examples has been demonstrated experimentally and the observable for detecting the error turns out to be Paulian, thereby showing the potential utility of this approach. This work provides a possible approach to implement error-correcting codes and to find new codes. ",
