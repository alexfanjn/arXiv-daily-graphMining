    "title": "Evaluating Picture Description Speech for Dementia Detection using  Image-text Alignment",
    "abstract": "Using picture description speech for dementia detection has been studied for 30 years. Despite the long history, previous models focus on identifying the differences in speech patterns between healthy subjects and patients with dementia but do not utilize the picture information directly. In this paper, we propose the first dementia detection models that take both the picture and the description texts as inputs and incorporate knowledge from large pre-trained image-text alignment models. We observe the difference between dementia and healthy samples in terms of the text's relevance to the picture and the focused area of the picture. We thus consider such a difference could be used to enhance dementia detection accuracy. Specifically, we use the text's relevance to the picture to rank and filter the sentences of the samples. We also identified focused areas of the picture as topics and categorized the sentences according to the focused areas. We propose three advanced models that pre-processed the samples based on their relevance to the picture, sub-image, and focused areas. The evaluation results show that our advanced models, with knowledge of the picture and large image-text alignment models, achieve state-of-the-art performance with the best detection accuracy at 83.44%, which is higher than the text-only baseline model at 79.91%. Lastly, we visualize the sample and picture results to explain the advantages of our models. ",

    "title": "One-bit Flip is All You Need: When Bit-flip Attack Meets Model Training",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely deployed on real-world devices. Concerns regarding their security have gained great attention from researchers. Recently, a new weight modification attack called bit flip attack (BFA) was proposed, which exploits memory fault inject techniques such as row hammer to attack quantized models in the deployment stage. With only a few bit flips, the target model can be rendered useless as a random guesser or even be implanted with malicious functionalities. In this work, we seek to further reduce the number of bit flips. We propose a training-assisted bit flip attack, in which the adversary is involved in the training stage to build a high-risk model to release. This high-risk model, obtained coupled with a corresponding malicious model, behaves normally and can escape various detection methods. The results on benchmark datasets show that an adversary can easily convert this high-risk but normal model to a malicious one on victim's side by \\textbf{flipping only one critical bit} on average in the deployment stage. Moreover, our attack still poses a significant threat even when defenses are employed. The codes for reproducing main experiments are available at \\url{https://github.com/jianshuod/TBA}. ",

    "abstract": "The task of inductive knowledge graph completion requires models to learn inference patterns from a training graph, which can then be used to make predictions on a disjoint test graph. Rule-based methods seem like a natural fit for this task, but in practice they significantly underperform state-of-the-art methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as NBFNet. We hypothesise that the underperformance of rule-based methods is due to two factors: (i) implausible entities are not ranked at all and (ii) only the most informative path is taken into account when determining the confidence in a given link prediction answer. To analyse the impact of these factors, we study a number of variants of a rule-based approach, which are specifically aimed at addressing the aforementioned issues. We find that the resulting models can achieve a performance which is close to that of NBFNet. Crucially, the considered variants only use a small fraction of the evidence that NBFNet relies on, which means that they largely keep the interpretability advantage of rule-based methods. Moreover, we show that a further variant, which does look at the full KG, consistently outperforms NBFNet. ",

Multimodality, in particular the addition of visual information next to text, has been shown to improve the performance on scholarly document quality prediction (SDQP) tasks. We propose the multimodal predictive model MultiSChuBERT. It combines a textual model based on chunking full paper text and aggregating computed BERT chunk-encodings (SChuBERT), with a visual model based on Inception V3.Our work contributes to the current state-of-the-art in SDQP in three ways. First, we show that the method of combining visual and textual embeddings can substantially influence the results. Second, we demonstrate that gradual-unfreezing of the weights of the visual sub-model, reduces its tendency to ovefit the data, improving results. Third, we show the retained benefit of multimodality when replacing standard BERT$_{\\textrm{BASE}}$ embeddings with more recent state-of-the-art text embedding models. Using BERT$_{\\textrm{BASE}}$ embeddings, on the (log) number of citations prediction task with the ACL-BiblioMetry dataset, our MultiSChuBERT (text+visual) model obtains an $R^{2}$ score of 0.454 compared to 0.432 for the SChuBERT (text only) model. Similar improvements are obtained on the PeerRead accept/reject prediction task. In our experiments using SciBERT, scincl, SPECTER and SPECTER2.0 embeddings, we show that each of these tailored embeddings adds further improvements over the standard BERT$_{\\textrm{BASE}}$ embeddings, with the SPECTER2.0 embeddings performing best.

    "abstract": "Sampling-based path planning algorithms suffer from heavy reliance on uniform sampling, which accounts for unreliable and time-consuming performance, especially in complex environments. Recently, neural-network-driven methods predict regions as sampling domains to realize a non-uniform sampling and reduce calculation time. However, the accuracy of region prediction hinders further improvement. We propose a sampling-based algorithm, abbreviated to Region Prediction Neural Network RRT* (RPNN-RRT*), to rapidly obtain the optimal path based on a high-accuracy region prediction. First, we implement a region prediction neural network (RPNN), to predict accurate regions for the RPNN-RRT*. A full-layer channel-wise attention module is employed to enhance the feature fusion in the concatenation between the encoder and decoder. Moreover, a three-level hierarchy loss is designed to learn the pixel-wise, map-wise, and patch-wise features. A dataset, named Complex Environment Motion Planning, is established to test the performance in complex environments. Ablation studies and test results show that a high accuracy of 89.13% is achieved by the RPNN for region prediction, compared with other region prediction models. In addition, the RPNN-RRT* performs in different complex scenarios, demonstrating significant and reliable superiority in terms of the calculation time, sampling efficiency, and success rate for optimal path planning.

    "abstract": "Pragmatics is core to natural language, enabling speakers to communicate efficiently with structures like ellipsis and anaphora that can shorten utterances without loss of meaning. These structures require a listener to interpret an ambiguous form - like a pronoun - and infer the speaker's intended meaning - who that pronoun refers to. Despite potential to introduce ambiguity, anaphora is ubiquitous across human language. In an effort to better understand the origins of anaphoric structure in natural language, we look to see if analogous structures can emerge between artificial neural networks trained to solve a communicative task. We show that: first, despite the potential for increased ambiguity, languages with anaphoric structures are learnable by neural models. Second, anaphoric structures emerge between models 'naturally' without need for additional constraints. Finally, introducing an explicit efficiency pressure on the speaker increases the prevalence of these structures. We conclude that certain pragmatic structures straightforwardly emerge between neural networks, without explicit efficiency pressures, but that the competing needs of speakers and listeners conditions the degree and nature of their emergence.

    "abstract": "Modeling self-gravitating gas flows is essential to answering many fundamental questions in astrophysics. This spans many topics including planet-forming disks, star-forming clouds, galaxy formation, and the development of large-scale structures in the Universe. However, the nonlinear interaction between gravity and fluid dynamics offers a formidable challenge to solving the resulting time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in three dimensions (3D). By leveraging the universal approximation capabilities of a neural network within a mesh-free framework, physics informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a new way of addressing this challenge. We introduce the gravity-informed neural network (GRINN), a PINN-based code, to simulate 3D self-gravitating hydrodynamic systems. Here, we specifically study gravitational instability and wave propagation in an isothermal gas. Our results match a linear analytic solution to within 1\\% in the linear regime and a conventional grid code solution to within 5\\% as the disturbance grows into the nonlinear regime. We find that the computation time of the GRINN does not scale with the number of dimensions. This is in contrast to the scaling of the grid-based code for the hydrodynamic and self-gravity calculations as the number of dimensions is increased. Our results show that the GRINN computation time is longer than the grid code in one- and two- dimensional calculations but is an order of magnitude lesser than the grid code in 3D with similar accuracy. Physics-informed neural networks like GRINN thus show promise for advancing our ability to model 3D astrophysical flows. ",

    "abstract": "Connectivity robustness, a crucial aspect for understanding, optimizing, and repairing complex networks, has traditionally been evaluated through time-consuming and often impractical simulations. Fortunately, machine learning provides a new avenue for addressing this challenge. However, several key issues remain unresolved, including the performance in more general edge removal scenarios, capturing robustness through attack curves instead of directly training for robustness, scalability of predictive tasks, and transferability of predictive capabilities. In this paper, we address these challenges by designing a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model with spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPP-net), adapting existing evaluation metrics, redesigning the attack modes, introducing appropriate filtering rules, and incorporating the value of robustness as training data. The results demonstrate the thoroughness of the proposed CNN framework in addressing the challenges of high computational time across various network types, failure component types and failure scenarios. However, the performance of the proposed CNN model varies: for evaluation tasks that are consistent with the trained network type, the proposed CNN model consistently achieves accurate evaluations of both attack curves and robustness values across all removal scenarios. When the predicted network type differs from the trained network, the CNN model still demonstrates favorable performance in the scenario of random node failure, showcasing its scalability and performance transferability. Nevertheless, the performance falls short of expectations in other removal scenarios. This observed scenario-sensitivity in the evaluation of network features has been overlooked in previous studies and necessitates further attention and optimization. Lastly, we discuss important unresolved questions and further investigation. ",

This analysis will utilize aggregated shelter access data for over 40,000 individuals from seven major urban shelters dating from 2018 to the present. A graph theoretic approach will be used to examine the journeys of individuals between shelters before, during and after the COVID-19 lockdown period. This approach treats shelters as nodes in a graph and a person's transition between shelter as an arrow or edge between nodes. This perspective is used to create both timeline and network diagrams that visualize shelter use and the flow of people between shelters. Statistical results are also presented that illustrate the differences between the cohorts of people who only used shelter pre/post-lockdown, people who stayed in shelter during lockdown and people who used shelter for the first time during lockdown. The results demonstrate not only how a complex system of care responded to the pandemic but also the characteristics of the people most likely to continue to rely on that system during an emergency.

We leverage work in uncertainty estimation in a novel approach to efficiently construct experimental populations. The resultant tool, PopulationLM, has been made open source. We provide theoretical grounding in the uncertainty estimation literature and motivation from current cognitive work regarding language models. We discuss the methodological lessons from other scientific communities and attempt to demonstrate their application to two artificial population studies. Through population based experimentation we find that language models exhibit behavior consistent with typicality effects among categories highly represented in training. However, we find that language models don't tend to exhibit structural priming effects. Generally, our results show that single models tend to over estimate the presence of cognitive behaviors in neural models. ",

Therefore, they typically create tests that are not human-readable and may not necessarily detect all types of complex bugs developer-written tests would do. In this study, we leverage Transformer-based code models to generate unit tests that can complement search-based test generation. Specifically, we use CodeT5, i.e., a state-of-the-art large code model, and fine-tune it on the test generation downstream task. For our analysis, we use the Methods2test dataset for fine-tuning CodeT5 and Defects4j for project-level domain adaptation and evaluation. The main contribution of this study is proposing a fully automated testing framework that leverages developer-written tests and available code models to generate compilable, human-readable unit tests. Results show that our approach can generate new test cases that cover lines that were not covered by developer-written tests. Using domain adaptation, we can also increase line coverage of the model-generated unit tests by 49.9% and 54% in terms of mean and median (compared to the model without domain adaptation). We can also use our framework as a complementary solution alongside common search-based methods to increase the overall coverage with mean and median of 25.3% and 6.3%. It can also increase the mutation score of search-based methods by killing extra mutants (up to 64 new mutants were killed per project in our experiments). ",

    "abstract": "We consider team zero-sum network congestion games with $n$ senders playing against $k$ interceptors over a graph $G$. The senders aim to minimize their collective cost of sending messages over paths in $G$, which is an aggregation of edge costs, while the interceptors aim to maximize the collective cost by increasing some of these edge costs. To evade the interceptors, the senders will usually use randomized strategies. We consider two cases, the correlated case when senders have access to a shared source of randomness, and the uncorrelated case, when each sender has access to only its own source of randomness. We study the additional cost that uncorrelated senders have to bear, specifically by comparing the costs incurred by senders in cost-minimal Nash Equilibria when senders can and cannot share randomness. We prove that for an intuitive strict subset of cost functions, the ratio between correlated and uncorrelated costs at equilibrium is $O(\\min(m_c(G),n))$, where $m_c(G)$ is the mincut size of $G$. This bound is much milder compared to the most general case, where an upper bound of $\\Omega((m_c(G))^{n-1})$ on the ratio is known. We show that the senders can approximate their optimal play by playing simple strategies which select paths uniformly at random from subsets of disjoint paths. We then focus on two natural cost functions. For the first, we prove that one of the simple strategies above is an optimal strategy for senders over graphs with disjoint paths. In complete contrast, for the second cost function we prove that none of these simple strategies is optimal for the senders over these graphs, unless the game instance admits a trivial optimal senders strategy.

    "abstract": "In many real world settings binary classification decisions are made based on limited data in near real-time, e.g. when assessing a loan application. We focus on a class of these problems that share a common feature: the true label is only observed when a data point is assigned a positive label by the principal, e.g. we only find out whether an applicant defaults if we accepted their loan application. As a consequence, the false rejections become self-reinforcing and cause the labelled training set, that is being continuously updated by the model decisions, to accumulate bias. Prior work mitigates this effect by injecting optimism into the model, however this comes at the cost of increased false acceptance rate. We introduce adversarial optimism (AdOpt) to directly address bias in the training set using adversarial domain adaptation. The goal of AdOpt is to learn an unbiased but informative representation of past data, by reducing the distributional shift between the set of accepted data points and all data points seen thus far. AdOpt significantly exceeds state-of-the-art performance on a set of challenging benchmark problems. Our experiments also provide initial evidence that the introduction of adversarial domain adaptation improves fairness in this setting. ",

    "abstract": "Hateful meme detection is a challenging multimodal task that requires comprehension of both vision and language, as well as cross-modal interactions. Recent studies have tried to fine-tune pre-trained vision-language models (PVLMs) for this task. However, with increasing model sizes, it becomes important to leverage powerful PVLMs more efficiently, rather than simply fine-tuning them. Recently, researchers have attempted to convert meme images into textual captions and prompt language models for predictions. This approach has shown good performance but suffers from non-informative image captions. Considering the two factors mentioned above, we propose a probing-based captioning approach to leverage PVLMs in a zero-shot visual question answering (VQA) manner. Specifically, we prompt a frozen PVLM by asking hateful content-related questions and use the answers as image captions (which we call Pro-Cap), so that the captions contain information critical for hateful content detection. The good performance of models with Pro-Cap on three benchmarks validates the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "Existing studies for applying the mixup technique on graphs mainly focus on graph classification tasks, while the research in node classification is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a novel mixup augmentation for node classification called Structural Mixup (S-Mixup). The core idea is to take into account the structural information while mixing nodes. Specifically, S-Mixup obtains pseudo-labels for unlabeled nodes in a graph along with their prediction confidence via a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier. These serve as the criteria for the composition of the mixup pool for both inter and intra-class mixups. Furthermore, we utilize the edge gradient obtained from the GNN training and propose a gradient-based edge selection strategy for selecting edges to be attached to the nodes generated by the mixup. Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of S-Mixup evaluated on the node classification task. We observe that S-Mixup enhances the robustness and generalization performance of GNNs, especially in heterophilous situations.

    "abstract": "Today, the most widespread, widely applicable technology for gathering data relies on experienced scientists armed with handheld radio telemetry equipment to locate low-power radio transmitters attached to wildlife from the ground. Although aerial robots can transform labor-intensive conservation tasks, the realization of autonomous systems for tackling task complexities under real-world conditions remains a challenge. We developed ConservationBots-small aerial robots for tracking multiple, dynamic, radio-tagged wildlife. The aerial robot achieves robust localization performance and fast task completion times -- significant for energy-limited aerial systems while avoiding close encounters with potential, counter-productive disturbances to wildlife. Our approach overcomes the technical and practical problems posed by combining a lightweight sensor with new concepts: i) planning to determine both trajectory and measurement actions guided by an information-theoretic objective, which allows the robot to strategically select near-instantaneous range-only measurements to achieve faster localization, and time-consuming sensor rotation actions to acquire bearing measurements and achieve robust tracking performance; ii) a bearing detector more robust to noise and iii) a tracking algorithm formulation robust to missed and false detections experienced in real-world conditions. We conducted extensive studies: simulations built upon complex signal propagation over high-resolution elevation data on diverse geographical terrains; field testing; studies with wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons; nocturnal, vulnerable species dwelling in underground warrens) and tracking comparisons with a highly experienced biologist to validate the effectiveness of our aerial robot and demonstrate the significant advantages over the manual method.

This problem has been investigated for decades under the formulation of stochastic optimization, which minimizes the expected value of a performance metric while assuming that the distribution of process variation is exactly given. This paper rethinks the variation-aware circuit design optimization from a new perspective. First, we discuss the variation shift problem, which means that the actual density function of process variations almost always differs from the given model and is often unknown. Consequently, we propose to formulate the variation-aware circuit design optimization as a distributionally robust optimization problem, which does not require the exact distribution of process variations. By selecting an appropriate uncertainty set for the probability density function of process variations, we solve the shift-aware circuit optimization problem using distributionally robust Bayesian optimization. This method is validated with both a photonic IC and an electronics IC. Our optimized circuits show excellent robustness against variation shifts: the optimized circuit has excellent performance under many possible distributions of process variations that differ from the given statistical model. This work has the potential to enable a new research direction and inspire subsequent research at different levels of the EDA flow under the setting of variation shift. ",

Recently, there has been a growing interest in employing data-driven approaches by using machine learning technologies, in combination with conventional theoretical calculations. In material science, the prediction of unobserved values, commonly referred to as extrapolation, is particularly critical for property prediction as it enables researchers to gain insight into materials beyond the limits of available data. However, even with the recent advancements in powerful machine learning models, accurate extrapolation is still widely recognized as a significantly challenging problem. On the other hand, self-supervised pretraining is a machine learning technique where a model is first trained on unlabeled data using relatively simple pretext tasks before being trained on labeled data for target tasks. As self-supervised pretraining can effectively utilize material data without observed property values, it has the potential to improve the model's extrapolation ability. In this paper, we clarify how such self-supervised pretraining can enhance extrapolation performance.We propose an experimental framework for the demonstration and empirically reveal that while models were unable to accurately extrapolate absolute property values, self-supervised pretraining enables them to learn relative tendencies of unobserved property values and improve extrapolation performance.

However, two main problems still need to be solved: task-specific algorithms make it difficult to integrate them into a single neural network architecture, and large amounts of parameters make it difficult to achieve real-time inference. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel network, SYENet, with only $~$6K parameters, to handle multiple low-level vision tasks on mobile devices in a real-time manner. The SYENet consists of two asymmetrical branches with simple building blocks. To effectively connect the results by asymmetrical branches, a Quadratic Connection Unit(QCU) is proposed.

However, the performance of 3D detectors is considerably limited when deployed in unseen environments, owing to the severe domain gap problem. Existing domain adaptive 3D detection methods do not adequately consider the problem of the distributional discrepancy in feature space, thereby hindering generalization of detectors across domains. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptive \\textbf{3D} detection framework, namely \\textbf{G}eometry-aware \\textbf{P}rototype \\textbf{A}lignment (\\textbf{GPA-3D}), which explicitly leverages the intrinsic geometric relationship from point cloud objects to reduce the feature discrepancy, thus facilitating cross-domain transferring.

Each prototype aligns BEV (bird's-eye-view) features derived from corresponding point cloud objects on source and target domains, reducing the distributional discrepancy and achieving better adaptation. The evaluation results obtained on various benchmarks, including Waymo, nuScenes and KITTI, demonstrate the superiority of our GPA-3D over the state-of-the-art approaches for different adaptation scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a novel model called self- and cross-attention network (SCANet), which leverages the attention mechanism for efficient audio-visual feature fusion. SCANet consists of two types of attention blocks: self-attention (SA) and cross-attention (CA) blocks, where the CA blocks are distributed at the top (TCA), middle (MCA) and bottom (BCA) of SCANet. These blocks maintain the ability to learn modality-specific features and enable the extraction of different semantics from audio-visual features. Comprehensive experiments on three standard audio-visual separation benchmarks (LRS2, LRS3, and VoxCeleb2) demonstrate the effectiveness of SCANet, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while maintaining comparable inference time.

Our study bridges this gap, seeking to understand the effect of adversarial inputs crafted for base models on their pruned versions. To examine this relationship, we have developed a comprehensive benchmark across diverse adversarial attacks and popular DNN models. We uniquely focus on models not previously exposed to adversarial training and apply pruning schemes optimized for accuracy and performance. Our findings reveal that while the benefits of pruning enhanced generalizability, compression, and faster inference times are preserved, adversarial robustness remains comparable to the base model. This suggests that model compression while offering its unique advantages, does not undermine adversarial robustness. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown significant accuracy improvements in a variety of graph learning domains, sparking considerable research interest. To translate these accuracy improvements into practical applications, it is essential to develop high-performance and efficient hardware acceleration for GNN models. However, designing GNN accelerators faces two fundamental challenges: the high bandwidth requirement of GNN models and the diversity of GNN models. Previous works have addressed the first challenge by using more expensive memory interfaces to achieve higher bandwidth. For the second challenge, existing works either support specific GNN models or have generic designs with poor hardware utilization. In this work, we tackle both challenges simultaneously. First, we identify a new type of partition-level operator fusion, which we utilize to internally reduce the high bandwidth requirement of GNNs. Next, we introduce partition-level multi-threading to schedule the concurrent processing of graph partitions, utilizing different hardware resources. To further reduce the extra on-chip memory required by multi-threading, we propose fine-grained graph partitioning to generate denser graph partitions. Importantly, these three methods make no assumptions about the targeted GNN models, addressing the challenge of model variety. We implement these methods in a framework called SwitchBlade, consisting of a compiler, a graph partitioner, and a hardware accelerator. Our evaluation demonstrates that SwitchBlade achieves an average speedup of $1.85\\times$ and energy savings of $19.03\\times$ compared to the NVIDIA V100 GPU. Additionally, SwitchBlade delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art specialized accelerators. ",

However, bus operation efficiency can be impacted by bus bunching. This problem is notably exacerbated when the bus system operates along a signalized corridor with unpredictable travel demand. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a multi-strategy fusion approach for the longitudinal control of connected and automated buses. The approach is driven by a physics-informed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm and takes into account a variety of traffic conditions along urban signalized corridors. Taking advantage of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology, the proposed approach can leverage real-time information regarding bus operating conditions and road traffic environment. By integrating the aforementioned information into the DRL-based bus control framework, our designed physics-informed DRL state fusion approach and reward function efficiently embed prior physics and leverage the merits of equilibrium and consensus concepts from control theory. This integration enables the framework to learn and adapt multiple control strategies to effectively manage complex traffic conditions and fluctuating passenger demands. Three control variables, i.e., dwell time at stops, speed between stations, and signal priority, are formulated to minimize travel duration and ensure bus stability with the aim of avoiding bus bunching. We present simulation results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, underlining its superior performance when subjected to sensitivity analysis, specifically considering factors such as traffic volume, desired speed, and traffic signal conditions.

In specific, we treat discrepancies between images and regions from different domains as disturbances, and introduce a novel simple but effective Network Stability Analysis (NSA) framework that considers various disturbances for domain adaptation. Particularly, we explore three types of perturbations including heavy and light image-level disturbances and instancelevel disturbance.

By integrating NSA into Faster R-CNN, we immediately achieve state-of-the-art results. In particular, we set a new record of 52.7% mAP on Cityscapes-to-FoggyCityscapes, showing the potential of NSA for domain adaptive detection.

Recently, vision-based solutions started to appear as a cost-effective alternative to standard PGI systems based on hardware sensors mounted on each parking slot. Vision-based systems provide information about parking occupancy based on images taken by a camera that is recording a parking lot. However, such systems are challenging to develop due to various possible viewpoints, weather conditions, and object occlusions. Most notably, they require manual labeling of parking slot locations in the input image which is sensitive to camera angle change, replacement, or maintenance. In this paper, the algorithm that performs Automatic Parking Slot Detection and Occupancy Classification (APSD-OC) solely on input images is proposed. Automatic parking slot detection is based on vehicle detections in a series of parking lot images upon which clustering is applied in bird's eye view to detect parking slots. Once the parking slots positions are determined in the input image, each detected parking slot is classified as occupied or vacant using a specifically trained ResNet34 deep classifier. The proposed approach is extensively evaluated on well-known publicly available datasets (PKLot and CNRPark+EXT), showing high efficiency in parking slot detection and robustness to the presence of illegal parking or passing vehicles. Trained classifier achieves high accuracy in parking slot occupancy classification. ",

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose Momentum Contrast for knowledge graph completion with Structure-Augmented pre-trained language models (MoCoSA), which allows the PLM to perceive the structural information by the adaptable structure encoder. To improve learning efficiency, we proposed momentum hard negative and intra-relation negative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), with improvements of 2.5% on WN18RR and 21% on OpenBG500. ",

    "abstract": "Physical experiments often involve multiple imaging representations, such as X-ray scans and microscopic images. Deep learning models have been widely used for supervised analysis in these experiments. Combining different image representations is frequently required to analyze and make a decision properly. Consequently, multi-view data has emerged - datasets where each sample is described by views from different angles, sources, or modalities. These problems are addressed with the concept of multi-view learning. Understanding the decision-making process of deep learning models is essential for reliable and credible analysis. Hence, many explainability methods have been devised recently. Nonetheless, there is a lack of proper explainability in multi-view models, which are challenging to explain due to their architectures. In this paper, we suggest different multi-view architectures for the vision domain, each suited to another problem, and we also present a methodology for explaining these models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, we focus on the domain of High Energy Density Physics (HEDP) experiments, where multiple imaging representations are used to assess the quality of foam samples. We apply our methodology to classify the foam samples quality using the suggested multi-view architectures. Through experimental results, we showcase the improvement of accurate architecture choice on both accuracy - 78% to 84% and AUC - 83% to 93% and present a trade-off between performance and explainability. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach enables the explanation of individual one-view models, providing insights into the decision-making process of each view. This understanding enhances the interpretability of the overall multi-view model.

The implementation of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware presents a promising choice for future energy-efficient AI applications. However, there exist very few results that compare the computational power of spiking neurons to arbitrary threshold circuits and sigmoidal neurons. Additionally, it has also been shown that a network of spiking neurons is capable of approximating any continuous function. By using the Spike Response Model as a mathematical model of a spiking neuron and assuming a linear response function, we prove that the mapping generated by a network of spiking neurons is continuous piecewise linear. We also show that a spiking neural network can emulate the output of any multi-layer (ReLU) neural network. Furthermore, we show that the maximum number of linear regions generated by a spiking neuron scales exponentially with respect to the input dimension, a characteristic that distinguishes it significantly from an artificial (ReLU) neuron. Our results further extend the understanding of the approximation properties of spiking neural networks and open up new avenues where spiking neural networks can be deployed instead of artificial neural networks without any performance loss.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel network structure with illumination-aware gamma correction and complete image modelling to solve the low-light image enhancement problem. Low-light environments usually lead to less informative large-scale dark areas, directly learning deep representations from low-light images is insensitive to recovering normal illumination. We propose to integrate the effectiveness of gamma correction with the strong modelling capacities of deep networks, which enables the correction factor gamma to be learned in a coarse to elaborate manner via adaptively perceiving the deviated illumination. Because exponential operation introduces high computational complexity, we propose to use Taylor Series to approximate gamma correction, accelerating the training and inference speed. Dark areas usually occupy large scales in low-light images, common local modelling structures, e.g., CNN, SwinIR, are thus insufficient to recover accurate illumination across whole low-light images. We propose a novel Transformer block to completely simulate the dependencies of all pixels across images via a local-to-global hierarchical attention mechanism, so that dark areas could be inferred by borrowing the information from far informative regions in a highly effective manner. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are well known as a promising energy-efficient alternative to conventional artificial neural networks. Subject to the preconceived impression that SNNs are sparse firing, the analysis and optimization of inherent redundancy in SNNs have been largely overlooked, thus the potential advantages of spike-based neuromorphic computing in accuracy and energy efficiency are interfered. In this work, we pose and focus on three key questions regarding the inherent redundancy in SNNs. We argue that the redundancy is induced by the spatio-temporal invariance of SNNs, which enhances the efficiency of parameter utilization but also invites lots of noise spikes. Further, we analyze the effect of spatio-temporal invariance on the spatio-temporal dynamics and spike firing of SNNs. Then, motivated by these analyses, we propose an Advance Spatial Attention (ASA) module to harness SNNs' redundancy, which can adaptively optimize their membrane potential distribution by a pair of individual spatial attention sub-modules. In this way, noise spike features are accurately regulated. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly drop the spike firing with better performance than state-of-the-art SNN baselines.

Then, we explore the use of inherent fault tolerance of winograd convolution for cost-effective NN protection against soft errors. Specifically, we mainly investigate how winograd convolution can be effectively incorporated with classical fault-tolerant design approaches including triple modular redundancy (TMR), fault-aware retraining, and constrained activation functions. According to our experiments, winograd convolution can reduce the fault-tolerant design overhead by 55.77\\% on average without any accuracy loss compared to standard convolution, and further reduce the computing overhead by 17.24\\% when the inherent fault tolerance of winograd convolution is considered. When it is applied on fault-tolerant neural networks enhanced with fault-aware retraining and constrained activation functions, the resulting model accuracy generally shows significant improvement in presence of various faults.

However, no survey papers and open-source repositories comprehensively summarize and discuss models in this important direction. To fill the gap, we conduct a first survey for models for enhancing expressive power under different forms of definition.

Here, we propose an integrated optical convolution architecture that leverages the inherent routing principles of arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) to execute the sliding of convolution kernel and summation of results. M*N multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations are facilitated by M+N units within a single clock cycle, thus eliminating the redundancy. In the experiment, we achieved 5-bit precision and 91.9% accuracy in the handwritten digit recognition task confirming the reliability of our approach. Its redundancy-free architecture, low power consumption, high compute density (8.53 teraOP mm^-2 s^-1) and scalability make it a valuable contribution to the field of optical neural networks, thereby paving the way for future advancements in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence applications.

The proposed method is named TEST. It first tokenizes TS, builds an encoder to embed them by instance-wise, feature-wise, and text-prototype-aligned contrast, and then creates prompts to make LLM more open to embeddings, and finally implements TS tasks. Experiments are carried out on TS classification and forecasting tasks using 8 LLMs with different structures and sizes. Although its results cannot significantly outperform the current SOTA models customized for TS tasks, by treating LLM as the pattern machine, it can endow LLM's ability to process TS data without compromising the language ability.

Lane markings have strong shape priors, but their visibility is easily compromised. Factors like lighting, weather, vehicles, pedestrians, and aging colors challenge the detection. A large amount of data is required to train a lane detection approach that can withstand natural variations caused by low visibility. This is because there are numerous lane shapes and natural variations that exist. Our solution, Contrastive Learning for Lane Detection via cross-similarity (CLLD), is a self-supervised learning method that tackles this challenge by enhancing lane detection models resilience to real-world conditions that cause lane low visibility. CLLD is a novel multitask contrastive learning that trains lane detection approaches to detect lane markings even in low visible situations by integrating local feature contrastive learning (CL) with our new proposed operation cross-similarity. Local feature CL focuses on extracting features for small image parts, which is necessary to localize lane segments, while cross-similarity captures global features to detect obscured lane segments using their surrounding. We enhance cross-similarity by randomly masking parts of input images for augmentation. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, CLLD outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive learning, especially in visibility-impairing conditions like shadows. Compared to supervised learning, CLLD excels in scenarios like shadows and crowded scenes. ",

Although some recent attempts have been made to handle this task, we still face two potential challenges: 1) most of existing works only manipulate on the intermediate graph embedding and ignore intrinsic properties of graphs. It is non-trivial to differentiate the transferred information across graphs. 2) recent attempts take a parameter-sharing policy to transfer knowledge across time steps or progressively expand new architecture given shifted graph distribution. Learning a single model could loss discriminative information for each graph task while the model expansion scheme suffers from high model complexity. In this paper, we point out that latent relations behind graph edges can be attributed as an invariant factor for the evolving graphs and the statistical information of latent relations evolves. Motivated by this, we design a relation-aware adaptive model, dubbed as RAM-CG, that consists of a relation-discovery modular to explore latent relations behind edges and a task-awareness masking classifier to accounts for the shifted. Extensive experiments show that RAM-CG provides significant 2.2%, 6.9% and 6.6% accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art results on CitationNet, OGBN-arxiv and TWITCH dataset, respective. ",

However, also the data itself can be exploited to reveal information and break anonymity. We propose a novel similarity-based re-identification attack on time-series health data and thereby unveil a significant vulnerability. Despite privacy measures that remove identifying information, our attack demonstrates that a brief amount of various sensor data from a target individual is adequate to possibly identify them within a database of other samples, solely based on sensor-level similarities. In our example scenario, where data owners leverage health data from smartwatches, findings show that we are able to correctly link the target data in two out of three cases.

In this study, we analyze discriminative self-supervised methods from a causal perspective to explain these unstable behaviors and propose solutions to overcome them. Our approach draws inspiration from prior works that empirically demonstrate the ability of discriminative self-supervised methods to demix ground truth causal sources to some extent.

We show that canonical noise distributions (CNDs), proposed by Awan and Vadhan (2023), match the anti-concentration bounds at half-integer values, indicating that their tail behavior is near-optimal. We also show that all CNDs are sub-exponential, regardless of the $f$-DP guarantee. In the case of log-concave CNDs, we show that they are the stochastically smallest noise compared to any other noise distributions with the same privacy guarantee. In terms of integer-valued noise, we propose a new notion of discrete CND and prove that a discrete CND always exists, can be constructed by rounding a continuous CND, and that the discrete CND is unique when designed for a statistic with sensitivity 1. We further show that the discrete CND at sensitivity 1 is stochastically smallest compared to other integer-valued noises. Our theoretical results shed light on the different types of privacy guarantees possible in the $f$-DP framework and can be incorporated in more complex mechanisms to optimize performance. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Network (GNN) has demonstrated extraordinary performance in classifying graph properties. However, due to the selection bias of training and testing data (e.g., training on small graphs and testing on large graphs, or training on dense graphs and testing on sparse graphs), distribution deviation is widespread. More importantly, we often observe \\emph{hybrid structure distribution shift} of both scale and density, despite of one-sided biased data partition. The spurious correlations over hybrid distribution deviation degrade the performance of previous GNN methods and show large instability among different datasets. To alleviate this problem, we propose \\texttt{OOD-GMixup} to jointly manipulate the training distribution with \\emph{controllable data augmentation} in metric space. Specifically, we first extract the graph rationales to eliminate the spurious correlations due to irrelevant information. Secondly, we generate virtual samples with perturbation on graph rationale representation domain to obtain potential OOD training samples. Finally, we propose OOD calibration to measure the distribution deviation of virtual samples by leveraging Extreme Value Theory, and further actively control the training distribution by emphasizing the impact of virtual OOD samples. Extensive studies on several real-world datasets on graph classification demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. ",

    "abstract": "As one of the energy-efficient alternatives of conventional neural networks (CNNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained more and more interest recently. To train the deep models, some effective batch normalization (BN) techniques are proposed in SNNs. All these BNs are suggested to be used after the convolution layer as usually doing in CNNs. However, the spiking neuron is much more complex with the spatio-temporal dynamics. The regulated data flow after the BN layer will be disturbed again by the membrane potential updating operation before the firing function, i.e., the nonlinear activation. Therefore, we advocate adding another BN layer before the firing function to normalize the membrane potential again, called MPBN. To eliminate the induced time cost of MPBN, we also propose a training-inference-decoupled re-parameterization technique to fold the trained MPBN into the firing threshold. With the re-parameterization technique, the MPBN will not introduce any extra time burden in the inference. Furthermore, the MPBN can also adopt the element-wised form, while these BNs after the convolution layer can only use the channel-wised form. Experimental results show that the proposed MPBN performs well on both popular non-spiking static and neuromorphic datasets. Our code is open-sourced at \\href{https://github.com/yfguo91/MPBN}{MPBN}.

    "abstract": "Learning graph embeddings is a crucial task in graph mining tasks. An effective graph embedding model can learn low-dimensional representations from graph-structured data for data publishing benefiting various downstream applications such as node classification, link prediction, etc. However, recent studies have revealed that graph embeddings are susceptible to attribute inference attacks, which allow attackers to infer private node attributes from the learned graph embeddings. To address these concerns, privacy-preserving graph embedding methods have emerged, aiming to simultaneously consider primary learning and privacy protection through adversarial learning. However, most existing methods assume that representation models have access to all sensitive attributes in advance during the training stage, which is not always the case due to diverse privacy preferences. Furthermore, the commonly used adversarial learning technique in privacy-preserving representation learning suffers from unstable training issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Private Variational Graph AutoEncoders (PVGAE) with the aid of independent distribution penalty as a regularization term. Specifically, we split the original variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) to learn sensitive and non-sensitive latent representations using two sets of encoders. Additionally, we introduce a novel regularization to enforce the independence of the encoders. We prove the theoretical effectiveness of regularization from the perspective of mutual information. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PVGAE outperforms other baselines in private embedding learning regarding utility performance and privacy protection. ",

AGER acquires instance tokens by dynamically clustering patch tokens and aligning cluster centers to instances with textual guidance, thus enjoying two benefits: 1) Integrality: each instance token is encouraged to contain all discriminative feature regions of an instance, which demonstrates a significant improvement in the extraction of different instance-level cues and subsequently leads to a new state-of-the-art performance of HOI detection with 36.75 mAP on HICO-Det. 2) Efficiency: the dynamical clustering mechanism allows AGER to generate instance tokens jointly with the feature learning of the Transformer encoder, eliminating the need of an additional object detector or instance decoder in prior methods, thus allowing the extraction of desirable extra cues for HOI detection in a single-stage and end-to-end pipeline. Concretely, AGER reduces GFLOPs by 8.5% and improves FPS by 36%, even compared to a vanilla DETR-like pipeline without extra cue extraction. ",

Although several studies have investigated continual learning methods for information retrieval tasks, a well-defined task formulation is still lacking, and it is unclear how typical learning strategies perform in this context. To address this challenge, a systematic task formulation of continual neural information retrieval is presented, along with a multiple-topic dataset that simulates continuous information retrieval. A comprehensive continual neural information retrieval framework consisting of typical retrieval models and continual learning strategies is then proposed. Empirical evaluations illustrate that the proposed framework can successfully prevent catastrophic forgetting in neural information retrieval and enhance performance on previously learned tasks. The results indicate that embedding-based retrieval models experience a decline in their continual learning performance as the topic shift distance and dataset volume of new tasks increase. In contrast, pretraining-based models do not show any such correlation. Adopting suitable learning strategies can mitigate the effects of topic shift and data augmentation. ",

We then show how we can use this dynamic selection to increase the lifetime of a wireless sensor network (WSN) by imposing constraints on how often each node is allowed to transmit. We further improve performance by including a dynamic spatial filter that makes the task-DNN more robust against the fact that it now needs to be able to handle a multitude of possible node subsets. Finally, we explain how the selection of the optimal channels can be distributed across the different nodes in a WSN. We validate this method on a use case in the context of body-sensor networks, where we use real electroencephalography (EEG) sensor data to emulate an EEG sensor network.

The car being controlled does not have a pre-defined route, rather it reactively adapts to follow a target vehicle while maintaining a safety distance. To train our model, we do not rely on steering labels recorded from an expert driver but effectively leverage a classical controller as an offline label generation tool. In addition, we account for the errors in the predicted control values, which can lead to a loss of tracking and catastrophic crashes of the controlled vehicle. To this end, we propose an effective data augmentation approach, which allows to train a network capable of handling different views of the target vehicle. During the pursuit, the target vehicle is firstly localized using a Convolutional Neural Network. The network takes a single RGB image along with cars' velocities and estimates the target vehicle's pose with respect to the ego-vehicle. This information is then fed to a Multi-Layer Perceptron, which regresses the control commands for the ego-vehicle, namely throttle and steering angle. We extensively validate our approach using the CARLA simulator on a wide range of terrains. Our method demonstrates real-time performance and robustness to different scenarios including unseen trajectories and high route completion.

State of the art physics-based models, while reliable, are computationally intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a surrogate modeling approach using neural networks (NN) to predict a number of SNF characteristics with reduced computational costs compared to physics-based models. An NN is trained using data generated from CASMO5 lattice calculations. The trained NN accurately predicts decay heat and nuclide concentrations of SNF, as a function of key input parameters, such as enrichment, burnup, cooling time between cycles, mean boron concentration and fuel temperature. The model is validated against physics-based decay heat simulations and measurements of different uranium oxide fuel assemblies from two different pressurized water reactors. In addition, the NN is used to perform sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. The results are in very good alignment to CASMO5, while the computational costs (taking into account the costs of generating training samples) are reduced by a factor of 10 or more. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs as surrogate models for fast characterization of SNF, providing a promising avenue for improving computational efficiency in assessing nuclear fuel behavior and associated risks.

While the single-user relay selection problem is well studied in the literature, research on achievable rate maximization is limited to dual-hop networks and multi-hop networks with a single relay per hop. We fill this important gap by focusing on achievable rate maximization in multi-hop, multi-relay networks. First, we consider optimal relay selection and obtain two approximations to the achievable rate. Next, we consider three existing sub-optimal relay selection strategies namely hop-by-hop, ad-hoc and block-by-block relay selection and obtain exact expressions for the achievable rate under each of these strategies. We also extend the sliding window based relay selection to the DF relay network and derive an approximation to the achievable rate. Further, we investigate the impact of window size in sliding window based relay selection and show that a window size of three is sufficient to achieve most of the possible performance gains. Finally, we extend this analysis to a noise limited multi-user network where the number of available relay nodes is large compared to the number of users and derive approximations to the achievable sum-rate.

    "abstract": "Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder often characterized by reduced speech intelligibility through slow, uncoordinated control of speech production muscles. Automatic Speech recognition (ASR) systems can help dysarthric talkers communicate more effectively. However, robust dysarthria-specific ASR requires a significant amount of training speech, which is not readily available for dysarthric talkers. This paper presents a new dysarthric speech synthesis method for the purpose of ASR training data augmentation. Differences in prosodic and acoustic characteristics of dysarthric spontaneous speech at varying severity levels are important components for dysarthric speech modeling, synthesis, and augmentation. For dysarthric speech synthesis, a modified neural multi-talker TTS is implemented by adding a dysarthria severity level coefficient and a pause insertion model to synthesize dysarthric speech for varying severity levels. To evaluate the effectiveness for synthesis of training data for ASR, dysarthria-specific speech recognition was used. Results show that a DNN-HMM model trained on additional synthetic dysarthric speech achieves WER improvement of 12.2% compared to the baseline, and that the addition of the severity level and pause insertion controls decrease WER by 6.5%, showing the effectiveness of adding these parameters. Overall results on the TORGO database demonstrate that using dysarthric synthetic speech to increase the amount of dysarthric-patterned speech for training has significant impact on the dysarthric ASR systems. In addition, we have conducted a subjective evaluation to evaluate the dysarthric-ness and similarity of synthesized speech. Our subjective evaluation shows that the perceived dysartrhic-ness of synthesized speech is similar to that of true dysarthric speech, especially for higher levels of dysarthria ",

Unlike universal e-commerce platforms such as Taobao and Amazon, user behaviors and interests on the OFD platform are more location and time-sensitive due to limited delivery ranges and regional commodity supplies. However, existing CTR prediction algorithms in OFD scenarios concentrate on capturing interest from historical behavior sequences, which fails to effectively model the complex spatiotemporal information within features, leading to poor performance. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the Contrastive Sres under different search states using three modules: contrastive spatiotemporal representation learning (CSRL), spatiotemporal preference extractor (StPE), and spatiotemporal information filter (StIF). CSRL utilizes a contrastive learning framework to generate a spatiotemporal activation representation (SAR) for the search action. StPE employs SAR to activate users' diverse preferences related to location and time from the historical behavior sequence field, using a multi-head attention mechanism. StIF incorporates SAR into a gating network to automatically capture important features with latent spatiotemporal effects. Extensive experiments conducted on two large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CSPM. Notably, CSPM has been successfully deployed in Alibaba's online OFD platform Ele.me, resulting in a significant 0.88% lift in CTR, which has substantial business implications. ",

Thus, integrating active learning into object detection will raise pretty positive significance. In this paper, we propose a classification committee for active deep object detection method by introducing a discrepancy mechanism of multiple classifiers for samples' selection when training object detectors. The model contains a main detector and a classification committee. The main detector denotes the target object detector trained from a labeled pool composed of the selected informative images. The role of the classification committee is to select the most informative images according to their uncertainty values from the view of classification, which is expected to focus more on the discrepancy and representative of instances. Specifically, they compute the uncertainty for a specified instance within the image by measuring its discrepancy output by the committee pre-trained via the proposed Maximum Classifiers Discrepancy Group Loss (MCDGL). The most informative images are finally determined by selecting the ones with many high-uncertainty instances. Besides, to mitigate the impact of interference instances, we design a Focus on Positive Instances Loss (FPIL) to make the committee the ability to automatically focus on the representative instances as well as precisely encode their discrepancies for the same instance. Experiments are conducted on Pascal VOC and COCO datasets versus some popular object detectors. And results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art active learning methods, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

    "title": "TBIN: Modeling Long Textual Behavior Data for CTR Prediction",
    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays a pivotal role in the success of recommendations. Inspired by the recent thriving of language models (LMs), a surge of works improve prediction by organizing user behavior data in a \\textbf{textual} format and using LMs to understand user interest at a semantic level. While promising, these works have to truncate the textual data to reduce the quadratic computational overhead of self-attention in LMs. However, it has been studied that long user behavior data can significantly benefit CTR prediction. In addition, these works typically condense user diverse interests into a single feature vector, which hinders the expressive capability of the model. In this paper, we propose a \\textbf{T}extual \\textbf{B}ehavior-based \\textbf{I}nterest Chunking \\textbf{N}etwork (TBIN), which tackles the above limitations by combining an efficient locality-sensitive hashing algorithm and a shifted chunk-based self-attention. The resulting user diverse interests are dynamically activated, producing user interest representation towards the target item. Finally, the results of both offline and online experiments on real-world food recommendation platform demonstrate the effectiveness of TBIN. ",

    "title": "Temporal Interest Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction",
    "abstract": "The history of user behaviors constitutes one of the most significant characteristics in predicting the click-through rate (CTR), owing to their strong semantic and temporal correlation with the target item. While the literature has individually examined each of these correlations, research has yet to analyze them in combination, that is, the quadruple correlation of (behavior semantics, target semantics, behavior temporal, and target temporal). The effect of this correlation on performance and the extent to which existing methods learn it remain unknown. To address this gap, we empirically measure the quadruple correlation and observe intuitive yet robust quadruple patterns. We measure the learned correlation of several representative user behavior methods, but to our surprise, none of them learn such a pattern, especially the temporal one. In this paper, we propose the Temporal Interest Network (TIN) to capture the quadruple semantic and temporal correlation between behaviors and the target. We achieve this by incorporating target-aware temporal encoding, in addition to semantic embedding, to represent behaviors and the target. Furthermore, we deploy target-aware attention, along with target-aware representation, to explicitly conduct the 4-way interaction. We performed comprehensive evaluations on the Amazon and Alibaba datasets. Our proposed TIN outperforms the best-performing baselines by 0.43\\% and 0.29\\% on two datasets, respectively. Comprehensive analysis and visualization show that TIN is indeed capable of learning the quadruple correlation effectively, while all existing methods fail to do so. We provide our implementation of TIN in Tensorflow. ",

These camera based perception algorithms require an accurate calibration to map the real world distances to image pixels. In practice, calibration is a laborious procedure requiring specialised data collection and careful tuning. This process must be repeated whenever the parameters of the camera change, which can be a frequent occurrence in autonomous vehicles. Hence there is a need to calibrate at regular intervals to ensure the camera is accurate. Proposed is a deep learning framework to learn intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of the camera in real time. The framework is self-supervised and doesn't require any labelling or supervision to learn the calibration parameters. The framework learns calibration without the need for any physical targets or to drive the car on special planar surfaces. ",

This study aims to address these gaps by exploring the contextual representation of each device-service pair. Firstly, we propose a latent features combination technique that can capture latent feature interactions, by aggregating the device-device relationships within the SIoT. Then, we leverage Factorization Machines to model higher-order feature interactions specific to each SIoT device-service pair to accomplish accurate rating prediction. Finally, we propose a service recommendation framework for SIoT based on review aggregation and feature learning processes. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in improving service recommendation accuracy and relevance. ",

    "abstract": "Companies across the globe are keen on targeting potential high-value customers in an attempt to expand revenue and this could be achieved only by understanding the customers more. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is the total monetary value of transactions/purchases made by a customer with the business over an intended period of time and is used as means to estimate future customer interactions. CLV finds application in a number of distinct business domains such as Banking, Insurance, Online-entertainment, Gaming, and E-Commerce. The existing distribution-based and basic (recency, frequency & monetary) based models face a limitation in terms of handling a wide variety of input features. Moreover, the more advanced Deep learning approaches could be superfluous and add an undesirable element of complexity in certain application areas. We, therefore, propose a system which is able to qualify both as effective, and comprehensive yet simple and interpretable. With that in mind, we develop a meta-learning-based stacked regression model which combines the predictions from bagging and boosting models that each is found to perform well individually. Empirical tests have been carried out on an openly available Online Retail dataset to evaluate various models and show the efficacy of the proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "Deploying machine learning (ML) models in the wild is challenging as it suffers from distribution shifts, where the model trained on an original domain cannot generalize well to unforeseen diverse transfer domains. To address this challenge, several test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to improve the generalization ability of the target pre-trained models under test data to cope with the shifted distribution. The success of TTA can be credited to the continuous fine-tuning of the target model according to the distributional hint from the test samples during test time. Despite being powerful, it also opens a new attack surface, i.e., test-time poisoning attacks, which are substantially different from previous poisoning attacks that occur during the training time of ML models (i.e., adversaries cannot intervene in the training process). In this paper, we perform the first test-time poisoning attack against four mainstream TTA methods, including TTT, DUA, TENT, and RPL. Concretely, we generate poisoned samples based on the surrogate models and feed them to the target TTA models. Experimental results show that the TTA methods are generally vulnerable to test-time poisoning attacks. For instance, the adversary can feed as few as 10 poisoned samples to degrade the performance of the target model from 76.20% to 41.83%. Our results demonstrate that TTA algorithms lacking a rigorous security assessment are unsuitable for deployment in real-life scenarios. As such, we advocate for the integration of defenses against test-time poisoning attacks into the design of TTA methods. ",

    "abstract": "Traditional geometric registration based estimation methods only exploit the CAD model implicitly, which leads to their dependence on observation quality and deficiency to occlusion. To address the problem,the paper proposes a bidirectional correspondence prediction network with a point-wise attention-aware mechanism. This network not only requires the model points to predict the correspondence but also explicitly models the geometric similarities between observations and the model prior. Our key insight is that the correlations between each model point and scene point provide essential information for learning point-pair matches. To further tackle the correlation noises brought by feature distribution divergence, we design a simple but effective pseudo-siamese network to improve feature homogeneity. Experimental results on the public datasets of LineMOD, YCB-Video, and Occ-LineMOD show that the proposed method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art methods under the same evaluation criteria. Its robustness in estimating poses is greatly improved, especially in an environment with severe occlusions. ",

This research bridges an existing gap by investigating the tourism website ecosystem through social network analysis. It focuses specifically on inter-website communication patterns based on user navigation. Data mining facilitates the identification of 162 core Iranian tourism websites, which are visualized as an interconnected network with websites as nodes and user transitions as weighted directed edges. By implementing community detection, eight key clusters are discerned, encompassing domains like ticket/tour bookings, accommodations, location services, and cuisine. Further analysis of inter-community relationships reveals website groupings frequently accessed together by users, highlighting complementary services sought during travel planning. The research derives invaluable insights into user preferences and information propagation within the tourism ecosystem. The methodology and findings contribute original perspectives to academia while offering pragmatic strategic recommendations to industry stakeholders like service providers, investors, and policymakers. This pioneering exploration of latent user behavior patterns advances comprehension of the evolving digital tourism landscape in Iran. It contributes pathways toward a sustainable future vision of the ecosystem, guiding stakeholders in targeted decision-making based on empirical evidence derived from social network analysis of websites and consumption patterns.

It requires a natural integration between the musculoskeletal systems and sensory receptors, which is challenging among modern robots that aim for lightweight, adaptive, and sensitive designs at a low cost. Here, we present the Soft Polyhedral Network with an embedded vision for physical interactions, capable of adaptive kinesthesia and viscoelastic proprioception by learning kinetic features. This design enables passive adaptations to omni-directional interactions, visually captured by a miniature high-speed motion tracking system embedded inside for proprioceptive learning. The results show that the soft network can infer real-time 6D forces and torques with accuracies of 0.25/0.24/0.35 N and 0.025/0.034/0.006 Nm in dynamic interactions. We also incorporate viscoelasticity in proprioception during static adaptation by adding a creep and relaxation modifier to refine the predicted results. The proposed soft network combines simplicity in design, omni-adaptation, and proprioceptive sensing with high accuracy, making it a versatile solution for robotics at a low cost with more than 1 million use cycles for tasks such as sensitive and competitive grasping, and touch-based geometry reconstruction.

In this work, our aim is to identify communities that are not only densely connected but also harmonious or balanced in terms of the nature of their relationships. Such communities are more likely to be stable over time and less prone to conflicts. Consequently, we propose a motif-based method to identify communities by quantifying the importance of links in the local structural balance. The results in synthetic and real-world networks show that the proposed method has a higher performance in identifying the community. In addition, it demonstrates strong robustness, i.e., remains insensitive to the balance of the network, and accurately classifies communities in real-world networks. ",

To facilitate our analysis, we give a novel approximation error bound for general analytic functions using ReLU networks, which may be of independent interest. Gaussian distributions can be adopted nicely to model data arising in applications, e.g., speeches, images, and texts; our results provide a theoretical verification of the observed efficiency of deep neural networks in practical classification problems.

However, classic TF methods based on maximum likelihood estimation underperform when applied to zero-inflated count data, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Additionally, the stochasticity inherent in TFs results in factors that vary across repeated runs, making interpretation and reproducibility of the results challenging. In this paper, we introduce Zero Inflated Poisson Tensor Factorization (ZIPTF), a novel approach for the factorization of high-dimensional count data with excess zeros. To address the challenge of stochasticity, we introduce Consensus Zero Inflated Poisson Tensor Factorization (C-ZIPTF), which combines ZIPTF with a consensus-based meta-analysis. We evaluate our proposed ZIPTF and C-ZIPTF on synthetic zero-inflated count data and synthetic and real scRNA-seq data. ZIPTF consistently outperforms baseline matrix and tensor factorization methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy for zero-inflated data. When the probability of excess zeros is high, ZIPTF achieves up to $2.4\\times$ better accuracy. Additionally, C-ZIPTF significantly improves the consistency and accuracy of the factorization. When tested on both synthetic and real scRNA-seq data, ZIPTF and C-ZIPTF consistently recover known and biologically meaningful gene expression programs. ",

One of the key properties which are exploited is entanglement to transfer information from one network node to another. Applications like quantum teleportation rely on the entanglement between the concerned nodes. Thus, efficient entanglement distribution among network nodes is of utmost importance. Several entanglement distribution methods have been proposed in the literature which primarily rely on attributes, such as, fidelities, link layer network topologies, proactive distribution, etc. This paper studies the centralities of the network when the link layer topology of entanglements (referred to as entangled graph) is driven by usage patterns of peer-to-peer connections between remote nodes (referred to as connection graph) with different characteristics. Three different distributions (uniform, gaussian, and power law) are considered for the connection graph where the two nodes are selected from the same distribution. For the entangled graph, both reactive and proactive entanglements are employed to form a random graph. Results show that the edge centralities (measured as usage frequencies of individual edges during entanglement distribution) of the entangled graph follow power law distributions whereas the growth in entanglements with connections and node centralities (degrees of nodes) are monomolecularly distributed for most of the scenarios. These findings will help in quantum resource management, e.g., quantum technology with high reliability and lower decoherence time may be allocated to edges with high centralities. ",

The reconstructed dMRI signal using this method shows a more structurally coherent representation of the data. Noise in gradient images is removed and the fiber orientation distribution functions show a smooth change in direction along a fiber tract. We showcase how the reconstruction can be used to calculate mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, and total apparent fiber density. These results can be achieved with a single model architecture, tuning only one hyperparameter. In this paper we also demonstrate how upsampling in both the angular and spatial domain yields reconstructions that are on par or better than existing methods. ",

Early diagnosis can significantly improve the 5-year survival rate of patients.

However, the absence of publicly available endometrial cancer image datasets restricts the application of computer-assisted diagnostic techniques.In this paper, a publicly available Endometrial Cancer PET/CT Image Dataset for Evaluation of Semantic Segmentation and Detection of Hypermetabolic Regions (ECPC-IDS) are published. Specifically, the segmentation section includes PET and CT images, with a total of 7159 images in multiple formats. In order to prove the effectiveness of segmentation methods on ECPC-IDS, five classical deep learning semantic segmentation methods are selected to test the image segmentation task. The object detection section also includes PET and CT images, with a total of 3579 images and XML files with annotation information. Six deep learning methods are selected for experiments on the detection task.This study conduct extensive experiments using deep learning-based semantic segmentation and object detection methods to demonstrate the differences between various methods on ECPC-IDS. As far as we know, this is the first publicly available dataset of endometrial cancer with a large number of multiple images, including a large amount of information required for image and target detection. ECPC-IDS can aid researchers in exploring new algorithms to enhance computer-assisted technology, benefiting both clinical doctors and patients greatly. ",

    "abstract": "Locoregional recurrences (LRR) are still a frequent site of treatment failure for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Identification of high risk subvolumes based on pretreatment imaging is key to biologically targeted radiation therapy. We investigated the extent to which a Convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to predict LRR volumes based on pre-treatment 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans in HNSCC patients and thus the potential to identify biological high risk volumes using CNNs. For 37 patients who had undergone primary radiotherapy for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, five oncologists contoured the relapse volumes on recurrence CT scans. Datasets of pre-treatment FDG-PET/CT, gross tumour volume (GTV) and contoured relapse for each of the patients were randomly divided into training (n=23), validation (n=7) and test (n=7) datasets. We compared a CNN trained from scratch, a pre-trained CNN, a SUVmax threshold approach, and using the GTV directly. The SUVmax threshold method included 5 out of the 7 relapse origin points within a volume of median 4.6 cubic centimetres (cc). Both the GTV contour and best CNN segmentations included the relapse origin 6 out of 7 times with median volumes of 28 and 18 cc respectively. The CNN included the same or greater number of relapse volume POs, with significantly smaller relapse volumes. Our novel findings indicate that CNNs may predict LRR, yet further work on dataset development is required to attain clinically useful prediction accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Deterministic model predictive control (MPC), while powerful, is often insufficient for effectively controlling autonomous systems in the real-world. Factors such as environmental noise and model error can cause deviations from the expected nominal performance. Robust MPC algorithms aim to bridge this gap between deterministic and uncertain control. However, these methods are often excessively difficult to tune for robustness due to the nonlinear and non-intuitive effects that controller parameters have on performance. To address this challenge, a unifying perspective on differentiable optimization for control is presented, which enables derivation of a general, differentiable tube-based MPC algorithm. The proposed approach facilitates the automatic and real-time tuning of robust controllers in the presence of large uncertainties and disturbances. ",

In this work, we discuss some upcoming active new research areas in application of quantum machine learning (QML) in finance. We discuss certain QML models that has become areas of active interest in the financial world for various applications. We use real world financial dataset and compare models such as qGAN (quantum generative adversarial networks) and QCBM (quantum circuit Born machine) among others, using simulated environments. For the qGAN, we define quantum circuits for discriminators and generators and show promises of future quantum advantage via QML in finance. ",

    "title": "Learning to Distill Global Representation for Sparse-View CT",
    "abstract": "Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) -- using a small number of projections for tomographic reconstruction -- enables much lower radiation dose to patients and accelerated data acquisition. The reconstructed images, however, suffer from strong artifacts, greatly limiting their diagnostic value. Current trends for sparse-view CT turn to the raw data for better information recovery. The resultant dual-domain methods, nonetheless, suffer from secondary artifacts, especially in ultra-sparse view scenarios, and their generalization to other scanners/protocols is greatly limited. A crucial question arises: have the image post-processing methods reached the limit? Our answer is not yet. In this paper, we stick to image post-processing methods due to great flexibility and propose global representation (GloRe) distillation framework for sparse-view CT, termed GloReDi. First, we propose to learn GloRe with Fourier convolution, so each element in GloRe has an image-wide receptive field. Second, unlike methods that only use the full-view images for supervision, we propose to distill GloRe from intermediate-view reconstructed images that are readily available but not explored in previous literature. The success of GloRe distillation is attributed to two key components: representation directional distillation to align the GloRe directions, and band-pass-specific contrastive distillation to gain clinically important details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GloReDi over the state-of-the-art methods, including dual-domain ones. The source code is available at https://github.com/longzilicart/GloReDi. ",

    "abstract": "Learning a medical image segmentation model is an inherently ambiguous task, as uncertainties exist in both images (noise) and manual annotations (human errors and bias) used for model training. To build a trustworthy image segmentation model, it is important to not just evaluate its performance but also estimate the uncertainty of the model prediction. Most state-of-the-art image segmentation networks adopt a hierarchical encoder architecture, extracting image features at multiple resolution levels from fine to coarse. In this work, we leverage this hierarchical image representation and propose a simple yet effective method for estimating uncertainties at multiple levels. The multi-level uncertainties are modelled via the skip-connection module and then sampled to generate an uncertainty map for the predicted image segmentation. We demonstrate that a deep learning segmentation network such as U-net, when implemented with such hierarchical uncertainty estimation module, can achieve a high segmentation performance, while at the same time provide meaningful uncertainty maps that can be used for out-of-distribution detection.
