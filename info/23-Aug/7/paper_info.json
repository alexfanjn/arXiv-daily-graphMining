    "title": "PePNet: A Periodicity-Perceived Workload Prediction Network Supporting  Rare Occurrence of Heavy Workload",
    "abstract": "Cloud providers can greatly benefit from accurate workload prediction. However, the workload of cloud servers is highly variable, with occasional heavy workload bursts. This makes workload prediction challenging. There are mainly two categories of workload prediction methods: statistical methods and neural-network-based ones. The former ones rely on strong mathematical assumptions and have reported low accuracy when predicting highly variable workload. The latter ones offer higher overall accuracy, yet they are vulnerable to data imbalance between heavy workload and common one. This impairs the prediction accuracy of neural network-based models on heavy workload. Either the overall inaccuracy of statistic methods or the heavy-workload inaccuracy of neural-network-based models can cause service level agreement violations. Thus, we propose PePNet to improve overall especially heavy workload prediction accuracy. It has two distinctive characteristics: (i) A Periodicity-Perceived Mechanism to detect the existence of periodicity and the length of one period automatically, without any priori knowledge. Furthermore, it fuses periodic information adaptively, which is suitable for periodic, lax periodic and aperiodic time series. (ii) An Achilles' Heel Loss Function iteratively optimizing the most under-fitting part in predicting sequence for each step, which significantly improves the prediction accuracy of heavy load. Extensive experiments conducted on Alibaba2018, SMD dataset and Dinda's dataset demonstrate that PePNet improves MAPE for overall workload by 20.0% on average, compared with state-of-the-art methods. Especially, PePNet improves MAPE for heavy workload by 23.9% on average. ",

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting anesthetic effects is essential for target-controlled infusion systems. The traditional (PK-PD) models for Bispectral index (BIS) prediction require manual selection of model parameters, which can be challenging in clinical settings. Recently proposed deep learning methods can only capture general trends and may not predict abrupt changes in BIS. To address these issues, we propose a transformer-based method for predicting the depth of anesthesia (DOA) using drug infusions of propofol and remifentanil. Our method employs long short-term memory (LSTM) and gate residual network (GRN) networks to improve the efficiency of feature fusion and applies an attention mechanism to discover the interactions between the drugs. We also use label distribution smoothing and reweighting losses to address data imbalance. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms traditional PK-PD models and previous deep learning methods, effectively predicting anesthetic depth under sudden and deep anesthesia conditions.

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a prevalent chronic condition that compromises the health of millions of people worldwide. Minimally invasive methods are needed to prevent and control diabetes but most devices for measuring glucose levels are invasive and not amenable for continuous monitoring. Here, we present an alternative method to overcome these shortcomings based on non-invasive optical photoplethysmography (PPG) for detecting diabetes. We classify non-Diabetic and Diabetic patients using the PPG signal and metadata for training Logistic Regression (LR) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms. We used PPG signals from a publicly available dataset. To prevent overfitting, we divided the data into five folds for cross-validation. By ensuring that patients in the training set are not in the testing set, the model's performance can be evaluated on unseen subjects' data, providing a more accurate assessment of its generalization. Our model achieved an F1-Score and AUC of $58.8\\pm20.0\\%$ and $79.2\\pm15.0\\%$ for LR and $51.7\\pm16.5\\%$ and $73.6\\pm17.0\\%$ for XGBoost, respectively. Feature analysis suggested that PPG morphological features contains diabetes-related information alongside metadata. Our findings are within the same range reported in the literature, indicating that machine learning methods are promising for developing remote, non-invasive, and continuous measurement devices for detecting and preventing diabetes.

    "abstract": "Different from the current node-level anomaly detection task, the goal of graph-level anomaly detection is to find abnormal graphs that significantly differ from others in a graph set. Due to the scarcity of research on the work of graph-level anomaly detection, the detailed description of graph-level anomaly is insufficient. Furthermore, existing works focus on capturing anomalous graph information to learn better graph representations, but they ignore the importance of an effective anomaly score function for evaluating abnormal graphs. Thus, in this work, we first define anomalous graph information including node and graph property anomalies in a graph set and adopt node-level and graph-level information differences to identify them, respectively. Then, we introduce a discriminative graph-level anomaly detection framework with dual-students-teacher model, where the teacher model with a heuristic loss are trained to make graph representations more divergent. Then, two competing student models trained by normal and abnormal graphs respectively fit graph representations of the teacher model in terms of node-level and graph-level representation perspectives. Finally, we combine representation errors between two student models to discriminatively distinguish anomalous graphs. Extensive experiment analysis demonstrates that our method is effective for the graph-level anomaly detection task on graph datasets in the real world. ",

    "abstract": "The embedding spaces of image models have been shown to encode a range of social biases such as racism and sexism. Here, we investigate specific factors that contribute to the emergence of these biases in Vision Transformers (ViT). Therefore, we measure the impact of training data, model architecture, and training objectives on social biases in the learned representations of ViTs. Our findings indicate that counterfactual augmentation training using diffusion-based image editing can mitigate biases, but does not eliminate them. Moreover, we find that larger models are less biased than smaller models, and that models trained using discriminative objectives are less biased than those trained using generative objectives. In addition, we observe inconsistencies in the learned social biases. To our surprise, ViTs can exhibit opposite biases when trained on the same data set using different self-supervised objectives. Our findings give insights into the factors that contribute to the emergence of social biases and suggests that we could achieve substantial fairness improvements based on model design choices. ",

    "abstract": "The aim of distribution networks is to meet their local area power demand with maximum reliability. As the electricity consumption tends to increase every year, limited line thermal capacity can lead to network congestion. Continuous development and upgradation of the distribution network is thus required to meet the energy demand, which poses a significant increase in cost. The objective of this research is to analyze distribution network topologies and introduce a topology reconfiguration scheme based on the cost and demand of electricity. Traditional electrical distribution networks are static and inefficient. To make the network active, an optimal dynamic network topology reconfiguration (DNTR) is proposed to control line switching and reconnect some loads to different substations such that the cost of electricity can be minimized. The proposed DNTR strategy was tested on a synthetic radial distribution network with three substations each connecting to an IEEE 13-bus system. Simulation results demonstrated significant cost saving in daily operations of this distribution system. ",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of fake reviews on various online platforms has created a major concern for both consumers and businesses. Such reviews can deceive customers and cause damage to the reputation of products or services, making it crucial to identify them. Although the detection of fake reviews has been extensively studied in English language, detecting fake reviews in non-English languages such as Bengali is still a relatively unexplored research area. This paper introduces the Bengali Fake Review Detection (BFRD) dataset, the first publicly available dataset for identifying fake reviews in Bengali. The dataset consists of 7710 non-fake and 1339 fake food-related reviews collected from social media posts. To convert non-Bengali words in a review, a unique pipeline has been proposed that translates English words to their corresponding Bengali meaning and also back transliterates Romanized Bengali to Bengali. We have conducted rigorous experimentation using multiple deep learning and pre-trained transformer language models to develop a reliable detection system. Finally, we propose a weighted ensemble model that combines four pre-trained transformers: BanglaBERT, BanglaBERT Base, BanglaBERT Large, and BanglaBERT Generator . According to the experiment results, the proposed ensemble model obtained a weighted F1-score of 0.9843 on 13390 reviews, including 1339 actual fake reviews and 5356 augmented fake reviews generated with the nlpaug library. The remaining 6695 reviews were randomly selected from the 7710 non-fake instances. The model achieved a 0.9558 weighted F1-score when the fake reviews were augmented using the bnaug library. ",

Motivated by how human gradually builds complex symbolic representation from the prototype symbols that are learned through perception and environmental interactions. We propose a Neural-Symbolic Transitional Dictionary Learning (TDL) framework that employs an EM algorithm to learn a transitional representation of data that compresses high-dimension information of visual parts of an input into a set of tensors as neural variables and discover the implicit predicate structure in a self-supervised way. We implement the framework with a diffusion model by regarding the decomposition of input as a cooperative game, then learn predicates by prototype clustering. We additionally use RL enabled by the Markovian of diffusion models to further tune the learned prototypes by incorporating subjective factors. Extensive experiments on 3 abstract compositional visual objects datasets that require the model to segment parts without any visual features like texture, color, or shadows apart from shape and 3 neural/symbolic downstream tasks demonstrate the learned representation enables interpretable decomposition of visual input and smooth adaption to downstream tasks which are not available by existing methods.

For non-polynomial real analytic activation functions, such as sigmoids and smoothed rectified linear units (smoothed ReLUs), we establish a lower bound of md/2 and optimality up to a factor of approximately 2. Analogous prior results were limited to Heaviside and ReLU activations, with results for smooth activations suffering from logarithmic factors and requiring random data. To analyze the memory capacity, we examine the rank of the network's Jacobian by computing the rank of matrices involving both Hadamard powers and the Khati-Rao product. Our computation extends classical linear algebraic facts about the rank of Hadamard powers. Overall, our approach differs from previous works on memory capacity and holds promise for extending to deeper models and other architectures. ",

Recently, deep learning-based methods have been a mainstream approach for social media analysis models involving complex patterns. However, these methods are susceptible to biases in the training data, such as participation inequality. Basically, a mere 1% of users generate the majority of the content on social networking sites, while the remaining users, though engaged to varying degrees, tend to be less active in content creation and largely silent. These silent users consume and listen to information that is propagated on the platform. However, their voice, attitude, and interests are not reflected in the online content, making the decision of the current methods predisposed towards the opinion of the active users. So models can mistake the loudest users for the majority. We propose to leverage re-weighting techniques to make the silent majority heard, and in turn, investigate whether the cues from these users can improve the performance of the current models for the downstream task of fake news detection.

Here, Political Tangent Search Optimizer based Transfer Learning (PTSO_TL) is introduced for thalassemia detection. Initially, input data obtained from a particular dataset is normalized in the data normalization stage. Quantile normalization is utilized in the data normalization stage, and the data are then passed to the feature fusion phase, in which Weighted Euclidean Distance with Deep Maxout Network (DMN) is utilized. Thereafter, data augmentation is performed using the oversampling method to increase data dimensionality. Lastly, thalassemia detection is carried out by TL, wherein a convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized with hyperparameters from a trained model such as Xception. TL is tuned by PTSO, and the training algorithm PTSO is presented by merging of Political Optimizer (PO) and Tangent Search Algorithm (TSA). Furthermore, PTSO_TL obtained maximal precision, recall, and f-measure values of about 94.3%, 96.1%, and 95.2%, respectively. ",

The proposed conceptual framework was demonstrated in the Freedom Convoy social media listening.

This is due to the expensive cost of running a large number of simulations at each synthesis cycle. Artificial intelligence methods are promising approaches for circuit modeling due to their speed and relative accuracy. However, existing approaches require a large amount of training data, which is still collected using simulation runs. In addition, such approaches collect a whole separate dataset for each circuit topology even if a single element is added or removed. These matters are only exacerbated by the need for post-layout modeling simulations, which take even longer. To alleviate these drawbacks, in this paper, we present FuNToM, a functional modeling method for RF circuits. FuNToM leverages the two-port analysis method for modeling multiple topologies using a single main dataset and multiple small datasets. It also leverages neural networks which have shown promising results in predicting the behavior of circuits. Our results show that for multiple RF circuits, in comparison to the state-of-the-art works, while maintaining the same accuracy, the required training data is reduced by 2.8x - 10.9x. In addition, FuNToM needs 176.8x - 188.6x less time for collecting the training set in post-layout modeling. ",

In this work, we examine the impact of high sparsity on model training using the standard computer vision and natural language processing sparsity benchmarks. We begin by showing that using standard dense training recipes for sparse training is suboptimal, and results in under-training. We provide new approaches for mitigating this issue for both sparse pre-training of vision models (e.g. ResNet50/ImageNet) and sparse fine-tuning of language models (e.g. BERT/GLUE), achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings in the high-sparsity regime, and providing detailed analyses for the difficulty of sparse training in both scenarios. Our work sets a new threshold in terms of the accuracies that can be achieved under high sparsity, and should inspire further research into improving sparse model training, to reach higher accuracies under high sparsity, but also to do so efficiently.

    "abstract": "Social media platforms, despite their value in promoting open discourse, are often exploited to spread harmful content. Current deep learning and natural language processing models used for detecting this harmful content overly rely on domain-specific terms affecting their capabilities to adapt to generalizable hate speech detection. This is because they tend to focus too narrowly on particular linguistic signals or the use of certain categories of words. Another significant challenge arises when platforms lack high-quality annotated data for training, leading to a need for cross-platform models that can adapt to different distribution shifts. Our research introduces a cross-platform hate speech detection model capable of being trained on one platform's data and generalizing to multiple unseen platforms. To achieve good generalizability across platforms, one way is to disentangle the input representations into invariant and platform-dependent features. We also argue that learning causal relationships, which remain constant across diverse environments, can significantly aid in understanding invariant representations in hate speech. By disentangling input into platform-dependent features (useful for predicting hate targets) and platform-independent features (used to predict the presence of hate), we learn invariant representations resistant to distribution shifts. These features are then used to predict hate speech across unseen platforms. Our extensive experiments across four platforms highlight our model's enhanced efficacy compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in detecting generalized hate speech. ",

Prior research has achieved great success by integrating external knowledge to enhance the semantics, but it is laborious to acquisite the appropriate knowledge resources and retrieve the script-related knowledge. In this paper, we regard public pre-trained language models as knowledge bases and automatically mine the script-related knowledge via prompt-learning. Still, the scenario-diversity and label-ambiguity in scripts make it uncertain to construct the most functional prompt and label token in prompt learning, i.e., prompt-uncertainty and verbalizer-uncertainty. Considering the innate ability of Gaussian distribution to express uncertainty, we deploy the prompt tokens and label tokens as random variables following Gaussian distributions, where a prompt estimator and a verbalizer estimator are proposed to estimate their probabilistic representations instead of deterministic representations. We take the lead to explore prompt-learning in SEP and provide a fresh perspective to enrich the script semantics. Our method is evaluated on the most widely used benchmark and a newly proposed large-scale one. Experiments show that our method, which benefits from knowledge evoked from pre-trained language models, outperforms prior baselines by 1.46\\% and 1.05\\% on two benchmarks, respectively. ",

Despite considerable advancements in this domain, the ability of even the most state-of-the-art methods to defend against adversarial examples remains elusive. While several adversarial defense strategies have been proposed, they typically suffer from constrained practicability due to inevitable trade-offs between universality, effectiveness, and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we thoroughly delve into the coupled relationship between adversarial detection and face anti-spoofing. Based on this, we propose a robust face anti-spoofing framework, namely AdvFAS, that leverages two coupled scores to accurately distinguish between correctly detected and wrongly detected face images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in a variety of settings, including different attacks, datasets, and backbones, meanwhile enjoying high accuracy on clean examples.

Such message passing leads to scalability issues in practical latency-constrained applications. To address this issue, recent methods adopt knowledge distillation (KD) to learn computationally-efficient multi-layer perceptron (MLP) by mimicking the output of GNN. However, the existing GNN representation space may not be expressive enough for representing diverse local structures of the underlying graph, which limits the knowledge transfer from GNN to MLP. Here we present a novel framework VQGraph to learn a powerful graph representation space for bridging GNNs and MLPs. We adopt the encoder of a variant of a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) as a structure-aware graph tokenizer, which explicitly represents the nodes of diverse local structures as numerous discrete tokens and constitutes a meaningful codebook. Equipped with the learned codebook, we propose a new token-based distillation objective based on soft token assignments to sufficiently transfer the structural knowledge from GNN to MLP. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the strong performance of VQGraph, where we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on GNN-MLP distillation in both transductive and inductive settings across seven graph datasets. We show that VQGraph with better performance infers faster than GNNs by 828x, and also achieves accuracy improvement over GNNs and stand-alone MLPs by 3.90% and 28.05% on average, respectively.

The pipeline is built around a lightweight model that leverages ghosted features and the DFC attention mechanism to reduce computational complexity while maintaining high performance. The model was trained on the HAM10000 dataset, which includes various types of skin lesions. To address the class imbalance in the dataset, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique and various image augmentation techniques were used. The model also incorporates a knowledge-based loss weighting technique, which assigns different weights to the loss function at the class level and the instance level, helping the model focus on minority classes and challenging samples. This technique involves assigning different weights to the loss function on two levels - the class level and the instance level. By applying appropriate loss weights, the model pays more attention to the minority classes and challenging samples, thus improving its ability to correctly detect and classify different skin lesions. The model achieved an accuracy of 92.4%, a precision of 84.2%, a recall of 86.9%, a f1-score of 85.4% with particularly strong performance in identifying Benign Keratosis-like lesions (BKL) and Nevus (NV). Despite its superior performance, the model's computational cost is considerably lower than some models with less accuracy, making it an optimal solution for real-world applications where both accuracy and efficiency are essential.

While it is well known that multiple data modalities promote mutual contextual exchange, deployment to practical driving scenarios requires global 3D scene understanding in real-time with minimal computations, thus placing greater significance on training strategies given a limited number of practically usable sensors. In this light, we exploit carefully selected auxiliary tasks that are highly correlated with the target task of interest (e.g., traffic light recognition and semantic segmentation) by fusing auxiliary task features and also using auxiliary heads for waypoint prediction based on imitation learning. Our multi-task feature fusion augments and improves the base network, TransFuser, by significant margins for safer and more complete road navigation in CARLA simulator as validated on the Town05 Benchmark through extensive experiments.

In particular, we aim to minimize the delivery latency of HARQ schemes over time-correlated fading channels, meanwhile ensuring the high reliability and limited power consumption. To ease the optimization, the simple asymptotic outage expressions of HARQ schemes are adopted. Furthermore, by noticing the non-convexity of the latency minimization problem and the intricate connection between different HARQ rounds, the graph convolutional network (GCN) is invoked for the optimal power solution owing to its powerful ability of handling the graph data. The primal-dual learning method is then leveraged to train the GCN weights. Consequently, the numerical results are presented for verification together with the comparisons among three HARQ schemes in terms of the latency and the reliability, where the three HARQ schemes include Type-I HARQ, HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC), and HARQ with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR). To recapitulate, it is revealed that HARQ-IR offers the lowest latency while guaranteeing the demanded reliability target under a stringent power constraint, albeit at the price of high coding complexity.

In this work, we introduce a novel method for extrinsic calibration that builds upon the principles of self-supervised monocular depth and ego-motion learning. Our proposed curriculum learning strategy uses monocular depth and pose estimators with velocity supervision to estimate extrinsics, and then jointly learns extrinsic calibration along with depth and pose for a set of overlapping cameras rigidly attached to a moving vehicle. Experiments on a benchmark multi-camera dataset (DDAD) demonstrate that our method enables self-calibration in various scenes robustly and efficiently compared to a traditional vision-based pose estimation pipeline. Furthermore, we demonstrate the benefits of extrinsics self-calibration as a way to improve depth prediction via joint optimization. ",

With the help of powerful image editing tools, document images are easily forged without leaving visible manipulation traces, which leads to severe issues if significant information is falsified for malicious use. Therefore, the research of document image forensics is worth further exploring. In a document image, the character with specific semantic information is most vulnerable to tampering, for which capturing the forgery traces of the character is the key to localizing the forged region in document images. Considering both character and image textures, in this paper, we propose a Character Texture Perception Network (CTP-Net) to localize the forgery of document images. Based on optical character recognition, a Character Texture Stream (CTS) is designed to capture features of text areas that are essential components of a document image. Meanwhile, texture features of the whole document image are exploited by an Image Texture Stream (ITS). Combining the features extracted from the CTS and the ITS, the CTP-Net can reveal more subtle forgery traces from document images. To overcome the challenge caused by the lack of fake document images, we design a data generation strategy that is utilized to construct a Fake Chinese Trademark dataset (FCTM). Through a series of experiments, we show that the proposed CTP-Net is able to capture tampering traces in document images, especially in text regions. Experimental results demonstrate that CTP-Net can localize multi-scale forged areas in document images and outperform the state-of-the-art forgery localization methods. ",

    "abstract": "Direct training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware has the potential to significantly reduce the high energy consumption of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) training on modern computers. The biological plausibility of SNNs allows them to benefit from bio-inspired plasticity rules, such as Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP). STDP offers gradient-free and unsupervised local learning, which can be easily implemented on neuromorphic hardware. However, relying solely on unsupervised STDP to perform classification tasks is not enough. In this paper, we propose Stabilized Supervised STDP (S2-STDP), a supervised STDP learning rule to train the classification layer of an SNN equipped with unsupervised STDP. S2-STDP integrates error-modulated weight updates that align neuron spikes with desired timestamps derived from the average firing time within the layer. Then, we introduce a training architecture called Paired Competing Neurons (PCN) to further enhance the learning capabilities of our classification layer trained with S2-STDP. PCN associates each class with paired neurons and encourages neuron specialization through intra-class competition. We evaluated our proposed methods on image recognition datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Results showed that our methods outperform current supervised STDP-based state of the art, for comparable architectures and numbers of neurons. Also, the use of PCN enhances the performance of S2-STDP, regardless of the configuration, and without introducing any hyperparameters.Further analysis demonstrated that our methods exhibited improved hyperparameter robustness, which reduces the need for tuning.

The region of interest is first tessellated, and the tiles/cells are connected using some SFC. A robot follows the SFC to explore the entire area. However, there could be obstacles that block the systematic movement of the robot. We overcome this problem by providing an evading technique that avoids the blocked tiles while ensuring all the free ones are visited at least once. The proposed strategy is online, implying that prior knowledge of the obstacles is not mandatory. It works for all SFCs, but for the sake of demonstration, we use Hilbert curve. We present the completeness of the algorithm and discuss its desirable properties with examples. We also address the non-uniform coverage problem using our strategy. ",

    "abstract": "Hyperauthorship, a phenomenon whereby there are a disproportionately large number of authors on a single paper, is increasingly common in several scientific disciplines, but with unknown consequences for network metrics used to study scientific collaboration. The validity of co-authorship as a proxy for scientific collaboration is affected by this. Using bibliometric data from publications in the field of genomics, we examine the impact of hyperauthorship on metrics of scientific collaboration, and propose a method to determine a suitable cutoff threshold for hyperauthored papers and compare co-authorship networks with and without hyperauthored works. Our analysis reveals that including hyperauthored papers dramatically impacts the structural positioning of central authors and the topological characteristics of the network, while producing small influences on whole-network cohesion measures. We present two solutions to minimize the impact of hyperauthorship: using a mathematically grounded and reproducible calculation of threshold cutoff to exclude hyperauthored papers or fractional counting to weight network results. Our findings affirm the structural influences of hyperauthored papers and suggest that scholars should be mindful when using co-authorship networks to study scientific collaboration. ",

    "title": "Balanced Classification: A Unified Framework for Long-Tailed Object  Detection",
    "abstract": "Conventional detectors suffer from performance degradation when dealing with long-tailed data due to a classification bias towards the majority head categories. In this paper, we contend that the learning bias originates from two factors: 1) the unequal competition arising from the imbalanced distribution of foreground categories, and 2) the lack of sample diversity in tail categories. To tackle these issues, we introduce a unified framework called BAlanced CLassification (BACL), which enables adaptive rectification of inequalities caused by disparities in category distribution and dynamic intensification of sample diversities in a synchronized manner. Specifically, a novel foreground classification balance loss (FCBL) is developed to ameliorate the domination of head categories and shift attention to difficult-to-differentiate categories by introducing pairwise class-aware margins and auto-adjusted weight terms, respectively. This loss prevents the over-suppression of tail categories in the context of unequal competition. Moreover, we propose a dynamic feature hallucination module (FHM), which enhances the representation of tail categories in the feature space by synthesizing hallucinated samples to introduce additional data variances. In this divide-and-conquer approach, BACL sets a new state-of-the-art on the challenging LVIS benchmark with a decoupled training pipeline, surpassing vanilla Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50-FPN by 5.8% AP and 16.1% AP for overall and tail categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BACL consistently achieves performance improvements across various datasets with different backbones and architectures.

We present a detailed analysis focusing on its derivation and the dual-thresholding strategy. A key advantage of RDI is its ability to handle potential inaccuracies associated with detecting discontinuities on non-uniform meshes, thanks to its innovative discontinuity indicators. We also extend the applicability of RDI to handle general surfaces with boundaries, features, and ridge points, thereby enhancing its versatility and usefulness in various scenarios. To demonstrate the robustness of RDI, we conduct a series of experiments on non-uniform meshes and general surfaces, and compare its performance with some alternative methods. By addressing the challenges posed by the Gibbs phenomena and providing reliable detection of discontinuities, RDI opens up possibilities for improved approximation and analysis of piecewise continuous functions, such as in data remap.

Backward projection, with BEVFormer being an example, tends to generate false-positive BEV features from incorrect projections due to the lack of utilization on depth.

MSECNet consists of a backbone network and a multi-scale edge conditioning (MSEC) stream. The MSEC stream achieves robust edge detection through multi-scale feature fusion and adaptive edge detection. The detected edges are then combined with the output of the backbone network using the edge conditioning module to produce edge-aware representations. Extensive experiments show that MSECNet outperforms existing methods on both synthetic (PCPNet) and real-world (SceneNN) datasets while running significantly faster. We also conduct various analyses to investigate the contribution of each component in the MSEC stream. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in surface reconstruction. ",

To address this challenge, we utilized self-supervised learning with convolutional neural network based on pitch contour, then analyzed how the musical concept of tori, a classification system defined by a specific scale, ornamental notes, and an idiomatic melodic contour, is captured by the model. The experimental result shows that our approach can better capture the characteristics of tori compared to traditional pitch histograms.

The out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and generalization on time series tend to suffer due to its non-stationary property, i.e., the distribution changes over time. The dynamic distributions inside time series pose great challenges to existing algorithms to identify invariant distributions since they mainly focus on the scenario where the domain information is given as prior knowledge. In this paper, we attempt to exploit subdomains within a whole dataset to counteract issues induced by non-stationary for generalized representation learning. We propose DIVERSIFY, a general framework, for OOD detection and generalization on dynamic distributions of time series. DIVERSIFY takes an iterative process: it first obtains the \"worst-case\" latent distribution scenario via adversarial training, then reduces the gap between these latent distributions. We implement DIVERSIFY via combining existing OOD detection methods according to either extracted features or outputs of models for detection while we also directly utilize outputs for classification. In addition, theoretical insights illustrate that DIVERSIFY is theoretically supported. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven datasets with different OOD settings across gesture recognition, speech commands recognition, wearable stress and affect detection, and sensor-based human activity recognition. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that DIVERSIFY learns more generalized features and significantly outperforms other baselines. ",

This procedure consists of election officials casting a test deck of ballots into each voting machine and confirming the machine produces the expected vote total for each candidate. We bring a scientific perspective to LAT by introducing the first formal approach to designing test decks with rigorous security guarantees. Specifically, our approach employs robust optimization to find test decks that are guaranteed to detect any voting machine misconfiguration that would cause votes to be swapped across candidates. Out of all the test decks with this security guarantee, our robust optimization problem yields the test deck with the minimum number of ballots, thereby minimizing implementation costs for election officials. To facilitate deployment at scale, we develop a practically efficient exact algorithm for solving our robust optimization problems based on the cutting plane method. In partnership with the Michigan Bureau of Elections, we retrospectively applied our approach to all 6928 ballot styles from Michigan's November 2022 general election; this retrospective study reveals that the test decks with rigorous security guarantees obtained by our approach require, on average, only 1.2% more ballots than current practice. Our approach has since been piloted in real-world elections by the Michigan Bureau of Elections as a low-cost way to improve election security and increase public trust in democratic institutions. ",

By taking an information-theoretic viewpoint, we demonstrate analytically that with a careful design, full macrodiversity gains and significant SNR gains can be achieved through canonical receivers and minimal coordination and synchronization requirements at the infrastructure side. Our proposed scheme extends non-coherent joint transmission by employing a special form of diversity to counteract artificially induced deep fades that would otherwise make this technique often compare unfavorably against standard transmitter selection schemes. Additionally, the inclusion of an Alamouti-like space-time coding layer is shown to recover a significant fraction of the optimal performance. Our conclusions are based on an insightful multi-point intermittent block fading channel model that enables rigorous ergodic and outage rate analysis, while also considering timing offsets due to imperfect delay compensation. Although simplified, our approach captures the essential features of modern mmWave/sub-THz communications, thereby providing practical design guidelines for realistic systems. ",

Previous efforts have applied graph neural networks (GNNs) in balanced situations where the class distribution is balanced. However, real-world data typically exhibit long-tailed class distributions, resulting in a bias towards the head classes when using GNNs and limited generalization ability over the tail classes. Recent approaches mainly focus on re-balancing different classes during model training, which fails to explicitly introduce new knowledge and sacrifices the performance of the head classes. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel framework called Retrieval Augmented Hybrid Network (RAHNet) to jointly learn a robust feature extractor and an unbiased classifier in a decoupled manner. In the feature extractor training stage, we develop a graph retrieval module to search for relevant graphs that directly enrich the intra-class diversity for the tail classes. Moreover, we innovatively optimize a category-centered supervised contrastive loss to obtain discriminative representations, which is more suitable for long-tailed scenarios. In the classifier fine-tuning stage, we balance the classifier weights with two weight regularization techniques, i.e., Max-norm and weight decay. Experiments on various popular benchmarks verify the superiority of the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches. ",

We argue that an overlooked problem in SGG is the coarse-grained interactions between boxes, which inadequately capture contextual semantics for relationship modeling, practically limiting the development of the field. In this paper, we take the initiative to explore and propose a generic paradigm termed Superpixel-based Interaction Learning (SIL) to remedy coarse-grained interactions at the box level. It allows us to model fine-grained interactions at the superpixel level in SGG. Specifically, (i) we treat a scene as a set of points and cluster them into superpixels representing sub-regions of the scene. (ii) We explore intra-entity and cross-entity interactions among the superpixels to enrich fine-grained interactions between entities at an earlier stage. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks (Visual Genome and Open Image V6) prove that our SIL enables fine-grained interaction at the superpixel level above previous box-level methods, and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. More encouragingly, the proposed method can be applied to boost the performance of existing box-level approaches in a plug-and-play fashion. In particular, SIL brings an average improvement of 2.0% mR (even up to 3.4%) of baselines for the PredCls task on Visual Genome, which facilitates its integration into any existing box-level method.

State-of-the-art methods rely on knowledge distillation and data replay techniques but still have limitations. In this work, we analyze the causes of catastrophic forgetting in class incremental learning, which owes to three factors: representation drift, representation confusion, and classifier distortion. Based on this view, we propose a two-stage learning framework with a fixed encoder and an incrementally updated prototype classifier. The encoder is trained with self-supervised learning to generate a feature space with high intrinsic dimensionality, thus improving its transferability and generality. The classifier incrementally learns new prototypes while retaining the prototypes of previously learned data, which is crucial in preserving the decision boundary.Our method does not rely on preserved samples of old classes, is thus a non-exemplar based CIL method. Experiments on public datasets show that our method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art exemplar-based methods when they reserved 5 examplers per class, under the incremental setting of 10 phases, by 18.24% on CIFAR-100 and 9.37% on ImageNet100.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks have been shown to be very effective in utilizing pairwise relationships across samples. Recently, there have been several successful proposals to generalize graph neural networks to hypergraph neural networks to exploit more complex relationships. In particular, the hypergraph collaborative networks yield superior results compared to other hypergraph neural networks for various semi-supervised learning tasks. The collaborative network can provide high quality vertex embeddings and hyperedge embeddings together by formulating them as a joint optimization problem and by using their consistency in reconstructing the given hypergraph. In this paper, we aim to establish the algorithmic stability of the core layer of the collaborative network and provide generalization guarantees. The analysis sheds light on the design of hypergraph filters in collaborative networks, for instance, how the data and hypergraph filters should be scaled to achieve uniform stability of the learning process. Some experimental results on real-world datasets are presented to illustrate the theory. ",

    "abstract": "Quantization has emerged as an essential technique for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on devices with limited resources. However, quantized models exhibit vulnerabilities when exposed to various noises in real-world applications. Despite the importance of evaluating the impact of quantization on robustness, existing research on this topic is limited and often disregards established principles of robustness evaluation, resulting in incomplete and inconclusive findings. To address this gap, we thoroughly evaluated the robustness of quantized models against various noises (adversarial attacks, natural corruptions, and systematic noises) on ImageNet. The comprehensive evaluation results empirically provide valuable insights into the robustness of quantized models in various scenarios, for example: (1) quantized models exhibit higher adversarial robustness than their floating-point counterparts, but are more vulnerable to natural corruptions and systematic noises; (2) in general, increasing the quantization bit-width results in a decrease in adversarial robustness, an increase in natural robustness, and an increase in systematic robustness; (3) among corruption methods, \\textit{impulse noise} and \\textit{glass blur} are the most harmful to quantized models, while \\textit{brightness} has the least impact; (4) among systematic noises, the \\textit{nearest neighbor interpolation} has the highest impact, while bilinear interpolation, cubic interpolation, and area interpolation are the three least harmful. Our research contributes to advancing the robust quantization of models and their deployment in real-world scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel semi-supervised Graph Counterfactual Explainer (GCE) methodology, Dynamic GRAph Counterfactual Explainer (DyGRACE). It leverages initial knowledge about the data distribution to search for valid counterfactuals while avoiding using information from potentially outdated decision functions in subsequent time steps. Employing two graph autoencoders (GAEs), DyGRACE learns the representation of each class in a binary classification scenario. The GAEs minimise the reconstruction error between the original graph and its learned representation during training. The method involves (i) optimising a parametric density function (implemented as a logistic regression function) to identify counterfactuals by maximising the factual autoencoder's reconstruction error, (ii) minimising the counterfactual autoencoder's error, and (iii) maximising the similarity between the factual and counterfactual graphs. This semi-supervised approach is independent of an underlying black-box oracle. A logistic regression model is trained on a set of graph pairs to learn weights that aid in finding counterfactuals. At inference, for each unseen graph, the logistic regressor identifies the best counterfactual candidate using these learned weights, while the GAEs can be iteratively updated to represent the continual adaptation of the learned graph representation over iterations. DyGRACE is quite effective and can act as a drift detector, identifying distributional drift based on differences in reconstruction errors between iterations. It avoids reliance on the oracle's predictions in successive iterations, thereby increasing the efficiency of counterfactual discovery. DyGRACE, with its capacity for contrastive learning and drift detection, will offer new avenues for semi-supervised learning and explanation generation. ",

It is widely used in land management, environmental monitoring, disaster assessment and other fields. Currently, most change detection methods are based on Siamese network structure or early fusion structure. Siamese structure focuses on extracting object features at different times but lacks attention to change information, which leads to false alarms and missed detections. Early fusion (EF) structure focuses on extracting features after the fusion of images of different phases but ignores the significance of object features at different times for detecting change details, making it difficult to accurately discern the edges of changed objects. To address these issues and obtain more accurate results, we propose a novel network, Triplet UNet(T-UNet), based on a three-branch encoder, which is capable to simultaneously extract the object features and the change features between the pre- and post-time-phase images through triplet encoder. To effectively interact and fuse the features extracted from the three branches of triplet encoder, we propose a multi-branch spatial-spectral cross-attention module (MBSSCA). In the decoder stage, we introduce the channel attention mechanism (CAM) and spatial attention mechanism (SAM) to fully mine and integrate detailed textures information at the shallow layer and semantic localization information at the deep layer.

In particular, in contrast with existing regret analyses, our regret bound does not depend on the diameter of the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), which in most queueing systems is at least exponential in $S$.

By incorporating distribution information, paNNG can significantly improve performance for ambiguous samples by \"pulling\" them towards their original classes and hence enable enhanced overall accuracy and generalization capability.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of TKGC methods and their details. Specifically, this paper mainly consists of three components, namely, 1)Background, which covers the preliminaries of TKGC methods, loss functions required for training, as well as the dataset and evaluation protocol; 2)Interpolation, that estimates and predicts the missing elements or set of elements through the relevant available information. It further categorizes related TKGC methods based on how to process temporal information; 3)Extrapolation, which typically focuses on continuous TKGs and predicts future events, and then classifies all extrapolation methods based on the algorithms they utilize.

    "abstract": "Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models by keeping the raw data of the involved workers private. One of its main objectives is to improve the models' privacy, security, and scalability. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) offers an efficient cross-silo setting where a few parties collaboratively train a model without sharing the same features. In such a scenario, classification labels are commonly considered sensitive information held exclusively by one (active) party, while other (passive) parties use only their local information. Recent works have uncovered important flaws of VFL, leading to possible label inference attacks under the assumption that the attacker has some, even limited, background knowledge on the relation between labels and data. In this work, we are the first (to the best of our knowledge) to investigate label inference attacks on VFL using a zero-background knowledge strategy. To concretely formulate our proposal, we focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a target model for the underlying VFL. In particular, we refer to node classification tasks, which are widely studied, and GNNs have shown promising results. Our proposed attack, BlindSage, provides impressive results in the experiments, achieving nearly 100% accuracy in most cases. Even when the attacker has no information about the used architecture or the number of classes, the accuracy remained above 85% in most instances. Finally, we observe that well-known defenses cannot mitigate our attack without affecting the model's performance on the main classification task. ",

One way to address this challenge is to leverage multi-modal models, such as CLIP, to provide image and text features in a shared embedding space, which bridges the gap between closed-vocabulary and open-vocabulary recognition. Hence, existing methods often adopt a two-stage framework to tackle the problem, where the inputs first go through a mask generator and then through the CLIP model along with the predicted masks. This process involves extracting features from images multiple times, which can be ineffective and inefficient. By contrast, we propose to build everything into a single-stage framework using a shared Frozen Convolutional CLIP backbone, which not only significantly simplifies the current two-stage pipeline, but also remarkably yields a better accuracy-cost trade-off. The proposed FC-CLIP, benefits from the following observations: the frozen CLIP backbone maintains the ability of open-vocabulary classification and can also serve as a strong mask generator, and the convolutional CLIP generalizes well to a larger input resolution than the one used during contrastive image-text pretraining. When training on COCO panoptic data only and testing in a zero-shot manner, FC-CLIP achieve 26.8 PQ, 16.8 AP, and 34.1 mIoU on ADE20K, 18.2 PQ, 27.9 mIoU on Mapillary Vistas, 44.0 PQ, 26.8 AP, 56.2 mIoU on Cityscapes, outperforming the prior art by +4.2 PQ, +2.4 AP, +4.2 mIoU on ADE20K, +4.0 PQ on Mapillary Vistas and +20.1 PQ on Cityscapes, respectively. Additionally, the training and testing time of FC-CLIP is 7.5x and 6.6x significantly faster than the same prior art, while using 5.9x fewer parameters.

However, a critical challenge in nanobodies production is the unavailability of nanobodies for a majority of antigens. Although some computational methods have been proposed to screen potential nanobodies for given target antigens, their practical application is highly restricted due to their reliance on 3D structures. Moreover, predicting nanobodyantigen interactions (binding) is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. This study aims to develop a machine-learning method to predict Nanobody-Antigen binding solely based on the sequence data. We curated a comprehensive dataset of Nanobody-Antigen binding and nonbinding data and devised an embedding method based on gapped k-mers to predict binding based only on sequences of nanobody and antigen.

Further, an MRI image processing pipeline that can address both afine and non-rigid registration is critical, as both types of deformations may be occuring in real MRI data scenarios. Unlike image classification, explainability is not commonly addressed in image registration deep learning (DL) methods, as it is challenging to interpet model-data behaviours against transformation fields. To properly address this, we incorporate Grad-CAM-based explainability frameworks in each major component of our unsupervised multi-modal and multi-organ image registration DL methodology.

In this work, we present a weakly supervised method to generate a healthy version of a diseased image and then use it to obtain a pixel-wise anomaly map. To do so, we start by considering a saliency map that approximately covers the pathological areas, obtained with ACAT. Then, we propose a technique that allows to perform targeted modifications to these regions, while preserving the rest of the image. In particular, we employ a diffusion model trained on healthy samples and combine Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) at each step of the sampling process. DDPM is used to modify the areas affected by a lesion within the saliency map, while DDIM guarantees reconstruction of the normal anatomy outside of it. The two parts are also fused at each timestep, to guarantee the generation of a sample with a coherent appearance and a seamless transition between edited and unedited parts. We verify that when our method is applied to healthy samples, the input images are reconstructed without significant modifications. We compare our approach with alternative weakly supervised methods on IST-3 for stroke lesion segmentation and on BraTS2021 for brain tumour segmentation, where we improve the DICE score of the best competing method from $0.6534$ to $0.7056$.

    "abstract": "Capturing global contextual information plays a critical role in breast ultrasound (BUS) image classification. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated reliable performance in tumor classification, they have inherent limitations for modeling global and long-range dependencies due to the localized nature of convolution operations. Vision Transformers have an improved capability of capturing global contextual information but may distort the local image patterns due to the tokenization operations. In this study, we proposed a hybrid multitask deep neural network called Hybrid-MT-ESTAN, designed to perform BUS tumor classification and segmentation using a hybrid architecture composed of CNNs and Swin Transformer components. The proposed approach was compared to nine BUS classification methods and evaluated using seven quantitative metrics on a dataset of 3,320 BUS images. The results indicate that Hybrid-MT-ESTAN achieved the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score of 82.7%, 86.4%, and 86.0%, respectively. ",

Our method, called DeepLR, offers several qualitative advantages: most notably, the ability to construct asymmetric intervals that expand in regions with a limited amount of data, and the inherent incorporation of factors such as the amount of training time, network architecture, and regularization techniques. While acknowledging that the current implementation of the method is prohibitively expensive for many deep-learning applications, the high cost may already be justified in specific fields like medical predictions or astrophysics, where a reliable uncertainty estimate for a single prediction is essential. This work highlights the significant potential of a likelihood-ratio-based uncertainty estimate and establishes a promising avenue for future research. ",

    "abstract": "While highly expressive parametric models including deep neural networks have an advantage to model complicated concepts, training such highly non-linear models is known to yield a high risk of notorious overfitting. To address this issue, this study considers a $k$th order total variation ($k$-TV) regularization, which is defined as the squared integral of the $k$th order derivative of the parametric models to be trained; penalizing the $k$-TV is expected to yield a smoother function, which is expected to avoid overfitting. While the $k$-TV terms applied to general parametric models are computationally intractable due to the integration, this study provides a stochastic optimization algorithm, that can efficiently train general models with the $k$-TV regularization without conducting explicit numerical integration. The proposed approach can be applied to the training of even deep neural networks whose structure is arbitrary, as it can be implemented by only a simple stochastic gradient descent algorithm and automatic differentiation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the neural networks trained with the $K$-TV terms are more ``resilient'' than those with the conventional parameter regularization. The proposed algorithm also can be extended to the physics-informed training of neural networks (PINNs). ",

In this vein, we consider GGMs whose covariance structures align with the geometry of the weighted network on which they are based. Such GGMs have been of longstanding interest in statistical physics, and are referred to as the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). In recent years, they have attracted considerable interest in the machine learning and theoretical computer science. In this work, we propose a novel estimator for the weighted network (equivalently, its Laplacian) from repeated measurements of a GFF on the network, based on the Fourier analytic properties of the Gaussian distribution. In this pursuit, our approach exploits complex-valued statistics constructed from observed data, that are of interest on their own right. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimator with concrete recovery guarantees and bounds on the required sample complexity. In particular, we show that the proposed statistic achieves the parametric rate of estimation for fixed network size. In the setting of networks growing with sample size, our results show that for Erdos-Renyi random graphs $G(d,p)$ above the connectivity threshold, we demonstrate that network recovery takes place with high probability as soon as the sample size $n$ satisfies $n \\gg d^4 \\log d \\cdot p^{-2}$.

This work proposes \"HOOD\" as a real-time robust human presence and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection method by exploiting 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar. We approach the presence detection application as an OOD detection problem and solve the two problems simultaneously using a single pipeline. Our solution relies on a reconstruction-based architecture and works with radar macro and micro range-Doppler images (RDIs). HOOD aims to accurately detect the \"presence\" of humans in the presence or absence of moving and stationary disturbers. Since it is also an OOD detector, it aims to detect moving or stationary clutters as OOD in humans' absence and predicts the current scene's output as \"no presence.\" HOOD is an activity-free approach that performs well in different human scenarios. On our dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW Radar, we achieve an average AUROC of 94.36%. Additionally, our extensive evaluations and experiments demonstrate that HOOD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) OOD detection methods in terms of common OOD detection metrics.

By integrating the deep learning technology with CSI-based HAR, researchers achieve state-of-the-art performance without the need of expert knowledge. However, the scarcity of labeled CSI data remains the most prominent challenge when applying deep learning models in the context of CSI-based HAR due to the privacy and incomprehensibility of CSI-based HAR data. On the other hand, SSL has emerged as a promising approach for learning meaningful representations from data without heavy reliance on labeled examples. Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to address the challenge of insufficient data in deep learning by leveraging SSL algorithms. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive inventory and analysis of the potential held by different categories of SSL algorithms, including those that have been previously studied and those that have not yet been explored, within the field. We provide an in-depth investigation of SSL algorithms in the context of WiFi CSI-based HAR. We evaluate four categories of SSL algorithms using three publicly available CSI HAR datasets, each encompassing different tasks and environmental settings. To ensure relevance to real-world applications, we design performance metrics that align with specific requirements. Furthermore, our experimental findings uncover several limitations and blind spots in existing work, highlighting the barriers that need to be addressed before SSL can be effectively deployed in real-world WiFi-based HAR applications. Our results also serve as a practical guideline for industry practitioners and provide valuable insights for future research endeavors in this field. ",

To address this issue, various studies have suggested monitoring the driver physiological state, as there exists a well-established connection between the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) and the level of attention. For our study, we designed an innovative bio-sensor comprising near-infrared LED emitters and photo-detectors, specifically a Silicon PhotoMultiplier device. This allowed us to assess the driver physiological status by analyzing the associated PhotoPlethysmography (PPG) signal.Furthermore, we developed an embedded time-domain hyper-filtering technique in conjunction with a 1D Temporal Convolutional architecture that embdes a progressive dilation setup.

    "abstract": "Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been widely utilized to support the decisions made by cardiologists when detecting and classifying arrhythmia from electrocardiograms (ECGs). However, forming a CDSS for the arrhythmia classification task is challenging due to the varying lengths of arrhythmias. Although the onset time of arrhythmia varies, previously developed methods have not considered such conditions. Thus, we propose a framework that consists of (i) local temporal information extraction, (ii) global pattern extraction, and (iii) local-global information fusion with attention to perform arrhythmia detection and classification with a constrained input length. The 10-class and 4-class performances of our approach were assessed by detecting the onset and offset of arrhythmia as an episode and the duration of arrhythmia based on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) and MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database (AFDB), respectively. The results were statistically superior to those achieved by the comparison models. To check the generalization ability of the proposed method, an AFDB-trained model was tested on the MITDB, and superior performance was attained compared with that of a state-of-the-art model. The proposed method can capture local-global information and dynamics without incurring information losses. Therefore, arrhythmias can be recognized more accurately, and their occurrence times can be calculated; thus, the clinical field can create more accurate treatment plans by using the proposed method.

Early detection of hypertension is crucial in preventing significant health issues.

This lack of certainty has resulted in some studies doubting the existence of such relationships, or considering them weak and limited to heart rate and blood pressure. In this paper, a high-dimensional representation technique based on random convolution kernels is proposed for hypertension detection using PPG signals. The results show that this relationship extends beyond heart rate and blood pressure, demonstrating the feasibility of hypertension detection with generalization. Additionally, the utilized transform using convolution kernels, as an end-to-end time-series feature extractor, outperforms the methods proposed in the previous studies and state-of-the-art deep learning models.
