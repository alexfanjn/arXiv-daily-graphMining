    "abstract": "Worked examples, which present an explained code for solving typical programming problems are among the most popular types of learning content in programming classes. Most approaches and tools for presenting these examples to students are based on line-by-line explanations of the example code. However, instructors rarely have time to provide explanations for many examples typically used in a programming class. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of using LLMs to generate code explanations for passive and active example exploration systems. To achieve this goal, we compare the code explanations generated by chatGPT with the explanations generated by both experts and students. ",

    "title": "Unified Occupancy on a Public Transport Network through Combination of  AFC and APC Data",
    "abstract": "In a transport network, the onboard occupancy is key for gaining insights into travelers' habits and adjusting the offer. Traditionally, operators have relied on field studies to evaluate ridership of a typical workday. However, automated fare collection (AFC) and automatic passenger counting (APC) data, which provide complete temporal coverage, are often available but underexploited. It should be noted, however, that each data source comes with its own biases: AFC data may not account for fraud, while not all vehicles are equipped with APC systems. This paper introduces the unified occupancy method, a geostatistical model to extrapolate occupancy to every course of a public transportation network by combining AFC and APC data with partial coverage. Unified occupancy completes missing APC information for courses on lines where other courses have APC measures, as well as for courses on lines where no APC data is available at all. The accuracy of this method is evaluated on real data from several public transportation networks in France. ",

    "abstract": "Racism and intolerance on social media contribute to a toxic online environment which may spill offline to foster hatred, and eventually lead to physical violence. That is the case with online antisemitism, the specific category of hatred considered in this study. Tracking antisemitic themes and their associated terminology over time in online discussions could help monitor the sentiments of their participants and their evolution, and possibly offer avenues for intervention that may prevent the escalation of hatred. Due to the large volume and constant evolution of online traffic, monitoring conversations manually is impractical. Instead, we propose an automated method that extracts antisemitic themes and terminology from extremist social media over time and captures their evolution. Since supervised learning would be too limited for such a task, we created an unsupervised online machine learning approach that uses large language models to assess the contextual similarity of posts. The method clusters similar posts together, dividing, and creating additional clusters over time when sub-themes emerge from existing ones or new themes appear. The antisemitic terminology used within each theme is extracted from the posts in each cluster. Our experiments show that our methodology outperforms existing baselines and demonstrates the kind of themes and sub-themes it discovers within antisemitic discourse along with their associated terminology. We believe that our approach will be useful for monitoring the evolution of all kinds of hatred beyond antisemitism on social platforms. ",

Fuzzy Delphi takes the opinion issued by judges from a linguistic perspective reducing ambiguity in opinions by using fuzzy numbers. We propose an extension named 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi method to deal with scenarios in which judges show different expertise degrees by using fuzzy multigranular semantics of the linguistic terms and to obtain intermediate and final results expressed by 2-tuple linguistic values. The key idea of our proposal is to validate the full questionnaire by means of the evaluation of its parts, defining the validity of each item as a Decision Making problem. Taking the opinion of experts, we measure the degree of consensus, the degree of consistency, and the linguistic score of each item, in order to detect those items that affect, positively or negatively, the quality of the instrument. Considering the real need to evaluate a b-learning educational experience with a consensual questionnaire, we present a Decision Making model for questionnaire validation that solve it. Additionally, we contribute to this consensus reaching problem by developing an online tool under GPL v3 license. The software visualizes the collective valuations for each iteration and assists to determine which parts of the questionnaire should be modified to reach a consensual solution. ",

The increasing sizes of datasets are enabled by larger automated efforts to collect data as well as by scalable methods to analyze and unveil insights, which was not possible many years ago. However, this fast expansion and innovation in human-centric research often comes at a cost of privacy or ethics. In this work, we review a vast corpus of scientific work on human mobility and how ethics and privacy were considered. We reviewed a total of 118 papers, including 149 datasets on individual mobility. We demonstrate that these ever growing collections, while enabling new and insightful studies, have not all consistently followed a pre-defined set of guidelines regarding acceptable practices in data governance as well as how their research was communicated.

    "abstract": "Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) algorithms receive growing research interest in intelligent education. Typically, these CD algorithms assist students by inferring their abilities (i.e., their proficiency levels on various knowledge concepts). The proficiency levels can enable further targeted skill training and personalized exercise recommendations, thereby promoting students' learning efficiency in online education. Recently, researchers have found that building and incorporating a student-exercise bipartite graph is beneficial for enhancing diagnostic performance. However, there are still limitations in their studies. On one hand, researchers overlook the heterogeneity within edges, where there can be both correct and incorrect answers. On the other hand, they disregard the uncertainty within edges, e.g., a correct answer can indicate true mastery or fortunate guessing. To address the limitations, we propose Adaptive Semantic-aware Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis model (ASG-CD), which introduces a novel and effective way to leverage bipartite graph information in CD. Specifically, we first map students, exercises, and knowledge concepts into a latent representation space and combine these latent representations to obtain student abilities and exercise difficulties. After that, we propose a Semantic-aware Graph Neural Network Layer to address edge heterogeneity. This layer splits the original bipartite graph into two subgraphs according to edge semantics, and aggregates information based on these two subgraphs separately. To mitigate the impact of edge uncertainties, we propose an Adaptive Edge Differentiation Layer that dynamically differentiates edges, followed by keeping reliable edges and filtering out uncertain edges. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of ASG-CD. ",

Up to approximately 50% of adults with ADHD may also have an anxiety disorder and approximately 30\\% of adults with anxiety may also have ADHD. Patients presenting with anxiety may be treated for anxiety without ADHD ever being considered, possibly affecting treatment. We show how data that bears on ADHD that is comorbid with anxiety can be obtained from social media data, and show that Transformers can be used to detect a proxy for possible comorbid ADHD in people with anxiety symptoms. We collected data from anxiety and ADHD online forums (subreddits). We identified posters who first started posting in the Anxiety subreddit and later started posting in the ADHD subreddit as well. We use this subset of the posters as a proxy for people who presented with anxiety symptoms and then became aware that they might have ADHD. We fine-tune a Transformer architecture-based classifier to classify people who started posting in the Anxiety subreddit and then started posting in the ADHD subreddit vs. people who posted in the Anxiety subreddit without later posting in the ADHD subreddit. We show that a Transformer architecture is capable of achieving reasonable results (76% correct for RoBERTa vs. under 60% correct for the best keyword-based model, both with 50% base rate). ",

We develop a data-driven ergonomic risk assessment system with a special focus on hand and finger activity to better identify and address ergonomic issues related to hand-intensive manufacturing processes. The system comprises a multi-modal sensor testbed to collect and synchronize operator upper body pose, hand pose and applied forces; a Biometric Assessment of Complete Hand (BACH) formulation to measure high-fidelity hand and finger risks; and industry-standard risk scores associated with upper body posture, RULA, and hand activity, HAL. Our findings demonstrate that BACH captures injurious activity with a higher granularity in comparison to the existing metrics. Machine learning models are also used to automate RULA and HAL scoring, and generalize well to unseen participants. Our assessment system, therefore, provides ergonomic interpretability of the manufacturing processes studied, and could be used to mitigate risks through minor workplace optimization and posture corrections.

These guarantees can be desirable compared to vanilla DP in real world settings as they tightly upper-bound the privacy leakage for a $\\textit{specific}$ individual in an $\\textit{actual}$ dataset, rather than considering worst-case datasets. While these frameworks are beginning to gain popularity, to date, there is a lack of private mechanisms that can fully leverage advantages of data-dependent accounting. To bridge this gap, we propose simple modifications of the Gaussian mechanism with bounded support, showing that they amplify privacy guarantees under data-dependent accounting. Experiments on model training with DP-SGD show that using bounded support Gaussian mechanisms can provide a reduction of the pDP bound $\\epsilon$ by as much as 30% without negative effects on model utility.

It is based on a new hierarchical classification network topology that combines sequential processing of generic low-level features with parallelism and nesting of high-level features.

In certain cases, it is possible to skip almost all unneeded high-level features, which can significantly reduce the inference cost and is highly beneficial in resource-constrained conditions. We believe this method paves the way for future network designs that are lightweight and adaptable, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, from compact edge devices to large-scale clouds. In terms of dynamic inference our methodology can achieve an exclusion of up to 88.7\\,\\% of parameters and 73.4\\,\\% fewer giga-multiply accumulate (GMAC) operations, analysis against comparative baselines showing an average reduction of 47.6\\,\\% in parameters and 5.8\\,\\% in GMACs across the cases we evaluated.

    "abstract": "A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to infer abstract rules from limited experience and apply these rules to unfamiliar situations. This capacity is widely studied in the visual domain using the Raven's Progressive Matrices. Recent advances in deep learning have led to multiple artificial neural network models matching or even surpassing human performance. However, while humans can identify and express the rule underlying these tasks with little to no exposure, contemporary neural networks often rely on massive pattern-based training and cannot express or extrapolate the rule inferred from the task. Furthermore, most Raven's Progressive Matrices or Raven-like tasks used for neural network training used symbolic representations, whereas humans can flexibly switch between symbolic and continuous perceptual representations. In this work, we present an algorithmic approach to rule detection and application using feature detection, affine transformation estimation and search. We applied our model to a simplified Raven's Progressive Matrices task, previously designed for behavioral testing and neuroimaging in humans. The model exhibited one-shot learning and achieved near human-level performance in the symbolic reasoning condition of the simplified task. Furthermore, the model can express the relationships discovered and generate multi-step predictions in accordance with the underlying rule. Finally, the model can reason using continuous patterns. We discuss our results and their relevance to studying abstract reasoning in humans, as well as their implications for improving intelligent machines. ",

    "abstract": "Under-display camera (UDC) systems are the foundation of full-screen display devices in which the lens mounts under the display. The pixel array of light-emitting diodes used for display diffracts and attenuates incident light, causing various degradations as the light intensity changes. Unlike general video restoration which recovers video by treating different degradation factors equally, video restoration for UDC systems is more challenging that concerns removing diverse degradation over time while preserving temporal consistency. In this paper, we introduce a novel video restoration network, called D$^2$RNet, specifically designed for UDC systems. It employs a set of Decoupling Attention Modules (DAM) that effectively separate the various video degradation factors. More specifically, a soft mask generation function is proposed to formulate each frame into flare and haze based on the diffraction arising from incident light of different intensities, followed by the proposed flare and haze removal components that leverage long- and short-term feature learning to handle the respective degradations. Such a design offers an targeted and effective solution to eliminating various types of degradation in UDC systems. We further extend our design into multi-scale to overcome the scale-changing of degradation that often occur in long-range videos. To demonstrate the superiority of D$^2$RNet, we propose a large-scale UDC video benchmark by gathering HDR videos and generating realistically degraded videos using the point spread function measured by a commercial UDC system. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of D$^2$RNet compared to other state-of-the-art video restoration and UDC image restoration methods.

    "abstract": "SCTP is a transport protocol offering features such as multi-homing, multi-streaming, and message-oriented delivery. Its two main implementations were subjected to conformance tests using the PacketDrill tool. Conformance testing is not exhaustive and a recent vulnerability (CVE-2021-3772) showed SCTP is not immune to attacks. Changes addressing the vulnerability were implemented, but the question remains whether other flaws might persist in the protocol design. We study the security of the SCTP design, taking a rigorous approach rooted in formal methods. We create a formal Promela model of SCTP, and define 10 properties capturing the essential protocol functionality based on its RFC specification and consultation with the lead RFC author. Then we show using the Spin model checker that our model satisfies these properties. We define 4 attacker models - Off-Path, where the attacker is an outsider that can spoof the port and IP of a peer; Evil-Server, where the attacker is a malicious peer; Replay, where an attacker can capture and replay, but not modify, packets; and On-Path, where the attacker controls the channel between peers. We modify an attack synthesis tool designed for transport protocols, Korg, to support our SCTP model and four attacker models. We synthesize 14 unique attacks using the attacker models - including the CVE vulnerability in the Off-Path attacker model, 4 attacks in the Evil-Server attacker model, an opportunistic ABORT attack in the Replay attacker model, and eight connection manipulation attacks in the On-Path attacker model. We show that the proposed patch eliminates the vulnerability and does not introduce new ones according to our model and protocol properties. Finally, we identify and analyze an ambiguity in the RFC, which we show can be interpreted insecurely. We propose an erratum and show that it eliminates the ambiguity. ",

For safety-critical applications such as autonomous navigation, ensuring the resilience of algorithms prior to deployments is of utmost importance. The ICP algorithm has become the standard for lidar-based localization. However, the pose estimate it produces can be greatly affected by corruption in the measurements. Corruption can arise from a variety of scenarios such as occlusions, adverse weather, or mechanical issues in the sensor. Unfortunately, the complex and iterative nature of ICP makes assessing its resilience to corruption challenging. While there have been efforts to create challenging datasets and develop simulations to evaluate the resilience of ICP empirically, our method focuses on finding the maximum possible ICP pose error using perturbation-based adversarial attacks. The proposed attack induces significant pose errors on ICP and outperforms baselines more than 88% of the time across a wide range of scenarios. As an example application, we demonstrate that our attack can be used to identify areas on a map where ICP is particularly vulnerable to corruption in the measurements. ",

To this end, we propose the Scene Graph aided RRG (SGRRG) network, a framework that generates region-level visual features, predicts anatomical attributes, and leverages an automatically generated scene graph, thus achieving medical knowledge distillation in an end-to-end manner. SGRRG is composed of a dedicated scene graph encoder responsible for translating the scene graph, and a scene graph-aided decoder that takes advantage of both patch-level and region-level visual information.

    "abstract": "Solar energy is rapidly becoming a robust renewable energy source to conventional finite resources such as fossil fuels. It is harvested using interconnected photovoltaic panels, typically built with crystalline silicon cells, i.e. semiconducting materials that convert effectively the solar radiation into electricity. However, crystalline silicon is fragile and vulnerable to cracking over time or in predictive maintenance tasks, which can lead to electric isolation of parts of the solar cell and even failure, thus affecting the panel performance and reducing electricity generation. This work aims to developing a system for detecting cell cracks in solar panels to anticipate and alaert of a potential failure of the photovoltaic system by using computer vision techniques. Three scenarios are defined where these techniques will bring value. In scenario A, images are taken manually and the system detecting failures in the solar cells is not subject to any computationa constraints. In scenario B, an Edge device is placed near the solar farm, able to make inferences. Finally, in scenario C, a small microcontroller is placed in a drone flying over the solar farm and making inferences about the solar cells' states. Three different architectures are found the most suitable solutions, one for each scenario, namely the InceptionV3 model, an EfficientNetB0 model shrunk into full integer quantization, and a customized CNN architechture built with VGG16 blocks.

To facilitate such analyses, we construct, validate, and release publicly the representative DADIT dataset of 30M tweets of 20k Italian Twitter users, along with their bios and profile pictures. We enrich the user data with high-quality labels for gender, age, and location. DADIT enables us to train and compare the performance of various state-of-the-art models for the prediction of the gender and age of social media users. In particular, we investigate if tweets contain valuable information for the task, since popular classifiers like M3 don't leverage them. Our best XLM-based classifier improves upon the commonly used competitor M3 by up to 53% F1. Especially for age prediction, classifiers profit from including tweets as features. We also confirm these findings on a German test set. ",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in robotics, especially for high-level action planning. Meanwhile, many robotics applications involve human supervisors or collaborators. Hence, it is crucial for LLMs to generate socially acceptable actions that align with people's preferences and values. In this work, we test whether LLMs capture people's intuitions about behavior judgments and communication preferences in human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. For evaluation, we reproduce three HRI user studies, comparing the output of LLMs with that of real participants. We find that GPT-4 strongly outperforms other models, generating answers that correlate strongly with users' answers in two studies $\\unicode{x2014}$ the first study dealing with selecting the most appropriate communicative act for a robot in various situations ($r_s$ = 0.82), and the second with judging the desirability, intentionality, and surprisingness of behavior ($r_s$ = 0.83). However, for the last study, testing whether people judge the behavior of robots and humans differently, no model achieves strong correlations. Moreover, we show that vision models fail to capture the essence of video stimuli and that LLMs tend to rate different communicative acts and behavior desirability higher than people. ",

    "abstract": "An issue tracker is a software tool used by organisations to interact with users and manage various aspects of the software development lifecycle. With the rise of agile methodologies, issue trackers have become popular in open and closed-source settings alike. Internal and external stakeholders report, manage, and discuss \"issues\", which represent different information such as requirements and maintenance tasks. Issue trackers can quickly become complex ecosystems, with dozens of projects, hundreds of users, thousands of issues, and often millions of issue evolutions. Finding and understanding the relevant issues for the task at hand and keeping an overview becomes difficult with time. Moreover, managing issue workflows for diverse projects becomes more difficult as organisations grow, and more stakeholders get involved. To help address these difficulties, software and requirements engineering research have suggested automated techniques based on mining issue tracking data. Given the vast amount of textual data in issue trackers, many of these techniques leverage natural language processing. This chapter discusses four major use cases for algorithmically analysing issue data to assist stakeholders with the complexity and heterogeneity of information in issue trackers. The chapter is accompanied by a follow-along demonstration package with JupyterNotebooks. ",

While the recent literature in this space leaves the impression that the pretraining algorithm is of critical importance to performance, understanding its effect is complicated by the difficulty in making objective and direct comparisons between methods. We propose a new framework which unifies many seemingly disparate SSL methods into a single shared template. Using this framework, we identify aspects in which methods differ and observe that in addition to changing the pretraining algorithm, many works also use new data augmentations or more powerful model architectures. We compare several popular SSL methods using our framework and find that many algorithmic additions, such as prediction networks or new losses, have a minor impact on downstream task performance (often less than $1\\%$), while enhanced augmentation techniques offer more significant performance improvements ($2-4\\%$). Our findings challenge the premise that SSL is being driven primarily by algorithmic improvements, and suggest instead a bitter lesson for SSL: that augmentation diversity and data / model scale are more critical contributors to recent advances in self-supervised learning.

First, we calculate the covariance matrix of the innovation (i.e., the soft-decision input to the main decoder in a Scarce-State-Transition (SST) Viterbi decoder). Then a covariance matrix corresponding to that of the one-step prediction error in the Kalman filter is obtained. Furthermore, from that matrix, a covariance matrix corresponding to that of the filtering error in the Kalman filter is derived using the formula in the Kalman filter. As a result, the average mutual information per branch for Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes is given using these covariance matrices. Also, the trace of the latter matrix represents the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE). We show that an approximate value of the average mutual information is sandwiched between half the SNR times the average filtering and one-step prediction LMMSEs. In the case of QLI codes, from the covariance matrix of the soft-decision input to the main decoder, we can get a matrix. We show that the trace of this matrix has some connection with the linear smoothing error. ",

We propose a graph homology with robust $k$-paths as the bases of its chain spaces. In this framework, the topological simplicity of series-parallel graphs translates into a triviality of higher-order chain spaces. We discuss a correspondence between the space of order-three chains and sites within the network that are susceptible to the Braess paradox, a well-known phenomenon in transportation networks. In this manner, we illustrate the utility of the proposed graph homology in sytematically studying the complexity of flow networks. ",

    "abstract": "A Knowledge Graph (KG) is a heterogeneous graph encompassing a diverse range of node and edge types. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are popular for training machine learning tasks like node classification and link prediction on KGs. However, HGNN methods exhibit excessive complexity influenced by the KG's size, density, and the number of node and edge types. AI practitioners handcraft a subgraph of a KG G relevant to a specific task. We refer to this subgraph as a task-oriented subgraph (TOSG), which contains a subset of task-related node and edge types in G. Training the task using TOSG instead of G alleviates the excessive computation required for a large KG. Crafting the TOSG demands a deep understanding of the KG's structure and the task's objectives. Hence, it is challenging and time-consuming. This paper proposes KG-TOSA, an approach to automate the TOSG extraction for task-oriented HGNN training on a large KG. In KG-TOSA, we define a generic graph pattern that captures the KG's local and global structure relevant to a specific task. We explore different techniques to extract subgraphs matching our graph pattern: namely (i) two techniques sampling around targeted nodes using biased random walk or influence scores, and (ii) a SPARQL-based extraction method leveraging RDF engines' built-in indices. Hence, it achieves negligible preprocessing overhead compared to the sampling techniques. We develop a benchmark of real KGs of large sizes and various tasks for node classification and link prediction. Our experiments show that KG-TOSA helps state-of-the-art HGNN methods reduce training time and memory usage by up to 70% while improving the model performance, e.g., accuracy and inference time. ",

The state-of-the-art KGC solutions based on graph convolution neural network (GCN) involve extensive vertex/relation embedding updates and complicated score functions, which are inherently cumbersome for acceleration. As a result, existing accelerator designs are no longer optimal, and a novel algorithm-hardware co-design for KG reasoning is needed. Recently, brain-inspired HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) has been introduced as a promising solution for lightweight machine learning, particularly for graph learning applications. In this paper, we leverage HDC for an intrinsically more efficient and acceleration-friendly KGC algorithm. We also co-design an acceleration framework named HDReason targeting FPGA platforms. On the algorithm level, HDReason achieves a balance between high reasoning accuracy, strong model interpretability, and less computation complexity. In terms of architecture, HDReason offers reconfigurability, high training throughput, and low energy consumption. When compared with NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, the proposed accelerator achieves an average 10.6x speedup and 65x energy efficiency improvement. When conducting cross-models and cross-platforms comparison, HDReason yields an average 4.2x higher performance and 3.4x better energy efficiency with similar accuracy versus the state-of-the-art FPGA-based GCN training platform.

Recently, physics-informed motion planning methods have emerged that directly solve the Eikonal equation through neural networks for motion planning and do not require expert demonstrations for learning. Inspired by these approaches, we propose the first physics-informed CMP framework that solves the Eikonal equation on the constraint manifolds and trains neural function for CMP without expert data. Our results show that the proposed approach efficiently solves various CMP problems in both simulation and real-world, including object manipulation under orientation constraints and door opening with a high-dimensional 6-DOF robot manipulator. In these complex settings, our method exhibits high success rates and finds paths in sub-seconds, which is many times faster than the state-of-the-art CMP methods. ",

To address this curse of dimensionality, we propose to use RL to enable agents to learn such graph traversal and teammate supporting behaviors in a data-driven manner. Specifically, through a new formulation of the team coordination on graphs with risky edges problem into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a novel state and action space, we investigate how RL can solve it in two paradigms: First, we use RL for a team of agents to learn how to coordinate and reach the goal with minimal cost on a single EG. We show that RL efficiently solves problems with up to 20/4 or 25/3 nodes/agents, using a fraction of the time needed for JSG to solve such complex problems; Second, we learn a general RL policy for any $N$-node EGs to produce efficient supporting behaviors.

To address this, we develop a novel weakly supervised change detection technique via Knowledge Distillation and Multiscale Sigmoid Inference (KD-MSI) that leverages image-level labels.

Previous studies have tried to tackle this problem by leveraging a portion of the trajectory data from the target domain to adapt the model. However, such domain adaptation methods are impractical in real-world scenarios, as it is infeasible to collect trajectory data from all potential target domains. In this paper, we study a task named generalized pedestrian trajectory prediction, with the aim of generalizing the model to unseen domains without accessing their trajectories. To tackle this task, we introduce a Recurrent Aligned Network~(RAN) to minimize the domain gap through domain alignment. Specifically, we devise a recurrent alignment module to effectively align the trajectory feature spaces at both time-state and time-sequence levels by the recurrent alignment strategy.Furthermore, we introduce a pre-aligned representation module to combine social interactions with the recurrent alignment strategy, which aims to consider social interactions during the alignment process instead of just target trajectories. We extensively evaluate our method and compare it with state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method. Our work not only fills the gap in the generalization setting for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction but also sets strong baselines in this field. ",

Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate MP2D's efficacy in generating dialogue with natural topic shifts. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel benchmark for topic shift dialogues, TS-WikiDialog. Utilizing the dataset, we demonstrate that even Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to handle topic shifts in dialogue effectively, and we showcase the performance improvements of models trained on datasets generated by MP2D across diverse topic shift dialogue tasks.

    "abstract": "LiDAR-based 3D object detection plays an essential role in autonomous driving. Existing high-performing 3D object detectors usually build dense feature maps in the backbone network and prediction head. However, the computational costs introduced by the dense feature maps grow quadratically as the perception range increases, making these models hard to scale up to long-range detection. Some recent works have attempted to construct fully sparse detectors to solve this issue; nevertheless, the resulting models either rely on a complex multi-stage pipeline or exhibit inferior performance. In this work, we propose SAFDNet, a straightforward yet highly effective architecture, tailored for fully sparse 3D object detection. In SAFDNet, an adaptive feature diffusion strategy is designed to address the center feature missing problem. We conducted extensive experiments on Waymo Open, nuScenes, and Argoverse2 datasets. SAFDNet performed slightly better than the previous SOTA on the first two datasets but much better on the last dataset, which features long-range detection, verifying the efficacy of SAFDNet in scenarios where long-range detection is required. Notably, on Argoverse2, SAFDNet surpassed the previous best hybrid detector HEDNet by 2.6% mAP while being 2.1x faster, and yielded 2.1% mAP gains over the previous best sparse detector FSDv2 while being 1.3x faster.

To address the issue, we develop a more accurate and efficient Prostate Cancer patient condition prediction model, named PR-NET. By compressing and optimizing the network structure of P-NET, the model complexity is reduced while maintaining high accuracy and interpretability. The PR-NET demonstrated superior performance in predicting prostate cancer patient outcomes, outshining P-NET and six other traditional models with a significant margin. In our rigorous evaluation, PR-NET not only achieved impressive average AUC and Recall scores of 0.94 and 0.83, respectively, on known data but also maintained robust generalizability on five unknown datasets with a higher average AUC of 0.73 and Recall of 0.72, compared to P-NET's 0.68 and 0.5. PR-NET's efficiency was evidenced by its shorter average training and inference times, and its gene-level analysis revealed 46 key genes, demonstrating its enhanced predictive power and efficiency in identifying critical biomarkers for prostate cancer.

Given a precondition and postcondition of a system, we formalize two quantitative safety notions, quantitative forward and backward safety, which respectively express (1) how strong the strongest postcondition of the system is with respect to the specified postcondition, and (2) how strong the specified precondition is with respect to the weakest precondition of the system needed to ensure the specified postcondition holds. We introduce two notions, forward and backward robustness, to characterize the robustness of a system against sensor attacks as the loss of safety. To reason about robustness, we introduce two simulation distances, forward and backward simulation distances, which are defined based on the behavioral distances between the original system and the system with compromised sensors. Forward and backward distances, respectively, characterize upper bounds of the degree of forward and backward safety loss caused by the sensor attacks. We verify the two simulation distances by expressing them as modalities, i.e., formulas of differential dynamic logic, and develop an ad-hoc proof system to reason with such formulas. We showcase our formal notions and reasoning techniques on two non-trivial case studies: an autonomous vehicle that needs to avoid collision and a water tank system. ",

    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud processing starkly contrasts with their susceptibility to security breaches, notably backdoor attacks. These attacks hijack DNNs during training, embedding triggers in the data that, once activated, cause the network to make predetermined errors while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. This vulnerability poses significant risks, especially given the insufficient research on robust defense mechanisms for 3D point cloud networks against such sophisticated threats. Existing attacks either struggle to resist basic point cloud pre-processing methods, or rely on delicate manual design. Exploring simple, effective, imperceptible, and difficult-to-defend triggers in 3D point clouds is still challenging.To address these challenges, we introduce MirrorAttack, a novel effective 3D backdoor attack method, which implants the trigger by simply reconstructing a clean point cloud with an auto-encoder. The data-driven nature of the MirrorAttack obviates the need for complex manual design. Minimizing the reconstruction loss automatically improves imperceptibility. Simultaneously, the reconstruction network endows the trigger with pronounced nonlinearity and sample specificity, rendering traditional preprocessing techniques ineffective in eliminating it. A trigger smoothing module based on spherical harmonic transformation is also attached to regulate the intensity of the attack.Both quantitive and qualitative results verify the effectiveness of our method. We achieve state-of-the-art ASR on different types of victim models with the intervention of defensive techniques. Moreover, the minimal perturbation introduced by our trigger, as assessed by various metrics, attests to the method's stealth, ensuring its imperceptibility. ",

    "abstract": "In the upcoming B5G/6G era, virtual reality (VR) over wireless has become a typical application, which is an inevitable trend in the development of video. However, in immersive and interactive VR experiences, VR services typically exhibit high delay, while simultaneously posing challenges for the energy consumption of local devices. To address these issues, this paper aims to improve the performance of the VR service in the edge-terminal cooperative system. Specifically, we formulate a problem of joint caching, computing, and communication VR service policy, by optimizing the weighted sum of overall VR delivery delay and energy consumption of local devices. For the purpose of designing the optimal VR service policy, the optimization problem is decoupled into three independent subproblems to be solved separately. To enhance the caching efficiency within the network, a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (Bert)-based user interest analysis method is first proposed to characterize the content requesting behavior accurately. On the basis of this, a service cost minimum-maximization problem is formulated with consideration of performance fairness among users. Thereafter, the joint caching and computing scheme is derived for each user with given allocation of communication resources while a bisection-based communication scheme is acquired with the given information on joint caching and computing policy. With alternative optimization, an optimal policy for joint caching, computing and communication based on user interest can be finally obtained. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed user interest-aware caching scheme and the effective of the joint caching, computing and communication optimization policy with consideration of user fairness.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral video (HSV) offers valuable spatial, spectral, and temporal information simultaneously, making it highly suitable for handling challenges such as background clutter and visual similarity in object tracking. However, existing methods primarily focus on band regrouping and rely on RGB trackers for feature extraction, resulting in limited exploration of spectral information and difficulties in achieving complementary representations of object features. In this paper, a spatial-spectral fusion network with spectral angle awareness (SST-Net) is proposed for hyperspectral (HS) object tracking. Firstly, to address the issue of insufficient spectral feature extraction in existing networks, a spatial-spectral feature backbone ($S^2$FB) is designed. With the spatial and spectral extraction branch, a joint representation of texture and spectrum is obtained. Secondly, a spectral attention fusion module (SAFM) is presented to capture the intra- and inter-modality correlation to obtain the fused features from the HS and RGB modalities. It can incorporate the visual information into the HS spectral context to form a robust representation. Thirdly, to ensure a more accurate response of the tracker to the object position, a spectral angle awareness module (SAAM) investigates the region-level spectral similarity between the template and search images during the prediction stage. Furthermore, we develop a novel spectral angle awareness loss (SAAL) to offer guidance for the SAAM based on similar regions. Finally, to obtain the robust tracking results, a weighted prediction method is considered to combine the HS and RGB predicted motions of objects to leverage the strengths of each modality. Extensive experiments on the HOTC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SSF-Net, compared with state-of-the-art trackers. ",

Specifically, the SIM is physically constructed by stacking multiple layers of metasurfaces and has an architecture similar to an artificial neural network (ANN), which can flexibly manipulate the electromagnetic waves that propagate through it at the speed of light. This architecture enables the SIM to achieve HMIMO precoding and combining in the wave domain, thus significantly reducing the hardware cost and energy consumption. In this letter, we investigate the channel estimation problem in SIM-assisted multi-user HMIMO communication systems. Since the number of antennas at the base station (BS) is much smaller than the number of meta-atoms per layer of the SIM, it is challenging to acquire the channel state information (CSI) in SIM-assisted multi-user systems. To address this issue, we collect multiple copies of the uplink pilot signals that propagate through the SIM. Furthermore, we leverage the array geometry to identify the subspace that spans arbitrary spatial correlation matrices. Based on partial CSI about the channel statistics, a pair of subspace-based channel estimators are proposed. Additionally, we compute the mean square error (MSE) of the proposed channel estimators and optimize the phase shifts of the SIM to minimize the MSE. Numerical results are illustrated to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation schemes. ",

    "abstract": "Although considerable advancements have been attained in self-supervised depth estimation from monocular videos, most existing methods often treat all objects in a video as static entities, which however violates the dynamic nature of real-world scenes and fails to model the geometry and motion of moving objects. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method to jointly learn 3D motion and depth from monocular videos. Our system contains a depth estimation module to predict depth, and a new decomposed object-wise 3D motion (DO3D) estimation module to predict ego-motion and 3D object motion. Depth and motion networks work collaboratively to faithfully model the geometry and dynamics of real-world scenes, which, in turn, benefits both depth and 3D motion estimation. Their predictions are further combined to synthesize a novel video frame for self-supervised training. As a core component of our framework, DO3D is a new motion disentanglement module that learns to predict camera ego-motion and instance-aware 3D object motion separately. To alleviate the difficulties in estimating non-rigid 3D object motions, they are decomposed to object-wise 6-DoF global transformations and a pixel-wise local 3D motion deformation field. Qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, including KITTI, Cityscapes, and VKITTI2, where our model delivers superior performance in all evaluated settings. For the depth estimation task, our model outperforms all compared research works in the high-resolution setting, attaining an absolute relative depth error (abs rel) of 0.099 on the KITTI benchmark. Besides, our optical flow estimation results (an overall EPE of 7.09 on KITTI) also surpass state-of-the-art methods and largely improve the estimation of dynamic regions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our motion model.

In order to balance the data distribution before model training, oversampling methods are often used to generate data for a small number of classes to solve the problem of classifying unbalanced data. Most of the classical oversampling methods are based on the SMOTE technique, which only focuses on the local information of the data, and therefore the generated data may have the problem of not being realistic enough. In the current oversampling methods based on generative networks, the methods based on GANs can capture the true distribution of data, but there is the problem of pattern collapse and training instability in training; in the oversampling methods based on denoising diffusion probability models, the neural network of the inverse diffusion process using the U-Net is not applicable to tabular data, and although the MLP can be used to replace the U-Net, the problem exists due to the simplicity of the structure and the poor effect of removing noise. problem of poor noise removal. In order to overcome the above problems, we propose a novel oversampling method SEMRes-DDPM.In the SEMRes-DDPM backward diffusion process, a new neural network structure SEMST-ResNet is used, which is suitable for tabular data and has good noise removal effect, and it can generate tabular data with higher quality. Experiments show that the SEMResNet network removes noise better than MLP; SEMRes-DDPM generates data distributions that are closer to the real data distributions than TabDDPM with CWGAN-GP; on 20 real unbalanced tabular datasets with 9 classification models, SEMRes-DDPM improves the quality of the generated tabular data in terms of three evaluation metrics (F1, G-mean, AUC) with better classification performance than other SOTA oversampling methods.

This paper presents BEACON, a novel framework that enhances the falsification process through a combination of Bayesian optimization and covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy. By exploiting quantitative metrics to evaluate how closely a system adheres to safety specifications, BEACON advances the state-of-the-art in testing methodologies. It employs a model-based test point selection approach, designed to facilitate exploration across dynamically evolving search zones to efficiently uncover safety violations. Our findings demonstrate that BEACON not only locates a higher percentage of counterexamples compared to standalone BO but also achieves this with significantly fewer simulations than required by CMA-ES, highlighting its potential to optimize the verification process of control systems. This framework offers a promising direction for achieving thorough and resource-efficient safety evaluations, ensuring the reliability of control systems in critical applications. ",

    "abstract": "Conversational systems are crucial for human-computer interaction, managing complex dialogues by identifying threads and prioritising responses. This is especially vital in multi-party conversations, where precise identification of threads and strategic response prioritisation ensure efficient dialogue management. To address these challenges an end-to-end model that identifies threads and prioritises their response generation based on the importance was developed, involving a systematic decomposition of the problem into discrete components - thread detection, prioritisation, and performance optimisation which was meticulously analysed and optimised. These refined components seamlessly integrate into a unified framework, in conversational systems. Llama2 7b is used due to its high level of generalisation but the system can be updated with any open source Large Language Model(LLM). The computational capabilities of the Llama2 model was augmented by using fine tuning methods and strategic prompting techniques to optimise the model's performance, reducing computational time and increasing the accuracy of the model. The model achieves up to 10x speed improvement, while generating more coherent results compared to existing models. ",

    "abstract": "Neural network-based image coding has been developing rapidly since its birth. Until 2022, its performance has surpassed that of the best-performing traditional image coding framework -- H.266/VVC. Witnessing such success, the IEEE 1857.11 working subgroup initializes a neural network-based image coding standard project and issues a corresponding call for proposals (CfP). In response to the CfP, this paper introduces a novel wavelet-like transform-based end-to-end image coding framework -- iWaveV3. iWaveV3 incorporates many new features such as affine wavelet-like transform, perceptual-friendly quality metric, and more advanced training and online optimization strategies into our previous wavelet-like transform-based framework iWave++. While preserving the features of supporting lossy and lossless compression simultaneously, iWaveV3 also achieves state-of-the-art compression efficiency for objective quality and is very competitive for perceptual quality. As a result, iWaveV3 is adopted as a candidate scheme for developing the IEEE Standard for neural-network-based image coding. ",

In this paper, we presented a deep learning strategy for 3D object classification in augmented reality. The proposed approach is a combination of the GRU and LSTM. LSTM networks learn longer dependencies well, but due to the number of gates, it takes longer to train; on the other hand, GRU networks have a weaker performance than LSTM, but their training speed is much higher than GRU, which is The speed is due to its fewer gates.

    "abstract": "Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) has recently boosted the practical applications of affective computing techniques in unconstrained environments. Mainstream CAER methods invariably extract ensemble representations from diverse contexts and subject-centred characteristics to perceive the target person's emotional state. Despite advancements, the biggest challenge remains due to context bias interference. The harmful bias forces the models to rely on spurious correlations between background contexts and emotion labels in likelihood estimation, causing severe performance bottlenecks and confounding valuable context priors. In this paper, we propose a counterfactual emotion inference (CLEF) framework to address the above issue. Specifically, we first formulate a generalized causal graph to decouple the causal relationships among the variables in CAER. Following the causal graph, CLEF introduces a non-invasive context branch to capture the adverse direct effect caused by the context bias. During the inference, we eliminate the direct context effect from the total causal effect by comparing factual and counterfactual outcomes, resulting in bias mitigation and robust prediction. As a model-agnostic framework, CLEF can be readily integrated into existing methods, bringing consistent performance gains. ",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement in self-supervised learning (SSL) has highlighted its potential to leverage unlabeled data for learning powerful visual representations. However, existing SSL approaches, particularly those employing different views of the same image, often rely on a limited set of predefined data augmentations. This constrains the diversity and quality of transformations, which leads to sub-optimal representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that enriches the SSL paradigm by utilizing generative models to produce semantically consistent image augmentations. By directly conditioning generative models on a source image representation, our method enables the generation of diverse augmentations while maintaining the semantics of the source image, thus offering a richer set of data for self-supervised learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the quality of learned visual representations. This research demonstrates that incorporating generative models into the SSL workflow opens new avenues for exploring the potential of unlabeled visual data. This development paves the way for more robust and versatile representation learning techniques. ",

Our proposed learning-based platform comprises a deep Koopman system model and a change point detector that provides guidance on domain shifts prompting relearning under severe exogenous and endogenous perturbations. Motion control of the autonomous system is achieved via an optimal controller design. The Koopman linearized model naturally lends itself to a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) control design. We propose the C3D control architecture Cascade Control with Change Point Detection and Deep Koopman Learning.

    "abstract": "Faults on electrical power lines could severely compromise both the reliability and safety of power systems, leading to unstable power delivery and increased outage risks. They pose significant safety hazards, necessitating swift detection and mitigation to maintain electrical infrastructure integrity and ensure continuous power supply. Hence, accurate detection and categorization of electrical faults are pivotal for optimized power system maintenance and operation. In this work, we propose a novel approach for detecting and categorizing electrical faults using the Hessian locally linear embedding (HLLE) technique and subsequent clustering with t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM). First, we employ HLLE to transform high-dimensional (HD) electrical data into low-dimensional (LD) embedding coordinates. This technique effectively captures the inherent variations and patterns in the data, enabling robust feature extraction. Next, we perform the Mann-Whitney U test based on the feature space of the embedding coordinates for fault detection. This statistical approach allows us to detect electrical faults providing an efficient means of system monitoring and control. Furthermore, to enhance fault categorization, we employ t-SNE with GMM to cluster the detected faults into various categories. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive simulations on an electrical system integrated with solar farm. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits effective fault detection and clustering across a range of fault types with different variations of the same fault. Overall, this research presents an effective methodology for robust fault detection and categorization in electrical systems, contributing to the advancement of fault management practices and the prevention of system failures.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of average consensus in a distributed system comprising a set of nodes that can exchange information among themselves. We focus on a class of algorithms for solving such a problem whereby each node maintains a state and updates it iteratively as a linear combination of the states maintained by its in-neighbors, i.e., nodes from which it receives information directly. Averaging algorithms within this class can be thought of as discrete-time linear time-varying systems without external driving inputs and whose state matrix is column stochastic. As a result, the algorithms exhibit a global invariance property in that the sum of the state variables remains constant at all times. In this paper, we report on another invariance property for the aforementioned class of averaging algorithms. This property is local to each node and reflects the conservation of certain quantities capturing an aggregate of all the values received by a node from its in-neighbors and all the values sent by said node to its out-neighbors (i.e., nodes to which it sends information directly) throughout the execution of the averaging algorithm. We show how this newly-discovered invariant can be leveraged for detecting errors while executing the averaging algorithm. ",

Through a novel evaluation approach leveraging clustering for efficient assessment of explanation robustness, we demonstrate that enhancing explanation robustness does not necessarily flatten the input loss landscape with respect to explanation loss - contrary to flattened loss landscapes indicating better classification robustness. To deeply investigate this contradiction, a groundbreaking training method designed to adjust the loss landscape with respect to explanation loss is proposed. Through the new training method, we uncover that although such adjustments can impact the robustness of explanations, they do not have an influence on the robustness of classification. These findings not only challenge the prevailing assumption of a strong correlation between the two forms of robustness but also pave new pathways for understanding relationship between loss landscape and explanation loss.

However, the majority of the methods adopting this approach are soft label based to take the full advantage of zeroth order optimisation. Unlike mainstream methods, we propose a new practical setting of hard label based attack with an optimisation process guided by a pretrained surrogate model. Experiments show the proposed method significantly improves the query efficiency of the hard label based black-box attack across various target model architectures.

The proposed synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets offer the flexibility to create data with controllable bias parameters, thereby enabling the generation of desired datasets with user-defined bias values with ease. Moreover, we conduct systematic evaluations of these proposed datasets and establish a unified evaluation approach for fair graph learning models.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using learning-based approaches for solving combinatorial problems, either in an end-to-end manner or in conjunction with traditional optimization algorithms. In both scenarios, the challenge lies in encoding the targeted combinatorial problems into a structure compatible with the learning algorithm. Many existing works have proposed problem-specific representations, often in the form of a graph, to leverage the advantages of \\textit{graph neural networks}. However, these approaches lack generality, as the representation cannot be easily transferred from one combinatorial problem to another one. While some attempts have been made to bridge this gap, they still offer a partial generality only. In response to this challenge, this paper advocates for progress toward a fully generic representation of combinatorial problems for learning-based approaches. The approach we propose involves constructing a graph by breaking down any constraint of a combinatorial problem into an abstract syntax tree and expressing relationships (e.g., a variable involved in a constraint) through the edges. Furthermore, we introduce a graph neural network architecture capable of efficiently learning from this representation. The tool provided operates on combinatorial problems expressed in the XCSP3 format, handling all the constraints available in the 2023 mini-track competition. Experimental results on four combinatorial problems demonstrate that our architecture achieves performance comparable to dedicated architectures while maintaining generality.

Thus, there is great interest in integrating pedagogical approaches for the development of both traditional coding competencies and the novel skills required to interact with LLMs. One effective way to develop and assess code comprehension ability is with ``Explain in plain English'' (EiPE) questions, where students succinctly explain the purpose of a fragment of code. However, grading EiPE questions has always been difficult given the subjective nature of evaluating written explanations and this has stifled their uptake. In this paper, we explore a natural synergy between EiPE questions and code-generating LLMs to overcome this limitation. We propose using an LLM to generate code based on students' responses to EiPE questions -- not only enabling EiPE responses to be assessed automatically, but helping students develop essential code comprehension and prompt crafting skills in parallel. We investigate this idea in an introductory programming course and report student success in creating effective prompts for solving EiPE questions. We also examine student perceptions of this activity and how it influences their views on the use of LLMs for aiding and assessing learning. ",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised semantic hashing has emerged as an indispensable technique for fast image search, which aims to convert images into binary hash codes without relying on labels. Recent advancements in the field demonstrate that employing large-scale backbones (e.g., ViT) in unsupervised semantic hashing models can yield substantial improvements. However, the inference delay has become increasingly difficult to overlook. Knowledge distillation provides a means for practical model compression to alleviate this delay. Nevertheless, the prevailing knowledge distillation approaches are not explicitly designed for semantic hashing. They ignore the unique search paradigm of semantic hashing, the inherent necessities of the distillation process, and the property of hash codes. In this paper, we propose an innovative Bit-mask Robust Contrastive knowledge Distillation (BRCD) method, specifically devised for the distillation of semantic hashing models. To ensure the effectiveness of two kinds of search paradigms in the context of semantic hashing, BRCD first aligns the semantic spaces between the teacher and student models through a contrastive knowledge distillation objective. Additionally, to eliminate noisy augmentations and ensure robust optimization, a cluster-based method within the knowledge distillation process is introduced. Furthermore, through a bit-level analysis, we uncover the presence of redundancy bits resulting from the bit independence property. To mitigate these effects, we introduce a bit mask mechanism in our knowledge distillation objective. Finally, extensive experiments not only showcase the noteworthy performance of our BRCD method in comparison to other knowledge distillation methods but also substantiate the generality of our methods across diverse semantic hashing models and backbones.

These bounds are capable of capturing subtleties inherent in various graph structures, including but not limited to paths, cycles and cliques. This enables a data-dependent generalization analysis with robust theoretical guarantees. To shed light on the generality of of our proposed bounds, we present a unifying framework that can characterize a broad spectrum of GNN models through the lens of graph homomorphism. We validate the practical applicability of our theoretical findings by showing the alignment between the proposed bounds and the empirically observed generalization gaps over both real-world and synthetic datasets.

In this study, we investigate the expressivity of GNNs from the perspective of graph search.

We show the colouring scheme inherits useful properties from graph search that can help solve problems like graph biconnectivity. Furthermore, we show that under certain conditions, the expressivity of GNNs increases hierarchically with the radius of the search neighbourhood.

To handle this issue, previous efforts have been made towards leveraging learned priors or introducing additional regularizations. In contrast, in this paper, we for the first time provide an orthogonal method from the perspective of network structure. Given the observation that trivially reducing the number of model parameters alleviates the overfitting issue, but at the cost of missing details, we propose the multi-input MLP (mi-MLP) that incorporates the inputs (i.e., location and viewing direction) of the vanilla MLP into each layer to prevent the overfitting issue without harming detailed synthesis. To further reduce the artifacts, we propose to model colors and volume density separately and present two regularization terms. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that: 1) although the proposed mi-MLP is easy to implement, it is surprisingly effective as it boosts the PSNR of the baseline from $14.73$ to $24.23$. 2) the overall framework achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide range of benchmarks.

However, we observe that there are cases (e.g. faraway regions) in which popular 2D object detectors are more reliable than state-of-the-art 3D detectors. In this paper, to improve the performance of query-based 3D object detectors, we present a novel query generating approach termed QAF2D, which infers 3D query anchors from 2D detection results. A 2D bounding box of an object in an image is lifted to a set of 3D anchors by associating each sampled point within the box with depth, yaw angle, and size candidates. Then, the validity of each 3D anchor is verified by comparing its projection in the image with its corresponding 2D box, and only valid anchors are kept and used to construct queries. The class information of the 2D bounding box associated with each query is also utilized to match the predicted boxes with ground truth for the set-based loss. The image feature extraction backbone is shared between the 3D detector and 2D detector by adding a small number of prompt parameters. We integrate QAF2D into three popular query-based 3D object detectors and carry out comprehensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset. The largest improvement that QAF2D can bring about on the nuScenes validation subset is $2.3\\%$ NDS and $2.7\\%$ mAP. Code is available at https://github.com/nullmax-vision/QAF2D. ",

Popular data augmentation approaches include image transformation-based methods, generative data augmentation, and automatic data augmentation. However, these approaches encounter notable limitations: image transformation-based and automated data augmentation techniques cannot implement semantic transformations, leading to a constrained variety of augmented samples, and generative data augmentation methods are computationally expensive. In response to these challenges, we proposed Bayesian Random Semantic Data Augmentation (BRSDA), a novel, efficient, and plug-and-play semantic data augmentation method. BRSDA is motivated by a simple translation in the feature space along specific directions that can effectuate semantic transformations. When given a feature, we define its augmentable semantic magnitude as a random variable and estimate its distribution using variational Bayesian, then sample semantic magnitude and add to the randomly selected semantic direction to achieve semantic data augmentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BRSDA on five 2D and six 3D medical image datasets covering nine modalities. We also test BRSDA with mainstream neural network architectures, showcasing its robustness. Furthermore, combining BRSDA with other leading data augmentation methods achieves superior performance.

Specifically, glance annotation is a random frame within each abnormal event, which can be easily accessed and is cost-effective. To assess its effectiveness, we manually annotate the glance annotations for two standard video anomaly detection datasets: UCF-Crime and XD-Violence.

Years of expertise lead to a remarkable capacity to separate highly similar letters and encode their relative positions, thus distinguishing words such as FORM and FROM, invariantly over a large range of sizes and absolute positions. How neural circuits achieve invariant word recognition remains unknown. Here, we address this issue by training deep neural network models to recognize written words and then analyzing how reading-specialized units emerge and operate across different layers of the network. With literacy, a small subset of units becomes specialized for word recognition in the learned script, similar to the \"visual word form area\" of the human brain. We show that these units are sensitive to specific letter identities and their distance from the blank space at the left or right of a word, thus acting as \"space bigrams\". These units specifically encode ordinal positions and operate by pooling across low and high-frequency detector units from early layers of the network. The proposed neural code provides a mechanistic insight into how information on letter identity and position is extracted and allow for invariant word recognition, and leads to predictions for reading behavior, error patterns, and the neurophysiology of reading.

To address this, we introduce an intriguing Cross-Cluster Shifting operation to unleash the representation capacity of the point-based detector by efficiently modeling longer-range inter-dependency while including only a negligible overhead. Concretely, the Cross-Cluster Shifting operation enhances the conventional design by shifting partial channels from neighboring clusters, which enables richer interaction with non-local regions and thus enlarges the receptive field of clusters.

    "abstract": "Domain generalization models aim to learn cross-domain knowledge from source domain data, to improve performance on unknown target domains. Recent research has demonstrated that diverse and rich source domain samples can enhance domain generalization capability. This paper argues that the impact of each sample on the model's generalization ability varies. Despite its small scale, a high-quality dataset can still attain a certain level of generalization ability. Motivated by this, we propose a domain-adversarial active learning (DAAL) algorithm for classification tasks in domain generalization. First, we analyze that the objective of tasks is to maximize the inter-class distance within the same domain and minimize the intra-class distance across different domains. To achieve this objective, we design a domain adversarial selection method that prioritizes challenging samples. Second, we posit that even in a converged model, there are subsets of features that lack discriminatory power within each domain. We attempt to identify these feature subsets and optimize them by a constraint loss. We validate and analyze our DAAL algorithm on multiple domain generalization datasets, comparing it with various domain generalization algorithms and active learning algorithms. Our results demonstrate that the DAAL algorithm can achieve strong generalization ability with fewer data resources, thereby reducing data annotation costs in domain generalization tasks. ",

It provides the vehicle with the ability to comprehend its surroundings and make informed decisions. Depth prediction plays a pivotal role in this process, as it helps the understanding of the geometry and motion of the environment. This thesis focuses on the challenge of depth prediction using monocular self-supervised learning techniques. The problem is approached from a broader perspective first, exploring conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) as a potential technique to achieve better generalization was performed. In doing so, a fundamental contribution to the conditional GANs, the acontrario cGAN was proposed. The second contribution entails a single image-to-depth self-supervised method, proposing a solution for the rigid-scene assumption using a novel transformer-based method that outputs a pose for each dynamic object. The third significant aspect involves the introduction of a video-to-depth map forecasting approach. This method serves as an extension of self-supervised techniques to predict future depths. This involves the creation of a novel transformer model capable of predicting the future depth of a given scene. Moreover, the various limitations of the aforementioned methods were addressed and a video-to-video depth maps model was proposed. This model leverages the spatio-temporal consistency of the input and output sequence to predict a more accurate depth sequence output. These methods have significant applications in autonomous driving (AD) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). ",

In this paper, an efficient, robust, and safe motion-planing algorithm is developed by learning the obstacle uncertainties online. More specifically, the unknown yet intended control set of obstacles is efficiently computed by solving a linear programming problem. The learned control set is used to compute forward reachable sets of obstacles that are less conservative than the worst-case prediction. Based on the forward prediction, a robust model predictive controller is designed to compute a safe reference trajectory for the ego robotic system that remains outside the reachable sets of obstacles over the prediction horizon.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive results in graph classification tasks, but they struggle to generalize effectively when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Several approaches have been proposed to address this problem. Among them, one solution is to diversify training distributions in vanilla classification by modifying the data environment, yet accessing the environment information is complex. Besides, another promising approach involves rationalization, extracting invariant rationales for predictions. However, extracting rationales is difficult due to limited learning signals, resulting in less accurate rationales and diminished predictions. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Cooperative Classification and Rationalization (C2R) method, consisting of the classification and the rationalization module. Specifically, we first assume that multiple environments are available in the classification module. Then, we introduce diverse training distributions using an environment-conditional generative network, enabling robust graph representations. Meanwhile, the rationalization module employs a separator to identify relevant rationale subgraphs while the remaining non-rationale subgraphs are de-correlated with labels. Next, we align graph representations from the classification module with rationale subgraph representations using the knowledge distillation methods, enhancing the learning signal for rationales. Finally, we infer multiple environments by gathering non-rationale representations and incorporate them into the classification module for cooperative learning. Extensive experimental results on both benchmarks and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of C2R. Code is available at https://github.com/yuelinan/Codes-of-C2R. ",

    "abstract": "Given trajectories with gaps (i.e., missing data), we investigate algorithms to identify abnormal gaps in trajectories which occur when a given moving object did not report its location, but other moving objects in the same geographic region periodically did. The problem is important due to its societal applications, such as improving maritime safety and regulatory enforcement for global security concerns such as illegal fishing, illegal oil transfers, and trans-shipments. The problem is challenging due to the difficulty of bounding the possible locations of the moving object during a trajectory gap, and the very high computational cost of detecting gaps in such a large volume of location data. The current literature on anomalous trajectory detection assumes linear interpolation within gaps, which may not be able to detect abnormal gaps since objects within a given region may have traveled away from their shortest path. In preliminary work, we introduced an abnormal gap measure that uses a classical space-time prism model to bound an object's possible movement during the trajectory gap and provided a scalable memoized gap detection algorithm (Memo-AGD). In this paper, we propose a Space Time-Aware Gap Detection (STAGD) approach to leverage space-time indexing and merging of trajectory gaps. We also incorporate a Dynamic Region Merge-based (DRM) approach to efficiently compute gap abnormality scores. We provide theoretical proofs that both algorithms are correct and complete and also provide analysis of asymptotic time complexity. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world maritime trajectory data show that the proposed approach substantially improves computation time over the baseline technique. ",

While the mesh-free nature of PINNs offers significant advantages in handling high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), challenges arise when applying quadrature rules for accurate integral evaluation in the BGK operator, which can compromise the mesh-free benefit and increase computational costs. To address this, we leverage the canonical polyadic decomposition structure of SPINNs and the linear nature of moment calculation, achieving a substantial reduction in computational expense for quadrature rule application. The multi-scale nature of the particle density function poses difficulties in precisely approximating macroscopic moments using neural networks. To improve SPINN training, we introduce the integration of Gaussian functions into SPINNs, coupled with a relative loss approach. This modification enables SPINNs to decay as rapidly as Maxwellian distributions, thereby enhancing the accuracy of macroscopic moment approximations. The relative loss design further ensures that both large and small-scale features are effectively captured by the SPINNs. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through a series of five numerical experiments, including the solution to a challenging 3D Riemann problem. These results highlight the potential of our novel method in efficiently and accurately addressing complex challenges in computational physics. ",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional sparse data emerge in many critical application domains such as cybersecurity, healthcare, anomaly detection, and trend analysis. To quickly extract meaningful insights from massive volumes of these multi-dimensional data, scientists employ unsupervised analysis tools based on tensor decomposition (TD) methods. However, real-world sparse tensors exhibit highly irregular shapes, data distributions, and sparsity, which pose significant challenges for making efficient use of modern parallel architectures. This study breaks the prevailing assumption that compressing sparse tensors into coarse-grained structures (i.e., tensor slices or blocks) or along a particular dimension/mode (i.e., mode-specific) is more efficient than keeping them in a fine-grained, mode-agnostic form. Our novel sparse tensor representation, Adaptive Linearized Tensor Order (ALTO), encodes tensors in a compact format that can be easily streamed from memory and is amenable to both caching and parallel execution. To demonstrate the efficacy of ALTO, we accelerate popular TD methods that compute the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) model across a range of real-world sparse tensors. Additionally, we characterize the major execution bottlenecks of TD methods on multiple generations of the latest Intel Xeon Scalable processors, including Sapphire Rapids CPUs, and introduce dynamic adaptation heuristics to automatically select the best algorithm based on the sparse tensor characteristics. Across a diverse set of real-world data sets, ALTO outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieving more than an order-of-magnitude speedup over the best mode-agnostic formats. Compared to the best mode-specific formats, which require multiple tensor copies, ALTO achieves more than 5.1x geometric mean speedup at a fraction (25%) of their storage. ",

Subsequently, a shared deeper decoding model decodes cross-subject features into the target feature space. During training, we leverage both visual and textual supervision for multi-modal brain decoding. Our model integrates a high-level perception decoding pipeline and a pixel-wise reconstruction pipeline guided by high-level perceptions, simulating bottom-up and top-down processes in neuroscience. Empirical experiments demonstrate robust neural representation learning across subjects for both pipelines. Moreover, merging high-level and low-level information improves both low-level and high-level reconstruction metrics. Additionally, we successfully transfer learned general knowledge to new subjects by training new adapters with limited training data. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, notably pre-training-based methods (Mind-Vis and fMRI-PTE), our approach achieves comparable or superior results across diverse tasks, showing promise as an alternative method for cross-subject fMRI data pre-training.

To augment good features, data scientists need to come up with SQL queries manually, which is time-consuming. Featuretools [1] is a widely used tool by the data science community to automatically augment the training data by extracting new features from relevant tables. It represents each feature as a group-by aggregation SQL query on relevant tables and can automatically generate these SQL queries. However, it does not include predicates in these queries, which significantly limits its application in many real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose FEATAUG, a new feature augmentation framework that automatically extracts predicate-aware SQL queries from one-to-many relationship tables. This extension is not trivial because considering predicates will exponentially increase the number of candidate queries. As a result, the original Featuretools framework, which materializes all candidate queries, will not work and needs to be redesigned. We formally define the problem and model it as a hyperparameter optimization problem. We discuss how the Bayesian Optimization can be applied here and propose a novel warm-up strategy to optimize it. To make our algorithm more practical, we also study how to identify promising attribute combinations for predicates. We show that how the beam search idea can partially solve the problem and propose several techniques to further optimize it. Our experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FeatAug extracts more effective features compared to Featuretools and other baselines.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to provide users with personalized suggestions based on their historical interactions. When training sequential models, padding is a widely adopted technique for two main reasons: 1) The vast majority of models can only handle fixed-length sequences; 2) Batching-based training needs to ensure that the sequences in each batch have the same length. The special value \\emph{0} is usually used as the padding content, which does not contain the actual information and is ignored in the model calculations. This common-sense padding strategy leads us to a problem that has never been explored before: \\emph{Can we fully utilize this idle input space by padding other content to further improve model performance and training efficiency?} In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective padding method called \\textbf{Rep}eated \\textbf{Pad}ding (\\textbf{RepPad}). Specifically, we use the original interaction sequences as the padding content and fill it to the padding positions during model training. This operation can be performed a finite number of times or repeated until the input sequences' length reaches the maximum limit. Our RepPad can be viewed as a sequence-level data augmentation strategy. Unlike most existing works, our method contains no trainable parameters or hyperparameters and is a plug-and-play data augmentation operation. Extensive experiments on various categories of sequential models and five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. The average recommendation performance improvement is up to 60.3\\% on GRU4Rec and 24.3\\% on SASRec. We also provide in-depth analysis and explanation of what makes RepPad effective from multiple perspectives. The source code will be released to ensure the reproducibility of our experiments. ",

This means that agents adapt their opinions by interacting with their neighbors in a time-varying social network. Being contrarian, the agents are kept from reaching consensus. This is the key feature that allows the emergence of cyclical trends. We show that the systems either converge to nonconsensual equilibrium or are attracted to periodic or quasi-periodic orbits. We bound the dimension of the attractors and the period of cyclical trends. We exhibit instances where each orbit is dense and uniformly distributed within its attractor. We also investigate the case of randomly changing social networks. ",

    "title": "Towards Decoupling Frontend Enhancement and Backend Recognition in  Monaural Robust ASR",
    "abstract": "It has been shown that the intelligibility of noisy speech can be improved by speech enhancement (SE) algorithms. However, monaural SE has not been established as an effective frontend for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in noisy conditions compared to an ASR model trained on noisy speech directly. The divide between SE and ASR impedes the progress of robust ASR systems, especially as SE has made major advances in recent years. This paper focuses on eliminating this divide with an ARN (attentive recurrent network) time-domain and a CrossNet time-frequency domain enhancement models. The proposed systems fully decouple frontend enhancement and backend ASR trained only on clean speech. Results on the WSJ, CHiME-2, LibriSpeech, and CHiME-4 corpora demonstrate that ARN and CrossNet enhanced speech both translate to improved ASR results in noisy and reverberant environments, and generalize well to real acoustic scenarios. The proposed system outperforms the baselines trained on corrupted speech directly. Furthermore, it cuts the previous best word error rate (WER) on CHiME-2 by $28.4\\%$ relatively with a $5.57\\%$ WER, and achieves $3.32/4.44\\%$ WER on single-channel CHiME-4 simulated/real test data without training on CHiME-4.

    "abstract": "Understanding the potential of generative AI (GenAI)-based attacks on the power grid is a fundamental challenge that must be addressed in order to protect the power grid by realizing and validating risk in new attack vectors. In this paper, a novel zero trust framework for a power grid supply chain (PGSC) is proposed. This framework facilitates early detection of potential GenAI-driven attack vectors (e.g., replay and protocol-type attacks), assessment of tail risk-based stability measures, and mitigation of such threats. First, a new zero trust system model of PGSC is designed and formulated as a zero-trust problem that seeks to guarantee for a stable PGSC by realizing and defending against GenAI-driven cyber attacks. Second, in which a domain-specific generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based attack generation mechanism is developed to create a new vulnerability cyberspace for further understanding that threat. Third, tail-based risk realization metrics are developed and implemented for quantifying the extreme risk of a potential attack while leveraging a trust measurement approach for continuous validation. Fourth, an ensemble learning-based bootstrap aggregation scheme is devised to detect the attacks that are generating synthetic identities with convincing user and distributed energy resources device profiles. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed zero trust framework that achieves an accuracy of 95.7% on attack vector generation, a risk measure of 9.61% for a 95% stable PGSC, and a 99% confidence in defense against GenAI-driven attack.

    "abstract": "Generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data or unseen domain, termed OOD generalization, still lacks appropriate theoretical guarantees. Canonical OOD bounds focus on different distance measurements between source and target domains but fail to consider the optimization property of the learned model. As empirically shown in recent work, the sharpness of learned minima influences OOD generalization. To bridge this gap between optimization and OOD generalization, we study the effect of sharpness on how a model tolerates data change in domain shift which is usually captured by \"robustness\" in generalization. In this paper, we give a rigorous connection between sharpness and robustness, which gives better OOD guarantees for robust algorithms. It also provides a theoretical backing for \"flat minima leads to better OOD generalization\". Overall, we propose a sharpness-based OOD generalization bound by taking robustness into consideration, resulting in a tighter bound than non-robust guarantees. Our findings are supported by the experiments on a ridge regression model, as well as the experiments on deep learning classification tasks. ",

To achieve satisfactory performance, existing methods for multi-label feature selection often require the centralization of substantial data from multiple sources. However, in Federated setting, centralizing data from all sources and merging them into a single dataset is not feasible. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we study a challenging problem of causal multi-label feature selection in federated setting and propose a Federated Causal Multi-label Feature Selection (FedCMFS) algorithm with three novel subroutines. Specifically, FedCMFS first uses the FedCFL subroutine that considers the correlations among label-label, label-feature, and feature-feature to learn the relevant features (candidate parents and children) of each class label while preserving data privacy without centralizing data. Second, FedCMFS employs the FedCFR subroutine to selectively recover the missed true relevant features. Finally, FedCMFS utilizes the FedCFC subroutine to remove false relevant features. The extensive experiments on 8 datasets have shown that FedCMFS is effect for causal multi-label feature selection in federated setting. ",

    "abstract": "Windows malware is predominantly available in cyberspace and is a prime target for deliberate adversarial evasion attacks. Although researchers have investigated the adversarial malware attack problem, a multitude of important questions remain unanswered, including (a) Are the existing techniques to inject adversarial perturbations in Windows Portable Executable (PE) malware files effective enough for evasion purposes?; (b) Does the attack process preserve the original behavior of malware?; (c) Are there unexplored approaches/locations that can be used to carry out adversarial evasion attacks on Windows PE malware?; and (d) What are the optimal locations and sizes of adversarial perturbations required to evade an ML-based malware detector without significant structural change in the PE file? To answer some of these questions, this work proposes a novel approach that injects a code cave within the section (i.e., intra-section) of Windows PE malware files to make space for adversarial perturbations. In addition, a code loader is also injected inside the PE file, which reverts adversarial malware to its original form during the execution, preserving the malware's functionality and executability. To understand the effectiveness of our approach, we injected adversarial perturbations inside the .text, .data and .rdata sections, generated using the gradient descent and Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), to target the two popular CNN-based malware detectors, MalConv and MalConv2. Our experiments yielded notable results, achieving a 92.31% evasion rate with gradient descent and 96.26% with FGSM against MalConv, compared to the 16.17% evasion rate for append attacks. Similarly, when targeting MalConv2, our approach achieved a remarkable maximum evasion rate of 97.93% with gradient descent and 94.34% with FGSM, significantly surpassing the 4.01% evasion rate observed with append attacks.

However, obtaining extensive labeled clinical data for training is often resource-intensive, making practical application difficult. Leveraging unlabeled data thus becomes crucial for representation learning in a label-scarce setting. Although generative self-supervised learning techniques, especially masked autoencoders, have shown promising results in representation learning in various domains, their application to dynamic graphs for dynamic functional connectivity remains underexplored, facing challenges in capturing high-level semantic representations. Here, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Joint Embedding Masked Autoencoder (ST-JEMA), drawing inspiration from the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) in computer vision. ST-JEMA employs a JEPA-inspired strategy for reconstructing dynamic graphs, which enables the learning of higher-level semantic representations considering temporal perspectives, addressing the challenges in fMRI data representation learning. Utilizing the large-scale UK Biobank dataset for self-supervised learning, ST-JEMA shows exceptional representation learning performance on dynamic functional connectivity demonstrating superiority over previous methods in predicting phenotypes and psychiatric diagnoses across eight benchmark fMRI datasets even with limited samples and effectiveness of temporal reconstruction on missing data scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of our approach as a robust representation learning method for leveraging label-scarce fMRI data. ",

    "abstract": "Developing high-performance, real-time architectures for LiDAR-based 3D object detectors is essential for the successful commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Pillar-based methods stand out as a practical choice for onboard deployment due to their computational efficiency. However, despite their efficiency, these methods can sometimes underperform compared to alternative point encoding techniques such as Voxel-encoding or PointNet++. We argue that current pillar-based methods have not sufficiently captured the fine-grained distributions of LiDAR points within each pillar structure. Consequently, there exists considerable room for improvement in pillar feature encoding. In this paper, we introduce a novel pillar encoding architecture referred to as Fine-Grained Pillar Feature Encoding (FG-PFE). FG-PFE utilizes Spatio-Temporal Virtual (STV) grids to capture the distribution of point clouds within each pillar across vertical, temporal, and horizontal dimensions. Through STV grids, points within each pillar are individually encoded using Vertical PFE (V-PFE), Temporal PFE (T-PFE), and Horizontal PFE (H-PFE). These encoded features are then aggregated through an Attentive Pillar Aggregation method. Our experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that FG-PFE achieves significant performance improvements over baseline models such as PointPillar, CenterPoint-Pillar, and PillarNet, with only a minor increase in computational overhead.

This approach harnesses the potent generation capabilities of stable-diffusion models, navigating the trade-off between image aesthetics and QR code scannability.

In the GNN framework, we transform traditional graph-matching solvers as single-channel GNNs on the association graph and extend the single-channel architecture to the multi-channel network. The proposed model can be seen as an ensemble method that fuses multiple algorithms at every iteration. Instead of averaging the estimates at the end of the ensemble, in our approach, the independent iterations of the ensembled algorithms exchange their information after each iteration via a 1x1 channel-wise convolution layer. Experiments show that our model improves the performance of traditional algorithms significantly. In addition, we propose a random sampling strategy to reduce the computational complexity and GPU memory usage, so the model applies to matching graphs with thousands of nodes. We evaluate the performance of our method on three tasks: geometric graph matching, semantic feature matching, and few-shot 3D shape classification.

Although most of the FSS research has focused on human health care, its application in veterinary medicine, particularly for pet care, remains largely limited. This study has focused on accurate segmentation of the heart and left atrial enlargement on canine chest radiographs using the proposed deep prototype alignment network (DPANet). The PANet architecture is adopted as the backbone model, and experiments are conducted using various encoders based on VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 to extract features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DPANet achieves the highest performance. In the 2way-1shot scenario, it achieves the highest intersection over union (IoU) value of 0.6966, and in the 2way-5shot scenario, it achieves the highest IoU value of 0.797. The DPANet not only signifies a performance improvement, but also shows an improved training speed in the 2way-5shot scenario. These results highlight our model's exceptional capability as a trailblazing solution for segmenting the heart and left atrial enlargement in veterinary applications through FSS, setting a new benchmark in veterinary AI research, and demonstrating its superior potential to veterinary medicine advances.

The evolution of the foreground prototype is accomplished through a \\textit{support-query-support} iterative process involving two new modules: Pseudo-prototype Generation (PPG) and Dual Prototype Evolution (DPE). The PPG module employs support features to create an initial prototype for the preliminary segmentation of the query image, resulting in a pseudo-prototype reflecting the unique needs of the current query. Subsequently, the DPE module performs reverse segmentation on support images using this pseudo-prototype, leading to the generation of evolved prototypes, which can be considered as custom solutions. As for the background prototype, the evolution begins with a global background prototype that represents the generalized features of all training images. We also design a Global Background Cleansing (GBC) module to eliminate potential adverse components mirroring the characteristics of the current foreground class. Experimental results on the PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ datasets attest to the substantial enhancements achieved by QPENet over prevailing state-of-the-art techniques, underscoring the validity of our ideas.

    "abstract": "Uplift modeling aims to measure the incremental effect, which we call uplift, of a strategy or action on the users from randomized experiments or observational data. Most existing uplift methods only use individual data, which are usually not informative enough to capture the unobserved and complex hidden factors regarding the uplift. Furthermore, uplift modeling scenario usually has scarce labeled data, especially for the treatment group, which also poses a great challenge for model training. Considering that the neighbors' features and the social relationships are very informative to characterize a user's uplift, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with two uplift estimators, called GNUM, to learn from the social graph for uplift estimation. Specifically, we design the first estimator based on a class-transformed target. The estimator is general for all types of outcomes, and is able to comprehensively model the treatment and control group data together to approach the uplift. When the outcome is discrete, we further design the other uplift estimator based on our defined partial labels, which is able to utilize more labeled data from both the treatment and control groups, to further alleviate the label scarcity problem. Comprehensive experiments on a public dataset and two industrial datasets show a superior performance of our proposed framework over state-of-the-art methods under various evaluation metrics. The proposed algorithms have been deployed online to serve real-world uplift estimation scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the problem of Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD), aiming to train one single detection model that can generalize to detect anomalies in diverse datasets from different application domains without any further training on the target data. Some recent studies have shown that large pre-trained Visual-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have strong generalization capabilities on detecting industrial defects from various datasets, but their methods rely heavily on handcrafted text prompts about defects, making them difficult to generalize to anomalies in other applications, e.g., medical image anomalies or semantic anomalies in natural images. In this work, we propose to train a GAD model with few-shot normal images as sample prompts for AD on diverse datasets on the fly. To this end, we introduce a novel approach that learns an in-context residual learning model for GAD, termed InCTRL. It is trained on an auxiliary dataset to discriminate anomalies from normal samples based on a holistic evaluation of the residuals between query images and few-shot normal sample prompts. Regardless of the datasets, per definition of anomaly, larger residuals are expected for anomalies than normal samples, thereby enabling InCTRL to generalize across different domains without further training. Comprehensive experiments on nine AD datasets are performed to establish a GAD benchmark that encapsulate the detection of industrial defect anomalies, medical anomalies, and semantic anomalies in both one-vs-all and multi-class setting, on which InCTRL is the best performer and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

The proposed multi-modal 3D object detection combines semantic features obtained from images and geometric features obtained from point clouds, but there are difficulties in defining unified representation to fuse data existing in different domains and synchronization between them.

Therefore, it excels in fast rendering scenes with simple geometry and textures through its mesh component, while simultaneously enabling high-quality rendering in intricate regions by leveraging voxel component. The flexibility of Vosh is showcased through the ability to adjust hybrid ratios, providing users the ability to control the balance between rendering quality and speed based on flexible usage.

We apply our method to benchmark and real-world datasets with varying difficulty and availability of semantic annotations. Testing on diverse classifiers, we find that our CEs outperform previous SoTA explanation models based on semantics, including both white and black-box as well as conceptual and pixel-level approaches. Their superiority is proven quantitatively and qualitatively, as validated by human subjects, highlighting the significance of leveraging semantic edges in the presence of intricate relationships. Our model-agnostic graph-based approach is widely applicable and easily extensible, producing actionable explanations across different contexts. ",

However, this research field suffers from both limited public datasets (mostly comprising <2K images with only mono-category objects) and inaccessible source code. To tackle these challenges, we establish a new benchmark dataset and an open-source method for large-scale SAR object detection. Our dataset, SARDet-100K, is a result of intense surveying, collecting, and standardizing 10 existing SAR detection datasets, providing a large-scale and diverse dataset for research purposes. To the best of our knowledge, SARDet-100K is the first COCO-level large-scale multi-class SAR object detection dataset ever created. With this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive experiments and uncovered a crucial challenge in SAR object detection: the substantial disparities between the pretraining on RGB datasets and finetuning on SAR datasets in terms of both data domain and model structure. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Multi-Stage with Filter Augmentation (MSFA) pretraining framework that tackles the problems from the perspective of data input, domain transition, and model migration. The proposed MSFA method significantly enhances the performance of SAR object detection models while demonstrating exceptional generalizability and flexibility across diverse models.

Progress in this area enables automated detection of dangerous behavior using surveillance camera feeds. A dangerous behavior that is often overlooked in other research is the throwing action in traffic flow, which is one of the unique requirements of our Smart City project to enhance public safety. This paper proposes a solution for throwing action detection in surveillance videos using deep learning. At present, datasets for throwing actions are not publicly available. To address the use-case of our Smart City project, we first generate the novel public 'Throwing Action' dataset, consisting of 271 videos of throwing actions performed by traffic participants, such as pedestrians, bicyclists, and car drivers, and 130 normal videos without throwing actions. Second, we compare the performance of different feature extractors for our anomaly detection method on the UCF-Crime and Throwing-Action datasets. The explored feature extractors are the Convolutional 3D (C3D) network, the Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) network, and the Multi-Fiber Network (MFNet). Finally, the performance of the anomaly detection algorithm is improved by applying the Adam optimizer instead of Adadelta, and proposing a mean normal loss function that covers the multitude of normal situations in traffic. Both aspects yield better anomaly detection performance. Besides this, the proposed mean normal loss function lowers the false alarm rate on the combined dataset. The experimental results reach an area under the ROC curve of 86.10 for the Throwing-Action dataset, and 80.13 on the combined dataset, respectively. ",

As data centralization yields privacy issues, Federated Learning was introduced to reduce data sharing and have a central server coordinate the learning of multiple devices. While Federated Learning is more decentralized, it still relies on a central entity that may fail or be subject to attacks, provoking the failure of the whole system. Then, Decentralized Federated Learning removes the need for a central server entirely, letting participating processes handle the coordination of the model construction. This distributed control urges studying the possibility of malicious attacks by the participants themselves. While poisoning attacks on Federated Learning have been extensively studied, their effects in Decentralized Federated Learning did not get the same level of attention. Our work is the first to propose a methodology to assess poisoning attacks in Decentralized Federated Learning in both churn free and churn prone scenarios. Furthermore, in order to evaluate our methodology on a case study representative for gossip learning we extended the gossipy simulator with an attack injector module. ",

However, FAC models trained by traditional methodologies can be unfair by exhibiting accuracy inconsistencies across varied data subpopulations. This unfairness is largely attributed to bias in data, where some spurious attributes (e.g., Male) statistically correlate with the target attribute (e.g., Smiling). Most of existing fairness-aware methods rely on the labels of spurious attributes, which may be unavailable in practice. This work proposes a novel, generation-based two-stage framework to train a fair FAC model on biased data without additional annotation. Initially, we identify the potential spurious attributes based on generative models. Notably, it enhances interpretability by explicitly showing the spurious attributes in image space. Following this, for each image, we first edit the spurious attributes with a random degree sampled from a uniform distribution, while keeping target attribute unchanged. Then we train a fair FAC model by fostering model invariance to these augmentation. Extensive experiments on three common datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in promoting fairness in FAC without compromising accuracy. Codes are in https://github.com/heqianpei/DiGA.

Given a graph $G$ whose edges are colored using two colors and a positive integer $k$, the objective in the Edge Balanced Connected Subgraph problem is to determine if $G$ has a balanced connected subgraph containing at least $k$ edges. We first show that this problem is NP-complete and remains so even if the solution is required to be a tree or a path. Then, we focus on the parameterized complexity of Edge Balanced Connected Subgraph and its variants (where the balanced subgraph is required to be a path/tree) with respect to $k$ as the parameter. Towards this, we show that if a graph has a balanced connected subgraph/tree/path of size at least $k$, then it has one of size at least $k$ and at most $f(k)$ where $f$ is a linear function. We use this result combined with dynamic programming algorithms based on color coding and representative sets to show that Edge Balanced Connected Subgraph and its variants are FPT. Further, using polynomial-time reductions to the Multilinear Monomial Detection problem, we give faster randomized FPT algorithms for the problems. In order to describe these reductions, we define a combinatorial object called relaxed-subgraph. We define this object in such a way that balanced connected subgraphs, trees and paths are relaxed-subgraphs with certain properties.

In the present study, we introduce a pioneering paradigm denominated as Bad-Deepfake, which represents a novel foray into the realm of backdoor attacks levied against deepfake detectors. Our approach hinges upon the strategic manipulation of a delimited subset of the training data, enabling us to wield disproportionate influence over the operational characteristics of a trained model. This manipulation leverages inherent frailties inherent to deepfake detectors, affording us the capacity to engineer triggers and judiciously select the most efficacious samples for the construction of the poisoned set.

    "abstract": "Phase-locked loops are commonly used for shaker-based backbone tracking of nonlinear structures. The state of the art is to tune the control parameters by trial and error. In the present work, an approach is proposed to make backbone tracking much more robust and faster. A simple PI controller is proposed, and closed-form expressions for the gains are provided that lead to an optimal settling of the phase transient. The required input parameters are obtained from a conventional shaker-based linear modal test, and an open-loop sine test at a single frequency and level. For phase detection, an adaptive filter based on the LMS algorithm is used, which is shown to be superior to the synchronous demodulation commonly used. Once the phase has locked, one can directly take the next step along the backbone, eliminating the hold times. The latter are currently used for recording the steady state, and to estimate Fourier coefficients in the post-process, which becomes unnecessary since the adaptive filter yields a highly accurate estimation at runtime. The excellent performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated for a doubly clamped beam undergoing bending-stretching coupling leading to a 20 percent shift of the lowest modal frequency. Even for fixed control parameters, designed for the linear regime, only about 100 periods are needed per backbone point, also in the nonlinear regime. This is much faster than what has been reported in the literature so far. In fact, the nonlinear backbone test becomes faster than the linear modal test, shifting the established paradigm. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate occupancy information helps to improve building energy efficiency and occupant comfort. Occupancy detection methods based on CO2 sensors have received attention due to their low cost and low intrusiveness. In naturally ventilated buildings, the accuracy of CO2-based occupancy detection is generally low in related studies due to the complex ventilation behavior and the difficulty in measuring the actual air exchange through windows. In this study, we present two novel features for occupancy detection based on the spatial distribution of the CO2 concentration. After a quantitative analysis with Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier, it was found that the accuracy of occupancy state detection in naturally ventilated rooms could be improved by up to 14.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, reaching 83.2 % (F1 score 0.84) without any ventilation information. With ventilation information, the accuracy reached 87.6 % (F1 score 0.89). The performance of occupancy quantity detection was significantly improved by up to 25.3 percentage points versus baseline, reaching 56 %, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.44 occupants, using only CO2-related features. Additional ventilation information further enhanced the performance to 61.8 % (RMSE 9.02 occupants). By incorporating spatial features, the model using only CO2-related features revealed similar performance as the model containing additional ventilation information, resulting in a better low-cost occupancy detection method for naturally ventilated buildings.

    "abstract": "Point clouds and meshes are widely used 3D data structures for many computer vision applications. While the meshes represent the surfaces of an object, point cloud represents sampled points from the surface which is also the output of modern sensors such as LiDAR and RGB-D cameras. Due to the wide application area of point clouds and the recent advancements in deep neural networks, studies focusing on robust classification of the 3D point cloud data emerged. To evaluate the robustness of deep classifier networks, a common method is to use adversarial attacks where the gradient direction is followed to change the input slightly. The previous studies on adversarial attacks are generally evaluated on point clouds of daily objects. However, considering 3D faces, these adversarial attacks tend to affect the person's facial structure more than the desired amount and cause malformation. Specifically for facial expressions, even a small adversarial attack can have a significant effect on the face structure. In this paper, we suggest an adversarial attack called $\\epsilon$-Mesh Attack, which operates on point cloud data via limiting perturbations to be on the mesh surface. We also parameterize our attack by $\\epsilon$ to scale the perturbation mesh. Our surface-based attack has tighter perturbation bounds compared to $L_2$ and $L_\\infty$ norm bounded attacks that operate on unit-ball. Even though our method has additional constraints, our experiments on CoMA, Bosphorus and FaceWarehouse datasets show that $\\epsilon$-Mesh Attack (Perpendicular) successfully confuses trained DGCNN and PointNet models $99.72\\%$ and $97.06\\%$ of the time, with indistinguishable facial deformations.

    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness of the neural network is a significant concern when it is applied to security-critical domains. In this situation, adversarial distillation is a promising option which aims to distill the robustness of the teacher network to improve the robustness of a small student network. Previous works pretrain the teacher network to make it robust to the adversarial examples aimed at itself. However, the adversarial examples are dependent on the parameters of the target network. The fixed teacher network inevitably degrades its robustness against the unseen transferred adversarial examples which targets the parameters of the student network in the adversarial distillation process. We propose PeerAiD to make a peer network learn the adversarial examples of the student network instead of adversarial examples aimed at itself. PeerAiD is an adversarial distillation that trains the peer network and the student network simultaneously in order to make the peer network specialized for defending the student network. We observe that such peer networks surpass the robustness of pretrained robust teacher network against student-attacked adversarial samples. With this peer network and adversarial distillation, PeerAiD achieves significantly higher robustness of the student network with AutoAttack (AA) accuracy up to 1.66%p and improves the natural accuracy of the student network up to 4.72%p with ResNet-18 and TinyImageNet dataset.

Nevertheless, traditional PLL methods rely on the closed-world assumption, which can be limiting in open-world scenarios and negatively impact model performance and generalization. To tackle these challenges, our study introduces a novel method called PLL-OOD, which is the first to incorporate Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection into the PLL framework. PLL-OOD significantly enhances model adaptability and accuracy by merging self-supervised learning with partial label loss and pioneering the Partial-Energy (PE) score for OOD detection. This approach improves data feature representation and effectively disambiguates candidate labels, using a dynamic label confidence matrix to refine predictions. The PE score, adjusted by label confidence, precisely identifies OOD instances, optimizing model training towards in-distribution data. This innovative method markedly boosts PLL model robustness and performance in open-world settings. To validate our approach, we conducted a comprehensive comparative experiment combining the existing state-of-the-art PLL model with multiple OOD scores on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with various OOD datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed PLL-OOD framework is highly effective and effectiveness outperforms existing models, showcasing its superiority and effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "Cultural heritage serves as the enduring record of human thought and history. Despite significant efforts dedicated to the preservation of cultural relics, many ancient artefacts have been ravaged irreversibly by natural deterioration and human actions. Deep learning technology has emerged as a valuable tool for restoring various kinds of cultural heritages, including ancient text restoration. Previous research has approached ancient text restoration from either visual or textual perspectives, often overlooking the potential of synergizing multimodal information. This paper proposes a novel Multimodal Multitask Restoring Model (MMRM) to restore ancient texts, particularly emphasising the ideograph. This model combines context understanding with residual visual information from damaged ancient artefacts, enabling it to predict damaged characters and generate restored images simultaneously. We tested the MMRM model through experiments conducted on both simulated datasets and authentic ancient inscriptions. The results show that the proposed method gives insightful restoration suggestions in both simulation experiments and real-world scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the pioneering application of multimodal deep learning in ancient text restoration, which will contribute to the understanding of ancient society and culture in digital humanities fields.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have proven effective in capturing relationships among nodes in a graph. This study introduces a novel perspective by considering a graph as a simplicial complex, encompassing nodes, edges, triangles, and $k$-simplices, enabling the definition of graph-structured data on any $k$-simplices. Our contribution is the Hodge-Laplacian heterogeneous graph attention network (HL-HGAT), designed to learn heterogeneous signal representations across $k$-simplices. The HL-HGAT incorporates three key components: HL convolutional filters (HL-filters), simplicial projection (SP), and simplicial attention pooling (SAP) operators, applied to $k$-simplices. HL-filters leverage the unique topology of $k$-simplices encoded by the Hodge-Laplacian (HL) operator, operating within the spectral domain of the $k$-th HL operator. To address computation challenges, we introduce a polynomial approximation for HL-filters, exhibiting spatial localization properties. Additionally, we propose a pooling operator to coarsen $k$-simplices, combining features through simplicial attention mechanisms of self-attention and cross-attention via transformers and SP operators, capturing topological interconnections across multiple dimensions of simplices. The HL-HGAT is comprehensively evaluated across diverse graph applications, including NP-hard problems, graph multi-label and classification challenges, and graph regression tasks in logistics, computer vision, biology, chemistry, and neuroscience. The results demonstrate the model's efficacy and versatility in handling a wide range of graph-based scenarios. ",

Despite the recent success of point cloud neural networks, especially for safety-critical tasks, it is essential to also ensure the robustness of the model. A typical way to assess a model's robustness is through adversarial attacks, where test-time examples are generated based on gradients to deceive the model. While many different defense mechanisms are studied in 2D, studies on 3D point clouds have been relatively limited in the academic field. Inspired from PointDP, which denoises the network inputs by diffusion, we propose Point Cloud Layerwise Diffusion (PCLD), a layerwise diffusion based 3D point cloud defense strategy. Unlike PointDP, we propagated the diffusion denoising after each layer to incrementally enhance the results. We apply our defense method to different types of commonly used point cloud models and adversarial attacks to evaluate its robustness. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed defense method achieved results that are comparable to or surpass those of existing methodologies, establishing robustness through a novel technique.

However, on-chip training with memristor arrays still faces challenges, including device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variations, switching non-linearity, and especially SET and RESET asymmetry. To combat device non-linearity and asymmetry, we propose to program memristors by harnessing neural networks that map desired conductance updates to the required pulse times. With our method, approximately 95% of devices can be programmed within a relative percentage difference of +-50% from the target conductance after just one attempt. Our approach substantially reduces memristor programming delays compared to traditional write-and-verify methods, presenting an advantageous solution for on-chip training scenarios. Furthermore, our proposed neural network can be accelerated by memristor arrays upon deployment, providing assistance while reducing hardware overhead compared with previous works. This work contributes significantly to the practical application of memristors, particularly in reducing delays in memristor programming. It also envisions the future development of memristor-based machine learning accelerators. ",

This poses several unique challenges for click-through rate (CTR) prediction. Due to limited user interactions for each product (i.e. item), the corresponding item embedding in the CTR model may not easily converge. This makes the conventional sequence modeling based approaches cannot effectively utilize user history information since historical user behaviors contain a mixture of items with different volume of stocks. Particularly, the attention mechanism in a sequence model tends to assign higher score to products with more accumulated user interactions, making limited-stock products being ignored and contribute less to the final output. To this end, we propose the Meta-Split Network (MSNet) to split user history sequence regarding to the volume of stock for each product, and adopt differentiated modeling approaches for different sequences. As for the limited-stock products, a meta-learning approach is applied to address the problem of inconvergence, which is achieved by designing meta scaling and shifting networks with ID and side information. In addition, traditional approach can hardly update item embedding once the product is consumed. Thereby, we propose an auxiliary loss that makes the parameters updatable even when the product is no longer in distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution addressing the recommendation of limited-stock product. Experimental results on the production dataset and online A/B testing demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

Driven by a comprehensive analysis of conspiracy text that reveals its distinctive affective features, we propose ConspEmoLLM, the first open-source LLM that integrates affective information and is able to perform diverse tasks relating to conspiracy theories. These tasks include not only conspiracy theory detection, but also classification of theory type and detection of related discussion (e.g., opinions towards theories). ConspEmoLLM is fine-tuned based on an emotion-oriented LLM using our novel ConDID dataset, which includes five tasks to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. We demonstrate that when applied to these tasks, ConspEmoLLM largely outperforms several open-source general domain LLMs and ChatGPT, as well as an LLM that has been fine-tuned using ConDID, but which does not use affective features.

Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop a generalizable detector for accurately recognizing fake images. The conventional methods rely on generating diverse training sources or large pretrained models. In this work, we show that, on the contrary, the small and training-free filter is sufficient to capture more general artifact representations. Due to its unbias towards both the training and test sources, we define it as Data-Independent Operator (DIO) to achieve appealing improvements on unseen sources. In our framework, handcrafted filters and the randomly-initialized convolutional layer can be used as the training-free artifact representations extractor with excellent results. With the data-independent operator of a popular classifier, such as Resnet50, one could already reach a new state-of-the-art without bells and whistles. We evaluate the effectiveness of the DIO on 33 generation models, even DALLE and Midjourney.

    "abstract": "Lexicase and epsilon-lexicase selection are state of the art parent selection techniques for problems featuring multiple selection criteria. Originally, lexicase selection was developed for cases where these selection criteria are unlikely to be in conflict with each other, but preliminary work suggests it is also a highly effective many-objective optimization algorithm. However, to predict whether these results generalize, we must understand lexicase selection's performance on contradictory objectives. Prior work has shown mixed results on this question. Here, we develop theory identifying circumstances under which lexicase selection will succeed or fail to find a Pareto-optimal solution. To make this analysis tractable, we restrict our investigation to a theoretical problem with maximally contradictory objectives. Ultimately, we find that lexicase and epsilon-lexicase selection each have a region of parameter space where they are incapable of optimizing contradictory objectives. Outside of this region, however, they perform well despite the presence of contradictory objectives. Based on these findings, we propose theoretically-backed guidelines for parameter choice. Additionally, we identify other properties that may affect whether a many-objective optimization problem is a good fit for lexicase or epsilon-lexicase selection. ",

This framework is crucial for integrating structured knowledge into multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale, aiming to alleviate issues like knowledge misconceptions and multi-modal hallucinations. In this work, to evaluate models' ability to accurately embed entities within MMKGs, we focus on two widely researched tasks: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) and Multi-modal Entity Alignment (MMEA). Building on this foundation, we propose a novel SNAG method that utilizes a Transformer-based architecture equipped with modality-level noise masking for the robust integration of multi-modal entity features in KGs. By incorporating specific training objectives for both MKGC and MMEA, our approach achieves SOTA performance across a total of ten datasets (three for MKGC and seven for MEMA), demonstrating its robustness and versatility. Besides, SNAG can not only function as a standalone model but also enhance other existing methods, providing stable performance improvements.

In this paper, we focus on the species recognition task in images concerned with large databases, a large number of fine-grained hierarchical classes, severe class imbalance, and varying image quality. We propose a framework for combining individual OOD measures into one combined OOD (COOD) measure using a supervised model. The individual measures are several existing state-of-the-art measures and several novel OOD measures developed with novel class detection and hierarchical class structure in mind. COOD was extensively evaluated on three large-scale (500k+ images) biodiversity datasets in the context of anomaly and novel class detection. We show that COOD outperforms individual, including state-of-the-art, OOD measures by a large margin in terms of TPR@1% FPR in the majority of experiments, e.g., improving detecting ImageNet images (OOD) from 54.3% to 85.4% for the iNaturalist 2018 dataset. SHAP (feature contribution) analysis shows that different individual OOD measures are essential for various tasks, indicating that multiple OOD measures and combinations are needed to generalize. Additionally, we show that explicitly considering ID images that are incorrectly classified for the original (species) recognition task is important for constructing high-performing OOD detection methods and for practical applicability. The framework can easily be extended or adapted to other tasks and media modalities. ",

    "abstract": "Rupture of intracranial aneurysms results in severe subarachnoidal hemorrhage, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Neurointerventional occlusion of the aneurysm through coiling has evolved to a therapeutical standard. The choice of the specific coil has an important influence on secondary regrowth requiring retreatment. Aneurysm occlusion was simulated either through virtual implantation of a preshaped 3D coil or with a porous media approach. In this study, we used a recently developed numerical approach to simulate aneurysm shapes in specific challenging aneurysm anatomies and correlated these with aneurysm recurrence 6 months after treatment. The simulation showed a great variety of coil shapes depending on the variability in possible microcatheter positions. Aneurysms with a later recurrence showed a tendency for more successful coiling attempts. Results revealed further trends suggesting lower simulated packing densities in aneurysms with reoccurrence. Simulated packing densities did not correlate with those calculated by conventional software, indicating the potential for our approach to offer additional predictive value. Our study, therefore, pioneers a comprehensive numerical model for simulating aneurysm coiling, providing insights into individualized treatment strategies and outcome prediction. Future directions involve expanding the model's capabilities to simulate intraprocedural outcomes and long-term predictions, aiming to refine occlusion quality criteria and validate prediction parameters in larger patient cohorts. This simulation framework holds promise for enhancing clinical decision-making and optimizing patient outcomes in endovascular aneurysm treatment. ",

In this paper, we scrutinize the limitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and Grounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based real-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module designed to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO. Notably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with TensorRT and language cache techniques applied.

Furthermore, it establishes new state-of-the-art benchmarks on ODinW and OVDEval, boasting an AP of 30.1 and an NMS-AP of 26.86, respectively. The practicality of OmDet-Turbo in industrial applications is underscored by its exceptional performance on benchmark datasets and superior inference speed, positioning it as a compelling choice for real-time object detection tasks.

We study benign overfitting in two-layer leaky ReLU networks trained with the hinge loss on a binary classification task. We consider input data which can be decomposed into the sum of a common signal and a random noise component, which lie on subspaces orthogonal to one another. We characterize conditions on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the model parameters giving rise to benign versus non-benign, or harmful, overfitting: in particular, if the SNR is high then benign overfitting occurs, conversely if the SNR is low then harmful overfitting occurs. We attribute both benign and non-benign overfitting to an approximate margin maximization property and show that leaky ReLU networks trained on hinge loss with Gradient Descent (GD) satisfy this property. In contrast to prior work we do not require near orthogonality conditions on the training data: notably, for input dimension $d$ and training sample size $n$, while prior work shows asymptotically optimal error when $d = \\Omega(n^2 \\log n)$, here we require only $d = \\Omega\\left(n \\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ to obtain error within $\\epsilon$ of optimal.

    "abstract": "Weighted Timed Games (WTG for short) are the most widely used model to describe controller synthesis problems involving real-time issues. The synthesized strategies rely on a perfect measure of time elapse, which is not realistic in practice. In order to produce strategies tolerant to timing imprecisions, we rely on a notion of robustness first introduced for timed automata. More precisely, WTGs are two-player zero-sum games played in a timed automaton equipped with integer weights in which one of the players, that we call Min, wants to reach a target location while minimising the cumulated weight. In this work, we equip the underlying timed automaton with a semantics depending on some parameter (representing the maximal possible perturbation) in which the opponent of Min can in addition perturb delays chosen by Min. The robust value problem can then be stated as follows: given some threshold, determine whether there exists a positive perturbation and a strategy for Min ensuring to reach the target, with an accumulated weight below the threshold, whatever the opponent does. We provide the first decidability result for this robust value problem by computing the robust value function, in a parametric way, for the class of divergent WTGs (introduced to obtain decidability of the (classical) value problem in WTGs without bounding the number of clocks). To this end, we show that the robust value is the fixpoint of some operators, as is classically done for value iteration algorithms. We then combine in a very careful way two representations: piecewise affine functions introduced in [1] to analyse WTGs, and shrunk Difference Bound Matrices considered in [29] to analyse robustness in timed automata. Last, we also study qualitative decision problems and close an open problem on robust reachability, showing it is EXPTIME-complete for general WTGs. ",

We create corresponding benchmark datasets, which contain diverse hypothetical scenarios with plausible changes to the original knowledge graph and facts that should be retained. We develop COULDD, a general method for adapting existing knowledge graph embeddings given a hypothetical premise, and evaluate it on our benchmark. Our results indicate that KGEs learn patterns in the graph without explicit training. We further observe that KGEs adapted with COULDD solidly detect plausible counterfactual changes to the graph that follow these patterns. An evaluation on human-annotated data reveals that KGEs adapted with COULDD are mostly unable to recognize changes to the graph that do not follow learned inference rules. In contrast, ChatGPT mostly outperforms KGEs in detecting plausible changes to the graph but has poor knowledge retention.

Recently, object-centric learning has emerged as a promising approach for improved surgical scene understanding, capturing and disentangling visual and semantic properties of surgical tools and anatomy to improve downstream task performance. In this work, we conduct a multi-centric performance benchmark of object-centric approaches, focusing on Critical View of Safety assessment in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, then propose an improved approach for unseen domain generalization. Methods: We evaluate four object-centric approaches for domain generalization, establishing baseline performance. Next, leveraging the disentangled nature of object-centric representations, we dissect one of these methods through a series of ablations (e.g. ignoring either visual or semantic features for downstream classification). Finally, based on the results of these ablations, we develop an optimized method specifically tailored for domain generalization, LG-DG, that includes a novel disentanglement loss function. Results: Our optimized approach, LG-DG, achieves an improvement of 9.28% over the best baseline approach. More broadly, we show that object-centric approaches are highly effective for domain generalization thanks to their modular approach to representation learning. Conclusion: We investigate the use of object-centric methods for unseen domain generalization, identify method-agnostic factors critical for performance, and present an optimized approach that substantially outperforms existing methods.

As a starting point, we argue that the two often-conflated phases of next-token prediction -- autoregressive inference and teacher-forced training -- must be treated distinctly. The popular criticism that errors can compound during autoregressive inference, crucially assumes that teacher-forcing has learned an accurate next-token predictor. This assumption sidesteps a more deep-rooted problem we expose: in certain classes of tasks, teacher-forcing can simply fail to learn an accurate next-token predictor in the first place. We describe a general mechanism of how teacher-forcing can fail, and design a minimal planning task where both the Transformer and the Mamba architecture empirically fail in that manner -- remarkably, despite the task being straightforward to learn. We provide preliminary evidence that this failure can be resolved when training to predict multiple tokens in advance.

The first player aims is to minimize, and the second player to maximize, the regret: The minimal prediction loss using the representation, compared to the same loss using the original features. For the canonical setting in which the representation, the response to predict and the predictors are all linear functions, and under the mean squared error loss function, we derive the theoretically optimal representation in pure strategies, which shows the effectiveness of the prior knowledge, and the optimal regret in mixed strategies, which shows the usefulness of randomizing the representation. For general representations and loss functions, we propose an efficient algorithm to optimize a randomized representation. The algorithm only requires the gradients of the loss function, and is based on incrementally adding a representation rule to a mixture of such rules. ",

The main challenges to seizing this opportunity are the incomplete knowledge of the cellular network and the combinatorial explosion of possible interventions, both of which are insurmountable by experiments. To address these challenges, we develop a transfer learning approach to control cell behavior that is pre-trained on transcriptomic data associated with human cell fates, thereby generating a model of the network dynamics that can be transferred to specific reprogramming goals. The approach combines transcriptional responses to gene perturbations to minimize the difference between a given pair of initial and target transcriptional states. We demonstrate our approach's versatility by applying it to a microarray dataset comprising >9,000 microarrays across 54 cell types and 227 unique perturbations, and an RNASeq dataset consisting of >10,000 sequencing runs across 36 cell types and 138 perturbations. Our approach reproduces known reprogramming protocols with an AUROC of 0.91 while innovating over existing methods by pre-training an adaptable model that can be tailored to specific reprogramming transitions. We show that the number of gene perturbations required to steer from one fate to another increases with decreasing developmental relatedness and that fewer genes are needed to progress along developmental paths than to regress. These findings establish a proof-of-concept for our approach to computationally design control strategies and provide insights into how gene regulatory networks govern phenotype. ",

TeNPs exhibit unique properties such as the strengthening of covalent bonds within telluric chains and the disruption of secondary structure leading to the separation of these chains. This is analogous to increased cohesion within social groups and disruption of information flow between different subgroups, respectively. . Similarly, the outstanding properties of graphene, such as high electrical conductivity, strength, and flexibility, provide additional aspects for understanding the resilience and adaptability of social structures in response to external stimuli such as fake news. This research note proposes a novel metaphorical framework for analyzing the spread of fake news within social groups, analogous to the structural features of telluric nanoparticles (TeNPs).

Accurate detection of the phases of the gait in real-time is crucial to control lower-limb assistive devices like exoskeletons and prostheses. There are several ways to detect the walking gait phase, ranging from cameras and depth sensors to the sensors attached to the device itself or the human body. Electromyography (EMG) is one of the input methods that has captured lots of attention due to its precision and time delay between neuromuscular activity and muscle movement. This study proposes a few Machine Learning (ML) based models on lower-limb EMG data for human walking. The proposed models are based on Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). The traditional ML models are trained on hand-crafted features or their reduced components using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). On the contrary, the DCNN model utilises convolutional layers to extract features from raw data. The results show up to 75% average accuracy for traditional ML models and 79% for Deep Learning (DL) model. The highest achieved accuracy in 50 trials of the training DL model is 89.5%. ",

    "abstract": "The integration of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on brain signal analysis is still in its nascent stages compared to their success in fields like Computer Vision, especially in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), where the brain activity is decoded to control external devices without requiring muscle control. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely adopted choice for designing BCI systems due to its non-invasive and cost-effective nature and excellent temporal resolution. Still, it comes at the expense of limited training data, poor signal-to-noise, and a large variability across and within-subject recordings. Finally, setting up a BCI system with many electrodes takes a long time, hindering the widespread adoption of reliable DL architectures in BCIs outside research laboratories. To improve adoption, we need to improve user comfort using, for instance, reliable algorithms that operate with few electrodes. \\textbf{Approach:} Our research aims to develop a DL algorithm that delivers effective results with a limited number of electrodes. Taking advantage of the Augmented Covariance Method with SPDNet, we propose the SPDNet$_{\\psi}$ architecture and analyze its performance and computational impact, as well as the interpretability of the results. The evaluation is conducted on 5-fold cross-validation, using only three electrodes positioned above the Motor Cortex. The methodology was tested on nearly 100 subjects from several open-source datasets using the Mother Of All BCI Benchmark (MOABB) framework. \\textbf{Main results:} The results of our SPDNet$_{\\psi}$ demonstrate that the augmented approach combined with the SPDNet significantly outperforms all the current state-of-the-art DL architecture in MI decoding. \\textbf{Significance:} This new architecture is explainable, with a low number of trainable parameters and a reduced carbon footprint.

    "abstract": "Clustering data objects into homogeneous groups is one of the most important tasks in data mining. Spectral clustering is arguably one of the most important algorithms for clustering, as it is appealing for its theoretical soundness and is adaptable to many real-world data settings. For example, mixed data, where the data is composed of numerical and categorical features, is typically handled via numerical discretization, dummy coding, or similarity computation that takes into account both data types. This paper explores a more natural way to incorporate both numerical and categorical information into the spectral clustering algorithm, avoiding the need for data preprocessing or the use of sophisticated similarity functions. We propose adding extra nodes corresponding to the different categories the data may belong to and show that it leads to an interpretable clustering objective function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this simple framework leads to a linear-time spectral clustering algorithm for categorical-only data. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithms against other related methods and show that it provides a competitive alternative to them in terms of performance and runtime. ",

    "abstract": "Network diffusion models are used to study things like disease transmission, information spread, and technology adoption. However, small amounts of mismeasurement are extremely likely in the networks constructed to operationalize these models. We show that estimates of diffusions are highly non-robust to this measurement error. First, we show that even when measurement error is vanishingly small, such that the share of missed links is close to zero, forecasts about the extent of diffusion will greatly underestimate the truth. Second, a small mismeasurement in the identity of the initial seed generates a large shift in the locations of expected diffusion path. We show that both of these results still hold when the vanishing measurement error is only local in nature. Such non-robustness in forecasting exists even under conditions where the basic reproductive number is consistently estimable. Possible solutions, such as estimating the measurement error or implementing widespread detection efforts, still face difficulties because the number of missed links are so small. Finally, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations on simulated networks, and real networks from three settings: travel data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the western US, a mobile phone marketing campaign in rural India, and in an insurance experiment in China.

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are highly flexible predictive models. However, reliably quantifying uncertainty for their predictions is a continuing challenge. There has been much recent work on \"recalibration\" of predictive distributions for ANNs, so that forecast probabilities for events of interest are consistent with certain frequency evaluations of them. Uncalibrated probabilistic forecasts are of limited use for many important decision-making tasks. To address this issue, we propose a localized recalibration of ANN predictive distributions using the dimension-reduced representation of the input provided by the ANN hidden layers. Our novel method draws inspiration from recalibration techniques used in the literature on approximate Bayesian computation and likelihood-free inference methods. Most existing calibration methods for ANNs can be thought of as calibrating either on the input layer, which is difficult when the input is high-dimensional, or the output layer, which may not be sufficiently flexible. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that our method has good performance compared to alternative approaches, and explore the benefits that can be achieved by localizing the calibration based on different layers of the network. Finally, we apply our proposed method to a diamond price prediction problem, demonstrating the potential of our approach to improve prediction and uncertainty quantification in real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Nowadays human interactions largely take place on social networks, with online users' behavior often falling into a few general typologies or \"social roles\". Among these, opinion leaders are of crucial importance as they have the ability to spread an idea or opinion on a large scale across the network, with possible tangible consequences in the real world. In this work we extract and characterize the different social roles of users within the Reddit WallStreetBets community, around the time of the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021 -- when a handful of committed users led the whole community to engage in a large and risky financial operation. We identify the profiles of both average users and of relevant outliers, including opinion leaders, using an iterative, semi-supervised classification algorithm, which allows us to discern the characteristics needed to play a particular social role. The key features of opinion leaders are large risky investments and constant updates on a single stock, which allowed them to attract a large following and, in the case of GameStop, ignite the interest of the community. Finally, we observe a substantial change in the behavior and attitude of users after the short squeeze event: no new opinion leaders are found and the community becomes less focused on investments. Overall, this work sheds light on the users' roles and dynamics that led to the GameStop short squeeze, while also suggesting why WallStreetBets no longer wielded such large influence on financial markets, in the aftermath of this event.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework termed CausalCellSegmenter, which combines Causal Inference Module (CIM) with Diversified Aggregation Convolution (DAC) techniques. The DAC module is designed which incorporates diverse downsampling features through a simple, parameter-free attention module (SimAM), aiming to overcome the problems of false-positive identification and edge blurring. Furthermore, we introduce CIM to leverage sample weighting by directly removing the spurious correlations between features for every input sample and concentrating more on the correlation between features and labels.

    "abstract": "The combination of electronic health records (EHR) and medical images is crucial for clinicians in making diagnoses and forecasting prognosis. Strategically fusing these two data modalities has great potential to improve the accuracy of machine learning models in clinical prediction tasks. However, the asynchronous and complementary nature of EHR and medical images presents unique challenges. Missing modalities due to clinical and administrative factors are inevitable in practice, and the significance of each data modality varies depending on the patient and the prediction target, resulting in inconsistent predictions and suboptimal model performance. To address these challenges, we propose DrFuse to achieve effective clinical multi-modal fusion. It tackles the missing modality issue by disentangling the features shared across modalities and those unique within each modality. Furthermore, we address the modal inconsistency issue via a disease-wise attention layer that produces the patient- and disease-wise weighting for each modality to make the final prediction. We validate the proposed method using real-world large-scale datasets, MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/dorothy-yao/drfuse. ",

    "abstract": "User financial default prediction plays a critical role in credit risk forecasting and management. It aims at predicting the probability that the user will fail to make the repayments in the future. Previous methods mainly extract a set of user individual features regarding his own profiles and behaviors and build a binary-classification model to make default predictions. However, these methods cannot get satisfied results, especially for users with limited information. Although recent efforts suggest that default prediction can be improved by social relations, they fail to capture the higher-order topology structure at the level of small subgraph patterns. In this paper, we fill in this gap by proposing a motif-preserving Graph Neural Network with curriculum learning (MotifGNN) to jointly learn the lower-order structures from the original graph and higherorder structures from multi-view motif-based graphs for financial default prediction. Specifically, to solve the problem of weak connectivity in motif-based graphs, we design the motif-based gating mechanism. It utilizes the information learned from the original graph with good connectivity to strengthen the learning of the higher-order structure. And considering that the motif patterns of different samples are highly unbalanced, we propose a curriculum learning mechanism on the whole learning process to more focus on the samples with uncommon motif distributions. Extensive experiments on one public dataset and two industrial datasets all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

We categorize all possible causal relationships between two random variables into the following four categories and aim to identify one from observed data: two cases in which either of the direct causality exists, a case that variables are independent, and a case that variables are confounded by latent confounders. Although existing methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, they require unobserved variables to satisfy assumptions on the form of their equation models. In our previous study (Kobayashi et al., 2022), the first causal discovery method without such assumptions is proposed for discrete data and named CLOUD. Using Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) Code, CLOUD selects a model that yields the minimum codelength of the observed data from a set of model candidates. This paper extends CLOUD to apply for various data types across discrete, mixed, and continuous. We not only performed theoretical analysis to show the consistency of CLOUD in terms of the model selection, but also demonstrated that CLOUD is more effective than existing methods in inferring causal relationships by extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.

However, the fMRI-based image reconstruction methods are difficult to widely applied because of the complexity and high cost of the acquisition equipments. Considering the advantages of low cost and easy portability of the electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition equipments, we propose a novel image reconstruction method based on EEG signals in this paper. Firstly, to satisfy the high recognizability of visual stimulus images in fast switching manner, we build a visual stimuli image dataset, and obtain the EEG dataset by a corresponding EEG signals collection experiment. Secondly, the deep visual representation model(DVRM) consisting of a primary encoder and a subordinate decoder is proposed to reconstruct visual stimuli. The encoder is designed based on the residual-in-residual dense blocks to learn the distribution characteristics between EEG signals and visual stimulus images, while the decoder is designed based on the deep neural network to reconstruct the visual stimulus image from the learned deep visual representation. The DVRM can fit the deep and multiview visual features of human natural state and make the reconstructed images more precise. Finally, we evaluate the DVRM in the quality of the generated images on our EEG dataset. The results show that the DVRM have good performance in the task of learning deep visual representation from EEG signals and generating reconstructed images that are realistic and highly resemble the original images.

The question whether $3$-Coloring is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$2$ graphs is a well-known open problem.

We prove that for $k\\geq 2$, the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$(k+1)$ graphs -- note that such a result for $k=1$ would be precisely a polynomial-time algorithm for $3$-Coloring of diameter-$2$ graphs. Furthermore, we give subexponential-time algorithms for diameter-$(k+2)$ and -$(k+3)$ graphs. We complement these results with a lower bound for diameter-$(2k+2)$ graphs -- in this class of graphs the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem is NP-hard and cannot be solved in subexponential-time, unless the ETH fails.

In this paper, in order to reserve high generalization while improving robustness, we proposed a dynamic perturbation-adaptive adversarial training (DPAAT) method, which placed AT in a dynamic learning environment to generate adaptive data-level perturbations and provided a dynamically updated criterion by loss information collections to handle the disadvantage of fixed perturbation sizes in conventional AT methods and the dependence on external transference. Comprehensive testing on dermatology HAM10000 dataset showed that the DPAAT not only achieved better robustness improvement and generalization preservation but also significantly enhanced mean average precision and interpretability on various CNNs, indicating its great potential as a generic adversarial training method on the MIC.

Accurately forecasting CTh trajectories can significantly enhance early diagnosis and intervention strategies, providing timely care. However, the longitudinal data essential for these studies often suffer from temporal sparsity and incompleteness, presenting substantial challenges in modeling the disease's progression accurately. Existing methods are limited, focusing primarily on datasets without missing entries or requiring predefined assumptions about CTh progression. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a conditional score-based diffusion model specifically designed to generate CTh trajectories with the given baseline information, such as age, sex, and initial diagnosis. Our conditional diffusion model utilizes all available data during the training phase to make predictions based solely on baseline information during inference without needing prior history about CTh progression. The prediction accuracy of the proposed CTh prediction pipeline using a conditional score-based model was compared for sub-groups consisting of cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and AD subjects. The Bland-Altman analysis shows our diffusion-based prediction model has a near-zero bias with narrow 95% confidential interval compared to the ground-truth CTh in 6-36 months. In addition, our conditional diffusion model has a stochastic generative nature, therefore, we demonstrated an uncertainty analysis of patient-specific CTh prediction through multiple realizations.

    "title": "Applicability of oculomics for individual risk prediction: Repeatability  and robustness of retinal Fractal Dimension using DART and AutoMorph",
    "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate whether Fractal Dimension (FD)-based oculomics could be used for individual risk prediction by evaluating repeatability and robustness. Methods: We used two datasets: Caledonia, healthy adults imaged multiple times in quick succession for research (26 subjects, 39 eyes, 377 colour fundus images), and GRAPE, glaucoma patients with baseline and follow-up visits (106 subjects, 196 eyes, 392 images). Mean follow-up time was 18.3 months in GRAPE, thus it provides a pessimistic lower-bound as vasculature could change. FD was computed with DART and AutoMorph. Image quality was assessed with QuickQual, but no images were initially excluded. Pearson, Spearman, and Intraclass Correlation (ICC) were used for population-level repeatability. For individual-level repeatability, we introduce measurement noise parameter {\\lambda} which is within-eye Standard Deviation (SD) of FD measurements in units of between-eyes SD. Results: In Caledonia, ICC was 0.8153 for DART and 0.5779 for AutoMorph, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and last image) 0.7857/0.7824 for DART, and 0.3933/0.6253 for AutoMorph. In GRAPE, Pearson/Spearman correlation (first and next visit) was 0.7479/0.7474 for DART, and 0.7109/0.7208 for AutoMorph (all p<0.0001). Median {\\lambda} in Caledonia without exclusions was 3.55\\% for DART and 12.65\\% for AutoMorph, and improved to up to 1.67\\% and 6.64\\% with quality-based exclusions, respectively. Quality exclusions primarily mitigated large outliers. Worst quality in an eye correlated strongly with {\\lambda} (Pearson 0.5350-0.7550, depending on dataset and method, all p<0.0001). Conclusions: Repeatability was sufficient for individual-level predictions in heterogeneous populations. DART performed better on all metrics and might be able to detect small, longitudinal changes, highlighting the potential of robust methods. ",

    "title": "Accurate Crystal Structure Prediction of New 2D Hybrid Organic Inorganic  Perovskites",
    "abstract": "Low dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) represent a promising class of electronically active materials for both light absorption and emission. The design space of HOIPs is extremely large, since a diverse space of organic cations can be combined with different inorganic frameworks. This immense design space allows for tunable electronic and mechanical properties, but also necessitates the development of new tools for in silico high throughput analysis of candidate structures. In this work, we present an accurate, efficient, transferable and widely applicable machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) for predicting the structure of new 2D HOIPs. Using the MACE architecture, an MLIP is trained on 86 diverse experimentally reported HOIP structures. The model is tested on 73 unseen perovskite compositions, and achieves chemical accuracy with respect to the reference electronic structure method. Our model is then combined with a simple random structure search algorithm to predict the structure of hypothetical HOIPs given only the proposed composition. Success is demonstrated by correctly and reliably recovering the crystal structure of a set of experimentally known 2D perovskites. Such a random structure search is impossible with ab initio methods due to the associated computational cost, but is relatively inexpensive with the MACE potential. Finally, the procedure is used to predict the structure formed by a new organic cation with no previously known corresponding perovskite. Laboratory synthesis of the new hybrid perovskite confirms the accuracy of our prediction. This capability, applied at scale, enables efficient screening of thousands of combinations of organic cations and inorganic layers. ",
