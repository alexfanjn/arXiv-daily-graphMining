    "title": "Improved Forecasting Using a PSO-RDV Framework to Enhance Artificial  Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Decision making and planning have long relied heavily on AI-driven forecasts. The government and the general public are working to minimize the risks while maximizing benefits in the face of potential future public health uncertainties. This study used an improved method of forecasting utilizing the Random Descending Velocity Inertia Weight (RDV IW) technique to improve the convergence of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the accuracy of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The IW technique, inspired by the motions of a golf ball, modified the particles' velocities as they approached the solution point to a parabolically descending structure. Simulation results revealed that the proposed forecasting model with [0.4, 0.9] combination of alpha and alpha_dump exhibits a 6.36% improvement in position error and 11.75% improvement in computational time compared to the old model, thus, improving its convergence. It reached the optimum level at minimal steps with 12.50% improvement as against the old model since it provides better velocity averages when speed stabilization occurs at the 24th iteration. Meanwhile, the computed p-values for NRMSE (0.04889174), MAE (0.02829063), MAPE (0.02226053), WAPE (0.01701545), and R2 (0.00000021) of the proposed algorithm are less than the set 0.05 level of significance, thus the values indicated a significant result in terms of accuracy performance. Applying the modified ANN-PSO using RDV IW technique greatly improved the new HIV/AIDS forecasting model compared with the two models. ",

    "abstract": "The parametric constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection algorithms which are based on various statistical distributions, such as Gaussian, Gamma, Weibull, log-normal, G0 distribution, alpha-stable distribution, etc, are most widely used to detect the ship targets in SAR image at present. However, the clutter background in SAR images is complicated and variable. When the actual clutter background deviates from the assumed statistical distribution, the performance of the parametric CFAR detector will deteriorate. In addition to the parametric CFAR schemes, there is another class of nonparametric CFAR detectors which can maintain a constant false alarm rate for the target detection without the assumption of a known clutter distribution. In this work, the Wilcoxon nonparametric CFAR scheme for ship detection in SAR image is proposed and analyzed, and a closed form of the false alarm rate for the Wilcoxon nonparametric detector to determine the decision threshold is presented. By comparison with several typical parametric CFAR schemes on Radarsat-2, ICEYE-X6 and Gaofen-3 SAR images, the robustness of the Wilcoxon nonparametric detector to maintain a good false alarm performance in different detection backgrounds is revealed, and its detection performance for the weak ship in rough sea surface is improved to some extent. Moreover, the Wilcoxon nonparametric detector can suppress the false alarms resulting from the sidelobes at some degree and its detection speed is fast. ",

    "title": "Multi-objective Optimal Roadside Units Deployment in Urban Vehicular  Networks",
    "abstract": "The significance of transportation efficiency, safety, and related services is increasing in urban vehicular networks. Within such networks, roadside units (RSUs) serve as intermediates in facilitating communication. Therefore, the deployment of RSUs is of utmost importance in ensuring the quality of communication services. However, the optimization objectives, such as time delay and deployment cost, are commonly developed from diverse perspectives. As a result, it is possible that conflicts may arise among the objectives. Furthermore, in urban environments, the presence of various obstacles, such as buildings, gardens, lakes, and other infrastructure, poses challenges for the deployment of RSUs. Hence, the deployment encounters significant difficulties due to the existence of multiple objectives, constraints imposed by obstacles, and the necessity to explore a large-scale optimization space. To address this issue, two versions of multi-objective optimization algorithms are proposed in this paper. By utilizing a multi-population strategy and an adaptive exploration technique, the methods efficiently explore a large-scale decision-variable space. In order to mitigate the issue of an overcrowded deployment of RSUs, a calibrating mechanism is adopted to adjust RSU density during the optimization procedures. The proposed methods also take care of data offloading between vehicles and RSUs by setting up an iterative best response sequence game (IBRSG). By comparing the proposed algorithms with several state-of-the-art algorithms, the results demonstrate that our strategies perform better in both high-density and low-density urban scenarios. The results also indicate that the proposed solutions substantially improve the efficiency of vehicular networks. ",

    "abstract": "As a paradigmatic model for nonlinear dynamics studies, the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) demonstrates a high susceptibility to external disturbances owing to its intricate structure. This paper delves into the challenge of modulating HNN dynamics through time-variant stimuli. The effects of adjustments using two distinct types of time-variant stimuli, namely the Weight Matrix Stimulus (WMS) and the State Variable Stimulus (SVS), along with a Constant Stimulus (CS) are reported. The findings reveal that deploying four WMSs enables the HNN to generate either a four-scroll or a coexisting two-scroll attractor. When combined with one SVS, four WMSs can lead to the formation of an eight-scroll or four-scroll attractor, while the integration of four WMSs and multiple SVSs can induce grid-multi-scroll attractors. Moreover, the introduction of a CS and an SVS can significantly disrupt the dynamic behavior of the HNN. Consequently, suitable adjustment methods are crucial for enhancing the network's dynamics, whereas inappropriate applications can lead to the loss of its chaotic characteristics. To empirically validate these enhancement effects, the study employs an FPGA hardware platform. Subsequently, an image encryption scheme is designed to demonstrate the practical application benefits of the dynamically adjusted HNN in secure multimedia communication. This exploration into the dynamic modulation of HNN via time-variant stimuli offers insightful contributions to the advancement of secure communication technologies. ",

    "abstract": "We consider contextual bandits with graph feedback, a class of interactive learning problems with richer structures than vanilla contextual bandits, where taking an action reveals the rewards for all neighboring actions in the feedback graph under all contexts. Unlike the multi-armed bandits setting where a growing literature has painted a near-complete understanding of graph feedback, much remains unexplored in the contextual bandits counterpart. In this paper, we make inroads into this inquiry by establishing a regret lower bound $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\beta_M(G) T})$, where $M$ is the number of contexts, $G$ is the feedback graph, and $\\beta_M(G)$ is our proposed graph-theoretical quantity that characterizes the fundamental learning limit for this class of problems. Interestingly, $\\beta_M(G)$ interpolates between $\\alpha(G)$ (the independence number of the graph) and $\\mathsf{m}(G)$ (the maximum acyclic subgraph (MAS) number of the graph) as the number of contexts $M$ varies. We also provide algorithms that achieve near-optimal regrets for important classes of context sequences and/or feedback graphs, such as transitively closed graphs that find applications in auctions and inventory control. In particular, with many contexts, our results show that the MAS number completely characterizes the statistical complexity for contextual bandits, as opposed to the independence number in multi-armed bandits.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great breakthroughs in many fields such as image classification and natural language processing. However, the execution of DNNs needs to conduct massive numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations on hardware and thus incurs a large power consumption. To address this challenge, we propose a novel digital MAC design based on encoding. In this new design, the multipliers are replaced by simple logic gates to project the results onto a wide bit representation. These bits carry individual position weights, which can be trained for specific neural networks to enhance inference accuracy. The outputs of the new multipliers are added by bit-wise weighted accumulation and the accumulation results are compatible with existing computing platforms accelerating neural networks with either uniform or non-uniform quantization. Since the multiplication function is replaced by simple logic projection, the critical paths in the resulting circuits become much shorter. Correspondingly, pipelining stages in the MAC array can be reduced, leading to a significantly smaller area as well as a better power efficiency. The proposed design has been synthesized and verified by ResNet18-Cifar10, ResNet20-Cifar100 and ResNet50-ImageNet. The experimental results confirmed the reduction of circuit area by up to 79.63% and the reduction of power consumption of executing DNNs by up to 70.18%, while the accuracy of the neural networks can still be well maintained.

    "abstract": "Fully decentralized learning is gaining momentum for training AI models at the Internet's edge, addressing infrastructure challenges and privacy concerns. In a decentralized machine learning system, data is distributed across multiple nodes, with each node training a local model based on its respective dataset. The local models are then shared and combined to form a global model capable of making accurate predictions on new data. Our exploration focuses on how different types of network structures influence the spreading of knowledge - the process by which nodes incorporate insights gained from learning patterns in data available on other nodes across the network. Specifically, this study investigates the intricate interplay between network structure and learning performance using three network topologies and six data distribution methods. These methods consider different vertex properties, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficient, along with whether nodes exhibit high or low values of these metrics. Our findings underscore the significance of global centrality metrics (degree, betweenness) in correlating with learning performance, while local clustering proves less predictive. We highlight the challenges in transferring knowledge from peripheral to central nodes, attributed to a dilution effect during model aggregation. Additionally, we observe that central nodes exert a pull effect, facilitating the spread of knowledge. In examining degree distribution, hubs in Barabasi-Albert networks positively impact learning for central nodes but exacerbate dilution when knowledge originates from peripheral nodes. Finally, we demonstrate the formidable challenge of knowledge circulation outside of segregated communities. ",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive generative performance in terms of both sampling quality and distribution coverage. Accordingly, proposals are made for sharing pre-trained diffusion models across different organizations, as a way of improving data utilization while enhancing privacy protection by avoiding sharing private data directly. However, the potential risks associated with such an approach have not been comprehensively examined. In this paper, we take an adversarial perspective to investigate the potential privacy and fairness risks associated with the sharing of diffusion models. Specifically, we investigate the circumstances in which one party (the sharer) trains a diffusion model using private data and provides another party (the receiver) black-box access to the pre-trained model for downstream tasks. We demonstrate that the sharer can execute fairness poisoning attacks to undermine the receiver's downstream models by manipulating the training data distribution of the diffusion model. Meanwhile, the receiver can perform property inference attacks to reveal the distribution of sensitive features in the sharer's dataset. Our experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate remarkable attack performance on different types of diffusion models, which highlights the critical importance of robust data auditing and privacy protection protocols in pertinent applications.

This study presents LeukoGraph, a recently developed framework designed explicitly for this purpose employing graph attention networks (GATs) to navigate hierarchical classification (HC) complexities. Notably, LeukoGraph stands as a pioneering effort, marking the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) for hierarchical inference on graphs, accommodating up to one million nodes and millions of edges, all derived from flow cytometry data. LeukoGraph intricately addresses a classification paradigm where for example four different cell populations undergo flat categorization, while a fifth diverges into two distinct child branches, exemplifying the nuanced hierarchical structure inherent in complex datasets. The technique is more general than this example. A hallmark achievement of LeukoGraph is its F-score of 98%, significantly outclassing prevailing state-of-the-art methodologies. Crucially, LeukoGraph's prowess extends beyond theoretical innovation, showcasing remarkable precision in predicting both flat and hierarchical cell types across flow cytometry datasets from 30 distinct patients. This precision is further underscored by LeukoGraph's ability to maintain a correct label ratio, despite the inherent challenges posed by hierarchical classifications. ",

This ETF geometry is equivalent to vanishing within-class variability of the last layer activations. Inspired by NC properties, we explore in this paper the transferability of DNN models trained with their last layer weight fixed according to ETF. This enforces class separation by eliminating class covariance information, effectively providing implicit regularization. We show that DNN models trained with such a fixed classifier significantly improve transfer performance, particularly on out-of-domain datasets. On a broad range of fine-grained image classification datasets, our approach outperforms i) baseline methods that do not perform any covariance regularization (up to 22%), as well as ii) methods that explicitly whiten covariance of activations throughout training (up to 19%). Our findings suggest that DNNs trained with fixed ETF classifiers offer a powerful mechanism for improving transfer learning across domains. ",

In this study, we introduce a novel approach that uses unsupervised learning techniques to estimate the exploited level of each trajectory from the offline dataset of zero-sum games made by diverse demonstrators. Subsequently, we incorporate the estimated exploited level into the offline learning to maximize the influence of the dominant strategy. Our method enables interpretable exploited level estimation in multiple zero-sum games and effectively identifies dominant strategy data. Also, our exploited level augmented offline learning significantly enhances the original offline learning algorithms including imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning for zero-sum games.

However, the effectiveness of these approaches highly relies on the choice of CBFs. Inspired by the universal approximation power of neural networks, there is a growing trend toward representing CBFs using neural networks, leading to the notion of neural CBFs (NCBFs). Current NCBFs, however, are trained and deployed in benign environments, making them ineffective for scenarios where robotic systems experience sensor faults and attacks. In this paper, we study safety-critical control synthesis for robotic systems under sensor faults and attacks. Our main contribution is the development and synthesis of a new class of CBFs that we term fault tolerant neural control barrier function (FT-NCBF). We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for FT-NCBFs to guarantee safety, and develop a data-driven method to learn FT-NCBFs by minimizing a loss function constructed using the derived conditions. Using the learned FT-NCBF, we synthesize a control input and formally prove the safety guarantee provided by our approach.

To address this problem, we propose RORA, a Robust free-text Rationale evaluation against label leakage. RORA quantifies the new information supplied by a rationale to justify the label. This is achieved by assessing the conditional V-information \\citep{hewitt-etal-2021-conditional} with a predictive family robust against leaky features that can be exploited by a small model. RORA consistently outperforms existing approaches in evaluating human-written, synthetic, or model-generated rationales, particularly demonstrating robustness against label leakage.

Inspired by the human visual system, which first discerns the boundaries of ambiguous regions (i.e., hard regions) before delving into the semantic meaning, we propose a novel loss function, Spatial Coherence Loss (SCLoss), that uses the mutual response between adjacent pixels to suppress or emphasize the single-response of pixels. We demonstrate that the proposed SCLoss can gradually learn the hard regions by detecting and emphasizing their boundaries. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that replacing popular loss functions with SCLoss can improve the performance of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) salient or camouflaged object detection (SOD or COD) models. We also demonstrate that combining SCLoss with other loss functions can further improve performance and result in the SOTA outcomes for different applications. Finally, as a demonstrative example of the potential uses for other related tasks, we show an application of SCLoss for semantic segmentation. ",

The need to identify backdoors in biometric scenarios has led us to propose a novel technique with different trade-offs. In this paper we propose to use model pairs on open-set classification tasks for detecting backdoors. Using a simple linear operation to project embeddings from a probe model's embedding space to a reference model's embedding space, we can compare both embeddings and compute a similarity score. We show that this score, can be an indicator for the presence of a backdoor despite models being of different architectures, having been trained independently and on different datasets. Additionally, we show that backdoors can be detected even when both models are backdoored. The source code is made available for reproducibility purposes. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel distributed algorithm (herein called MaxCUCL) designed to guarantee that max-consensus is reached in networks characterized by unreliable communication links (i.e., links suffering from packet drops). Our proposed algorithm is the first algorithm that achieves max-consensus in a deterministic manner (i.e., nodes always calculate the maximum of their states regardless of the nature of the probability distribution of the packet drops). Furthermore, it allows nodes to determine whether convergence has been achieved (enabling them to transition to subsequent tasks). The operation of MaxCUCL relies on the deployment of narrowband error-free feedback channels used for acknowledging whether a packet transmission between nodes was successful. We analyze the operation of our algorithm and show that it converges after a finite number of time steps. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness and practical applicability by applying it to a sensor network deployed for environmental monitoring. ",

    "abstract": "Management and mission planning over a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remains to date as a challenging research trend in what regards to this particular type of aircrafts. These vehicles are controlled by a number of ground control station (GCS), from which they are commanded to cooperatively perform different tasks in specific geographic areas of interest. Mathematically the problem of coordinating and assigning tasks to a swarm of UAV can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem, whose complexity and multiple conflicting criteria has hitherto motivated the adoption of multi-objective solvers such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). The encoding approach consists of different alleles representing the decision variables, whereas the fitness function checks that all constraints are fulfilled, minimizing the optimization criteria of the problem. In problems of high complexity involving several tasks, UAV and GCS, where the space of search is huge compared to the space of valid solutions, the convergence rate of the algorithm increases significantly. To overcome this issue, this work proposes a weighted random generator for the creation and mutation of new individuals. The main objective of this work is to reduce the convergence rate of the MOEA solver for multi-UAV mission planning using weighted random strategies that focus the search on potentially better regions of the solution space. Extensive experimental results over a diverse range of scenarios evince the benefits of the proposed approach, which notably improves this convergence rate with respect to a na\\\"ive MOEA approach.

Water limiting stress, i.e. drought, emerges as a significant risk for soybean production, underscoring the need for advancements in stress monitoring for crop breeding and production. This project combines multi-modal information to identify the most effective and efficient automated methods to investigate drought response. We investigated a set of diverse soybean accessions using multiple sensors in a time series high-throughput phenotyping manner to: (1) develop a pipeline for rapid classification of soybean drought stress symptoms, and (2) investigate methods for early detection of drought stress. We utilized high-throughput time-series phenotyping using UAVs and sensors in conjunction with machine learning (ML) analytics, which offered a swift and efficient means of phenotyping. The red-edge and green bands were most effective to classify canopy wilting stress. The Red-Edge Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (RECI) successfully differentiated susceptible and tolerant soybean accessions prior to visual symptom development. We report pre-visual detection of soybean wilting using a combination of different vegetation indices. These results can contribute to early stress detection methodologies and rapid classification of drought responses in screening nurseries for breeding and production applications. ",

    "abstract": "In a ring-signature-based anonymous cryptocurrency, signers of a transaction are hidden among a set of potential signers, called a ring, whose size is much smaller than the number of all users. The ring-membership relations specified by the sets of transactions thus induce bipartite transaction graphs, whose distribution is in turn induced by the ring sampler underlying the cryptocurrency. Since efficient graph analysis could be performed on transaction graphs to potentially deanonymise signers, it is crucial to understand the resistance of (the transaction graphs induced by) a ring sampler against graph analysis. Of particular interest is the class of partitioning ring samplers. Although previous works showed that they provide almost optimal local anonymity, their resistance against global, e.g. graph-based, attacks were unclear. In this work, we analyse transaction graphs induced by partitioning ring samplers. Specifically, we show (partly analytically and partly empirically) that, somewhat surprisingly, by setting the ring size to be at least logarithmic in the number of users, a graph-analysing adversary is no better than the one that performs random guessing in deanonymisation up to constant factor of 2.

    "abstract": "Underpinning the past decades of work on the design, initialization, and optimization of neural networks is a seemingly innocuous assumption: that the network is trained on a \\textit{stationary} data distribution. In settings where this assumption is violated, e.g.\\ deep reinforcement learning, learning algorithms become unstable and brittle with respect to hyperparameters and even random seeds. One factor driving this instability is the loss of plasticity, meaning that updating the network's predictions in response to new information becomes more difficult as training progresses. While many recent works provide analyses and partial solutions to this phenomenon, a fundamental question remains unanswered: to what extent do known mechanisms of plasticity loss overlap, and how can mitigation strategies be combined to best maintain the trainability of a network? This paper addresses these questions, showing that loss of plasticity can be decomposed into multiple independent mechanisms and that, while intervening on any single mechanism is insufficient to avoid the loss of plasticity in all cases, intervening on multiple mechanisms in conjunction results in highly robust learning algorithms. We show that a combination of layer normalization and weight decay is highly effective at maintaining plasticity in a variety of synthetic nonstationary learning tasks, and further demonstrate its effectiveness on naturally arising nonstationarities, including reinforcement learning in the Arcade Learning Environment.

This paper presents \\textbf{X-ResQ}, a QA-based MIMO detector system featuring fine-grained quantum task parallelism that is uniquely enabled by the Reverse Annealing (RA) protocol. Unlike prior designs, X-ResQ has many desirable system properties for a parallel QA detector and has effectively improved detection performance as more qubits are assigned.

To mitigate this deficiency, we propose a novel adversarial defense method called \"Immunity\" (Innovative MoE with MUtual information \\& positioN stabilITY) based on a modified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in this work. The key enhancements to the standard MoE are two-fold: 1) integrating of Random Switch Gates (RSGs) to obtain diverse network structures via random permutation of RSG parameters at evaluation time, despite of RSGs being determined after one-time training; 2) devising innovative Mutual Information (MI)-based and Position Stability-based loss functions by capitalizing on Grad-CAM's explanatory power to increase the diversity and the causality of expert networks. Notably, our MI-based loss operates directly on the heatmaps, thereby inducing subtler negative impacts on the classification performance when compared to other losses of the same type, theoretically. Extensive evaluation validates the efficacy of the proposed approach in improving adversarial robustness against a wide range of attacks. ",

It has been empirically confirmed that the multimer structure prediction~(MSP) can be well handled in a step-wise assembly fashion using provided dimer structures and predicted protein-protein interactions~(PPIs). However, due to the biological gap in the formation of dimers and larger multimers, directly applying PPI prediction techniques can often cause a \\textit{poor generalization} to the MSP task.

Many BCSD solutions have been proposed recently, which mostly are embedding-based, but have shown limited accuracy and efficiency especially when the volume of target binaries to search is large. To address this issue, we propose a cost-effective BCSD framework, CEBin, which fuses embedding-based and comparison-based approaches to significantly improve accuracy while minimizing overheads. Specifically, CEBin utilizes a refined embedding-based approach to extract features of target code, which efficiently narrows down the scope of candidate similar code and boosts performance. Then, it utilizes a comparison-based approach that performs a pairwise comparison on the candidates to capture more nuanced and complex relationships, which greatly improves the accuracy of similarity detection. By bridging the gap between embedding-based and comparison-based approaches, CEBin is able to provide an effective and efficient solution for detecting similar code (including vulnerable ones) in large-scale software ecosystems. Experimental results on three well-known datasets demonstrate the superiority of CEBin over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. To further evaluate the usefulness of BCSD in real world, we construct a large-scale benchmark of vulnerability, offering the first precise evaluation scheme to assess BCSD methods for the 1-day vulnerability detection task. CEBin could identify the similar function from millions of candidate functions in just a few seconds and achieves an impressive recall rate of $85.46\\%$ on this more practical but challenging task, which are several order of magnitudes faster and $4.07\\times$ better than the best SOTA baseline.

Traditional methods relying on Gaussian processes can hardly scale to high-dimensional data. Deep learning approaches utilize neural network based encoders and decoders to improve scalability.

At the highest fidelity, the representations are decoded with different parameters, making the shared information inherently inaccurate. This hinders inference performance, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios when the highest fidelity data has limited domain coverage. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-fidelity Residual Neural Processes (MFRNP), a novel multi-fidelity surrogate modeling framework. MFRNP optimizes lower fidelity decoders for accurate information sharing by aggregating lower fidelity surrogate outputs and models residual between the aggregation and ground truth on the highest fidelity.

This challenge is particularly evident in personalized healthcare decision-making, where models need to take into account the intricate relationships between patient characteristics, treatment options, and health outcomes.

These models offer greater interpretability than deep neural networks and can encode more complex policies than common models such as decision trees. We show that PNNs can outperform existing methods in both synthetic data experiments and in a case study of assigning treatments for postpartum hypertension. In particular, PNNs are shown to produce policies that could reduce peak blood pressure by 5.47 mm Hg (p=0.02) over existing clinical practice, and by 2 mm Hg (p=0.01) over the next best prescriptive modeling technique. Moreover PNNs were more likely than all other models to correctly identify clinically significant features while existing models relied on potentially dangerous features such as patient insurance information and race that could lead to bias in treatment.

    "abstract": "Recent findings reveal that over-parameterized deep neural networks, trained beyond zero training-error, exhibit a distinctive structural pattern at the final layer, termed as Neural-collapse (NC). These results indicate that the final hidden-layer outputs in such networks display minimal within-class variations over the training set. While existing research extensively investigates this phenomenon under cross-entropy loss, there are fewer studies focusing on its contrastive counterpart, supervised contrastive (SC) loss. Through the lens of NC, this paper employs an analytical approach to study the solutions derived from optimizing the SC loss. We adopt the unconstrained features model (UFM) as a representative proxy for unveiling NC-related phenomena in sufficiently over-parameterized deep networks. We show that, despite the non-convexity of SC loss minimization, all local minima are global minima. Furthermore, the minimizer is unique (up to a rotation). We prove our results by formalizing a tight convex relaxation of the UFM. Finally, through this convex formulation, we delve deeper into characterizing the properties of global solutions under label-imbalanced training data. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL), aimed at leveraging vast distributed datasets, confronts a crucial challenge: the heterogeneity of data across different silos. While previous studies have explored discrete representations to enhance model generalization across minor distributional shifts, these approaches often struggle to adapt to new data silos with significantly divergent distributions. In response, we have identified that models derived from FL exhibit markedly increased uncertainty when applied to data silos with unfamiliar distributions. Consequently, we propose an innovative yet straightforward iterative framework, termed Uncertainty-Based Extensible-Codebook Federated Learning (UEFL). This framework dynamically maps latent features to trainable discrete vectors, assesses the uncertainty, and specifically extends the discretization dictionary or codebook for silos exhibiting high uncertainty. Our approach aims to simultaneously enhance accuracy and reduce uncertainty by explicitly addressing the diversity of data distributions, all while maintaining minimal computational overhead in environments characterized by heterogeneous data silos. Through experiments conducted on five datasets, our method has demonstrated its superiority, achieving significant improvements in accuracy (by 3%--22.1%) and uncertainty reduction (by 38.83%--96.24%), thereby outperforming contemporary state-of-the-art methods.

The ability of agent to comprehend its surroundings plays a crucial role in achieving successful object finding. However, existing knowledge-graph-based navigators often rely on discrete categorical one-hot vectors and vote counting strategy to construct graph representation of the scenes, which results in misalignment with visual images. To provide more accurate and coherent scene descriptions and address this misalignment issue, we propose the Aligning Knowledge Graph with Visual Perception (AKGVP) method for object-goal navigation. Technically, our approach introduces continuous modeling of the hierarchical scene architecture and leverages visual-language pre-training to align natural language description with visual perception. The integration of a continuous knowledge graph architecture and multimodal feature alignment empowers the navigator with a remarkable zero-shot navigation capability. We extensively evaluate our method using the AI2-THOR simulator and conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our navigator.

    "abstract": "Dexterous in-hand manipulation is an essential skill of production and life. Nevertheless, the highly stiff and mutable features of contacts cause limitations to real-time contact discovery and inference, which degrades the performance of model-based methods. Inspired by recent advancements in contact-rich locomotion and manipulation, this paper proposes a novel model-based approach to control dexterous in-hand manipulation and overcome the current limitations. The proposed approach has the attractive feature, which allows the robot to robustly execute long-horizon in-hand manipulation without pre-defined contact sequences or separated planning procedures. Specifically, we design a contact-implicit model predictive controller at high-level to generate real-time contact plans, which are executed by the low-level tracking controller. Compared with other model-based methods, such a long-horizon feature enables replanning and robust execution of contact-rich motions to achieve large-displacement in-hand tasks more efficiently; Compared with existing learning-based methods, the proposed approach achieves the dexterity and also generalizes to different objects without any pre-training. Detailed simulations and ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method. It runs at 20Hz on the 23-degree-of-freedom long-horizon in-hand object rotation task. ",

We design a novel framework, called DIGIC, to identify the causal features by finding the direct cause of the expert action from the demonstration data distribution via causal discovery. Our framework can achieve domain generalizable imitation learning with only single-domain data and serve as a complement for cross-domain variation-based methods under non-structural assumptions on the underlying causal models. Our empirical study in various control tasks shows that the proposed framework evidently improves the domain generalization performance and has comparable performance to the expert in the original domain simultaneously.

However, despite the compelling results achieved by previous research efforts, the exploration of adequate and discriminative heterogeneous feature fusion, as well as the development of fallibility-aware loss functions remains relatively scarce. This paper makes several significant contributions to address these limitations: (1) It presents a novel heterogeneous feature fusion block, comprising a holistic attention module, a heterogeneous feature contrast descriptor, and an affinity-weighted feature recalibrator, enabling a more in-depth exploitation of the inherent characteristics of the extracted features, (2) it incorporates both inter-scale and intra-scale skip connections into the decoder architecture while eliminating redundant ones, leading to both improved accuracy and computational efficiency, and (3) it introduces two fallibility-aware loss functions that separately focus on semantic-transition and depth-inconsistent regions, collectively contributing to greater supervision during model training. Our proposed heterogeneous feature fusion network (SNE-RoadSegV2), which incorporates all these innovative components, demonstrates superior performance in comparison to all other freespace detection algorithms across multiple public datasets.

    "abstract": "Camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection (SOD) are two distinct yet closely-related computer vision tasks widely studied during the past decades. Though sharing the same purpose of segmenting an image into binary foreground and background regions, their distinction lies in the fact that COD focuses on concealed objects hidden in the image, while SOD concentrates on the most prominent objects in the image. Previous works achieved good performance by stacking various hand-designed modules and multi-scale features. However, these carefully-designed complex networks often performed well on one task but not on another. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective network (SENet) based on vision Transformer (ViT), by employing a simple design of an asymmetric ViT-based encoder-decoder structure, we yield competitive results on both tasks, exhibiting greater versatility than meticulously crafted ones. Furthermore, to enhance the Transformer's ability to model local information, which is important for pixel-level binary segmentation tasks, we propose a local information capture module (LICM). We also propose a dynamic weighted loss (DW loss) based on Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and Intersection over Union (IoU) loss, which guides the network to pay more attention to those smaller and more difficult-to-find target objects according to their size. Moreover, we explore the issue of joint training of SOD and COD, and propose a preliminary solution to the conflict in joint training, further improving the performance of SOD. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/SENet. ",

We propose to extend a large-scale speech recognition model for inappropriate pause detection in dysarthric speech. To this end, we propose task design, labeling strategy, and a speech recognition model with an inappropriate pause prediction layer. First, we treat pause detection as speech recognition, using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to convert speech into text with pause tags. According to the newly designed task, we label pause locations at the text level and their appropriateness. We collaborate with speech-language pathologists to establish labeling criteria, ensuring high-quality annotated data. Finally, we extend the ASR model with an inappropriate pause prediction layer for end-to-end inappropriate pause detection. Moreover, we propose a task-tailored metric for evaluating inappropriate pause detection independent of ASR performance. Our experiments show that the proposed method better detects inappropriate pauses in dysarthric speech than baselines. (Inappropriate Pause Error Rate: 14.47%) ",

Existing multi-modality image registration algorithms rely on statistical-based similarity measures or local structural image representations. However, the former is sensitive to locally varying noise, while the latter is not discriminative enough to cope with complex anatomical structures in multimodal scans, causing ambiguity in determining the anatomical correspondence across scans with different modalities. In this paper, we propose a modality-agnostic structural representation learning method, which leverages Deep Neighbourhood Self-similarity (DNS) and anatomy-aware contrastive learning to learn discriminative and contrast-invariance deep structural image representations (DSIR) without the need for anatomical delineations or pre-aligned training images. We evaluate our method on multiphase CT, abdomen MR-CT, and brain MR T1w-T2w registration. Comprehensive results demonstrate that our method is superior to the conventional local structural representation and statistical-based similarity measures in terms of discriminability and accuracy.

However, existing PLM backdoors are conducted with explicit triggers under the manually aligned, thus failing to satisfy expectation goals simultaneously in terms of effectiveness, stealthiness, and universality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to achieve invisible and general backdoor implantation, called \\textbf{Syntactic Ghost} (synGhost for short). Specifically, the method hostilely manipulates poisoned samples with different predefined syntactic structures as stealth triggers and then implants the backdoor to pre-trained representation space without disturbing the primitive knowledge. The output representations of poisoned samples are distributed as uniformly as possible in the feature space via contrastive learning, forming a wide range of backdoors. Additionally, in light of the unique properties of syntactic triggers, we introduce an auxiliary module to drive the PLMs to learn this knowledge in priority, which can alleviate the interference between different syntactic structures. Experiments show that our method outperforms the previous methods and achieves the predefined objectives. Not only do severe threats to various natural language understanding (NLU) tasks on two tuning paradigms but also to multiple PLMs. Meanwhile, the synGhost is imperceptible against three countermeasures based on perplexity, fine-pruning, and the proposed maxEntropy.

Experimental evaluations of WWW demonstrate superior performance in both quantitative and qualitative metrics, outperforming existing methods in interpretability.

Extensive experiments on DOTA and DIOR, two popular datasets, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for object detection in RSIs.

Our permutation invariant model can also handle node features by concatenating them to the eigenvectors of each node. Using the Laplacian spectrum allows us to naturally capture the structural characteristics of the graph and work directly in the node space while avoiding the quadratic complexity bottleneck that limits the applicability of other methods.

However, one lasting issue regarding the discontinuity in Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) representation remains unresolved, which is an inherent bottleneck for extant OOD methods. This paper endeavors to completely solve this issue in a theoretically guaranteed manner and puts an end to the ad-hoc efforts in this direction. Prior studies typically can only address one of the two cases of discontinuity: rotation and aspect ratio, and often inadvertently introduce decoding discontinuity, e.g. Decoding Incompleteness (DI) and Decoding Ambiguity (DA) as discussed in literature. Specifically, we propose a novel representation method called Continuous OBB (COBB), which can be readily integrated into existing detectors e.g. Faster-RCNN as a plugin. It can theoretically ensure continuity in bounding box regression which to our best knowledge, has not been achieved in literature for rectangle-based object representation. For fairness and transparency of experiments, we have developed a modularized benchmark based on the open-source deep learning framework Jittor's detection toolbox JDet for OOD evaluation. On the popular DOTA dataset, by integrating Faster-RCNN as the same baseline model, our new method outperforms the peer method Gliding Vertex by 1.13% mAP50 (relative improvement 1.54%), and 2.46% mAP75 (relative improvement 5.91%), without any tricks.

    "abstract": "Graph neural network-based network intrusion detection systems have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from a reliance on target encoding for data pre-processing, limiting widespread adoption due to the associated need for annotated labels--a cost-prohibitive requirement. In this work, we propose a solution involving in-context pre-training and the utilization of dense representations for categorical features to jointly overcome the label-dependency limitation. Our approach exhibits remarkable data efficiency, achieving over 98% of the performance of the supervised state-of-the-art with less than 4% labeled data on the NF-UQ-NIDS-V2 dataset. ",

    "abstract": "As the role of artificial intelligence becomes increasingly pivotal in modern society, the efficient training and deployment of deep neural networks have emerged as critical areas of focus. Recent advancements in attention-based large neural architectures have spurred the development of AI accelerators, facilitating the training of extensive, multi-billion parameter models. Despite their effectiveness, these powerful networks often incur high execution costs in production environments. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological neural processes, offers a promising alternative. By utilizing temporally-sparse computations, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer to enhance energy efficiency through a reduced and low-power hardware footprint. However, the training of SNNs can be challenging due to their recurrent nature which cannot as easily leverage the massive parallelism of modern AI accelerators. To facilitate the investigation of SNN architectures and dynamics researchers have sought to bridge Python-based deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow with custom-implemented compute kernels. This paper introduces Spyx, a new and lightweight SNN simulation and optimization library designed in JAX. By pre-staging data in the expansive vRAM of contemporary accelerators and employing extensive JIT compilation, Spyx allows for SNN optimization to be executed as a unified, low-level program on NVIDIA GPUs or Google TPUs. This approach achieves optimal hardware utilization, surpassing the performance of many existing SNN training frameworks while maintaining considerable flexibility. ",

    "abstract": "Modeling count-valued time series has been receiving increasing attention since count time series naturally arise in physical and social domains. Poisson gamma dynamical systems (PGDSs) are newly-developed methods, which can well capture the expressive latent transition structure and bursty dynamics behind count sequences. In particular, PGDSs demonstrate superior performance in terms of data imputation and prediction, compared with canonical linear dynamical system (LDS) based methods. Despite these advantages, PGDS cannot capture the heterogeneous overdispersed behaviours of the underlying dynamic processes. To mitigate this defect, we propose a negative-binomial-randomized gamma Markov process, which not only significantly improves the predictive performance of the proposed dynamical system, but also facilitates the fast convergence of the inference algorithm. Moreover, we develop methods to estimate both factor-structured and graph-structured transition dynamics, which enable us to infer more explainable latent structure, compared with PGDSs. Finally, we demonstrate the explainable latent structure learned by the proposed method, and show its superior performance in imputing missing data and forecasting future observations, compared with the related models.

However, large anomaly-free datasets may not always be available before the inference stage; in which case an anomaly detection model must be trained with only a handful of normal samples, a.k.a. few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD). In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to address the challenge of FSAD which incorporates two important techniques. Firstly, we employ a model pre-trained on a large source dataset to initialize model weights. Secondly, to ameliorate the covariate shift between source and target domains, we adopt contrastive training to fine-tune on the few-shot target domain data. To learn suitable representations for the downstream AD task, we additionally incorporate cross-instance positive pairs to encourage a tight cluster of the normal samples, and negative pairs for better separation between normal and synthesized negative samples. We evaluate few-shot anomaly detection on on 3 controlled AD tasks and 4 real-world AD tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "Transferring features learned from natural to medical images for classification is common. However, challenges arise due to the scarcity of certain medical image types and the feature disparities between natural and medical images. Two-step transfer learning has been recognized as a promising solution for this issue. However, choosing an appropriate intermediate domain would be critical in further improving the classification performance. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of using color fundus photographs of the diabetic retina dataset as an intermediate domain for two-step heterogeneous learning (THTL) to classify laryngeal vascular images with nine deep-learning models. Experiment results confirm that although the images in both the intermediate and target domains share vascularized characteristics, the accuracy is drastically reduced compared to one-step transfer learning, where only the last layer is fine-tuned (e.g., ResNet18 drops 14.7%, ResNet50 drops 14.8%). By analyzing the Layer Class Activation Maps (LayerCAM), we uncover a novel finding that the prevalent radial vascular pattern in the intermediate domain prevents learning the features of twisted and tangled vessels that distinguish the malignant class in the target domain. To address the performance drop, we propose the Step-Wise Fine-Tuning (SWFT) method on ResNet in the second step of THTL, resulting in substantial accuracy improvements. Compared to THTL's second step, where only the last layer is fine-tuned, accuracy increases by 26.1% for ResNet18 and 20.4% for ResNet50. Additionally, compared to training from scratch, using ImageNet as the source domain could slightly improve classification performance for laryngeal vascular, but the differences are insignificant.

    "abstract": "Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the \"goals\" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset. ",

In this paper, we show that there exists a local representation in time and space, pointwise, of the fractional material derivative. This allows us to define it on a space of locally integrable functions which is larger than the original one in which Fourier and Laplace transform exist as functions. We consider several typical differential equations involving the fractional material derivative and provide conditions for their solutions to exist. In some cases, the analytical solution can be found. For the general initial value problem, we devise a finite volume method and prove its stability, convergence, and conservation of probability. Numerical illustrations verify our analytical findings. Moreover, our numerical experiments show superiority in the computation time of the proposed numerical scheme over a Monte Carlo method applied to the problem of probability density function's derivation.

    "abstract": "Embedding watermarks into models has been widely used to protect model ownership in federated learning (FL). However, existing methods are inadequate for protecting the ownership of personalized models acquired by clients in personalized FL (PFL). This is due to the aggregation of the global model in PFL, resulting in conflicts over clients' private watermarks. Moreover, malicious clients may tamper with embedded watermarks to facilitate model leakage and evade accountability. This paper presents a robust watermark embedding scheme, named RobWE, to protect the ownership of personalized models in PFL. We first decouple the watermark embedding of personalized models into two parts: head layer embedding and representation layer embedding. The head layer belongs to clients' private part without participating in model aggregation, while the representation layer is the shared part for aggregation. For representation layer embedding, we employ a watermark slice embedding operation, which avoids watermark embedding conflicts. Furthermore, we design a malicious watermark detection scheme enabling the server to verify the correctness of watermarks before aggregating local models. We conduct an exhaustive experimental evaluation of RobWE. The results demonstrate that RobWE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art watermark embedding schemes in FL in terms of fidelity, reliability, and robustness. ",

FlatNAS is the first work in the literature to systematically explore flat regions in the loss landscape of NNs in a NAS procedure, while jointly optimizing their performance on in-distribution data, their out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, and constraining the number of parameters in their architecture. Differently from current studies primarily concentrating on OOD algorithms, FlatNAS successfully evaluates the impact of NN architectures on OOD robustness, a crucial aspect in real-world applications of machine and deep learning. FlatNAS achieves a good trade-off between performance, OOD generalization, and the number of parameters, by using only in-distribution data in the NAS exploration. The OOD robustness of the NAS-designed models is evaluated by focusing on robustness to input data corruptions, using popular benchmark datasets in the literature. ",

Tailored for efficient and collaborative use of denoising diffusion probabilistic models, CollaFuse enables shared server training and inference, alleviating client computational burdens. This is achieved by retaining data and computationally inexpensive GPU processes locally at each client while outsourcing the computationally expensive processes to the shared server. Demonstrated in a healthcare context, CollaFuse enhances privacy by highly reducing the need for sensitive information sharing. These capabilities hold the potential to impact various application areas, such as the design of edge computing solutions, healthcare research, or autonomous driving.

DeepEraser utilizes a recurrent architecture that erases the text in an image via iterative operations. Our idea comes from the process of erasing pencil script, where the text area designated for removal is subject to continuous monitoring and the text is attenuated progressively, ensuring a thorough and clean erasure. Technically, at each iteration, an innovative erasing module is deployed, which not only explicitly aggregates the previous erasing progress but also mines additional semantic context to erase the target text. Through iterative refinements, the text regions are progressively replaced with more appropriate content and finally converge to a relatively accurate status. Furthermore, a custom mask generation strategy is introduced to improve the capability of DeepEraser for adaptive text removal, as opposed to indiscriminately removing all the text in an image. Our DeepEraser is notably compact with only 1.4M parameters and trained in an end-to-end manner. To verify its effectiveness, extensive experiments are conducted on several prevalent benchmarks, including SCUT-Syn, SCUT-EnsText, and Oxford Synthetic text dataset.

Specifically, this approach leverages both the intervention and counterfactual techniques to tackle the above two challenges respectively. Furthermore, a high-quality implicit-enhanced dataset is annotated to evaluate IECI and detailed evaluations show the great advantages of IECI over the state-of-the-art baselines.

The goal is to provide suggestions to the programmer for completing code throughout the codebase by identifying and analyzing code similarities. The proposed methodology can be regarded as a fundamental framework for automated code completion. From the investigation of hundreds of revisions of four subject systems written in C and Java, it is observed that the proposed method can automatically complete around 22% of code statements with an average accuracy of 87% that a programmer writes during development, accelerating software development time. The empirical analysis further demonstrates that the approach can be used with programming language neutrality.

Specifically, the Gait Representation Extractor (GRE) in BigGait effectively transforms all-purpose knowledge into implicit gait features in an unsupervised manner, drawing from design principles of established gait representation construction approaches. Experimental results on CCPG, CAISA-B* and SUSTech1K indicate that BigGait significantly outperforms the previous methods in both self-domain and cross-domain tasks in most cases, and provides a more practical paradigm for learning the next-generation gait representation.

This paper introduces an extension to detection transformers that constructs prototypical local features and uses them in object detection. These custom features, which we call prototypical parts, are designed to be mutually exclusive and align with the classifications of the model. The proposed extension consists of a bottleneck module, the prototype neck, that computes a discretized representation of prototype activations and a new loss term that matches prototypes to object classes. This setup leads to interpretable representations in the prototype neck, allowing visual inspection of the image content perceived by the model and a better understanding of the model's reliability. We show experimentally that our method incurs only a limited performance penalty, and we provide examples that demonstrate the quality of the explanations provided by our method, which we argue outweighs the performance penalty.

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D detection (M3D) aims for precise 3D object localization from a single-view image which usually involves labor-intensive annotation of 3D detection boxes. Weakly supervised M3D has recently been studied to obviate the 3D annotation process by leveraging many existing 2D annotations, but it often requires extra training data such as LiDAR point clouds or multi-view images which greatly degrades its applicability and usability in various applications. We propose SKD-WM3D, a weakly supervised monocular 3D detection framework that exploits depth information to achieve M3D with a single-view image exclusively without any 3D annotations or other training data. One key design in SKD-WM3D is a self-knowledge distillation framework, which transforms image features into 3D-like representations by fusing depth information and effectively mitigates the inherent depth ambiguity in monocular scenarios with little computational overhead in inference. In addition, we design an uncertainty-aware distillation loss and a gradient-targeted transfer modulation strategy which facilitate knowledge acquisition and knowledge transfer, respectively. Extensive experiments show that SKD-WM3D surpasses the state-of-the-art clearly and is even on par with many fully supervised methods. ",

    "abstract": "In industrial anomaly detection, model efficiency and mobile-friendliness become the primary concerns in real-world applications. Simultaneously, the impressive generalization capabilities of Segment Anything (SAM) have garnered broad academic attention, making it an ideal choice for localizing unseen anomalies and diverse real-world patterns. In this paper, considering these two critical factors, we propose a SAM-guided Two-stream Lightweight Model for unsupervised anomaly detection (STLM) that not only aligns with the two practical application requirements but also harnesses the robust generalization capabilities of SAM. We employ two lightweight image encoders, i.e., our two-stream lightweight module, guided by SAM's knowledge. To be specific, one stream is trained to generate discriminative and general feature representations in both normal and anomalous regions, while the other stream reconstructs the same images without anomalies, which effectively enhances the differentiation of two-stream representations when facing anomalous regions. Furthermore, we employ a shared mask decoder and a feature aggregation module to generate anomaly maps. Our experiments conducted on MVTec AD benchmark show that STLM, with about 16M parameters and achieving an inference time in 20ms, competes effectively with state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance, 98.26% on pixel-level AUC and 94.92% on PRO. We further experiment on more difficult datasets, e.g., VisA and DAGM, to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of STLM. ",

However, the Typographic Attack, which shows disruption to VLMs, has also been certified as a security vulnerability to LMMs. In this work, we first comprehensively investigate the distractibility of LMMs by typography. In particular, we introduce the Typographic Dataset designed to evaluate distractibility across various multi-modal subtasks, such as object recognition, visual attributes detection, enumeration, arithmetic computation, and commonsense reasoning. To further study the effect of typographic patterns on performance, we also scrutinize the effect of tuning various typographic factors, encompassing font size, color, opacity, and spatial positioning of typos. We discover that LMMs can partially distinguish visual contents and typos when confronting typographic attacks, which suggests that embeddings from vision encoders contain enough information to distinguish visual contents and typos in images. Inspired by such phenomena, we demonstrate that CLIP's performance of zero-shot classification on typo-ridden images can be significantly improved by providing more informative texts to match images. Furthermore, we also prove that LMMs can utilize more informative prompts to leverage information in embeddings to differentiate between visual content and typos. Finally, we propose a prompt information enhancement method that can effectively mitigate the effects of typography. ",

This paper addresses the challenge of link recommendation for the purpose of social influence maximization. In particular, given a graph $G$ and the seed set $S$, our objective is to select $k$ edges that connect seed nodes and ordinary nodes to optimize the influence dissemination of the seed set. This problem, referred to as influence maximization with augmentation (IMA), has been proven to be NP-hard. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, namely \\textsf{AIS}, consisting of an efficient estimator for augmented influence estimation and an accelerated sampling approach. \\textsf{AIS} provides a $(1-1/\\mathrm{e}-\\varepsilon)$-approximate solution with a high probability of $1-\\delta$, and runs in $O(k^2 (m+n) \\log (n / \\delta) / \\varepsilon^2 + k \\left|E_{\\mathcal{C}}\\right|)$ time assuming that the influence of any singleton node is smaller than that of the seed set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that can be implemented on large graphs containing millions of nodes while preserving strong theoretical guarantees.

Their respective advantages and disadvantages are outlined by categorizing existing NS methods into five distinct categories. Moreover, this survey identifies open research questions that serve as potential directions for future investigations.

    "abstract": "Prompt, recognized as crucial intellectual property, enables large language models (LLMs) to perform specific tasks without the need of fine-tuning, underscoring their escalating importance. With the rise of prompt-based services, such as prompt marketplaces and LLM applications, providers often display prompts' capabilities through input-output examples to attract users. However, this paradigm raises a pivotal security concern: does the exposure of input-output pairs pose the risk of potential prompt leakage, infringing on the intellectual property rights of the developers? To our knowledge, this problem still has not been comprehensively explored yet. To remedy this gap, in this paper, we perform the first in depth exploration and propose a novel attack framework for reverse-stealing prompts against commercial LLMs, namely PRSA. The main idea of PRSA is that by analyzing the critical features of the input-output pairs, we mimic and gradually infer (steal) the target prompts. In detail, PRSA mainly consists of two key phases: prompt mutation and prompt pruning. In the mutation phase, we propose a prompt attention algorithm based on differential feedback to capture these critical features for effectively inferring the target prompts. In the prompt pruning phase, we identify and mask the words dependent on specific inputs, enabling the prompts to accommodate diverse inputs for generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we verify that PRSA poses a severe threat in real world scenarios. We have reported these findings to prompt service providers and actively collaborate with them to take protective measures for prompt copyright. ",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, most methods in visual place recognition (VPR) have used neural networks to produce feature representations. These networks typically produce a global representation of a place image using only this image itself and neglect the cross-image variations (e.g. viewpoint and illumination), which limits their robustness in challenging scenes. In this paper, we propose a robust global representation method with cross-image correlation awareness for VPR, named CricaVPR. Our method uses the self-attention mechanism to correlate multiple images within a batch. These images can be taken in the same place with different conditions or viewpoints, or even captured from different places. Therefore, our method can utilize the cross-image variations as a cue to guide the representation learning, which ensures more robust features are produced. To further facilitate the robustness, we propose a multi-scale convolution-enhanced adaptation method to adapt pre-trained visual foundation models to the VPR task, which introduces the multi-scale local information to further enhance the cross-image correlation-aware representation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly less training time. Our method achieves 94.5% R@1 on Pitts30k using 512-dim global features. The code is released at https://github.com/Lu-Feng/CricaVPR. ",

Although obtaining and translating domain-specific data incurs high costs, it is inevitable for high-quality translations. Hence, finding the most 'effective' data with an unsupervised setting becomes a practical strategy for reducing labeling costs. Recent research indicates that this effective data could be found by selecting 'properly difficult data' based on its volume. This means the data should not be excessively challenging or overly simplistic, especially if the amount of data is limited. However, we found that establishing a criterion for unsupervised data selection remains challenging, as the 'proper difficulty' might vary based on the data domain being trained on. We introduce a novel unsupervised data selection method, 'Capturing Perplexing Named Entities', which adopts the maximum inference entropy in translated named entities as a selection measure. The motivation was that named entities in domain-specific data are considered the most complex portion of the data and should be predicted with high confidence. When verified with the 'Korean-English Parallel Corpus of Specialized Domains,' our method served as a robust guidance for unsupervised data selection, in contrast to existing methods. ",

    "title": "StiefelGen: A Simple, Model Agnostic Approach for Time Series Data  Augmentation over Riemannian Manifolds",
    "abstract": "Data augmentation is an area of research which has seen active development in many machine learning fields, such as in image-based learning models, reinforcement learning for self driving vehicles, and general noise injection for point cloud data. However, convincing methods for general time series data augmentation still leaves much to be desired, especially since the methods developed for these models do not readily cross-over. Three common approaches for time series data augmentation include: (i) Constructing a physics-based model and then imbuing uncertainty over the coefficient space (for example), (ii) Adding noise to the observed data set(s), and, (iii) Having access to ample amounts of time series data sets from which a robust generative neural network model can be trained. However, for many practical problems that work with time series data in the industry: (i) One usually does not have access to a robust physical model, (ii) The addition of noise can in of itself require large or difficult assumptions (for example, what probability distribution should be used? Or, how large should the noise variance be?), and, (iii) In practice, it can be difficult to source a large representative time series data base with which to train the neural network model for the underlying problem. In this paper, we propose a methodology which attempts to simultaneously tackle all three of these previous limitations to a large extent. The method relies upon the well-studied matrix differential geometry of the Stiefel manifold, as it proposes a simple way in which time series signals can placed on, and then smoothly perturbed over the manifold. We attempt to clarify how this method works by showcasing several potential use cases which in particular work to take advantage of the unique properties of this underlying manifold. ",

    "abstract": "Population-based structural health monitoring (PBSHM), aims to share information between members of a population. An offshore wind (OW) farm could be considered as a population of nominally-identical wind-turbine structures. However, benign variations exist among members, such as geometry, sea-bed conditions and temperature differences. These factors could influence structural properties and therefore the dynamic response, making it more difficult to detect structural problems via traditional SHM techniques. This paper explores the use of a hierarchical Bayesian model to infer expected soil stiffness distributions at both population and local levels, as a basis to perform anomaly detection, in the form of scour, for new and existing turbines. To do this, observations of natural frequency will be generated as though they are from a small population of wind turbines. Differences between individual observations will be introduced by postulating distributions over the soil stiffness and measurement noise, as well as reducing soil depth (to represent scour), in the case of anomaly detection.

Online this neural network controller computers the plant inputs cheaply using noisy measurements. In addition, the controller can be trained to only make use of certain predefined measurements. Further, a heuristic approach is proposed to perform the automatic selection of important measurements.

Amidst growing interest in technology-supported decision-making at work, their needs remain understudied.

We conducted iterative design research with line managers within a technology organization, investigating decision-making practices, and opportunities for technological support. Through formative research, development of a decision-representation tool -- DISCERN -- and user enactments, we identify their communication and analysis needs that lack adequate support. We found they preferred tools for externalizing reasoning rather than tools that replace interpersonal interactions, and they wanted tools to support a range of intuitive and calculative decision-making. We discuss how design of social decision-making supports, especially in the workplace, can more explicitly support highly interactional social decision-making. ",

Its primary objective is to provide advanced analytics services to various entities within the network and also towards external application services in the 5G ecosystem. One of the key use cases of NWDAF is mobility trajectory prediction, which aims to accurately support efficient mobility management of User Equipment (UE) in the network by allocating ``just in time'' necessary network resources. In this paper, we show that there are potential mobility attacks that can compromise the accuracy of these predictions. In a semi-realistic scenario with 10,000 subscribers, we demonstrate that an adversary equipped with the ability to hijack cellular mobile devices and clone them can significantly reduce the prediction accuracy from 75\\% to 40\\% using just 100 adversarial UEs. While a defense mechanism largely depends on the attack and the mobility types in a particular area, we prove that a basic KMeans clustering is effective in distinguishing legitimate and adversarial UEs.

    "abstract": "Neural networks are successful in various applications but are also susceptible to adversarial attacks. To show the safety of network classifiers, many verifiers have been introduced to reason about the local robustness of a given input to a given perturbation. While successful, local robustness cannot generalize to unseen inputs. Several works analyze global robustness properties, however, neither can provide a precise guarantee about the cases where a network classifier does not change its classification. In this work, we propose a new global robustness property for classifiers aiming at finding the minimal globally robust bound, which naturally extends the popular local robustness property for classifiers. We introduce VHAGaR, an anytime verifier for computing this bound. VHAGaR relies on three main ideas: encoding the problem as a mixed-integer programming and pruning the search space by identifying dependencies stemming from the perturbation or network computation and generalizing adversarial attacks to unknown inputs. We evaluate VHAGaR on several datasets and classifiers and show that, given a three hour timeout, the average gap between the lower and upper bound on the minimal globally robust bound computed by VHAGaR is 1.9, while the gap of an existing global robustness verifier is 154.7. Moreover, VHAGaR is 130.6x faster than this verifier. Our results further indicate that leveraging dependencies and adversarial attacks makes VHAGaR 78.6x faster. ",

This allows us to investigate what information is essential for the model. EEND-EDA utilizes vector representations of the speakers in a conversation - attractors. Our analysis shows that, attractors do not necessarily have to contain speaker characteristic information. On the other hand, giving the attractors more freedom allowing them to encode some extra (possibly speaker-specific) information leads to small but consistent diarization performance improvements. Despite architectural differences in EEND systems, the notion of attractors and frame embeddings is common to most of them and not specific to EEND-EDA. We believe that the main conclusions of this work can apply to other variants of EEND. Thus, we hope this paper will be a valuable contribution to guide the community to make more informed decisions when designing new systems. ",

Past work on the forecasting ability of large language models (LLMs) suggests that frontier LLMs, as individual forecasters, underperform compared to the gold standard of a human crowd forecasting tournament aggregate. In Study 1, we expand this research by using an LLM ensemble approach consisting of a crowd of twelve LLMs. We compare the aggregated LLM predictions on 31 binary questions to that of a crowd of 925 human forecasters from a three-month forecasting tournament. Our main analysis shows that the LLM crowd outperforms a simple no-information benchmark and is statistically equivalent to the human crowd. We also observe an acquiescence effect, with mean model predictions being significantly above 50%, despite an almost even split of positive and negative resolutions. Moreover, in Study 2, we test whether LLM predictions (of GPT-4 and Claude 2) can be improved by drawing on human cognitive output. We find that both models' forecasting accuracy benefits from exposure to the median human prediction as information, improving accuracy by between 17% and 28%: though this leads to less accurate predictions than simply averaging human and machine forecasts. Our results suggest that LLMs can achieve forecasting accuracy rivaling that of human crowd forecasting tournaments: via the simple, practically applicable method of forecast aggregation. This replicates the 'wisdom of the crowd' effect for LLMs, and opens up their use for a variety applications throughout society. ",

Yet such robustness is seemingly effortless for human perception. In this paper, we propose visually-continuous corruption robustness (VCR) -- an extension of corruption robustness to allow assessing it over the wide and continuous range of changes that correspond to the human perceptive quality (i.e., from the original image to the full distortion of all perceived visual information), along with two novel human-aware metrics for NN evaluation. To compare VCR of NNs with human perception, we conducted extensive experiments on 14 commonly used image corruptions with 7,718 human participants and state-of-the-art robust NN models with different training objectives (e.g., standard, adversarial, corruption robustness), different architectures (e.g., convolution NNs, vision transformers), and different amounts of training data augmentation. Our study showed that: 1) assessing robustness against continuous corruption can reveal insufficient robustness undetected by existing benchmarks; as a result, 2) the gap between NN and human robustness is larger than previously known; and finally, 3) some image corruptions have a similar impact on human perception, offering opportunities for more cost-effective robustness assessments. Our validation set with 14 image corruptions, human robustness data, and the evaluation code is provided as a toolbox and a benchmark. ",

It utilizes multimodal information to alleviate the data sparsity problem in recommendation systems, thus improving recommendation accuracy. However, the reliance on labeled data severely limits the performance of multimodal recommendation models. Recently, self-supervised learning has been used in multimodal recommendations to mitigate the label sparsity problem. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art methods cannot avoid the modality noise when aligning multimodal information due to the large differences in the distributions of different modalities. To this end, we propose a Multi-level sElf-supervised learNing for mulTimOdal Recommendation (MENTOR) method to address the label sparsity problem and the modality alignment problem. Specifically, MENTOR first enhances the specific features of each modality using the graph convolutional network (GCN) and fuses the visual and textual modalities. It then enhances the item representation via the item semantic graph for all modalities, including the fused modality. Then, it introduces two multilevel self-supervised tasks: the multilevel cross-modal alignment task and the general feature enhancement task. The multilevel cross-modal alignment task aligns each modality under the guidance of the ID embedding from multiple levels while maintaining the historical interaction information. The general feature enhancement task enhances the general feature from both the graph and feature perspectives to improve the robustness of our model.

With the need to model interactions among more than two entities, significant research has focused on higher-order networks and ways to represent, analyze, and learn from them. There are two main directions to studying higher-order networks. One direction has focused on capturing higher-order patterns in traditional (dyadic) graphs by changing the basic unit of study from nodes to small frequently observed subgraphs, called motifs. As most existing network data comes in the form of pairwise dyadic relationships, studying higher-order structures within such graphs may uncover new insights. The second direction aims to directly model higher-order interactions using new and more complex representations such as simplicial complexes or hypergraphs. Some of these models have long been proposed, but improvements in computational power and the advent of new computational techniques have increased their popularity. Our goal in this paper is to provide a succinct yet comprehensive summary of the advanced higher-order network analysis techniques. We provide a systematic review of its foundations and algorithms, along with use cases and applications of higher-order networks in various scientific domains. ",

However, the performance remains unsatisfactory in generating library-oriented code, especially for the libraries not present in the training data of LLMs. Previous work utilizes API recommendation technology to help LLMs use libraries: it retrieves APIs related to the user requirements, then leverages them as context to prompt LLMs. However, developmental requirements can be coarse-grained, requiring a combination of multiple fine-grained APIs. This granularity inconsistency makes API recommendation a challenging task. To address this, we propose CAPIR (Compositional API Recommendation), which adopts a \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy to recommend APIs for coarse-grained requirements. Specifically, CAPIR employs an LLM-based Decomposer to break down a coarse-grained task description into several detailed subtasks. Then, CAPIR applies an embedding-based Retriever to identify relevant APIs corresponding to each subtask. Moreover, CAPIR leverages an LLM-based Reranker to filter out redundant APIs and provides the final recommendation. To facilitate the evaluation of API recommendation methods on coarse-grained requirements, we present two challenging benchmarks, RAPID (Recommend APIs based on Documentation) and LOCG (Library-Oriented Code Generation). Experimental results on these benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of CAPIR in comparison to existing baselines. Specifically, on RAPID's Torchdata-AR dataset, compared to the state-of-the-art API recommendation approach, CAPIR improves recall@5 from 18.7% to 43.2% and precision@5 from 15.5% to 37.1%. On LOCG's Torchdata-Code dataset, compared to code generation without API recommendation, CAPIR improves pass@100 from 16.0% to 28.0%. ",

When evaluating current state-of-the-art models over snapshots of MATH(), we find a reasoning gap -- the percentage difference between the static and functional accuracies. We find reasoning gaps from 58.35% to 80.31% among the state-of-the-art closed and open weights models that perform well on static benchmarks, with the caveat that the gaps are likely to be smaller with more sophisticated prompting strategies. Here we show that models which anecdotally have good reasoning performance over real-world tasks, have quantifiable lower gaps, motivating the open problem of building \"gap 0\" models. Code for evaluation and new evaluation datasets, three MATH() snapshots, are publicly available at https://github.com/consequentai/fneval/. ",

    "abstract": "We cast real-world humanoid control as a next token prediction problem, akin to predicting the next word in language. Our model is a causal transformer trained via autoregressive prediction of sensorimotor trajectories. To account for the multi-modal nature of the data, we perform prediction in a modality-aligned way, and for each input token predict the next token from the same modality. This general formulation enables us to leverage data with missing modalities, like video trajectories without actions. We train our model on a collection of simulated trajectories coming from prior neural network policies, model-based controllers, motion capture data, and YouTube videos of humans. We show that our model enables a full-sized humanoid to walk in San Francisco zero-shot. Our model can transfer to the real world even when trained on only 27 hours of walking data, and can generalize to commands not seen during training like walking backward. These findings suggest a promising path toward learning challenging real-world control tasks by generative modeling of sensorimotor trajectories. ",

    "title": "The Counterfeit Conundrum: Can Code Language Models Grasp the Nuances of  Their Incorrect Generations?",
    "abstract": "While language models are increasingly more proficient at code generation, they still frequently generate incorrect programs. Many of these programs are obviously wrong, but others are more subtle and pass weaker correctness checks such as being able to compile. In this work, we focus on these counterfeit samples: programs sampled from a language model that 1) have a high enough log-probability to be generated at a moderate temperature and 2) pass weak correctness checks. Overall, we discover that most models have a very shallow understanding of counterfeits through three clear failure modes. First, models mistakenly classify them as correct. Second, models are worse at reasoning about the execution behaviour of counterfeits and often predict their execution results as if they were correct. Third, when asking models to fix counterfeits, the likelihood of a model successfully repairing a counterfeit is often even lower than that of sampling a correct program from scratch. Counterfeits also have very unexpected properties: first, counterfeit programs for problems that are easier for a model to solve are not necessarily easier to detect and only slightly easier to execute and repair. Second, counterfeits from a given model are just as confusing to the model itself as they are to other models. Finally, both strong and weak models are able to generate counterfeit samples that equally challenge all models. In light of our findings, we recommend that care and caution be taken when relying on models to understand their own samples, especially when no external feedback is incorporated. ",

    "abstract": "In the realm of hematologic cell populations classification, the intricate patterns within flow cytometry data necessitate advanced analytical tools. This paper presents 'HemaGraph', a novel framework based on Graph Attention Networks (GATs) for single-cell multi-class classification of hematological cells from flow cytometry data. Harnessing the power of GATs, our method captures subtle cell relationships, offering highly accurate patient profiling. Based on evaluation of data from 30 patients, HemaGraph demonstrates classification performance across five different cell classes, outperforming traditional methodologies and state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the uniqueness of this framework lies in the training and testing phase of HemaGraph, where it has been applied for extremely large graphs, containing up to hundreds of thousands of nodes and two million edges, to detect low frequency cell populations (e.g. 0.01% for one population), with accuracies reaching 98%. Our findings underscore the potential of HemaGraph in improving hematoligic multi-class classification, paving the way for patient-personalized interventions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to use GATs, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in general, to classify cell populations from single-cell flow cytometry data. We envision applying this method to single-cell data from larger cohort of patients and on other hematologic diseases. ",

    "abstract": "A common network inference problem, arising from real-world data constraints, is how to infer a dynamic network from its time-aggregated adjacency matrix and time-varying marginals (i.e., row and column sums). Prior approaches to this problem have repurposed the classic iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure, also known as Sinkhorn's algorithm, with promising empirical results. However, the statistical foundation for using IPF has not been well understood: under what settings does IPF provide principled estimation of a dynamic network from its marginals, and how well does it estimate the network? In this work, we establish such a setting, by identifying a generative network model whose maximum likelihood estimates are recovered by IPF. Our model both reveals implicit assumptions on the use of IPF in such settings and enables new analyses, such as structure-dependent error bounds on IPF's parameter estimates. When IPF fails to converge on sparse network data, we introduce a principled algorithm that guarantees IPF converges under minimal changes to the network structure. Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic and real-world data, which demonstrate the practical value of our theoretical and algorithmic contributions. ",

Albeit flexible, data-driven models still depend on the dataset and the functional form of the model chosen. Increased adoption of such models requires reliable uncertainty estimates both in the data-informed and out-of-distribution regimes. In this work, we employ Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) to capture both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in a reacting flow model. In particular, we model the filtered progress variable scalar dissipation rate which plays a key role in the dynamics of turbulent premixed flames. We demonstrate that BNN models can provide unique insights about the structure of uncertainty of the data-driven closure models. We also propose a method for the incorporation of out-of-distribution information in a BNN. The efficacy of the model is demonstrated by a priori evaluation on a dataset consisting of a variety of flame conditions and fuels. ",

    "abstract": "Ambisonics, a popular format of spatial audio, is the spherical harmonic (SH) representation of the plane wave density function of a sound field. Many algorithms operate in the SH domain and utilize the Ambisonics as their input signal. The process of encoding Ambisonics from a spherical microphone array involves dividing by the radial functions, which may amplify noise at low frequencies. This can be overcome by regularization, with the downside of introducing errors to the Ambisonics encoding. This paper aims to investigate the impact of different ways of regularization on Deep Neural Network (DNN) training and performance. Ideally, these networks should be robust to the way of regularization. Simulated data of a single speaker in a room and experimental data from the LOCATA challenge were used to evaluate this robustness on an example algorithm of speaker localization based on the direct-path dominance (DPD) test. Results show that performance may be sensitive to the way of regularization, and an informed approach is proposed and investigated, highlighting the importance of regularization information. ",

In this paper, we study the burning number problem both from an algorithmic and a structural point of view. The decision problem of computing the burning number of an input graph is known to be NP-Complete for trees with maximum degree at most three and interval graphs. Here, we prove that this problem is NP-Complete even when restricted to connected proper interval graphs and connected cubic graphs. The well-known burning number conjecture asserts that all the vertices of any graph of order $n$ can be burned in $\\lceil \\sqrt{n}~\\rceil$ steps. In line with this conjecture, upper and lower bounds of $b(G)$ are well-studied for various special graph classes. Here, we provide an improved upper bound for the burning number of connected $P_k$-free graphs and show that the bound is tight up to an additive constant $1$. Finally, we study two variants of the problem, namely edge burning (only edges are burned) and total burning (both vertices and edges are burned). In particular, we establish their relationship with the burning number problem and evaluate the complexity of these variants. ",

    "abstract": "To facilitate diagnosis on cardiac ultrasound (US), clinical practice has established several standard views of the heart, which serve as reference points for diagnostic measurements and define viewports from which images are acquired. Automatic view recognition involves grouping those images into classes of standard views. Although deep learning techniques have been successful in achieving this, they still struggle with fully verifying the suitability of an image for specific measurements due to factors like the correct location, pose, and potential occlusions of cardiac structures. Our approach goes beyond view classification and incorporates a 3D mesh reconstruction of the heart that enables several more downstream tasks, like segmentation and pose estimation. In this work, we explore learning 3D heart meshes via graph convolutions, using similar techniques to learn 3D meshes in natural images, such as human pose estimation. As the availability of fully annotated 3D images is limited, we generate synthetic US images from 3D meshes by training an adversarial denoising diffusion model. Experiments were conducted on synthetic and clinical cases for view recognition and structure detection. The approach yielded good performance on synthetic images and, despite being exclusively trained on synthetic data, it already showed potential when applied to clinical images. With this proof-of-concept, we aim to demonstrate the benefits of graphs to improve cardiac view recognition that can ultimately lead to better efficiency in cardiac diagnosis. ",

The protein secondary structure is formed by the folding of the protein primary structure, and the protein tertiary structure is formed by the bending and folding of the secondary structure. Therefore, the study of protein secondary structure is very helpful to the overall understanding of protein structure. Although the accuracy of protein secondary structure prediction has continuously improved with the development of machine learning and deep learning, progress in the field of protein structure prediction, unfortunately, remains insufficient to meet the large demand for protein information. Therefore, based on the advantages of deep learning-based methods in feature extraction and learning ability, this paper adopts a two-dimensional fusion deep neural network model, DstruCCN, which uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CCN) and a supervised Transformer protein language model for single-sequence protein structure prediction. The training features of the two are combined to predict the protein Transformer binding site matrix, and then the three-dimensional structure is reconstructed using energy minimization. ",

    "abstract": "Existing image compressed sensing (CS) coding frameworks usually solve an inverse problem based on measurement coding and optimization-based image reconstruction, which still exist the following two challenges: 1) The widely used random sampling matrix, such as the Gaussian Random Matrix (GRM), usually leads to low measurement coding efficiency. 2) The optimization-based reconstruction methods generally maintain a much higher computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a new CNN based image CS coding framework using local structural sampling (dubbed CSCNet) that includes three functional modules: local structural sampling, measurement coding and Laplacian pyramid reconstruction. In the proposed framework, instead of GRM, a new local structural sampling matrix is first developed, which is able to enhance the correlation between the measurements through a local perceptual sampling strategy. Besides, the designed local structural sampling matrix can be jointly optimized with the other functional modules during training process. After sampling, the measurements with high correlations are produced, which are then coded into final bitstreams by the third-party image codec. At last, a Laplacian pyramid reconstruction network is proposed to efficiently recover the target image from the measurement domain to the image domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing state-of-the-art CS coding methods, while maintaining fast computational speed. ",

Previous studies successfully clarified the factors contributing to trends in each streaming service, yet the similarities and differences between platforms are commonly unexplored; moreover, the influence of social connections and cultural similarity is usually overlooked. We hereby examine the social aspects of three significant streaming services--Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube--with an emphasis on the dissemination of content across countries. Using two-year-long trending chart datasets, we find that streaming content can be divided into two types: video-oriented (Netflix) and audio-oriented (Spotify). This characteristic is differentiated by accounting for the significance of social connectedness and linguistic similarity: audio-oriented content travels via social links, but video-oriented content tends to spread throughout linguistically akin countries. Interestingly, user-generated contents, YouTube, exhibits a dual characteristic by integrating both visual and auditory characteristics, indicating the platform is evolving into unique medium rather than simply residing a midpoint between video and audio media.
