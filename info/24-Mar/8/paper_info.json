    "title": "Identify Critical Nodes in Complex Network with Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Identifying critical nodes in networks is a classical decision-making task, and many methods struggle to strike a balance between adaptability and utility. Therefore, we propose an approach that empowers Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with Large Language Models (LLMs), to generate a function called \"score\\_nodes\" which can further be used to identify crucial nodes based on their assigned scores. Our model consists of three main components: Manual Initialization, Population Management, and LLMs-based Evolution. It evolves from initial populations with a set of designed node scoring functions created manually. LLMs leverage their strong contextual understanding and rich programming skills to perform crossover and mutation operations on the individuals, generating excellent new functions. These functions are then categorized, ranked, and eliminated to ensure the stable development of the populations while preserving diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of our method, showcasing its strong generalization ability compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. It can consistently and orderly generate diverse and efficient node scoring functions.

    "abstract": "The existence of adversarial attacks on machine learning models imperceptible to a human is still quite a mystery from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we introduce two notions of adversarial attacks: natural or on-manifold attacks, which are perceptible by a human/oracle, and unnatural or off-manifold attacks, which are not. We argue that the existence of the off-manifold attacks is a natural consequence of the dimension gap between the intrinsic and ambient dimensions of the data. For 2-layer ReLU networks, we prove that even though the dimension gap does not affect generalization performance on samples drawn from the observed data space, it makes the clean-trained model more vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in the off-manifold direction of the data space. Our main results provide an explicit relationship between the $\\ell_2,\\ell_{\\infty}$ attack strength of the on/off-manifold attack and the dimension gap. ",

    "abstract": "Machine comprehension of visual information from images and videos by neural networks faces two primary challenges. Firstly, there exists a computational and inference gap in connecting vision and language, making it difficult to accurately determine which object a given agent acts on and represent it through language. Secondly, classifiers trained by a single, monolithic neural network often lack stability and generalization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MoE-VRD, a novel approach to visual relationship detection utilizing a mixture of experts. MoE-VRD identifies language triplets in the form of < subject, predicate, object> tuples to extract relationships from visual processing. Leveraging recent advancements in visual relationship detection, MoE-VRD addresses the requirement for action recognition in establishing relationships between subjects (acting) and objects (being acted upon). In contrast to single monolithic networks, MoE-VRD employs multiple small models as experts, whose outputs are aggregated. Each expert in MoE-VRD specializes in visual relationship learning and object tagging. By utilizing a sparsely-gated mixture of experts, MoE-VRD enables conditional computation and significantly enhances neural network capacity without increasing computational complexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the conditional computation capabilities and scalability of the mixture-of-experts approach lead to superior performance in visual relationship detection compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Human brain and behavior provide a rich venue that can inspire novel control and learning methods for robotics. In an attempt to exemplify such a development by inspiring how humans acquire knowledge and transfer skills among tasks, we introduce a novel multi-task reinforcement learning framework named Episodic Return Progress with Bidirectional Progressive Neural Networks (ERP-BPNN). The proposed ERP-BPNN model (1) learns in a human-like interleaved manner by (2) autonomous task switching based on a novel intrinsic motivation signal and, in contrast to existing methods, (3) allows bidirectional skill transfer among tasks. ERP-BPNN is a general architecture applicable to several multi-task learning settings; in this paper, we present the details of its neural architecture and show its ability to enable effective learning and skill transfer among morphologically different robots in a reaching task. The developed Bidirectional Progressive Neural Network (BPNN) architecture enables bidirectional skill transfer without requiring incremental training and seamlessly integrates with online task arbitration. The task arbitration mechanism developed is based on soft Episodic Return progress (ERP), a novel intrinsic motivation (IM) signal. To evaluate our method, we use quantifiable robotics metrics such as 'expected distance to goal' and 'path straightness' in addition to the usual reward-based measure of episodic return common in reinforcement learning. With simulation experiments, we show that ERP-BPNN achieves faster cumulative convergence and improves performance in all metrics considered among morphologically different robots compared to the baselines.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, politically biased news (PBN) has significantly undermined public trust in vaccines, despite strong medical evidence supporting their efficacy. In this paper, we analyze: (i) how inherent vaccine stances subtly influence individuals' selection of news sources and participation in social media discussions; and (ii) the impact of exposure to PBN on users' attitudes toward vaccines. In doing so, we first curate a comprehensive dataset that connects PBN with related social media discourse. Utilizing advanced deep learning and causal inference techniques, we reveal distinct user behaviors between social media groups with various vaccine stances. Moreover, we observe that individuals with moderate stances, particularly the vaccine-hesitant majority, are more vulnerable to the influence of PBN compared to those with extreme views.

    "abstract": "The breadth, scale, and temporal granularity of modern electronic health records (EHR) systems offers great potential for estimating personalized and contextual patient health trajectories using sequential deep learning. However, learning useful representations of EHR data is challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, multimodality, irregular and variable-specific recording frequency, and timestamp duplication when multiple measurements are recorded simultaneously. Although recent efforts to fuse structured EHR and unstructured clinical notes suggest the potential for more accurate prediction of clinical outcomes, less focus has been placed on EHR embedding approaches that directly address temporal EHR challenges by learning time-aware representations from multimodal patient time series. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic embedding and tokenization framework for precise representation of multimodal clinical time series that combines novel methods for encoding time and sequential position with temporal cross-attention. Our embedding and tokenization framework, when integrated into a multitask transformer classifier with sliding window attention, outperformed baseline approaches on the exemplar task of predicting the occurrence of nine postoperative complications of more than 120,000 major inpatient surgeries using multimodal data from three hospitals and two academic health centers in the United States.

Such questions are of particular interest to educators, who worry that these tools enable a new form of academic dishonesty, in which students submit AI generated code as their own work. Our research explores the viability of using code stylometry and machine learning to distinguish between GPT-4 generated and human-authored code. Our dataset comprises human-authored solutions from CodeChef and AI-authored solutions generated by GPT-4. Our classifier outperforms baselines, with an F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 0.91. A variant of our classifier that excludes gameable features (e.g., empty lines, whitespace) still performs well with an F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 0.89. We also evaluated our classifier with respect to the difficulty of the programming problem and found that there was almost no difference between easier and intermediate problems, and the classifier performed only slightly worse on harder problems. Our study shows that code stylometry is a promising approach for distinguishing between GPT-4 generated code and human-authored code. ",

    "abstract": "Multiple access techniques are cornerstones of wireless communications. Their performance depends on the channel properties, which can be improved by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this work, we jointly optimize MA precoding at the base station (BS) and RIS configuration. We tackle difficulties of mutual coupling between RIS elements, scalability to more than 1000 RIS elements, and channel estimation. We first derive an RIS-assisted channel model considering mutual coupling, then propose an unsupervised machine learning (ML) approach to optimize the RIS. In particular, we design a dedicated neural network (NN) architecture RISnet with good scalability and desired symmetry. Moreover, we combine ML-enabled RIS configuration and analytical precoding at BS since there exist analytical precoding schemes. Furthermore, we propose another variant of RISnet, which requires the channel state information (CSI) of a small portion of RIS elements (in this work, 16 out of 1296 elements) if the channel comprises a few specular propagation paths. More generally, this work is an early contribution to combine ML technique and domain knowledge in communication for NN architecture design. Compared to generic ML, the problem-specific ML can achieve higher performance, lower complexity and symmetry. ",

    "abstract": "Radio Frequency (RF) device fingerprinting has been recognized as a potential technology for enabling automated wireless device identification and classification. However, it faces a key challenge due to the domain shift that could arise from variations in the channel conditions and environmental settings, potentially degrading the accuracy of RF-based device classification when testing and training data is collected in different domains. This paper introduces a novel solution that leverages contrastive learning to mitigate this domain shift problem. Contrastive learning, a state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approach from deep learning, learns a distance metric such that positive pairs are closer (i.e. more similar) in the learned metric space than negative pairs. When applied to RF fingerprinting, our model treats RF signals from the same transmission as positive pairs and those from different transmissions as negative pairs. Through experiments on wireless and wired RF datasets collected over several days, we demonstrate that our contrastive learning approach captures domain-invariant features, diminishing the effects of domain-specific variations. Our results show large and consistent improvements in accuracy (10.8\\% to 27.8\\%) over baseline models, thus underscoring the effectiveness of contrastive learning in improving device classification under domain shift.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved phenomenal success in various domains. However, its data-driven nature also introduces new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious opponents. Recent work shows that a well-trained RL agent can be easily manipulated by strategically perturbing its state observations at the test stage. Existing solutions either introduce a regularization term to improve the smoothness of the trained policy against perturbations or alternatively train the agent's policy and the attacker's policy. However, the former does not provide sufficient protection against strong attacks, while the latter is computationally prohibitive for large environments. In this work, we propose a new robust RL algorithm for deriving a pessimistic policy to safeguard against an agent's uncertainty about true states. This approach is further enhanced with belief state inference and diffusion-based state purification to reduce uncertainty. Empirical results show that our approach obtains superb performance under strong attacks and has a comparable training overhead with regularization-based methods.

However, current contrastive learning tends to learn global coarse-grained representations of the image that benefit generic object recognition, whereas such coarse-grained features are insufficient for fine-grained visual recognition. In this paper, we present to incorporate the subtle local fine-grained feature learning into global self-supervised contrastive learning through a pure self-supervised global-local fine-grained contrastive learning framework. Specifically, a novel pretext task called Local Discrimination (LoDisc) is proposed to explicitly supervise self-supervised model's focus towards local pivotal regions which are captured by a simple-but-effective location-wise mask sampling strategy. We show that Local Discrimination pretext task can effectively enhance fine-grained clues in important local regions, and the global-local framework further refines the fine-grained feature representations of images. Extensive experimental results on different fine-grained object recognition tasks demonstrate that the proposed method can lead to a decent improvement in different evaluation settings. Meanwhile, the proposed method is also effective in general object recognition tasks. ",

Modern feeding systems can pick up and position food in front of a care recipient's mouth for a bite. However, many with severe mobility constraints cannot lean forward and need direct inside-mouth food placement. This demands precision, especially for those with restricted mouth openings, and appropriately reacting to various physical interactions - incidental contacts as the utensil moves inside, impulsive contacts due to sudden muscle spasms, deliberate tongue maneuvers by the person being fed to guide the utensil, and intentional bites. In this paper, we propose an inside-mouth bite transfer system that addresses these challenges with two key components: a multi-view mouth perception pipeline robust to tool occlusion, and a control mechanism that employs multimodal time-series classification to discern and react to different physical interactions. We demonstrate the efficacy of these individual components through two ablation studies. In a full system evaluation, our system successfully fed 13 care recipients with diverse mobility challenges. Participants consistently emphasized the comfort and safety of our inside-mouth bite transfer system, and gave it high technology acceptance ratings - underscoring its transformative potential in real-world scenarios.

Motivated by this observation, we propose two simple, computationally cheap vulnerability-aware reweighting functions for assigning perturbation bounds to adversarial examples used for AT, named Margin-Weighted Perturbation Budget (MWPB) and Standard-Deviation-Weighted Perturbation Budget (SDWPB). The proposed methods assign perturbation radii to individual adversarial samples based on the vulnerability of their corresponding natural examples.

In recent years, machine learning models have proliferated for analyzing EHR data to predict patients future health conditions. Among them, some studies advocate for multi-task learning (MTL) to jointly predict multiple target diseases for improving the prediction performance over single task learning. Nevertheless, current MTL frameworks for EHR data have significant limitations due to their heavy reliance on human experts to identify task groups for joint training and design model architectures. To reduce human intervention and improve the framework design, we propose an automated approach named AutoDP, which can search for the optimal configuration of task grouping and architectures simultaneously. To tackle the vast joint search space encompassing task combinations and architectures, we employ surrogate model-based optimization, enabling us to efficiently discover the optimal solution. Experimental results on real-world EHR data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed AutoDP framework. It achieves significant performance improvements over both hand-crafted and automated state-of-the-art methods, also maintains a feasible search cost at the same time. ",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning presents an effective approach to alleviate the resource-intensive and time-consuming nature of policy learning from scratch in the solution space. Even though the resulting policy can mimic expert demonstrations reliably, it often lacks predictability in unexplored regions of the state-space, giving rise to significant safety concerns in the face of perturbations. To address these challenges, we introduce the Stable Neural Dynamical System (SNDS), an imitation learning regime which produces a policy with formal stability guarantees. We deploy a neural policy architecture that facilitates the representation of stability based on Lyapunov theorem, and jointly train the policy and its corresponding Lyapunov candidate to ensure global stability. We validate our approach by conducting extensive experiments in simulation and successfully deploying the trained policies on a real-world manipulator arm. The experimental results demonstrate that our method overcomes the instability, accuracy, and computational intensity problems associated with previous imitation learning methods, making our method a promising solution for stable policy learning in complex planning scenarios.

Our study extends this inquiry, examining DA's class-specific bias across various datasets, including those distinct from ImageNet, through random cropping.

This suggests a nuanced approach to model selection, emphasizing bias mitigation. We also refined a \"data augmentation robustness scouting\" method to manage DA-induced biases more efficiently, reducing computational demands significantly (training 112 models instead of 1860; a reduction of factor 16.2) while still capturing essential bias trends.

Nevertheless these methods are computationally expensive to train, introduce additional complexity and may require domain knowledge to adapt hyper-parameters to a new dataset. Inspired by developments in object detection, segmentation and large-scale self-supervised foundation vision models, we introduce Component Features (ComFe), a novel explainable-by-design image classification approach using a transformer-decoder head and hierarchical mixture-modelling. With only global image labels and no segmentation or part annotations, ComFe can identify consistent image components, such as the head, body, wings and tail of a bird, and the image background, and determine which of these features are informative in making a prediction. We demonstrate that ComFe obtains higher accuracy compared to previous interpretable models across a range of fine-grained vision benchmarks, without the need to individually tune hyper-parameters for each dataset. We also show that ComFe outperforms a non-interpretable linear head across a range of datasets, including ImageNet, and improves performance on generalisation and robustness benchmarks. ",

During the routing, the crosstalk effect is typically modeled by predicting coupling capacitance with congestion information. However, the timing estimation tends to be overly pessimistic, as the crosstalk-induced delay depends not only on the coupling capacitance but also on the signal arrival time. This work presents a crosstalk-aware timing estimation method using a two-step machine learning approach. Interconnects that are physically adjacent and overlap in signal timing windows are filtered first. Crosstalk delay is predicted by integrating physical topology and timing features without relying on post-routing results and the parasitic extraction. Experimental results show a match rate of over 99% for identifying crosstalk nets compared to the commercial tool on the OpenCores benchmarks, with prediction results being more accurate than those of other state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for learning a model from data distributed on massive clients without exposing data privacy. It works effectively in the ideal federation where clients share homogeneous data distribution and learning behavior. However, FL may fail to function appropriately when the federation is not ideal, amid an unhealthy state called Negative Federated Learning (NFL), in which most clients gain no benefit from participating in FL. Many studies have tried to address NFL. However, their solutions either (1) predetermine to prevent NFL in the entire learning life-cycle or (2) tackle NFL in the aftermath of numerous learning rounds. Thus, they either (1) indiscriminately incur extra costs even if FL can perform well without such costs or (2) waste numerous learning rounds. Additionally, none of the previous work takes into account the clients who may be unwilling/unable to follow the proposed NFL solutions when using those solutions to upgrade an FL system in use. This paper introduces FL-GUARD, a holistic framework that can be employed on any FL system for tackling NFL in a run-time paradigm. That is, to dynamically detect NFL at the early stage (tens of rounds) of learning and then to activate recovery measures when necessary. Specifically, we devise a cost-effective NFL detection mechanism, which relies on an estimation of performance gain on clients. Only when NFL is detected, we activate the NFL recovery process, in which each client learns in parallel an adapted model when training the global model. Extensive experiment results confirm the effectiveness of FL-GUARD in detecting NFL and recovering from NFL to a healthy learning state. We also show that FL-GUARD is compatible with previous NFL solutions and robust against clients unwilling/unable to take any recovery measures. ",

However, existing FSAD methods struggle to effectively leverage a limited number of normal samples, and they may fail to detect and locate inconspicuous anomalies in the spatial domain. We further discover that these subtle anomalies would be more noticeable in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Path Frequency Discriminators (DFD) network from a frequency perspective to tackle these issues. Specifically, we generate anomalies at both image-level and feature-level. Differential frequency components are extracted by the multi-frequency information construction module and supplied into the fine-grained feature construction module to provide adapted features. We consider anomaly detection as a discriminative classification problem, wherefore the dual-path feature discrimination module is employed to detect and locate the image-level and feature-level anomalies in the feature space. The discriminators aim to learn a joint representation of anomalous features and normal features in the latent space. Extensive experiments conducted on MVTec AD and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that our DFD surpasses current state-of-the-art methods. Source code will be available. ",

Existing methods typically focus on weighting the predictions produced by language-specific classifiers of different sources that follow a shared encoder. However, all source languages share the same encoder, which is updated by all these languages. The extracted representations inevitably contain different source languages' information, which may disturb the learning of the language-specific classifiers. Additionally, due to the language gap, language-specific classifiers trained with source labels are unable to make accurate predictions for the target language. Both facts impair the model's performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Disentangled and Adaptive Network (DA-Net). Firstly, we devise a feedback-guided collaborative disentanglement method that seeks to purify input representations of classifiers, thereby mitigating mutual interference from multiple sources. Secondly, we propose a class-aware parallel adaptation method that aligns class-level distributions for each source-target language pair, thereby alleviating the language pairs' language gap.

We evaluate Zoom2Net on four diverse datasets (e.g. cloud telemetry and Internet data transfer) and use cases (such as bursts analysis and traffic classification).

Social robots' unique characteristics -- such as anthropomorphic physical embodiment or effective communication methods -- help to engage users and motivate them to comply with specific interventions, thus improving the interventions' outcomes. This scoping review aims to evaluate current scientific evidence for employing social robots in sleep health interventions, identify critical research gaps, and suggest future directions for developing and using social robots to improve people's sleep health. Our analysis of the reviewed studies found them limited due to a singular focus on the older adult population, use of small sample sizes, limited intervention durations, and other compounding factors. Nevertheless, the reviewed studies reported several positive outcomes, highlighting the potential social robots hold in this field. Although our review found limited clinical evidence for the efficacy of social robots as purveyors of sleep health interventions, it did elucidate the potential for a successful future in this domain if current limitations are addressed and more research is conducted.

A promising solution is the use of learning from experience, i.e., Reinforcement Learning. In multi-agent (social) environments, complex population-level phenomena may emerge from interactions between individual learning agents. Many of the existing studies rely on simulated social dilemma environments to study the interactions of independent learning agents. However, they tend to ignore the moral heterogeneity that is likely to be present in societies of agents in practice. For example, at different points in time a single learning agent may face opponents who are consequentialist (i.e., caring about maximizing some outcome over time) or norm-based (i.e., focusing on conforming to a specific norm here and now). The extent to which agents' co-development may be impacted by such moral heterogeneity in populations is not well understood. In this paper, we present a study of the learning dynamics of morally heterogeneous populations interacting in a social dilemma setting. Using a Prisoner's Dilemma environment with a partner selection mechanism, we investigate the extent to which the prevalence of diverse moral agents in populations affects individual agents' learning behaviors and emergent population-level outcomes. We observe several types of non-trivial interactions between pro-social and anti-social agents, and find that certain classes of moral agents are able to steer selfish agents towards more cooperative behavior.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) and causal modelling naturally complement each other. The goal of causal modelling is to predict the effects of interventions in an environment, while the goal of reinforcement learning is to select interventions that maximize the rewards the agent receives from the environment. Reinforcement learning includes the two most powerful sources of information for estimating causal relationships: temporal ordering and the ability to act on an environment. This paper examines which reinforcement learning settings we can expect to benefit from causal modelling, and how. In online learning, the agent has the ability to interact directly with their environment, and learn from exploring it. Our main argument is that in online learning, conditional probabilities are causal, and therefore offline RL is the setting where causal learning has the most potential to make a difference. Essentially, the reason is that when an agent learns from their {\\em own} experience, there are no unobserved confounders that influence both the agent's own exploratory actions and the rewards they receive. Our paper formalizes this argument. For offline RL, where an agent may and typically does learn from the experience of {\\em others}, we describe previous and new methods for leveraging a causal model, including support for counterfactual queries.

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of high dynamic range (HDR) images from multi-exposure low dynamic range (LDR) images in dynamic scenes presents significant challenges, especially in preserving and restoring information in oversaturated regions and avoiding ghosting artifacts. While current methods often struggle to address these challenges, our work aims to bridge this gap by developing a multi-exposure HDR image reconstruction network for dynamic scenes, complemented by single-frame HDR image reconstruction. This network, comprising single-frame HDR reconstruction with enhanced stop image (SHDR-ESI) and SHDR-ESI-assisted multi-exposure HDR reconstruction (SHDRA-MHDR), effectively leverages the ghost-free characteristic of single-frame HDR reconstruction and the detail-enhancing capability of ESI in oversaturated areas. Specifically, SHDR-ESI innovatively integrates single-frame HDR reconstruction with the utilization of ESI. This integration not only optimizes the single image HDR reconstruction process but also effectively guides the synthesis of multi-exposure HDR images in SHDR-AMHDR. In this method, the single-frame HDR reconstruction is specifically applied to reduce potential ghosting effects in multiexposure HDR synthesis, while the use of ESI images assists in enhancing the detail information in the HDR synthesis process. Technically, SHDR-ESI incorporates a detail enhancement mechanism, which includes a self-representation module and a mutual-representation module, designed to aggregate crucial information from both reference image and ESI. To fully leverage the complementary information from non-reference images, a feature interaction fusion module is integrated within SHDRA-MHDR. Additionally, a ghost suppression module, guided by the ghost-free results of SHDR-ESI, is employed to suppress the ghosting artifacts. ",

    "title": "A Study of Dropout-Induced Modality Bias on Robustness to Missing Video  Frames for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition",
    "abstract": "Advanced Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) systems have been observed to be sensitive to missing video frames, performing even worse than single-modality models. While applying the dropout technique to the video modality enhances robustness to missing frames, it simultaneously results in a performance loss when dealing with complete data input. In this paper, we investigate this contrasting phenomenon from the perspective of modality bias and reveal that an excessive modality bias on the audio caused by dropout is the underlying reason. Moreover, we present the Modality Bias Hypothesis (MBH) to systematically describe the relationship between modality bias and robustness against missing modality in multimodal systems. Building on these findings, we propose a novel Multimodal Distribution Approximation with Knowledge Distillation (MDA-KD) framework to reduce over-reliance on the audio modality and to maintain performance and robustness simultaneously. Finally, to address an entirely missing modality, we adopt adapters to dynamically switch decision strategies. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is evaluated and validated through a series of comprehensive experiments using the MISP2021 and MISP2022 datasets.

    "title": "Towards Robustness Analysis of E-Commerce Ranking System",
    "abstract": "Information retrieval (IR) is a pivotal component in various applications. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have enabled the integration of ML algorithms into IR, particularly in ranking systems. While there is a plethora of research on the robustness of ML-based ranking systems, these studies largely neglect commercial e-commerce systems and fail to establish a connection between real-world and manipulated query relevance. In this paper, we present the first systematic measurement study on the robustness of e-commerce ranking systems. We define robustness as the consistency of ranking outcomes for semantically identical queries. To quantitatively analyze robustness, we propose a novel metric that considers both ranking position and item-specific information that are absent in existing metrics. Our large-scale measurement study with real-world data from e-commerce retailers reveals an open opportunity to measure and improve robustness since semantically identical queries often yield inconsistent ranking results. Based on our observations, we propose several solution directions to enhance robustness, such as the use of Large Language Models. Note that the issue of robustness discussed herein does not constitute an error or oversight. Rather, in scenarios where there exists a vast array of choices, it is feasible to present a multitude of products in various permutations, all of which could be equally appealing. However, this extensive selection may lead to customer confusion. As e-commerce retailers use various techniques to improve the quality of search results, we hope that this research offers valuable guidance for measuring the robustness of the ranking systems. ",

Community challenge evaluation competitions have played an important role in promoting technology innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration in biomedical text mining research. These challenges provide platforms for researchers to develop state-of-the-art solutions for data mining and information processing in biomedical research.

Secondly, we conduct systematic summary and comparative analysis, including named entity recognition, entity normalization, attribute extraction, relation extraction, event extraction, text classification, text similarity, knowledge graph construction, question answering, text generation, and large language model evaluation. Then, we summarize the potential clinical applications of these community challenge tasks from translational informatics perspective.

Inferring missing links or predicting future ones based on the currently observed network is known as the link prediction task.Recent network embedding based link prediction algorithms have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on link prediction accuracy. Those algorithms usually apply node attributes as the initial feature input to accelerate the convergence speed during the training process. However, they do not take full advantage of node feature information. In this paper,besides applying feature attributes as the initial input, we make better utilization of node attribute information by building attributable networks and plugging attributable networks into some typical link prediction algorithms and naming this algorithm Attributive Graph Enhanced Embedding (AGEE). AGEE is able to automatically learn the weighting trades-off between the structure and the attributive networks. Numerical experiments show that AGEE can improve the link prediction accuracy by around 3% compared with link prediction framework SEAL, Variational Graph AutoEncoder (VGAE), and Node2vec. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have become pivotal in recommendation systems for learning user and item embeddings by leveraging the user-item interaction graph's node information and topology. However, these models often face the famous over-smoothing issue, leading to indistinct user and item embeddings and reduced personalization. Traditional desmoothing methods in GCN-based systems are model-specific, lacking a universal solution. This paper introduces a novel, model-agnostic approach named \\textbf{D}esmoothing Framework for \\textbf{G}CN-based \\textbf{R}ecommendation Systems (\\textbf{DGR}). It effectively addresses over-smoothing on general GCN-based recommendation models by considering both global and local perspectives. Specifically, we first introduce vector perturbations during each message passing layer to penalize the tendency of node embeddings approximating overly to be similar with the guidance of the global topological structure. Meanwhile, we further develop a tailored-design loss term for the readout embeddings to preserve the local collaborative relations between users and their neighboring items. In particular, items that exhibit a high correlation with neighboring items are also incorporated to enhance the local topological information. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 5 benchmark datasets based on 5 well-known GCN-based recommendation models, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework.

    "abstract": "With the requirements of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) for extensive connectivity of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) to the outside world, safety and security have become stringent problems. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are a crucial safety component in remediating Controller Area Network (CAN) bus vulnerabilities. However, supervised-based IDSs fail to identify complexity attacks and anomaly-based IDSs have higher false alarms owing to capability bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-knowledge fused anomaly detection model, called MKF-IDS. Specifically, the method designs an integration framework, including spatial-temporal correlation with an attention mechanism (STcAM) module and patch sparse-transformer module (PatchST). The STcAM with fine-pruning uses one-dimensional convolution (Conv1D) to extract spatial features and subsequently utilizes the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) to extract the temporal features, where the attention mechanism will focus on the important time steps. Meanwhile, the PatchST captures the combined long-time historical features from independent univariate time series. Finally, the proposed method is based on knowledge distillation to STcAM as a student model for learning intrinsic knowledge and cross the ability to mimic PatchST. In the detection phase, the MKF-ADS only deploys STcAM to maintain efficiency in a resource-limited IVN environment. Moreover, the redundant noisy signal is reduced with bit flip rate and boundary decision estimation. We conduct extensive experiments on six simulation attack scenarios across various CAN IDs and time steps, and two real attack scenarios, which present a competitive prediction and detection performance. Compared with the baseline in the same paradigm, the error rate and FAR are 2.62% and 2.41% and achieve a promising F1-score of 97.3%. ",

In today's landscape of increasingly large models, stacking depth can even reach dozens, further exacerbating this issue. To mitigate this problem, we introduce LORS (LOw-rank Residual Structure). LORS allows stacked modules to share the majority of parameters, requiring a much smaller number of unique ones per module to match or even surpass the performance of using entirely distinct ones, thereby significantly reducing parameter usage. We validate our method by applying it to the stacked decoders of a query-based object detector, and conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, as even with a 70\\% reduction in the parameters of the decoder, our method still enables the model to achieve comparable or ",

Considering the significant overlapping phenomenon in X-ray prohibited item images, we propose an Anti-Overlapping DETR (AO-DETR) based on one of the state-of-the-art general object detectors, DINO. Specifically, to address the feature coupling issue caused by overlapping phenomena, we introduce the Category-Specific One-to-One Assignment (CSA) strategy to constrain category-specific object queries in predicting prohibited items of fixed categories, which can enhance their ability to extract features specific to prohibited items of a particular category from the overlapping foreground-background features. To address the edge blurring problem caused by overlapping phenomena, we propose the Look Forward Densely (LFD) scheme, which improves the localization accuracy of reference boxes in mid-to-high-level decoder layers and enhances the ability to locate blurry edges of the final layer. Similar to DINO, our AO-DETR provides two different versions with distinct backbones, tailored to meet diverse application requirements. Extensive experiments on the PIXray and OPIXray datasets demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art object detectors, indicating its potential applications in the field of prohibited item detection.

The proposed methods stem from sPOD but optimize the co-moving fields directly and penalize their nuclear norm to promote low rank of the individual data in the decomposition. Furthermore, we add a robustness term to the decomposition that can deal with interpolation error and data noises. Leveraging tools from convex optimization, we derive three proximal algorithms to solve the decomposition problem. We report a numerical comparison with existing methods against synthetic data benchmarks and then show the separation ability of our methods on 1D and 2D incompressible and reactive flows. The resulting methodology is the basis of a new analysis paradigm that results in the same interpretability as the POD for the individual co-moving fields. ",

Our system relies solely on onboard IMU measurements, stereo infrared images, and depth images and autonomously corrects teleoperated inputs when they are deemed unsafe. We define a point in 3D space as unsafe if it satisfies either of two conditions: (i) it is occupied by an obstacle, or (ii) it remains unmapped. At each time step, an occupancy map of the environment is updated by the VI-SLAM by fusing the onboard measurements, and a CBF is constructed to parameterize the (un)safe region in the 3D space. Given the CBF and state feedback from the VI-SLAM module, a safety filter computes a certified reference that best matches the teleoperation input while satisfying the safety constraint encoded by the CBF. In contrast to existing perception-based safe control frameworks, we directly close the perception-action loop and demonstrate the full capability of safe control in combination with real-time VI-SLAM without any external infrastructure or prior knowledge of the environment. We verify the efficacy of the perceptive safety filter in real-time MAV experiments using exclusively onboard sensing and computation and show that the teleoperated MAV is able to safely navigate through unknown environments despite arbitrary inputs sent by the teleoperator.

As a case study, it addresses the challenging problem of static silent store prediction. This involves identifying redundant memory writes based only on static program features. Eliminating such stores enhances performance and energy efficiency by reducing memory access and bus traffic, especially in the presence of emerging non-volatile memory technologies. To achieve this, we propose a methodology consisting of: 1) the development of relevant ML models for explaining silent store prediction, and 2) the application of XAI to explain these models. We employ two state-of-the-art model-agnostic XAI methods to analyze the causes of silent stores. Through the case study, we evaluate the effectiveness of the methods. We find that these methods provide explanations for silent store predictions, which are consistent with known causes of silent store occurrences from previous studies. Typically, this allows us to confirm the prevalence of silent stores in operations that write the zero constant into memory, or the absence of silent stores in operations involving loop induction variables. This suggests the potential relevance of XAI in analyzing ML models' decision in embedded system design. From the case study, we share some valuable insights and pitfalls we encountered. More generally, this study aims to lay the groundwork for future research in the emerging field of XAI for embedded system design. ",

While existing charge prediction methods have shown impressive performance, they face significant challenges when dealing with confusing charges, such as Snatch and Robbery.

Constituent elements are fundamental behaviors underlying criminal punishment and have subtle distinctions among charges. In this paper, we introduce a novel From Graph to Word Bag (FWGB) approach, which introduces domain knowledge regarding constituent elements to guide the model in making judgments on confusing charges, much like a judge's reasoning process. Specifically, we first construct a legal knowledge graph containing constituent elements to help select keywords for each charge, forming a word bag. Subsequently, to guide the model's attention towards the differentiating information for each charge within the context, we expand the attention mechanism and introduce a new loss function with attention supervision through words in the word bag. We construct the confusing charges dataset from real-world judicial documents.

The main aim of this ad-hoc brief report is to highlight some of surrogate models that were adequate and computationally less demanding for nonlinear dynamical models in various modeling application areas.To the author knowledge, these methods have been not, at least extensively, employed for ABMs within the field of (SHCS) Social Health Computational Sciences, yet. Thus, they might be, but not necessarily, useful in progressing state of the art for establishing surrogate models for ABMs in the field of SHCS. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an extensive empirical study on the integration of dimensionality reduction techniques with advanced unsupervised time series anomaly detection models, focusing on the MUTANT and Anomaly-Transformer models. The study involves a comprehensive evaluation across three different datasets: MSL, SMAP, and SWaT. Each dataset poses unique challenges, allowing for a robust assessment of the models' capabilities in varied contexts. The dimensionality reduction techniques examined include PCA, UMAP, Random Projection, and t-SNE, each offering distinct advantages in simplifying high-dimensional data. Our findings reveal that dimensionality reduction not only aids in reducing computational complexity but also significantly enhances anomaly detection performance in certain scenarios. Moreover, a remarkable reduction in training times was observed, with reductions by approximately 300\\% and 650\\% when dimensionality was halved and minimized to the lowest dimensions, respectively. This efficiency gain underscores the dual benefit of dimensionality reduction in both performance enhancement and operational efficiency. The MUTANT model exhibits notable adaptability, especially with UMAP reduction, while the Anomaly-Transformer demonstrates versatility across various reduction techniques. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the synergistic effects of dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection, contributing valuable perspectives to the field of time series analysis. The study underscores the importance of selecting appropriate dimensionality reduction strategies based on specific model requirements and dataset characteristics, paving the way for more efficient, accurate, and scalable solutions in anomaly detection.

Federated learning is a promising technique for effectively training GAI models in mobile edge networks due to its data distribution. However, there is a notable issue with communication consumption when training large GAI models like generative diffusion models in mobile edge networks. Additionally, the substantial energy consumption associated with training diffusion-based models, along with the limited resources of edge devices and complexities of network environments, pose challenges for improving the training efficiency of GAI models. To address this challenge, we propose an on-demand quantized energy-efficient federated diffusion approach for mobile edge networks. Specifically, we first design a dynamic quantized federated diffusion training scheme considering various demands from the edge devices. Then, we study an energy efficiency problem based on specific quantization requirements. Numerical results show that our proposed method significantly reduces system energy consumption and transmitted model size compared to both baseline federated diffusion and fixed quantized federated diffusion methods while effectively maintaining reasonable quality and diversity of generated data.

    "abstract": "The channel hardening effect is less pronounced in the cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system compared to its cellular counterpart, making it necessary to estimate the downlink effective channel gains to ensure decent performance. However, the downlink training inadvertently creates an opportunity for adversarial nodes to launch pilot spoofing attacks (PSAs). First, we demonstrate that adversarial distributed access points (APs) can severely degrade the achievable downlink rate. They achieve this by estimating their channels to users in the uplink training phase and then precoding and sending the same pilot sequences as those used by legitimate APs during the downlink training phase. Then, the impact of the downlink PSA is investigated by rigorously deriving a closed-form expression of the per-user achievable downlink rate. By employing the min-max criterion to optimize the power allocation coefficients, the maximum per-user achievable rate of downlink transmission is minimized from the perspective of adversarial APs. As an alternative to the downlink PSA, adversarial APs may opt to precode random interference during the downlink data transmission phase in order to disrupt legitimate communications. In this scenario, the achievable downlink rate is derived, and then power optimization algorithms are also developed. We present numerical results to showcase the detrimental impact of the downlink PSA and compare the effects of these two types of attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Adverse weather conditions often impair the quality of captured images, inevitably inducing cutting-edge object detection models for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. In this paper, we raise an intriguing question: can the combination of image restoration and object detection enhance detection performance in adverse weather conditions? To answer it, we propose an effective architecture that bridges image dehazing and object detection together via guidance information and task-driven learning to achieve detection-friendly dehazing, termed FriendNet. FriendNet aims to deliver both high-quality perception and high detection capacity. Different from existing efforts that intuitively treat image dehazing as pre-processing, FriendNet establishes a positive correlation between these two tasks. Clean features generated by the dehazing network potentially contribute to improvements in object detection performance. Conversely, object detection crucially guides the learning process of the image dehazing network under the task-driven learning scheme. We shed light on how downstream tasks can guide upstream dehazing processes, considering both network architecture and learning objectives. We design Guidance Fusion Block (GFB) and Guidance Attention Block (GAB) to facilitate the integration of detection information into the network. Furthermore, the incorporation of the detection task loss aids in refining the optimization process. Additionally, we introduce a new Physics-aware Feature Enhancement Block (PFEB), which integrates physics-based priors to enhance the feature extraction and representation capabilities. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods on both image quality and detection precision.

But while there is strong evidence for socio-demographic characteristics in language, they are infrequently used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Age and gender are somewhat well represented, but Labov's original target, socioeconomic status, is noticeably absent. And yet it matters. We show empirically that NLP disadvantages less-privileged socioeconomic groups. We annotate a corpus of 95K utterances from movies with social class, ethnicity and geographical language variety and measure the performance of NLP systems on three tasks: language modelling, automatic speech recognition, and grammar error correction. We find significant performance disparities that can be attributed to socioeconomic status as well as ethnicity and geographical differences. With NLP technologies becoming ever more ubiquitous and quotidian, they must accommodate all language varieties to avoid disadvantaging already marginalised groups. We argue for the inclusion of socioeconomic class in future language technologies. ",

Significant strides have been made in leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to achieve remarkable success in these areas. However, in real-world scenarios, the training environment for models is often far from ideal, leading to substantial performance degradation of GNN models due to various unfavorable factors, including imbalance in data distribution, the presence of noise in erroneous data, privacy protection of sensitive information, and generalization capability for out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To tackle these issues, substantial efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of GNN models in practical real-world scenarios, as well as enhancing their reliability and robustness. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey that systematically reviews existing GNN models, focusing on solutions to the four mentioned real-world challenges including imbalance, noise, privacy, and OOD in practical scenarios that many existing reviews have not considered. Specifically, we first highlight the four key challenges faced by existing GNNs, paving the way for our exploration of real-world GNN models. Subsequently, we provide detailed discussions on these four aspects, dissecting how these solutions contribute to enhancing the reliability and robustness of GNN models.

Afterwards, we extend the model with more components that are known to influence opinions, e.g. authority or openness to new views.

    "abstract": "Many computer vision and machine learning problems are modelled as learning tasks on graphs, where graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant tool for learning representations of graph-structured data. A key feature of GNNs is their use of graph structures as input, enabling them to exploit the graphs' inherent topological properties-known as the topology awareness of GNNs. Despite the empirical successes of GNNs, the influence of topology awareness on generalization performance remains unexplored, particularly for node-level tasks that diverge from the assumption of data being independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.). The precise definition and characterization of the topology awareness of GNNs, especially concerning different topological features, are still unclear. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework to characterize the topology awareness of GNNs across any topological feature. Using this framework, we investigate the effects of topology awareness on GNN generalization performance. Contrary to the prevailing belief that enhancing the topology awareness of GNNs is always advantageous, our analysis reveals a critical insight: improving the topology awareness of GNNs may inadvertently lead to unfair generalization across structural groups, which might not be desired in some scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a case study using the intrinsic graph metric, the shortest path distance, on various benchmark datasets. The empirical results of this case study confirm our theoretical insights. Moreover, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework by using it to tackle the cold start problem in graph active learning. ",

However, transferring data to clouds causes unavoidable privacy concerns. Here, we present a synthesis framework to design coding mechanisms that allow sharing and processing data in a privacy-preserving manner without sacrificing data utility and algorithmic performance. We consider the setup where the user aims to run an algorithm in the cloud using private data. The cloud then returns some data utility back to the user (utility refers to the service that the algorithm provides, e.g., classification, prediction, AI models, etc.). To avoid privacy concerns, the proposed scheme provides tools to co-design: 1) coding mechanisms to distort the original data and guarantee a prescribed differential privacy level; 2) an equivalent-but-different algorithm (referred here to as the target algorithm) that runs on distorted data and produces distorted utility; and 3) a decoding function that extracts the true utility from the distorted one with a negligible error. Then, instead of sharing the original data and algorithm with the cloud, only the distorted data and target algorithm are disclosed, thereby avoiding privacy concerns. The proposed scheme is built on the synergy of differential privacy and system immersion tools from control theory. The key underlying idea is to design a higher-dimensional target algorithm that embeds all trajectories of the original algorithm and works on randomly encoded data to produce randomly encoded utility. We show that the proposed scheme can be designed to offer any level of differential privacy without degrading the algorithm's utility. We present two use cases to illustrate the performance of the developed tools: privacy in optimization/learning algorithms and a nonlinear networked control system. ",

Recent methods view a rating matrix as a user-item bi-partite graph with labeled edges denoting observed ratings and predict the edges between the user and item nodes by using the graph neural network (GNN). Despite their effectiveness, they treat each rating type as an independent relation type and thus cannot sufficiently consider the ordinal nature of the ratings. In this paper, we explore a new approach to exploit rating ordinality for GNN, which has not been studied well in the literature. We introduce a new method, called ROGMC, to leverage Rating Ordinality in GNN-based Matrix Completion. It uses cumulative preference propagation to directly incorporate rating ordinality in GNN's message passing, allowing for users' stronger preferences to be more emphasized based on inherent orders of rating types. This process is complemented by interest regularization which facilitates preference learning using the underlying interest information. Our extensive experiments show that ROGMC consistently outperforms the existing strategies of using rating types for GNN. We expect that our attempt to explore the feasibility of utilizing rating ordinality for GNN may stimulate further research in this direction. ",

The side effect of noises due to the uncertainty of entities and triples may limit the few-shot learning, but existing FKGC works neglect such uncertainty, which leads them more susceptible to limited reference samples with noises. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware few-shot KG completion framework (UFKGC) to model uncertainty for a better understanding of the limited data by learning representations under Gaussian distribution. Uncertainty representation is first designed for estimating the uncertainty scope of the entity pairs after transferring feature representations into a Gaussian distribution. Further, to better integrate the neighbors with uncertainty characteristics for entity features, we design an uncertainty-aware relational graph neural network (UR-GNN) to conduct convolution operations between the Gaussian distributions. Then, multiple random samplings are conducted for reference triples within the Gaussian distribution to generate smooth reference representations during the optimization. The final completion score for each query instance is measured by the designed uncertainty optimization to make our approach more robust to the noises in few-shot scenarios. Experimental results show that our approach achieves excellent performance on two benchmark datasets compared to its competitors. ",

This paper presents T-TAME, Transformer-compatible Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations, a general methodology for explaining deep neural networks used in image classification tasks. The proposed architecture and training technique can be easily applied to any convolutional or Vision Transformer-like neural network, using a streamlined training approach. After training, explanation maps can be computed in a single forward pass; these explanation maps are comparable to or outperform the outputs of computationally expensive perturbation-based explainability techniques, achieving SOTA performance. We apply T-TAME to three popular deep learning classifier architectures, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B-16, trained on the ImageNet dataset, and we demonstrate improvements over existing state-of-the-art explainability methods. A detailed analysis of the results and an ablation study provide insights into how the T-TAME design choices affect the quality of the generated explanation maps. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of real-world applications. In this paper, we identify a suitable scaling factor (denoted by $\\alpha$) on the residual branch of deep wide ResNets to achieve good generalization ability. We show that if $\\alpha$ is a constant, the class of functions induced by Residual Neural Tangent Kernel (RNTK) is asymptotically not learnable, as the depth goes to infinity. We also highlight a surprising phenomenon: even if we allow $\\alpha$ to decrease with increasing depth $L$, the degeneration phenomenon may still occur. However, when $\\alpha$ decreases rapidly with $L$, the kernel regression with deep RNTK with early stopping can achieve the minimax rate provided that the target regression function falls in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the infinite-depth RNTK. Our simulation studies on synthetic data and real classification tasks such as MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 support our theoretical criteria for choosing $\\alpha$. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning models have been successfully utilized to extract clinically actionable insights from routinely available histology data. Generally, these models require annotations performed by clinicians, which are scarce and costly to generate. The emergence of self-supervised learning (SSL) methods remove this barrier, allowing for large-scale analyses on non-annotated data. However, recent SSL approaches apply increasingly expansive model architectures and larger datasets, causing the rapid escalation of data volumes, hardware prerequisites, and overall expenses, limiting access to these resources to few institutions. Therefore, we investigated the complexity of contrastive SSL in computational pathology in relation to classification performance with the utilization of consumer-grade hardware. Specifically, we analyzed the effects of adaptations in data volume, architecture, and algorithms on downstream classification tasks, emphasizing their impact on computational resources. We trained breast cancer foundation models on a large public patient cohort and validated them on various downstream classification tasks in a weakly supervised manner on two external public patient cohorts. Our experiments demonstrate that we can improve downstream classification performance whilst reducing SSL training duration by 90%. In summary, we propose a set of adaptations which enable the utilization of SSL in computational pathology in non-resource abundant environments. ",

    "abstract": "Rapid and reliable identification of dynamic scene parts, also known as motion segmentation, is a key challenge for mobile sensors. Contemporary RGB camera-based methods rely on modeling camera and scene properties however, are often under-constrained and fall short in unknown categories. Event cameras have the potential to overcome these limitations, but corresponding methods have only been demonstrated in smaller-scale indoor environments with simplified dynamic objects. This work presents an event-based method for class-agnostic motion segmentation that can successfully be deployed across complex large-scale outdoor environments too. To this end, we introduce a novel divide-and-conquer pipeline that combines: (a) ego-motion compensated events, computed via a scene understanding module that predicts monocular depth and camera pose as auxiliary tasks, and (b) optical flow from a dedicated optical flow module. These intermediate representations are then fed into a segmentation module that predicts motion segmentation masks. A novel transformer-based temporal attention module in the segmentation module builds correlations across adjacent 'frames' to get temporally consistent segmentation masks. Our method sets the new state-of-the-art on the classic EV-IMO benchmark (indoors), where we achieve improvements of 2.19 moving object IoU (2.22 mIoU) and 4.52 point IoU respectively, as well as on a newly-generated motion segmentation and tracking benchmark (outdoors) based on the DSEC event dataset, termed DSEC-MOTS, where we show improvement of 12.91 moving object IoU.

We solve the two-dimensional stationary Navier-Stokes equations within a geometrically intricate domain and explore methodologies that allow us to integrate additional physical insights into the model. These approaches include imposing the Dirichlet boundary conditions (BCs) strongly and employing domain decomposition (DD), with both overlapping and non-overlapping subdomains. We adapt the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) approach to solve different sets of equations in distinct subdomains based on the diverse flow characteristics present in each region. Our exploration results in a hierarchy of models spanning various levels of complexity, where the best models exhibit l1 prediction errors of less than 1% for both pressure and velocity. To illustrate the reproducibility of our approach, we track the errors over repeated independent training runs of the best identified model and show its reliability. Subsequently, by incorporating the stirring rate as a parametric input, we develop a fast-to-evaluate model of the flow capable of interpolating across a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Although we exclusively restrict ourselves to STRs in this work, we conclude that the steps taken to obtain the presented model hierarchy can be transferred to other applications. ",

While networks for tabular or image data are usually overconfident, recent works have shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) show the opposite behavior for node-level classification. But what happens when we are predicting links? We show that, in this case, GNNs often exhibit a mixed behavior. More specifically, they may be overconfident in negative predictions while being underconfident in positive ones. Based on this observation, we propose IN-N-OUT, the first-ever method to calibrate GNNs for link prediction. IN-N-OUT is based on two simple intuitions: i) attributing true/false labels to an edge while respecting a GNNs prediction should cause but small fluctuations in that edge's embedding; and, conversely, ii) if we label that same edge contradicting our GNN, embeddings should change more substantially. An extensive experimental campaign shows that IN-N-OUT significantly improves the calibration of GNNs in link prediction, consistently outperforming the baselines available -- which are not designed for this specific task.

    "abstract": "We describe the first algorithms that satisfy the standard notion of node-differential privacy in the continual release setting (i.e., without an assumed promise on input streams). Previous work addresses node-private continual release by assuming an unenforced promise on the maximum degree in a graph; indeed, the algorithms from these works exhibit blatant privacy violations when the degree bound is not met. Our algorithms are accurate on sparse graphs, for several fundamental graph problems: counting edges, triangles, other subgraphs, and connected components; and releasing degree histograms. Our unconditionally private algorithms generally have optimal error, up to polylogarithmic factors and lower-order terms. We provide general transformations that take a base algorithm for the continual release setting, which need only be private for streams satisfying a promised degree bound, and produce an algorithm that is unconditionally private yet mimics the base algorithm when the stream meets the degree bound (and adds only linear overhead to the time and space complexity of the base algorithm). To do so, we design new projection algorithms for graph streams, based on the batch-model techniques of Day et al. 2016 and Blocki et al. 2013, which modify the stream to limit its degree. Our main technical innovation is to show that the projections are stable -- meaning that similar input graphs have similar projections -- when the input stream satisfies a privately testable safety condition. Our transformation then follows a novel online variant of the Propose-Test-Release framework (Dwork and Lei, 2009), privately testing the safety condition before releasing output at each step. ",

Chellali et al. in 2013, by restricting the number of neighbors in $S$ of a vertex outside $S$, introduced the concept of $[1,j]$-dominating set. A set $D \\subseteq V$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is called $[1,j]$-Dominating Set of $G$ if every vertex not in $D$ has at least one neighbor and at most $j$ neighbors in $D$. The Minimum $[1,j]$-Domination problem is the problem of finding the minimum set $D$. Given a positive integer $k$ and a graph $G = (V, E)$, the $[1,j]$-Domination Decision problem is to decide whether $G$ has $[1,j]$-dominating set of cardinality at most $k$. A polynomial-time algorithm was obtained in split graphs for a constant $j$ in contrast to the classic Dominating Set problem which is NP-hard in split graphs. This result motivates us to investigate the effect of restriction $j$ on the complexity of $[1,j]$-domination problem on various classes of graphs. Although for $j\\geq 3$, it has been proved that the minimum of classical domination is equal to minimum $[1,j]$-domination in interval graphs, the complexity of finding the minimum $[1,2]$-domination in interval graphs is still outstanding. In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a minimum $[1,2]$ on non-proper interval graphs by a dynamic programming technique. Next, on the negative side, we show that the minimum $[1,2]$-dominating set problem on circle graphs is $NP$-complete. ",

Single-chip millimeter wave radar (single-chip radar in short) emerges as a low-cost sensor option for place recognition, with the advantage of insensitivity to degraded visual environments. However, it encounters two challenges. Firstly, sparse point cloud from single-chip radar leads to poor performance when using current place recognition methods, which assume much denser data. Secondly, its performance significantly declines in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations, due to limited overlap in its field of view (FOV). We propose mmPlace, a robust place recognition system to address these challenges. Specifically, mmPlace transforms intermediate frequency (IF) signal into range azimuth heatmap and employs a spatial encoder to extract features. Additionally, to improve the performance in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations, mmPlace employs a rotating platform and concatenates heatmaps in a rotation cycle, effectively expanding the system's FOV. We evaluate mmPlace's performance on the milliSonic dataset, which is collected on the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) campus, the city roads surrounding the campus, and an underground parking garage. The results demonstrate that mmPlace outperforms point cloud-based methods and achieves 87.37% recall@1 in scenarios involving rotational and lateral variations. ",

Although not generally presented as such, this paper demonstrates how a variety of graph learning techniques can be recast as special cases of bilevel optimization or simplifications thereof. In brief, building on prior work we first derive a more flexible class of energy functions that, when paired with various descent steps (e.g., gradient descent, proximal methods, momentum, etc.), form graph neural network (GNN) message-passing layers; critically, we also carefully unpack where any residual approximation error lies with respect to the underlying constituent message-passing functions. We then probe several simplifications of this framework to derive close connections with non-GNN-based graph learning approaches, including knowledge graph embeddings, various forms of label propagation, and efficient graph-regularized MLP models.

    "abstract": "Contrary to the widely believed hypothesis that larger, denser cities promote socioeconomic mixing, a recent study (Nilforoshan et al. 2023) reports the opposite behavior, i.e. more segregation. Here, we present a game-theoretic model that predicts such a density-dependent segregation outcome in both one- and two-class systems. The model provides key insights into the analytical conditions that lead to such behavior. Furthermore, the arbitrage equilibrium outcome implies the equality of effective utilities among all agents. This could be interpreted as all agents being equally \"happy\" in their respective environments in our ideal society. We believe that our model contributes towards a deeper mathematical understanding of social dynamics and behavior, which is important as we strive to develop more harmonious societies. ",

We define the spatial cost of a measurement schedule based on the number of simultaneously active qubits and prove that an optimal measurement schedule corresponds to a path decomposition of minimal width. Our analysis shows that approximating the spatial cost of a graph is \\textsf{NP}-hard, while for graphs with bounded spatial cost, we establish an efficient algorithm for computing an optimal measurement schedule.

    "abstract": "We present our experience of porting the code used in the wave-packet convergent-close-coupling (WP-CCC) approach to run on NVIDIA V100 and AMD MI250X GPUs. The WP-CCC approach is a method used in the field of ion-atom collision physics to describe various processes such as elastic scattering, target excitation and electron-capture by the projectile. It has demonstrated its effectiveness in modelling collisions involving proton or bare ion projectiles with various atomic and molecular targets, especially those which can be considered as one or two-electron systems. Such calculations find their application in computational atomic physics as well as in the modelling of fusion plasmas and in hadron therapy for cancer treatment. The main computational cost of the method lies in the solution of an emerging set of coupled first-order differential equations. This involves implementing the standard Runge-Kutta method while varying the projectile position along multiple straight-line paths. At each projectile position several millions of matrix elements need to be calculated which is accomplished using the OpenACC programming model. Once these matrix elements are computed, the subsequent steps involve matrix inversion and multiplication with another matrix. To expedite these operations, a GPU-accelerated LAPACK routine, specialised for solving systems of linear equations, is employed. For AMD GPUs, this routine is accessible through the hipSOLVER library, while for NVIDIA GPUs, it can be obtained from the cuSOLVER library. The portability, performance and energy efficiency of the CPU-only code have been compared with the GPU-accelerated version running on AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. The implementation of GPU-accelerated WP-CCC code opens up avenues for exploring more sophisticated collision processes involving complex projectile and target structures, which were previously considered infeasible.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has made significant progress in protein structure prediction, advancing the development of computational biology. However, despite the high accuracy achieved in predicting single-chain structures, a significant number of large homo-oligomeric assemblies exhibit internal symmetry, posing a major challenge in structure determination. The performances of existing deep learning methods are limited since the symmetrical protein assembly usually has a long sequence, making structural computation infeasible. In addition, multiple identical subunits in symmetrical protein complex cause the issue of supervision ambiguity in label assignment, requiring a consistent structure modeling for the training. To tackle these problems, we propose a protein folding framework called SGNet to model protein-protein interactions in symmetrical assemblies. SGNet conducts feature extraction on a single subunit and generates the whole assembly using our proposed symmetry module, which largely mitigates computational problems caused by sequence length. Thanks to the elaborate design of modeling symmetry consistently, we can model all global symmetry types in quaternary protein structure prediction. Extensive experimental results on a benchmark of symmetrical protein complexes further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. ",

Considering that only a few public lung datasets are available and lung nodules are more difficult to detect in CT images than in natural images, the existing methods face many bottlenecks when detecting lung nodules, especially hard ones in CT images. In order to solve these problems, we plan to enhance the focus of our network. In this work, we present an improved detection network that pays more attention to hard samples and datasets to deal with lung nodules by introducing deformable convolution and self-paced learning. Experiments on the LUNA16 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed components and show that our method has reached competitive performance. ",

    "abstract": "Currently, medical image domain translation operations show a high demand from researchers and clinicians. Amongst other capabilities, this task allows the generation of new medical images with sufficiently high image quality, making them clinically relevant. Deep Learning (DL) architectures, most specifically deep generative models, are widely used to generate and translate images from one domain to another. The proposed framework relies on an adversarial Denoising Diffusion Model (DDM) to synthesize echocardiography images and perform domain translation. Contrary to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), DDMs are able to generate high quality image samples with a large diversity. If a DDM is combined with a GAN, this ability to generate new data is completed at an even faster sampling time. In this work we trained an adversarial DDM combined with a GAN to learn the reverse denoising process, relying on a guide image, making sure relevant anatomical structures of each echocardiography image were kept and represented on the generated image samples. For several domain translation operations, the results verified that such generative model was able to synthesize high quality image samples: MSE: 11.50 +/- 3.69, PSNR (dB): 30.48 +/- 0.09, SSIM: 0.47 +/- 0.03. The proposed method showed high generalization ability, introducing a framework to create echocardiography images suitable to be used for clinical research purposes. ",

However, the impact of MAEs on intermodality remains a key challenge. We introduce MedFLIP, a Fast Language-Image Pre-training method for Medical analysis. We explore MAEs for zero-shot learning with crossed domains, which enhances the model ability to learn from limited data, a common scenario in medical diagnostics. We verify that masking an image does not affect intermodal learning. Furthermore, we propose the SVD loss to enhance the representation learning for characteristics of medical images, aiming to improve classification accuracy by leveraging the structural intricacies of such data. Lastly, we validate using language will improve the zero-shot performance for the medical image analysis. MedFLIP scaling of the masking process marks an advancement in the field, offering a pathway to rapid and precise medical image analysis without the traditional computational bottlenecks. Through experiments and validation, MedFLIP demonstrates efficient performance improvements, setting an explored standard for future research and application in medical diagnostics. ",
