    "title": "SimGrade: Using Code Similarity Measures for More Accurate Human Grading",
    "abstract": "While the use of programming problems on exams is a common form of summative assessment in CS courses, grading such exam problems can be a difficult and inconsistent process. Through an analysis of historical grading patterns we show that inaccurate and inconsistent grading of free-response programming problems is widespread in CS1 courses. These inconsistencies necessitate the development of methods to ensure more fairer and more accurate grading. In subsequent analysis of this historical exam data we demonstrate that graders are able to more accurately assign a score to a student submission when they have previously seen another submission similar to it. As a result, we hypothesize that we can improve exam grading accuracy by ensuring that each submission that a grader sees is similar to at least one submission they have previously seen. We propose several algorithms for (1) assigning student submissions to graders, and (2) ordering submissions to maximize the probability that a grader has previously seen a similar solution, leveraging distributed representations of student code in order to measure similarity between submissions. Finally, we demonstrate in simulation that these algorithms achieve higher grading accuracy than the current standard random assignment process used for grading. ",

    "title": "On Defining Smart Cities using Transformer Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Cities worldwide are rapidly adopting smart technologies, transforming urban life. Despite this trend, a universally accepted definition of 'smart city' remains elusive. Past efforts to define it have not yielded a consensus, as evidenced by the numerous definitions in use. In this paper, we endeavored to create a new 'compromise' definition that should resonate with most experts previously involved in defining this concept and aimed to validate one of the existing definitions. We reviewed 60 definitions of smart cities from industry, academia, and various relevant organizations, employing transformer architecture-based generative AI and semantic text analysis to reach this compromise. We proposed a semantic similarity measure as an evaluation technique, which could generally be used to compare different smart city definitions, assessing their uniqueness or resemblance. Our methodology employed generative AI to analyze various existing definitions of smart cities, generating a list of potential new composite definitions. Each of these new definitions was then tested against the pre-existing individual definitions we have gathered, using cosine similarity as our metric. This process identified smart city definitions with the highest average cosine similarity, semantically positioning them as the closest on average to all the 60 individual definitions selected. ",

    "abstract": "Generative models are increasingly being used in various applications, such as text generation, commonsense reasoning, and question-answering. To be effective globally, these models must be aware of and account for local socio-cultural contexts, making it necessary to have benchmarks to evaluate the models for their cultural familiarity. Since the training data for LLMs is web-based and the Web is limited in its representation of information, it does not capture knowledge present within communities that are not on the Web. Thus, these models exacerbate the inequities, semantic misalignment, and stereotypes from the Web. There has been a growing call for community-centered participatory research methods in NLP. In this work, we respond to this call by using participatory research methods to introduce $\\textit{DOSA}$, the first community-generated $\\textbf{D}$ataset $\\textbf{o}$f 615 $\\textbf{S}$ocial $\\textbf{A}$rtifacts, by engaging with 260 participants from 19 different Indian geographic subcultures. We use a gamified framework that relies on collective sensemaking to collect the names and descriptions of these artifacts such that the descriptions semantically align with the shared sensibilities of the individuals from those cultures. Next, we benchmark four popular LLMs and find that they show significant variation across regional sub-cultures in their ability to infer the artifacts. ",

    "abstract": "Although an ever-growing number of applications employ deep learning based systems for prediction, decision-making, or state estimation, almost no certification processes have been established that would allow such systems to be deployed in safety-critical applications. In this work we consider real-world problems arising in aviation and other safety-critical areas, and investigate their requirements for a certified model. To this end, we investigate methodologies from the machine learning research community aimed towards verifying robustness and reliability of deep learning systems, and evaluate these methodologies with regard to their applicability to real-world problems. Then, we establish a new framework towards deep learning certification based on (i) inherently safe design, and (ii) run-time error detection. Using a concrete use case from aviation, we show how deep learning models can recover disentangled variables through the use of weakly-supervised representation learning. We argue that such a system design is inherently less prone to common model failures, and can be verified to encode underlying mechanisms governing the data. Then, we investigate four techniques related to the run-time safety of a model, namely (i) uncertainty quantification, (ii) out-of-distribution detection, (iii) feature collapse, and (iv) adversarial attacks. We evaluate each for their applicability and formulate a set of desiderata that a certified model should fulfill. Finally, we propose a novel model structure that exhibits all desired properties discussed in this work, and is able to make regression and uncertainty predictions, as well as detect out-of-distribution inputs, while requiring no regression labels to train. We conclude with a discussion of the current state and expected future progress of deep learning certification, and its industrial and social implications. ",

    "abstract": "In the context of online education, designing an automatic solver for geometric problems has been considered a crucial step towards general math Artificial Intelligence (AI), empowered by natural language understanding and traditional logical inference. In most instances, problems are addressed by adding auxiliary components such as lines or points. However, adding auxiliary components automatically is challenging due to the complexity in selecting suitable auxiliary components especially when pivotal decisions have to be made. The state-of-the-art performance has been achieved by exhausting all possible strategies from the category library to identify the one with the maximum likelihood. However, an extensive strategy search have to be applied to trade accuracy for ef-ficiency. To add auxiliary components automatically and efficiently, we present deep reinforcement learning framework based on the language model, such as BERT. We firstly apply the graph attention mechanism to reduce the strategy searching space, called AttnStrategy, which only focus on the conclusion-related components. Meanwhile, a novel algorithm, named Automatically Adding Auxiliary Components using Reinforcement Learning framework (A3C-RL), is proposed by forcing an agent to select top strategies, which incorporates the AttnStrategy and BERT as the memory components. Results from extensive experiments show that the proposed A3C-RL algorithm can substantially enhance the average precision by 32.7% compared to the traditional MCTS. In addition, the A3C-RL algorithm outperforms humans on the geometric questions from the annual University Entrance Mathematical Examination of China. ",

We characterize the design of this framework, developed in collaboration with experts from language processing, communications, and causal inference. Our approach integrates microblog data with multiple sources of geospatial and temporal data, and leverages unsupervised machine learning (generalized additive models) to support collaborative hypothesis discovery and testing. We implement this approach in a system named MOTIV. We illustrate this approach on two problems, one related to Stay-at-home policies during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the other related to the Black Lives Matter movement. Through detailed case studies and discussions with collaborators, we identify several insights discovered regarding the different drivers of moral sentiment in social media. Our results indicate that this visual approach supports rapid, collaborative hypothesis testing, and can help give insights into the underlying moral values behind controversial political issues.

    "abstract": "In recent years, smart city-based development has gained momentum due to its versatile nature in architecture and planning for the systematic habitation of human beings. According to World Health Organization (WHO) report, air pollution causes serious respiratory diseases. Hence, it becomes necessary to real-time monitoring of air quality to minimize effect by taking time-bound decisions by the stakeholders. The air pollution comprises various compositions such as NH3, O3, SO2, NO2, etc., and their concentrations vary from location to location.The research work proposes an integrated framework for monitoring air quality using rule-based Complex Event Processing (CEP) and SPARQL queries. CEP works with the data stream based on predefined rules to detect the complex pattern, which helps in decision support for stakeholders. Initially, the dataset was collected from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India and this data was then preprocessed and passed through Apache Kafka. Then a knowledge graph developed based on the air quality paradigm. Consequently, convert preprocessed data into Resource Description Framework (RDF) data, and integrate with Knowledge graph which is ingested to CEP engine using Apache Jena for enhancing the decision support . Simultaneously, rules are extracted using a decision tree, and some ground truth parameters of CPCB are added and ingested to the CEP engine to determine the complex patterns. Consequently, the SPARQL query is used on real-time RDF dataset for fetching the condition of air quality as good, poor, severe, hazardous etc based on complex events detection. For validating the proposed approach various chunks of RDF are used for the deployment of events to the CEP engine, and its performance is examined over time while performing simple and complex queries.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), while powerful, are built and trained to process a single text input. In common applications, multiple inputs can be processed by concatenating them together into a single stream of text. However, the LLM is unable to distinguish which sections of prompt belong to various input sources. Indirect prompt injection attacks take advantage of this vulnerability by embedding adversarial instructions into untrusted data being processed alongside user commands. Often, the LLM will mistake the adversarial instructions as user commands to be followed, creating a security vulnerability in the larger system. We introduce spotlighting, a family of prompt engineering techniques that can be used to improve LLMs' ability to distinguish among multiple sources of input. The key insight is to utilize transformations of an input to provide a reliable and continuous signal of its provenance. We evaluate spotlighting as a defense against indirect prompt injection attacks, and find that it is a robust defense that has minimal detrimental impact to underlying NLP tasks. Using GPT-family models, we find that spotlighting reduces the attack success rate from greater than {50}\\% to below {2}\\% in our experiments with minimal impact on task efficacy. ",

To address the limitation, the Only-Train-Once (OTO) and OTOv2 are proposed to eliminate the need for additional fine-tuning steps by directly training and compressing a general DNN from scratch. Nevertheless, the static design of optimizers (in OTO) can lead to convergence issues of local optima. In this paper, we proposed the Auto-Train-Once (ATO), an innovative network pruning algorithm designed to automatically reduce the computational and storage costs of DNNs. During the model training phase, our approach not only trains the target model but also leverages a controller network as an architecture generator to guide the learning of target model weights. Furthermore, we developed a novel stochastic gradient algorithm that enhances the coordination between model training and controller network training, thereby improving pruning performance. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis as well as extensive experiments, and the results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various model architectures (including ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2) on standard benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet).

To this end, in this research we propose two algorithms, Reversible Jump Attack (RJA) and Metropolis-Hasting Modification Reduction (MMR), to generate highly effective adversarial examples and to improve the imperceptibility of the examples, respectively. RJA utilizes a novel randomization mechanism to enlarge the search space and efficiently adapts to a number of perturbed words for adversarial examples. With these generated adversarial examples, MMR applies the Metropolis-Hasting sampler to enhance the imperceptibility of adversarial examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RJA-MMR outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in attack performance, imperceptibility, fluency and grammar correctness. ",

    "abstract": "When the equipment is working, real-time collection of environmental sensor data for anomaly detection is one of the key links to prevent industrial process accidents and network attacks and ensure system security. However, under the environment with specific real-time requirements, the anomaly detection for environmental sensors still faces the following difficulties: (1) The complex nonlinear correlation characteristics between environmental sensor data variables lack effective expression methods, and the distribution between the data is difficult to be captured. (2) it is difficult to ensure the real-time monitoring requirements by using complex machine learning models, and the equipment cost is too high. (3) Too little sample data leads to less labeled data in supervised learning. This paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning anomaly detection system. Based on the generative adversarial network and self-attention mechanism, considering the different feature information contained in the local subsequences, it automatically learns the complex linear and nonlinear dependencies between environmental sensor variables, and uses the anomaly score calculation method combining reconstruction error and discrimination error. It can monitor the abnormal points of real sensor data with high real-time performance and can run on the intelligent satellite Internet of things system, which is suitable for the real working environment.

    "abstract": "Must we trace and block all fake content in a social commerce network so that genuine users may enjoy fake-free information? Such efforts largely fail, because, as we get better at spam detection, spammers use the same advances for anti-detection. As a fundamentally new approach, we show that an online platform can aggregate and route user-generated content in a smart personalized way, which fosters and relies on \"collective social responsibility\". We introduce the notion of information aggregation domain, or simply, domain: composed for a given \"central\" node (user account), a domain is a connected set of nodes whose user-generated content is eligible to be used to meet the central node's information needs. Admitting malicious information sources - \"bad citizen\" nodes - into \"good citizen\" nodes' domains puts the good citizens at risk for disinformation attacks. We show how a platform can limit this risk by exploiting the social link structure between its nodes without the need to know which nodes are good or bad citizens. We introduce Relaxed Clique Percolation (RCP), a class of policies to compose personalized disinformation-resilient domains. Then, we define \"RCP cores\" and show how they can be used to efficiently compose resilient domains for all network nodes at once. Finally, we analyze the properties of RCP domains found in real-world social networks including Slashdot, Facebook, Flickr, and Yelp, to affirm that in practice, RCP domains turn out to be large and spatially diverse.

    "abstract": "Accelerators have become increasingly popular in datacenters due to their cost, performance, and energy benefits. Direct-attached accelerators, where the network stack is implemented in hardware and network traffic bypasses the main CPU, can further enhance these benefits. However, modern datacenter software network stacks are complex, with interleaved protocol layers, network management functions, as well as virtualization support. They also need to flexibly interpose new layers to support new use cases. By contrast, most hardware network stacks only support basic protocol compatibility and are often difficult to extend due to using fixed processing pipelines. This paper proposes Beehive, a new, open-source hardware network stack for direct-attached FPGA accelerators designed to enable flexible and adaptive construction of complex protocol functionality. Our approach is based on a network-on-chip (NoC) substrate, automated tooling for the independent scale-up of protocol elements, compiletime deadlock analysis, and a flexible diagnostics and control plane. Our implementation interoperates with standard Linux TCP and UDP clients, allowing existing RPC clients to interface with the accelerator. We use three applications to illustrate the advantages of our approach: a throughputoriented erasure coding application, an accelerator for distributed consensus operations that reduces the latency and energy cost of linearizability, and TCP live migration support for dynamic server consolidation.

In this work, we develop a novel network architecture that leverages sparse-coding layers to obtain superior robustness to this class of attacks. Three decades of computer science research has studied sparse coding in the context of image denoising, object recognition, and adversarial misclassification settings, but to the best of our knowledge, its connection to state-of-the-art privacy vulnerabilities remains unstudied. However, sparse coding architectures suggest an advantageous means to defend against model inversion attacks because they allow us to control the amount of irrelevant private information encoded in a network's intermediate representations in a manner that can be computed efficiently during training and that is known to have little effect on classification accuracy. Specifically, compared to networks trained with a variety of state-of-the-art defenses, our sparse-coding architectures maintain comparable or higher classification accuracy while degrading state-of-the-art training data reconstructions by factors of 1.1 to 18.3 across a variety of reconstruction quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, FID). This performance advantage holds across 5 datasets ranging from CelebA faces to medical images and CIFAR-10, and across various state-of-the-art SGD-based and GAN-based inversion attacks, including Plug-&-Play attacks.

Inspired by the success of vision-language foundation models, previous efforts achieved zero-shot adversarial robustness by aligning adversarial visual features with text supervision. However, in practice, they are still unsatisfactory due to several issues, including heavy adaptation cost, suboptimal text supervision, and uncontrolled natural generalization capacity. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a few-shot adversarial prompt framework where adapting input sequences with limited data makes significant adversarial robustness improvement. Specifically, we achieve this by providing adversarially correlated text supervision that is end-to-end learned from adversarial examples. We also propose a novel training objective that enhances the consistency of multi-modal features while encourages differentiated uni-modal features between natural and adversarial examples. The proposed framework gives access to learn adversarial text supervision, which provides superior cross-modal adversarial alignment and matches state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness with only 1% training data.

    "abstract": "Modern digital engineering design process commonly involves expensive repeated simulations on varying three-dimensional (3D) geometries. The efficient prediction capability of neural networks (NNs) makes them a suitable surrogate to provide design insights. Nevertheless, few available NNs can handle solution prediction on varying 3D shapes. We present a novel deep operator network (DeepONet) variant called Geom-DeepONet, which encodes parameterized 3D geometries and predicts full-field solutions on an arbitrary number of nodes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature and is our primary novelty. In addition to expressing shapes using mesh coordinates, the signed distance function for each node is evaluated and used to augment the inputs to the trunk network of the Geom-DeepONet, thereby capturing both explicit and implicit representations of the 3D shapes. The powerful geometric encoding capability of a sinusoidal representation network (SIREN) is also exploited by replacing the classical feedforward neural networks in the trunk with SIREN. Additional data fusion between the branch and trunk networks is introduced by an element-wise product. A numerical benchmark was conducted to compare Geom-DeepONet to PointNet and vanilla DeepONet, where results show that our architecture trains fast with a small memory footprint and yields the most accurate results among the three with less than 2 MPa stress error. Results show a much lower generalization error of our architecture on unseen dissimilar designs than vanilla DeepONet. Once trained, the model can predict vector solutions, and speed can be over $10^5$ times faster than implicit finite element simulations for large meshes. ",

Two real-world applications are demonstrated: 1- coupled thermo-mechanical analysis of steel continuous casting with multiple visco-plastic constitutive laws and 2- sequentially coupled direct energy deposition for additive manufacturing. Despite highly challenging spatially variable target stress distributions, DeepONets can infer reasonably accurate full-field temperature and stress solutions several orders of magnitude faster than traditional and highly optimized finite-element analysis (FEA), even when FEA simulations are run on the latest high-performance computing platforms.

We propose a novel localized query function for efficient information retrieval from memory units, aiming to minimize forgetting. Furthermore, we identify a fundamental challenge in continual detection referred to as background relegation. This arises when object categories from earlier tasks reappear in future tasks, potentially without labels, leading them to be implicitly treated as background. This is an inevitable issue in continual detection or segmentation. The introduced continual optimization technique effectively tackles this challenge. Finally, we assess the performance of our proposed system on continual detection benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach surpasses the performance of existing state-of-the-art resulting in 5-7% improvements on MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC on the task of continual detection.

In this new representation, we use several Gaussian distribution components as an alternative to the provided fixation map, which makes the model more robust to the randomness of fixation.

Probabilistic MIL methods, and more specifically Gaussian Processes (GPs), have achieved excellent results due to their high expressiveness and uncertainty quantification capabilities. One of the most successful GP-based MIL methods, VGPMIL, resorts to a variational bound to handle the intractability of the logistic function. Here, we formulate VGPMIL using P\\'olya-Gamma random variables. This approach yields the same variational posterior approximations as the original VGPMIL, which is a consequence of the two representations that the Hyperbolic Secant distribution admits. This leads us to propose a general GP-based MIL method that takes different forms by simply leveraging distributions other than the Hyperbolic Secant one. Using the Gamma distribution we arrive at a new approach that obtains competitive or superior predictive performance and efficiency. This is validated in a comprehensive experimental study including one synthetic MIL dataset, two well-known MIL benchmarks, and a real-world medical problem. We expect that this work provides useful ideas beyond MIL that can foster further research in the field. ",

However, traditional 3D reconstruction with HSI is difficult due to technological limitations of hyperspectral cameras. In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have seen widespread success in creating high quality volumetric 3D representations of scenes captured by a variety of camera models. Leveraging recent advances in NeRFs, we propose computing a hyperspectral 3D reconstruction in which every point in space and view direction is characterized by wavelength-dependent radiance and transmittance spectra. To evaluate our approach, a dataset containing nearly 2000 hyperspectral images across 8 scenes and 2 cameras was collected. We perform comparisons against traditional RGB NeRF baselines and apply ablation testing with alternative spectra representations. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of hyperspectral NeRFs for hyperspectral super-resolution and imaging sensor simulation. We show that our hyperspectral NeRF approach enables creating fast, accurate volumetric 3D hyperspectral scenes and enables several new applications and areas for future study. ",

In this paper, we present a new Transformer-based method, called DSGG, that views scene graph detection as a direct graph prediction problem based on a unique set of graph-aware queries. In particular, each graph-aware query encodes a compact representation of both the node and all of its relations in the graph, acquired through the utilization of a relaxed sub-graph matching during the training process. Moreover, to address the problem of relational semantic overlap, we utilize a strategy for relation distillation, aiming to efficiently learn multiple instances of semantic relationships.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the feature learning ability of two-layer neural networks in the mean-field regime through the lens of kernel methods. To focus on the dynamics of the kernel induced by the first layer, we utilize a two-timescale limit, where the second layer moves much faster than the first layer. In this limit, the learning problem is reduced to the minimization problem over the intrinsic kernel. Then, we show the global convergence of the mean-field Langevin dynamics and derive time and particle discretization error. We also demonstrate that two-layer neural networks can learn a union of multiple reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces more efficiently than any kernel methods, and neural networks acquire data-dependent kernel which aligns with the target function. In addition, we develop a label noise procedure, which converges to the global optimum and show that the degrees of freedom appears as an implicit regularization. ",

    "abstract": "Traffic prediction has long been a focal and pivotal area in research, witnessing both significant strides from city-level to road-level predictions in recent years. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies, autonomous driving, and large-scale models in the traffic domain, lane-level traffic prediction has emerged as an indispensable direction. However, further progress in this field is hindered by the absence of comprehensive and unified evaluation standards, coupled with limited public availability of data and code. This paper extensively analyzes and categorizes existing research in lane-level traffic prediction, establishes a unified spatial topology structure and prediction tasks, and introduces a simple baseline model, GraphMLP, based on graph structure and MLP networks. We have replicated codes not publicly available in existing studies and, based on this, thoroughly and fairly assessed various models in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability, providing insights for practical applications. Additionally, we have released three new datasets and corresponding codes to accelerate progress in this field, all of which can be found on https://github.com/ShuhaoLii/TITS24LaneLevel-Traffic-Benchmark.

    "abstract": "The burdensome training costs on large-scale graphs have aroused significant interest in graph condensation, which involves tuning Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on a small condensed graph for use on the large-scale original graph. Existing methods primarily focus on aligning key metrics between the condensed and original graphs, such as gradients, distribution and trajectory of GNNs, yielding satisfactory performance on downstream tasks. However, these complex metrics necessitate intricate computations and can potentially disrupt the optimization process of the condensation graph, making the condensation process highly demanding and unstable. Motivated by the recent success of simplified models in various fields, we propose a simplified approach to metric alignment in graph condensation, aiming to reduce unnecessary complexity inherited from GNNs. In our approach, we eliminate external parameters and exclusively retain the target condensed graph during the condensation process. Following the hierarchical aggregation principles of GNNs, we introduce the Simple Graph Condensation (SimGC) framework, which aligns the condensed graph with the original graph from the input layer to the prediction layer, guided by a pre-trained Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) model on the original graph. As a result, both graphs possess the similar capability to train GNNs. This straightforward yet effective strategy achieves a significant speedup of up to 10 times compared to existing graph condensation methods while performing on par with state-of-the-art baselines. Comprehensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SimGC in prediction accuracy, condensation time, and generalization capability. Our code will be made publicly available. ",

The study addresses two key challenges: the trivialization of opinions resulting from excessive summarization and the diversion of focus caused by distractor concepts introduced from images. These challenges stem from the inductive (bottom-up) nature of existing debating schemes. To address the issue, we propose a deductive (top-down) debating approach called Blueprint Debate on Graphs (BDoG). In BDoG, debates are confined to a blueprint graph to prevent opinion trivialization through world-level summarization. Moreover, by storing evidence in branches within the graph, BDoG mitigates distractions caused by frequent but irrelevant concepts. Extensive experiments validate BDoG, achieving state-of-the-art results in Science QA and MMBench with significant improvements over previous methods. ",

On this benchmark, we study enhancing SSL geometric representations without sacrificing semantic classification accuracy. We find that leveraging mid-layer representations improves pose-estimation performance by 10-20%. Further, we introduce an unsupervised trajectory-regularization loss, which improves performance by an additional 4% and improves generalization ability on out-of-distribution data.

    "abstract": "To gather a significant quantity of annotated training data for high-performance image classification models, numerous companies opt to enlist third-party providers to label their unlabeled data. This practice is widely regarded as secure, even in cases where some annotated errors occur, as the impact of these minor inaccuracies on the final performance of the models is negligible and existing backdoor attacks require attacker's ability to poison the training images. Nevertheless, in this paper, we propose clean-image backdoor attacks which uncover that backdoors can still be injected via a fraction of incorrect labels without modifying the training images. Specifically, in our attacks, the attacker first seeks a trigger feature to divide the training images into two parts: those with the feature and those without it. Subsequently, the attacker falsifies the labels of the former part to a backdoor class. The backdoor will be finally implanted into the target model after it is trained on the poisoned data. During the inference phase, the attacker can activate the backdoor in two ways: slightly modifying the input image to obtain the trigger feature, or taking an image that naturally has the trigger feature as input. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our attacks. According to the experimental results, we conclude that our attacks seriously jeopardize the fairness and robustness of image classification models, and it is necessary to be vigilant about the incorrect labels in outsourced labeling.

    "abstract": "Due to their flexibility to represent almost any kind of relational data, graph-based models have enjoyed a tremendous success over the past decades. While graphs are inherently only combinatorial objects, however, many prominent analysis tools are based on the algebraic representation of graphs via matrices such as the graph Laplacian, or on associated graph embeddings. Such embeddings associate to each node a set of coordinates in a vector space, a representation which can then be employed for learning tasks such as the classification or alignment of the nodes of the graph. As the geometric picture provided by embedding methods enables the use of a multitude of methods developed for vector space data, embeddings have thus gained interest both from a theoretical as well as a practical perspective. Inspired by trace-optimization problems, often encountered in the analysis of graph-based data, here we present a method to derive ellipsoidal embeddings of the nodes of a graph, in which each node is assigned a set of coordinates on the surface of a hyperellipsoid. Our method may be seen as an alternative to popular spectral embedding techniques, to which it shares certain similarities we discuss. To illustrate the utility of the embedding we conduct a case study in which analyse synthetic and real world networks with modular structure, and compare the results obtained with known methods in the literature.

Conformal prediction (CP) handles uncertainty by predicting a set on a test input, hoping the set to cover the true label with at least $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence. This coverage can be guaranteed on test data even if the marginal distributions $P_X$ differ between calibration and test datasets. However, as it is common in practice, when the conditional distribution $P_{Y|X}$ is different on calibration and test data, the coverage is not guaranteed and it is essential to measure and minimize the coverage loss under distributional shift at \\textit{all} possible confidence levels. To address these issues, we upper bound the coverage difference at all levels using the cumulative density functions of calibration and test conformal scores and Wasserstein distance. Inspired by the invariance of physics across data distributions, we propose a physics-informed structural causal model (PI-SCM) to reduce the upper bound. We validated that PI-SCM can improve coverage robustness along confidence level and test domain on a traffic speed prediction task and an epidemic spread task with multiple real-world datasets. ",

Significant progress has been made in this field in recent years, largely due to the advancement of deep learning techniques. However, existing deep-learning-based CD methods encounter challenges in effectively integrating neighborhood and scale information, resulting in suboptimal performance. Therefore, by exploring the influence patterns of neighborhood and scale information, this paper proposes an Integrated Neighborhood and Scale Information Network (INSINet) for open-pit mine CD in HR remote sensing images. Specifically, INSINet introduces 8-neighborhood-image information to acquire a larger receptive field, improving the recognition of center image boundary regions. Drawing on techniques of skip connection, deep supervision, and attention mechanism, the multi-path deep supervised attention (MDSA) module is designed to enhance multi-scale information fusion and change feature extraction. Experimental analysis reveals that incorporating neighborhood and scale information enhances the F1 score of INSINet by 6.40%, with improvements of 3.08% and 3.32% respectively. INSINet outperforms existing methods with an Overall Accuracy of 97.69%, Intersection over Union of 71.26%, and F1 score of 83.22%.

    "abstract": "Recent methods utilize graph contrastive Learning within graph-structured user-item interaction data for collaborative filtering and have demonstrated their efficacy in recommendation tasks. However, they ignore that the difference relation density of nodes between the user- and item-side causes the adaptability of graphs on bilateral nodes to be different after multi-hop graph interaction calculation, which limits existing models to achieve ideal results. To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework for recommendation tasks called Bilateral Unsymmetrical Graph Contrastive Learning (BusGCL) that consider the bilateral unsymmetry on user-item node relation density for sliced user and item graph reasoning better with bilateral slicing contrastive training. Especially, taking into account the aggregation ability of hypergraph-based graph convolutional network (GCN) in digging implicit similarities is more suitable for user nodes, embeddings generated from three different modules: hypergraph-based GCN, GCN and perturbed GCN, are sliced into two subviews by the user- and item-side respectively, and selectively combined into subview pairs bilaterally based on the characteristics of inter-node relation structure. Furthermore, to align the distribution of user and item embeddings after aggregation, a dispersing loss is leveraged to adjust the mutual distance between all embeddings for maintaining learning ability. Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets have proved the superiority of BusGCL in comparison to various recommendation methods.

The literature on GNN highlights the potential of this evolving research area and its widespread adoption in real-life applications. However, most of the approaches are either new in concept or derived from specific techniques. Therefore, the potential of more than one approach in hybrid form has not been studied extensively, which can be well utilized for sequenced data or static data together. We derive a hybrid approach based on two established techniques as generalized aggregation networks and topology adaptive graph convolution networks that solve our purpose to apply on both types of sequenced and static nature of data, effectively. The proposed method applies to both node and graph classification. Our empirical analysis reveals that the results are at par with literature results and better for handwritten strokes as sequenced data, where graph structures have not been explored. ",

While much research focuses on utilizing ML and DL to tackle security challenges, there is often a tendency to overlook the practicality and feasibility of implementing these methods in real-time settings. This oversight stems from the constrained processing power and memory of certain devices (IoT devices), as well as concerns about the generalizability of these approaches. Focusing on the detection of DNS-tunneling attacks in a router as a case study, we present an end-to-end process designed to effectively address these challenges. The process spans from developing a lightweight DNS-tunneling detection model to integrating it into a resource-constrained device for real-time detection. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that utilizing stateless features for training the ML model, along with features chosen to be independent of the network configuration, leads to highly accurate results. The deployment of this carefully crafted model, optimized for embedded devices across diverse environments, resulted in high DNS-tunneling attack detection with minimal latency. With this work, we aim to encourage solutions that strike a balance between theoretical advancements and the practical applicability of ML approaches in the ever-evolving landscape of device security.

As layers going deeper, the regularization effect will gradually increase, instead of directly adding excessive regular constraints to the output layer of the model as in Deep VIB.

The feedback process is based on reparameterization trick for effective training. This work performs an extensive analysis on MNIST dataset to verify the effectiveness of each VIB cells, and provides an insightful analysis on how the VIB cells affect mutual information. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 also prove that our cellVIB is robust against noisy labels during training and against corrupted images during testing.

This assumption can be easily violated since real world datasets can be extremely class imbalanced in nature, thus making the performance of semi-supervised object detectors far from satisfactory. Besides, the research for this problem in SSOD is severely under-explored. To bridge this research gap, we comprehensively study the class imbalance problem for SSOD under more challenging scenarios, thus forming the first experimental setting for class imbalanced SSOD (CI-SSOD). Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective gradient-based sampling framework that tackles the class imbalance problem from the perspective of two types of confirmation biases. To tackle confirmation bias towards majority classes, the gradient-based reweighting and gradient-based thresholding modules leverage the gradients from each class to fully balance the influence of the majority and minority classes. To tackle the confirmation bias from incorrect pseudo labels of minority classes, the class-rebalancing sampling module resamples unlabeled data following the guidance of the gradient-based reweighting module. Experiments on three proposed sub-tasks, namely MS-COCO, MS-COCO to Object365 and LVIS, suggest that our method outperforms current class imbalanced object detectors by clear margins, serving as a baseline for future research in CI-SSOD.

In particular, we study the benefits of soft handover in the uplink from the physical-layer point of view. We give a realistic model for both the ground-to-satellite and the inter-satellite links, following the 3GPP channel model for the former. We suppose that, during handover from a serving satellite to a target satellite, one of the two satellites forwards the received signal from the ground user to the other, thus acting as a relay. We quantify through simulations the loss of hard handover, compared to soft handover. For the latter, we test both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying techniques and verify that, at least in the simulated conditions, DF does not repay, in terms of block error rate (BLER), the increase of complexity with respect to AF. Also, we study the effect of the LEO constellation size on the network BLER. Finally, we show that, with soft handover, the impact of misalignment on the inter-satellite link is severe, especially at optical frequencies. ",

More particularly, an STAR-RIS is deployed to assist in the information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), where two practical STAR-RIS operating protocols, namely energy splitting (ES) and time switching (TS), are employed. Under the imperfect channel state information (CSI) condition, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) framework, that simultaneously maximizes the minimum data rate and minimum harvested power, is employed to investigate the fundamental rate-energy trade-off between IUs and EUs. To obtain the optimal robust resource allocation strategy, the MOOP is first transformed into a single-objective optimization problem (SOOP) via the {\\epsilon}-constraint method, which is then reformulated by approximating semi-infinite inequality constraints with the S-procedure. For ES, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is proposed to jointly design AP active beamforming and STAR-RIS passive beamforming, where a penalty method is leveraged in STAR-RIS beamforming design. Furthermore, the developed algorithm is extended to optimize the time allocation policy and beamforming vectors in a two-layer iterative manner for TS. Numerical results reveal that: 1) deploying STAR-RISs achieves a significant performance gain over conventional RISs, especially in terms of harvested power for EUs; 2) the ES protocol obtains a better user fairness performance when focusing only on IUs or EUs, while the TS protocol yields a better balance between IUs and EUs; 3) the imperfect CSI affects IUs more significantly than EUs, whereas TS can confer a more robust design to attenuate these effects.

    "abstract": "Code completion is a key feature of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), aimed at predicting the next tokens a developer is likely to write, helping them write code faster and with less effort. Modern code completion approaches are often powered by deep learning (DL) models. However, the swift evolution of programming languages poses a critical challenge to the performance of DL-based code completion models: Can these models generalize across different language versions? This paper delves into such a question. In particular, we assess the capabilities of a state-of-the-art model, CodeT5, to generalize across nine different Java versions, ranging from Java 2 to Java 17, while being exclusively trained on Java 8 code. Our evaluation spans three completion scenarios, namely, predicting tokens, constructs (e.g., the condition of an if statement) and entire code blocks. The results of our study reveal a noticeable disparity among language versions, with the worst performance being obtained in Java 2 and 17 - the most far apart versions compared to Java 8. We investigate possible causes for the performance degradation and show that the adoption of a limited version-specific fine-tuning can partially alleviate the problem. Our work raises awareness on the importance of continuous model refinement, and it can inform the design of alternatives to make code completion models more robust to language evolution. ",

    "abstract": "Target class classification is a mixed classification and transition model whose integrated goal is to assign objects to a certain, so called target or normal class. The classification process is iterative, and in each step an object in a certain class undergoes an action attached to that class, initiating the transition of the object to one of the classes. The sequence of transitions, which we call class transitions, must be designed to provide the final assignment of objects to the target class. The transition process can be described in the form of a directed graph, and the success of the final classification is mainly due to the properties of this graph. In our previous research we showed that the desirable structure of the transition graph is an oriented rooted tree with orientation towards the root vertex, which corresponds to the normal class. It is clear that the transition graph of an arbitrary algorithm (policy) may not have this property. In this paper we study the structure of realistic transition graphs, which makes it possible to find classification inconsistencies, helping to transfer it into the desired form. The medical interpretation of dynamic treatment regime considered in the article further clarifies the investigated framework. ",

Motivated by that, in this study, we explore a task-agnostic representation derived through SSL in the context of detecting major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using audio and video data collected during interactive sessions. This study employs SSL models trained by predicting multiple fixed targets or masked frames. We propose a list of fixed targets to make the generated representation more efficient for detecting MDD and PTSD. Furthermore, we modify the hyper-parameters of the SSL encoder predicting fixed targets to generate global representations that capture varying temporal contexts. Both these innovations are noted to yield improved detection performances for considered mental disorders and exhibit task-agnostic traits. In the context of the SSL model predicting masked frames, the generated global representations are also noted to exhibit task-agnostic traits. ",

To achieve progressively improving solutions with minimal sampling, we introduce a method that combines round-wise Stochastic Beam Search with an update strategy derived from a provable policy improvement. This strategy refines the policy between rounds by utilizing the advantage of the sampled sequences with almost no computational overhead. We evaluate our approach on the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. The models trained with our method achieve comparable performance and generalization to those trained with expert data.

TLP is composed of two connected microarchitectural perceptron predictors, named First Level Predictor (FLP) and Second Level Predictor (SLP). FLP performs accurate off-chip prediction by using several program features based on virtual addresses and a novel selective delay component. The novelty of SLP relies on leveraging off-chip prediction to drive L1D prefetch filtering by using physical addresses and the FLP prediction as features. TLP constitutes the first hardware proposal targeting both off-chip prediction and prefetch filtering using a multi-level perceptron hardware approach. TLP only requires 7KB of storage. To demonstrate the benefits of TLP we compare its performance with state-of-the-art approaches using off-chip prediction and prefetch filtering on a wide range of single-core and multi-core workloads. Our experiments show that TLP reduces the average DRAM transactions by 30.7% and 17.7%, as compared to a baseline using state-of-the-art cache prefetchers but no off-chip prediction mechanism, across the single-core and multi-core workloads, respectively, while recent work significantly increases DRAM transactions. As a result, TLP achieves geometric mean performance speedups of 6.2% and 11.8% across single-core and multi-core workloads, respectively. In addition, our evaluation demonstrates that TLP is effective independently of the L1D prefetching logic. ",

However, such fusion-based methods remain unexplored for place recognition, an equally important task for autonomous systems. Given that place recognition relies on the similarity between a query scene and the corresponding candidate scene, the stationary background of a scene is expected to play a crucial role in the task. As such, current well-designed camera-radar fusion methods for 3D object detection can hardly take effect in place recognition because they mainly focus on dynamic foreground objects. In this paper, a background-attentive camera-radar fusion-based method, named CRPlace, is proposed to generate background-attentive global descriptors from multi-view images and radar point clouds for accurate place recognition. To extract stationary background features effectively, we design an adaptive module that generates the background-attentive mask by utilizing the camera BEV feature and radar dynamic points. With the guidance of a background mask, we devise a bidirectional cross-attention-based spatial fusion strategy to facilitate comprehensive spatial interaction between the background information of the camera BEV feature and the radar BEV feature. As the first camera-radar fusion-based place recognition network, CRPlace has been evaluated thoroughly on the nuScenes dataset.

Consequently, these models often perform poorly on functional languages such as Haskell. To investigate whether this can be alleviated, we evaluate the performance of two language models for code, CodeGPT and UniXcoder, on the functional programming language Haskell. We fine-tune and evaluate the models on Haskell functions sourced from a publicly accessible Haskell dataset on HuggingFace. Additionally, we manually evaluate the models using our novel translated HumanEval dataset. Our automatic evaluation shows that knowledge of imperative programming languages in the pre-training of LLMs may not transfer well to functional languages, but that code completion on functional languages is feasible. Consequently, this shows the need for more high-quality Haskell datasets. A manual evaluation on HumanEval-Haskell indicates CodeGPT frequently generates empty predictions and extra comments, while UniXcoder more often produces incomplete or incorrect predictions. Finally, we release HumanEval-Haskell, along with the fine-tuned models and all code required to reproduce our experiments on GitHub (https://github.com/AISE-TUDelft/HaskellCCEval). ",

    "abstract": "WebAssembly has gained significant traction as a high-performance, secure, and portable compilation target for the Web and beyond. However, its growing adoption has also introduced new security challenges. One such threat is cryptojacking, where websites mine cryptocurrencies on visitors' devices without their knowledge or consent, often through the use of WebAssembly. While detection methods have been proposed, research on circumventing them remains limited. In this paper, we present the most comprehensive evaluation of code obfuscation techniques for WebAssembly to date, assessing their effectiveness, detectability, and overhead across multiple abstraction levels. We obfuscate a diverse set of applications, including utilities, games, and crypto miners, using state-of-the-art obfuscation tools like Tigress and wasm-mutate, as well as our novel tool, emcc-obf. Our findings suggest that obfuscation can effectively produce dissimilar WebAssembly binaries, with Tigress proving most effective, followed by emcc-obf and wasm-mutate. The impact on the resulting native code is also significant, although the V8 engine's TurboFan optimizer can reduce native code size by 30\\% on average. Notably, we find that obfuscation can successfully evade state-of-the-art cryptojacking detectors. Although obfuscation can introduce substantial performance overheads, we demonstrate how obfuscation can be used for evading detection with minimal overhead in real-world scenarios by strategically applying transformations. These insights are valuable for researchers, providing a foundation for developing more robust detection methods. Additionally, we make our dataset of over 20,000 obfuscated WebAssembly binaries and the emcc-obf tool publicly available to stimulate further research. ",

In the case where uncertainty stems from the presence of adversarial attacks this need is becoming more prominent. In this paper we focus on linear and nonlinear classification problems and propose a novel adversarial training method for robust classifiers, inspired by Support Vector Machine (SVM) margins. We view robustness under a data driven lens, and derive finite sample complexity bounds for both linear and non-linear classifiers in binary and multi-class scenarios. Notably, our bounds match natural classifiers' complexity. Our algorithm minimizes a worst-case surrogate loss using Linear Programming (LP) and Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) for linear and non-linear models. Numerical experiments on the benchmark MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets show our approach's comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, without needing adversarial examples during training. Our work offers a comprehensive framework for enhancing binary linear and non-linear classifier robustness, embedding robustness in learning under the presence of adversaries. ",

However, current models often fail to detect pedestrians in obvious cases, especially due to the modality bias learned from statistically biased datasets. From these problems, we anticipate that maybe understanding the complementary information itself is difficult to achieve from vision-only models. Accordingly, we propose a novel Multispectral Chain-of-Thought Detection (MSCoTDet) framework, which incorporates Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the complementary information at the semantic level and further enhance the fusion process. Specifically, we generate text descriptions of the pedestrian in each RGB and thermal modality and design a Multispectral Chain-of-Thought (MSCoT) prompting, which models a step-by-step process to facilitate cross-modal reasoning at the semantic level and perform accurate detection. Moreover, we design a Language-driven Multi-modal Fusion (LMF) strategy that enables fusing vision-driven and language-driven detections.

For this, we implement content-level and network-level metrics to assess whether synthetic captions are realistic. The second objective (utility) is to create synthetic data that is useful for sponsored content detection. For this, we evaluate the effectiveness of the generated synthetic data for training classifiers to identify undisclosed advertisements on Instagram. Our investigations show that the objectives of fidelity and utility may conflict and that prompt engineering is a useful but insufficient strategy.

However, the degree of stylization achieved by existing methods is often not sufficient for practical applications because they are mostly based on statistical 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) with limited variations. To this end, we propose a method that can produce a highly stylized 3D face model with desired topology. Our methods train a surface deformation network with 3DMM and translate its domain to the target style using a paired exemplar. The network achieves stylization of the 3D face mesh by mimicking the style of the target using a differentiable renderer and directional CLIP losses. Additionally, during the inference process, we utilize a Mesh Agnostic Encoder (MAGE) that takes deformation target, a mesh of diverse topologies as input to the stylization process and encodes its shape into our latent space. The resulting stylized face model can be animated by commonly used 3DMM blend shapes. A set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our method can produce highly stylized face meshes according to a given style and output them in a desired topology. We also demonstrate example applications of our method including image-based stylized avatar generation, linear interpolation of geometric styles, and facial animation of stylized avatars. ",

In our study, we assess the current trends in the field and the importance of incorporating code into the training of large language models. Additionally, we examine publicly available datasets to see whether these models can be trained on them without the risk of legal issues in the future. To accomplish this, we compiled a list of 53 large language models trained on file-level code. We then extracted their datasets and analyzed how much they overlap with a dataset we created, consisting exclusively of strong copyleft code. Our analysis revealed that every dataset we examined contained license inconsistencies, despite being selected based on their associated repository licenses. We analyzed a total of 514 million code files, discovering 38 million exact duplicates present in our strong copyleft dataset. Additionally, we examined 171 million file-leading comments, identifying 16 million with strong copyleft licenses and another 11 million comments that discouraged copying without explicitly mentioning a license. Based on the findings of our study, which highlights the pervasive issue of license inconsistencies in large language models trained on code, our recommendation for both researchers and the community is to prioritize the development and adoption of best practices for dataset creation and management.

    "abstract": "NSEC3 is a proof of non-existence in DNSSEC, which provides an authenticated assertion that a queried resource does not exist in the target domain. NSEC3 consists of alphabetically sorted hashed names before and after the queried hostname. To make dictionary attacks harder, the hash function can be applied in multiple iterations, which however also increases the load on the DNS resolver during the computation of the SHA-1 hashes in NSEC3 records. Concerns about the load created by the computation of NSEC3 records on the DNS resolvers were already considered in the NSEC3 specifications RFC5155 and RFC9276. In February 2024, the potential of NSEC3 to exhaust DNS resolvers' resources was assigned a CVE-2023-50868, confirming that extra iterations of NSEC3 created substantial load. However, there is no published evaluation of the attack and the impact of the attack on the resolvers was not clarified. In this work we perform the first evaluation of the NSEC3-encloser attack against DNS resolver implementations and find that the NSEC3-encloser attack can still create a 72x increase in CPU instruction count, despite the victim resolver following RFC5155 recommendations in limiting hash iteration counts. The impact of the attack varies across the different DNS resolvers, but we show that with a sufficient volume of DNS packets the attack can increase CPU load and cause packet loss. We find that at a rate of 150 malicious NSEC3 records per second, depending on the DNS implementation, the loss rate of benign DNS requests varies between 2.7% and 30%. We provide a detailed description and implementation the NSEC3-encloser attack along with evaluation against five popular DNS resolver implementations. We also develop the first analysis how each NSEC3 parameter impacts the load inflicted on the victim resolver during NSEC3-encloser attack. ",

However, objects in the BEV representation typically exhibit small sizes, and the associated point cloud context is inherently sparse, which leads to great challenges for reliable 3D perception. In this paper, we propose IS-Fusion, an innovative multimodal fusion framework that jointly captures the Instance- and Scene-level contextual information. IS-Fusion essentially differs from existing approaches that only focus on the BEV scene-level fusion by explicitly incorporating instance-level multimodal information, thus facilitating the instance-centric tasks like 3D object detection. It comprises a Hierarchical Scene Fusion (HSF) module and an Instance-Guided Fusion (IGF) module. HSF applies Point-to-Grid and Grid-to-Region transformers to capture the multimodal scene context at different granularities. IGF mines instance candidates, explores their relationships, and aggregates the local multimodal context for each instance. These instances then serve as guidance to enhance the scene feature and yield an instance-aware BEV representation. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, IS-Fusion outperforms all the published multimodal works to date. Code is available at: https://github.com/yinjunbo/IS-Fusion. ",

The lack of efficient labeling approaches inspired us to consider self-supervised learning as a paradigm shift, learning meaningful feature representations from raw agricultural image data. In this work, we explore how self-supervised representation learning unlocks the potential applicability to diverse agriculture vision tasks by eliminating the need for large-scale annotated datasets. We propose a lightweight framework utilizing SimCLR, a contrastive learning approach, to pre-train a ResNet-50 backbone on a large, unannotated dataset of real-world agriculture field images. Our experimental analysis and results indicate that the model learns robust features applicable to a broad range of downstream agriculture tasks discussed in the paper.

In contrast to graph-theoretic shortest paths, our agents route their traffic along greedy paths, which are sequences of nodes where the distance in the metric space to the respective target node gets strictly smaller by each hop. Besides enabling greedy routing, the agents also optimize their connection quality within the created network by constructing greedy paths with low stretch. This ensures that greedy routing is always possible in equilibrium networks, while realistically modeling the agents' incentives for local structural changes to the network. With this we augment the elegant network creation model by Moscibroda, Schmidt, and Wattenhofer (PODC'06) with the feature of greedy routing. For our model, we analyze the existence of (approximate)-equilibria and the computational hardness in different underlying metric spaces. E.g., we characterize the set of equilibria in 1-2-metrics and tree metrics, we show that in both metrics Nash equilibria always exist, and we prove that the well-known $\\Theta$-graph construction yields constant-approximate Nash equilibria in Euclidean space. The latter justifies distributed network construction via $\\Theta$-graphs from a new point-of-view, since it shows that this powerful technique not only guarantees networks having a low stretch but also networks that are almost stable.

Building upon the foundations of the State-of-the-Art (SotA) camera-only BEVDet architecture, CR3DT demonstrates substantial improvements in both detection and tracking capabilities, by incorporating the spatial and velocity information of the RADAR sensor. Experimental results demonstrate an absolute improvement in detection performance of 5.3% in mean Average Precision (mAP) and a 14.9% increase in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (AMOTA) on the nuScenes dataset when leveraging both modalities.

Therefore, the form of point annotations is proposed to offer significant prospects for practical applications in 3D detection, which is not only more accessible and less expensive but also provides strong spatial information for object localization.In this paper, we empirically discover that it is non-trivial to merely adapt Point-DETR to its 3D form, encountering two main bottlenecks: 1) it fails to encode strong 3D prior into the model, and 2) it generates low-quality pseudo labels in distant regions due to the extreme sparsity of LiDAR points. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Point-DETR3D, a teacher-student framework for weakly semi-supervised 3D detection, designed to fully capitalize on point-wise supervision within a constrained instance-wise annotation budget.Different from Point-DETR which encodes 3D positional information solely through a point encoder, we propose an explicit positional query initialization strategy to enhance the positional prior. Considering the low quality of pseudo labels at distant regions produced by the teacher model, we enhance the detector's perception by incorporating dense imagery data through a novel Cross-Modal Deformable RoI Fusion (D-RoI).Moreover, an innovative point-guided self-supervised learning technique is proposed to allow for fully exploiting point priors, even in student models.Extensive experiments on representative nuScenes dataset demonstrate our Point-DETR3D obtains significant improvements compared to previous works. Notably, with only 5% of labeled data, Point-DETR3D achieves over 90% performance of its fully supervised counterpart. ",

Willems' lemma provides a data-based prediction model allowing a control designer to bypass the step of identifying a state-space or transfer function model.

This avoids the need for regularisers in the predictive control problem that are found in other data-driven predictive control methods. It also gives a closed form expression for the optimal (minimum variance) unbiased predictor of the future output trajectory and applies it for predictive control.

We initiate our study with a comprehensive categorization of the biases into background, nearby-object, tied-object, substance (in style re-contextualization), and pose biases. These biases manifest in the generated images due to their entanglement into the subject embedding. This undesired embedding entanglement not only results in the reflection of biases from the reference images into the generated images but also notably diminishes the alignment of the generated images with the given generation prompt. To address this challenge, we propose SID~(Selectively Informative Description), a text description strategy that deviates from the prevalent approach of only characterizing the subject's class identification. SID is generated utilizing multimodal GPT-4 and can be seamlessly integrated into optimization-based models.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach named CoLLEGe (Concept Learning with Language Embedding Generation) to modernize few-shot concept learning. CoLLEGe is a meta-learning framework capable of generating flexible embeddings for new concepts using a small number of example sentences or definitions. Our primary meta-learning objective is simply to facilitate a language model to make next word predictions in forthcoming sentences, making it compatible with language model pretraining.

Traditional power-flow-based tools for assessing cascading blackout risk are too slow to properly explore the space of possible failures and load/generation patterns. We add to the growing literature of faster graph-neural-network (GNN)-based techniques, developing two novel techniques for the estimation of blackout magnitude from initial grid conditions. First we propose several methods for employing an initial classification step to filter out safe \"non blackout\" scenarios prior to magnitude estimation. Second, using insights from the statistical properties of cascading blackouts, we propose a method for facilitating non-local message passing in our GNN models. We validate these two approaches on a large simulated dataset, and show the potential of both to increase blackout size estimation performance. ",

To overcome these challenges, we present ARSim, a fully automated, comprehensive, modular framework designed to enhance real multi-view image data with 3D synthetic objects of interest. The proposed method integrates domain adaptation and randomization strategies to address covariate shift between real and simulated data by inferring essential domain attributes from real data and employing simulation-based randomization for other attributes. We construct a simplified virtual scene using real data and strategically place 3D synthetic assets within it. Illumination is achieved by estimating light distribution from multiple images capturing the surroundings of the vehicle. Camera parameters from real data are employed to render synthetic assets in each frame. The resulting augmented multi-view consistent dataset is used to train a multi-camera perception network for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results on various AV perception tasks demonstrate the superior performance of networks trained on the augmented dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Automating real-time anomaly detection is essential for identifying rare transients in the era of large-scale astronomical surveys. Modern survey telescopes are generating tens of thousands of alerts per night, and future telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are projected to increase this number dramatically. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for astronomical transients rely either on hand-crafted features extracted from light curves or on features generated through unsupervised representation learning, which are then coupled with standard machine learning anomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach to detecting anomalies: using the penultimate layer of a neural network classifier as the latent space for anomaly detection. We then propose a novel method, named Multi-Class Isolation Forests (MCIF), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for a light curve from the latent space representation given by the classifier. This approach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest. We also use a simpler input method for real-time transient classifiers which circumvents the need for interpolation in light curves and helps the neural network model inter-passband relationships and handle irregular sampling. Our anomaly detection pipeline identifies rare classes including kilonovae, pair-instability supernovae, and intermediate luminosity transients shortly after trigger on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Using a sample of our simulations that matched the population of anomalies expected in nature (54 anomalies and 12,040 common transients), our method was able to discover $41\\pm3$ anomalies (~75% recall) after following up the top 2000 (~15%) ranked transients. Our novel method shows that classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly detection. ",

Given that the objective involves non-convex, non-smooth probabilistic functions that are often intractable to optimize, existing methods resort to approximations rather than exact solutions. To tackle the challenge, we introduce an exact mixed-integer exponential conic reformulation of the problem, which can be solved into a global optimum with a moderate amount of input data. Subsequently, we propose a convex approximation, demonstrating its superiority over current state-of-the-art methodologies in literature.

The decision problem whether an edge in a graph is relating is NP-complete. We prove that the problem remains NP-complete when the input is restricted to graphs without cycles of length $6$. This is an unexpected result because recognizing relating edges is known to be polynomially solvable for graphs without cycles of lengths $4$ and $6$, graphs without cycles of lengths $5$ and $6$, and graphs without cycles of lengths $6$ and $7$.

For this problem, a coded federated learning framework has been proposed, where the central server aggregates gradients received from the non-stragglers and gradient computed from a privacy-preservation global coded dataset to mitigate the negative impact of the stragglers. However, when aggregating these gradients, fixed weights are consistently applied across iterations, neglecting the generation process of the global coded dataset and the dynamic nature of the trained model over iterations. This oversight may result in diminished learning performance. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new method named adaptive coded federated learning (ACFL). In ACFL, before the training, each device uploads a coded local dataset with additive noise to the central server to generate a global coded dataset under privacy preservation requirements. During each iteration of the training, the central server aggregates the gradients received from the non-stragglers and the gradient computed from the global coded dataset, where an adaptive policy for varying the aggregation weights is designed. Under this policy, we optimize the performance in terms of privacy and learning, where the learning performance is analyzed through convergence analysis and the privacy performance is characterized via mutual information differential privacy. Finally, we perform simulations to demonstrate the superiority of ACFL compared with the non-adaptive methods. ",

However, it is often the case that only an aggregate consequence of such edge weights that characterize relations may be directly observable, as in protein expression of in gene regulatory networks. Thus, learning edge weights poses a significant challenge that is further exacerbated for intricate and large-scale networks. In this article, we address a model problem to determine the strength of sign-indefinite relations that explain marginal distributions that constitute our data. To this end, we develop a paradigm akin to that of the Schr\\\"odinger bridge problem and an efficient Sinkhorn type algorithm (more properly, Schr\\\"odinger-Fortet-Sinkhorn algorithm) that allows fast convergence to parameters that minimize a relative entropy/likelihood criterion between the sought signed adjacency matrix and a prior. The formalism that we present represents a novel generalization of the earlier Schr\\\"odinger formalism in that marginal computations may incorporate weights that model directionality in underlying relations, and further, that it can be extended to high-order networks -- the Schr\\\"odinger-Fortet-Sinkhorn algorithm that we derive is applicable all the same and allows geometric convergence to a sought sign-indefinite adjacency matrix or tensor, for high-order networks.

    "title": "Integrating multiscale topology in digital pathology with pyramidal  graph convolutional networks",
    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to multiple instance learning with convolutional neural networks in digital pathology, offering superior handling of structural information across various spatial ranges - a crucial aspect of learning from gigapixel H&E-stained whole slide images (WSI). However, graph message-passing algorithms often suffer from oversmoothing when aggregating a large neighborhood. Hence, effective modeling of multi-range interactions relies on the careful construction of the graph. Our proposed multi-scale GCN (MS-GCN) tackles this issue by leveraging information across multiple magnification levels in WSIs. MS-GCN enables the simultaneous modeling of long-range structural dependencies at lower magnifications and high-resolution cellular details at higher magnifications, akin to analysis pipelines usually conducted by pathologists. The architecture's unique configuration allows for the concurrent modeling of structural patterns at lower magnifications and detailed cellular features at higher ones, while also quantifying the contribution of each magnification level to the prediction. Through testing on different datasets, MS-GCN demonstrates superior performance over existing single-magnification GCN methods. The enhancement in performance and interpretability afforded by our method holds promise for advancing computational pathology models, especially in tasks requiring extensive spatial context. ",

    "abstract": "The present study introduces an advanced multi-physics and multi-scale modeling approach to investigate in silico colon motility. We introduce a generalized electromechanical framework, integrating cellular electrophysiology and smooth muscle contractility, thus advancing a first-of-its-kind computational model of laser tissue soldering after incision resection. The proposed theoretical framework comprises three main elements: a microstructural material model describing intestine wall geometry and composition of reinforcing fibers, with four fiber families, two active-conductive and two passive; an electrophysiological model describing the propagation of slow waves, based on a fully-coupled nonlinear phenomenological approach; and a thermodynamical consistent mechanical model describing the hyperelastic energetic contributions ruling tissue equilibrium under diverse loading conditions. The active strain approach was adopted to describe tissue electromechanics by exploiting the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient for each active fiber family and solving the governing equations via a staggered finite element scheme. The computational framework was fine-tuned according to state-of-the-art experimental evidence, and extensive numerical analyses allowed us to compare manometric traces computed via numerical simulations with those obtained clinically in human patients. The model proved capable of reproducing both qualitatively and quantitatively high or low-amplitude propagation contractions. Colon motility after laser tissue soldering demonstrates that material properties and couplings of the deposited tissue are critical to reproducing a physiological muscular contraction, thus restoring a proper peristaltic activity.

    "abstract": "Developing algorithms for accurate and comprehensive neural decoding of mental contents is one of the long-cherished goals in the field of neuroscience and brain-machine interfaces. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of neural decoding by training machine learning models to map brain activity patterns into a semantic vector representation of stimuli. These vectors, hereafter referred as pretrained feature vectors, are usually derived from semantic spaces based solely on image and/or text features and therefore they might have a totally different characteristics than how visual stimuli is represented in the human brain, resulting in limiting the capability of brain decoders to learn this mapping. To address this issue, we propose a representation learning framework, termed brain-grounding of semantic vectors, which fine-tunes pretrained feature vectors to better align with the neural representation of visual stimuli in the human brain. We trained this model this model with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of 150 different visual stimuli categories, and then performed zero-shot brain decoding and identification analyses on 1) fMRI and 2) magnetoencephalography (MEG). Interestingly, we observed that by using the brain-grounded vectors, the brain decoding and identification accuracy on brain data from different neuroimaging modalities increases. These findings underscore the potential of incorporating a richer array of brain-derived features to enhance performance of brain decoding algorithms. ",

    "title": "Flip-Breakability: A Combinatorial Dichotomy for Monadically Dependent  Graph Classes",
    "abstract": "A conjecture in algorithmic model theory predicts that the model-checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on a hereditary graph class if and only if the class is monadically dependent. Originating in model theory, this notion is defined in terms of logic, and encompasses nowhere dense classes, monadically stable classes, and classes of bounded twin-width. Working towards this conjecture, we provide the first two combinatorial characterizations of monadically dependent graph classes. This yields the following dichotomy. On the structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by a Ramsey-theoretic property called flip-breakability. This notion generalizes the notions of uniform quasi-wideness, flip-flatness, and bounded grid rank, which characterize nowhere denseness, monadic stability, and bounded twin-width, respectively, and played a key role in their respective model checking algorithms. Natural restrictions of flip-breakability additionally characterize bounded treewidth and cliquewidth and bounded treedepth and shrubdepth. On the non-structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by explicitly listing few families of forbidden induced subgraphs. This result is analogous to the characterization of nowhere denseness via forbidden subdivided cliques, and allows us to resolve one half of the motivating conjecture: First-order model checking is AW[$*$]-hard on every hereditary graph class that is monadically independent. The result moreover implies that hereditary graph classes which are small, have almost bounded twin-width, or have almost bounded flip-width, are monadically dependent. Lastly, we lift our result to also obtain a combinatorial dichotomy in the more general setting of monadically dependent classes of binary structures. ",

In this work, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) approach to (approximately) solve robust utility optimization problems in general and realistic settings. In particular, we model both the investor and the market by neural networks (NN) and train them in a mini-max zero-sum game. This approach is applicable for any continuous utility function and in realistic market settings with trading costs, where only observable information of the market can be used. A large empirical study shows the versatile usability of our method. Whenever an optimal reference strategy is available, our method performs on par with it and in the (many) settings without known optimal strategy, our method outperforms all other reference strategies. Moreover, we can conclude from our study that the trained path-dependent strategies do not outperform Markovian ones. Lastly, we uncover that our generative approach for learning optimal, (non-) robust investments under trading costs generates universally applicable alternatives to well known asymptotic strategies of idealized settings.
