    "title": "PreRoutGNN for Timing Prediction with Order Preserving Partition: Global  Circuit Pre-training, Local Delay Learning and Attentional Cell Modeling",
    "abstract": "Pre-routing timing prediction has been recently studied for evaluating the quality of a candidate cell placement in chip design. It involves directly estimating the timing metrics for both pin-level (slack, slew) and edge-level (net delay, cell delay), without time-consuming routing. However, it often suffers from signal decay and error accumulation due to the long timing paths in large-scale industrial circuits. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage approach. First, we propose global circuit training to pre-train a graph auto-encoder that learns the global graph embedding from circuit netlist. Second, we use a novel node updating scheme for message passing on GCN, following the topological sorting sequence of the learned graph embedding and circuit graph. This scheme residually models the local time delay between two adjacent pins in the updating sequence, and extracts the lookup table information inside each cell via a new attention mechanism. To handle large-scale circuits efficiently, we introduce an order preserving partition scheme that reduces memory consumption while maintaining the topological dependencies. Experiments on 21 real world circuits achieve a new SOTA R2 of 0.93 for slack prediction, which is significantly surpasses 0.59 by previous SOTA method.

    "abstract": "Source detection in graphs has demonstrated robust efficacy in the domain of rumor source identification. Although recent solutions have enhanced performance by leveraging deep neural networks, they often require complete user data. In this paper, we address a more challenging task, rumor source detection with incomplete user data, and propose a novel framework, i.e., Source Detection in Graphs with Incomplete Nodes via Positional Encoding and Attentive Fusion (GIN-SD), to tackle this challenge. Specifically, our approach utilizes a positional embedding module to distinguish nodes that are incomplete and employs a self-attention mechanism to focus on nodes with greater information transmission capacity. To mitigate the prediction bias caused by the significant disparity between the numbers of source and non-source nodes, we also introduce a class-balancing mechanism. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of GIN-SD and its superiority to state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the notion of federated learning (FL) has led to the new paradigm of distributed artificial intelligence (AI) with privacy preservation. However, most current FL systems suffer from data privacy issues due to the requirement of a trusted third party. Although some previous works introduce differential privacy to protect the data, however, it may also significantly deteriorate the model performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel decentralized collaborative AI framework, named Auditable Homomorphic-based Decentralised Collaborative AI (AerisAI), to improve security with homomorphic encryption and fine-grained differential privacy. Our proposed AerisAI directly aggregates the encrypted parameters with a blockchain-based smart contract to get rid of the need of a trusted third party. We also propose a brand-new concept for eliminating the negative impacts of differential privacy for model performance. Moreover, the proposed AerisAI also provides the broadcast-aware group key management based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CPABE) to achieve fine-grained access control based on different service-level agreements. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of the proposed AerisAI as well as the functionality comparison with the other baselines. We also conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the proposed approach. The experimental results indicate that our proposed AerisAI significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Robustness is pivotal for comprehending, designing, optimizing, and rehabilitating networks, with simulation attacks being the prevailing evaluation method. Simulation attacks are often time-consuming or even impractical, however, a more crucial yet persistently overlooked drawback is that any attack strategy merely provides a potential paradigm of disintegration. The key concern is: in the worst-case scenario or facing the most severe attacks, what is the limit of robustness, referred to as ``Worst Robustness'', for a given system? Understanding a system's worst robustness is imperative for grasping its reliability limits, accurately evaluating protective capabilities, and determining associated design and security maintenance costs. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Most Destruction Attack (MDA) based on the idea of knowledge stacking. MDA is employed to assess the worst robustness of networks, followed by the application of an adapted CNN algorithm for rapid worst robustness prediction. We establish the logical validity of MDA and highlight the exceptional performance of the adapted CNN algorithm in predicting the worst robustness across diverse network topologies, encompassing both model and empirical networks.

    "title": "Lower Bounds for Differential Privacy Under Continual Observation and  Online Threshold Queries",
    "abstract": "One of the most basic problems for studying the \"price of privacy over time\" is the so called private counter problem, introduced by Dwork et al. (2010) and Chan et al. (2010). In this problem, we aim to track the number of events that occur over time, while hiding the existence of every single event. More specifically, in every time step $t\\in[T]$ we learn (in an online fashion) that $\\Delta_t\\geq 0$ new events have occurred, and must respond with an estimate $n_t\\approx\\sum_{j=1}^t \\Delta_j$. The privacy requirement is that all of the outputs together, across all time steps, satisfy event level differential privacy. The main question here is how our error needs to depend on the total number of time steps $T$ and the total number of events $n$. Dwork et al. (2015) showed an upper bound of $O\\left(\\log(T)+\\log^2(n)\\right)$, and Henzinger et al. (2023) showed a lower bound of $\\Omega\\left(\\min\\{\\log n, \\log T\\}\\right)$. We show a new lower bound of $\\Omega\\left(\\min\\{n,\\log T\\}\\right)$, which is tight w.r.t. the dependence on $T$, and is tight in the sparse case where $\\log^2 n=O(\\log T)$. Our lower bound has the following implications: $\\bullet$ We show that our lower bound extends to the \"online thresholds problem\", where the goal is to privately answer many \"quantile queries\" when these queries are presented one-by-one. This resolves an open question of Bun et al. (2017). $\\bullet$ Our lower bound implies, for the first time, a separation between the number of mistakes obtainable by a private online learner and a non-private online learner. This partially resolves a COLT'22 open question published by Sanyal and Ramponi. $\\bullet$ Our lower bound also yields the first separation between the standard model of private online learning and a recently proposed relaxed variant of it, called private online prediction.

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNN), more and more graph datasets have been published for GNN tasks. However, when an upstream data owner publishes graph data, there are often many privacy concerns, because many real-world graph data contain sensitive information like person's friend list. Differential privacy (DP) is a common method to protect privacy, but due to the complex topological structure of graph data, applying DP on graphs often affects the message passing and aggregation of GNN models, leading to a decrease in model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel graph edge protection framework, graph publisher (GraphPub), which can protect graph topology while ensuring that the availability of data is basically unchanged. Through reverse learning and the encoder-decoder mechanism, we search for some false edges that do not have a large negative impact on the aggregation of node features, and use them to replace some real edges. The modified graph will be published, which is difficult to distinguish between real and false data. Sufficient experiments prove that our framework achieves model accuracy close to the original graph with an extremely low privacy budget. ",

Central to the study of SciSci has been the analysis of citation networks. Here, two prominent modeling methodologies have been employed: one is to assess the citation impact dynamics of papers using parametric distributions, and the other is to embed the citation networks in a latent space optimal for characterizing the static relations between papers in terms of their citations. Interestingly, citation networks are a prominent example of single-event dynamic networks, i.e., networks for which each dyad only has a single event (i.e., the point in time of citation). We presently propose a novel likelihood function for the characterization of such single-event networks. Using this likelihood, we propose the Dynamic Impact Single-Event Embedding model (DISEE). The \\textsc{\\modelabbrev} model characterizes the scientific interactions in terms of a latent distance model in which random effects account for citation heterogeneity while the time-varying impact is characterized using existing parametric representations for assessment of dynamic impact. We highlight the proposed approach on several real citation networks finding that the DISEE well reconciles static latent distance network embedding approaches with classical dynamic impact assessments.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of social media, the wide dissemination of fake news on social media is increasingly threatening both individuals and society. In the dynamic landscape of social media, fake news detection aims to develop a model trained on news reporting past events. The objective is to predict and identify fake news about future events, which often relate to subjects entirely different from those in the past. However, existing fake detection methods exhibit a lack of robustness and cannot generalize to unseen events. To address this, we introduce Future ADaptive Event-based Fake news Detection (FADE) framework. Specifically, we train a target predictor through an adaptive augmentation strategy and graph contrastive learning to make more robust overall predictions. Simultaneously, we independently train an event-only predictor to obtain biased predictions. Then we further mitigate event bias by obtaining the final prediction by subtracting the output of the event-only predictor from the output of the target predictor. Encouraging results from experiments designed to emulate real-world social media conditions validate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation, they still struggle with code generation tasks in specific scenarios. These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to fulfill specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice leads to poor code generation performance. How to effectively adapt LLMs to new scenarios with fewer training samples is a major challenge for current code generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach named SEED, which stands for Sample-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven learning for code generation. SEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as learning opportunities, using error revision to overcome its own shortcomings, thus achieving efficient learning. Specifically, SEED involves identifying error code generated by LLMs, employing Self-revise for code revision, optimizing the model with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that, compared to traditional fine-tuning approaches, SEED achieves superior performance with fewer training samples, showing a relative improvement of 27.2%-325.0% in Pass@1. We also validate the effectiveness of Self-revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets. Moreover, SEED consistently demonstrates strong performance across various LLMs, underscoring its generalizability. ",

Objectives: The objectives are to provide an overview of MCR research, analyze the practitioners' opinions on the importance of MCR research, investigate the alignment between research and practice, and propose future MCR research avenues. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study to survey state of the art until and including 2021, employed the Q-Methodology to analyze the practitioners' perception of the relevance of MCR research, and analyzed the primary studies' research impact. Results: We analyzed 244 primary studies, resulting in five themes. As a result of the 1,300 survey data points, we found that the respondents are positive about research investigating the impact of MCR on product quality and MCR process properties. In contrast, they are negative about human factor- and support systems-related research. Conclusion: These results indicate a misalignment between the state of the art and the themes deemed important by most survey respondents. Researchers should focus on solutions that can improve the state of MCR practice. We provide an MCR research agenda that can potentially increase the impact of MCR research. ",

    "abstract": "There is substantial interest in the use of machine learning (ML)-based techniques throughout the electronic computer-aided design (CAD) flow, particularly methods based on deep learning. However, while deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in several applications, recent work has demonstrated that neural networks are generally vulnerable to small, carefully chosen perturbations of their input (e.g. a single pixel change in an image). In this work, we investigate robustness in the context of ML-based EDA tools -- particularly for congestion prediction. As far as we are aware, we are the first to explore this concept in the context of ML-based EDA. We first describe a novel notion of imperceptibility designed specifically for VLSI layout problems defined on netlists and cell placements. Our definition of imperceptibility is characterized by a guarantee that a perturbation to a layout will not alter its global routing. We then demonstrate that state-of-the-art CNN and GNN-based congestion models exhibit brittleness to imperceptible perturbations. Namely, we show that when a small number of cells (e.g. 1%-5% of cells) have their positions shifted such that a measure of global congestion is guaranteed to remain unaffected (e.g. 1% of the design adversarially shifted by 0.001% of the layout space results in a predicted decrease in congestion of up to 90%, while no change in congestion is implied by the perturbation). In other words, the quality of a predictor can be made arbitrarily poor (i.e. can be made to predict that a design is \"congestion-free\") for an arbitrary input layout. Next, we describe a simple technique to train predictors that improves robustness to these perturbations. Our work indicates that CAD engineers should be cautious when integrating neural network-based mechanisms in EDA flows to ensure robust and high-quality results. ",

This greatly restricts the application of federated bandit learning in practice. In this work, we introduce a new approach for federated bandits for heterogeneous clients, which clusters clients for collaborative bandit learning under the federated learning setting. Our proposed algorithm achieves non-trivial sub-linear regret and communication cost for all clients, subject to the communication protocol under federated learning that at anytime only one model can be shared by the server.

We therefore introduce a taxonomy of potentially adversarial elements that may contribute to poor performance or system failures as a means of identifying and elucidating lesser-seen risks. This taxonomy may be used to characterize failures of automation, as well as to support simulation and real-world training efforts by providing a more comprehensive classification system for events resulting in disengagement, collision, or other negative consequences. This taxonomy is created from and tested against real collision events to ensure comprehensive coverage with minimal class overlap and few omissions. It is intended to be used both for the identification of harm-contributing adversarial events and in the generation thereof (to create extreme edge- and corner-case scenarios) in training procedures.

Further, we provide a theoretical analysis that explains the training process of the compressed network. The theoretical results are empirically validated through experiments conducted on standard pre-trained benchmarks, including AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG16, using CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets.

This paper presents SoD$^2$, a comprehensive framework for optimizing Dynamic DNNs. The basis of our approach is a classification of common operators that form DNNs, and the use of this classification towards a Rank and Dimension Propagation (RDP) method. This framework statically determines the shapes of operators as known constants, symbolic constants, or operations on these. Next, using RDP we enable a series of optimizations, like fused code generation, execution (order) planning, and even runtime memory allocation plan generation. By evaluating the framework on 10 emerging Dynamic DNNs and comparing it against several existing systems, we demonstrate both reductions in execution latency and memory requirements, with RDP-enabled key optimizations responsible for much of the gains. Our evaluation results show that SoD$^2$ runs up to $3.9\\times$ faster than these systems while saving up to $88\\%$ peak memory consumption. ",

This eliminates the need for invasive procedures or uncertain treatment decisions. In this paper, we propose a method to identify digital twin model parameters using only noninvasive patient health data. We approach the digital twin modeling as a composite inverse problem, and observe that its structure resembles pretraining and finetuning in self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging this, we introduce a physics-informed SSL algorithm that initially pretrains a neural network on the pretext task of solving the physical model equations. Subsequently, the model is trained to reconstruct low-dimensional health measurements from noninvasive modalities while being constrained by the physical equations learned in pretraining. We apply our method to identify digital twins of cardiac hemodynamics using noninvasive echocardiogram videos, and demonstrate its utility in unsupervised disease detection and in-silico clinical trials.

    "title": "Causal Graph ODE: Continuous Treatment Effect Modeling in Multi-agent  Dynamical Systems",
    "abstract": "Real-world multi-agent systems are often dynamic and continuous, where the agents co-evolve and undergo changes in their trajectories and interactions over time. For example, the COVID-19 transmission in the U.S. can be viewed as a multi-agent system, where states act as agents and daily population movements between them are interactions. Estimating the counterfactual outcomes in such systems enables accurate future predictions and effective decision-making, such as formulating COVID-19 policies. However, existing methods fail to model the continuous dynamic effects of treatments on the outcome, especially when multiple treatments (e.g., \"stay-at-home\" and \"get-vaccine\" policies) are applied simultaneously. To tackle this challenge, we propose Causal Graph Ordinary Differential Equations (CAG-ODE), a novel model that captures the continuous interaction among agents using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) as the ODE function. The key innovation of our model is to learn time-dependent representations of treatments and incorporate them into the ODE function, enabling precise predictions of potential outcomes. To mitigate confounding bias, we further propose two domain adversarial learning-based objectives, which enable our model to learn balanced continuous representations that are not affected by treatments or interference. Experiments on two datasets (i.e., COVID-19 and tumor growth) demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model. ",

We present a series of experimental evaluations in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in controlling a quadruped robot in confined, rough terrain.

Although this method has been shown to significantly improve student learning outcomes, it remains a complex labor-intensive task for instructors. Large language models (LLMs) can be used to augment human effort by automatically generating Socratic questions for students. However, existing methods that involve prompting these LLMs sometimes produce invalid outputs, e.g., those that directly reveal the solution to the problem or provide irrelevant or premature questions. To alleviate this problem, inspired by reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), we first propose a data augmentation method to enrich existing Socratic questioning datasets with questions that are invalid in specific ways. Next, we propose a method to optimize open-source LLMs such as LLama 2 to prefer ground-truth questions over generated invalid ones, using direct preference optimization (DPO). Our experiments on a Socratic questions dataset for student code debugging show that a DPO-optimized 7B LLama 2 model can effectively avoid generating invalid questions, and as a result, outperforms existing state-of-the-art prompting methods.

    "abstract": "Following the successes in the fields of vision and language, self-supervised pretraining via masked autoencoding of 3D point set data, or Masked Point Modeling (MPM), has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in various downstream tasks. However, current MPM methods lack a property essential for 3D point set analysis, namely, invariance against rotation of 3D objects/scenes. Existing MPM methods are thus not necessarily suitable for real-world applications where 3D point sets may have inconsistent orientations. This paper develops, for the first time, a rotation-invariant self-supervised pretraining framework for practical 3D point set analysis. The proposed algorithm, called MaskLRF, learns rotation-invariant and highly generalizable latent features via masked autoencoding of 3D points within Local Reference Frames (LRFs), which are not affected by rotation of 3D point sets. MaskLRF enhances the quality of latent features by integrating feature refinement using relative pose encoding and feature reconstruction using low-level but rich 3D geometry. The efficacy of MaskLRF is validated via extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks including classification, segmentation, registration, and domain adaptation. I confirm that MaskLRF achieves new state-of-the-art accuracies in analyzing 3D point sets having inconsistent orientations. Code will be available at: https://github.com/takahikof/MaskLRF ",

    "abstract": "Multicasting refers to the ability of transmitting data to multiple recipients without data sources needing to provide more than one copy of the data to the network. The network takes responsibility to route and deliver a copy of each data to every intended recipient. Multicasting has the potential to improve the network efficiency and performance (e.g., throughput and latency) through transferring fewer bits in communicating the same data to multiple recipients compared with unicast transmissions, reduce the amount of networking resources needed for communication, lower the network energy footprint, and alleviate the occurrence of congestion in the network. Over the past few decades, providing multicast services has been a real challenge for ISPs, especially to support home users and multi-domain network applications, leading to the emergence of complex application-level solutions. These solutions like Content Delivery and Peer-to-Peer networks take advantage of complex caching, routing, transport, and topology management systems which put heavy strains on the underlying Internet infrastructures to offer multicasting services. In reality, the main motivation behind the design of these systems is rather sharing content than offering efficient multicast services. In this paper, we propound Yodel, a name-based multicast network architecture that can provide multi-domain multicast services for current and future Internet applications. Compared to the wider array of other name-based network architectures with clean-slate infrastructure requirements, Yodel is designed to provide multicast services over the current Internet infrastructure. Hence, Yodel puts forward several design goals that distinguish it from other name-based network architectures with inherent multicast capabilities. This paper is prepared to discuss the Yodel architecture, its design goals, and architectural functions. ",

Recent methods use self-attention to find relevant non-occluded points as references for estimating the optical flow of occluded points based on the assumption of self-similarity. However, they rely on visual features of a single image and weak constraints, which are not sufficient to constrain the trained network to focus on erroneous and weakly relevant reference points. We make full use of online occlusion recognition information to construct occlusion extended visual features and two strong constraints, allowing the network to learn to focus only on the most relevant references without requiring occlusion ground truth to participate in the training of the network. Our method adds very few network parameters to the original framework, making it very lightweight. Extensive experiments show that our model has the greatest cross-dataset generalization. Our method achieves much greater error reduction, 18.6%, 16.2%, and 20.1% for all points, non-occluded points, and occluded points respectively from the state-of-the-art GMA-base method, MATCHFlow(GMA), on Sintel Albedo pass.

These skills, learned task-agnostically from offline datasets, can accelerate the policy learning process for new tasks. Yet, the application of these skills in different domains remains restricted due to their inherent dependency on the datasets, which poses a challenge when attempting to learn a skill-based policy via RL for a target domain different from the datasets' domains. In this paper, we present a novel offline skill learning framework DuSkill which employs a guided Diffusion model to generate versatile skills extended from the limited skills in datasets, thereby enhancing the robustness of policy learning for tasks in different domains. Specifically, we devise a guided diffusion-based skill decoder in conjunction with the hierarchical encoding to disentangle the skill embedding space into two distinct representations, one for encapsulating domain-invariant behaviors and the other for delineating the factors that induce domain variations in the behaviors. Our DuSkill framework enhances the diversity of skills learned offline, thus enabling to accelerate the learning procedure of high-level policies for different domains. Through experiments, we show that DuSkill outperforms other skill-based imitation learning and RL algorithms for several long-horizon tasks, demonstrating its benefits in few-shot imitation and online RL.

Lexical Semantic Change Detection (SCD) task considers the problem of predicting whether a given target word, $w$, changes its meaning between two different text corpora, $C_1$ and $C_2$. For this purpose, we propose a supervised two-staged SCD method that uses existing Word-in-Context (WiC) datasets. In the first stage, for a target word $w$, we learn two sense-aware encoder that represents the meaning of $w$ in a given sentence selected from a corpus. Next, in the second stage, we learn a sense-aware distance metric that compares the semantic representations of a target word across all of its occurrences in $C_1$ and $C_2$. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets for SCD show that our proposed method consistently outperforms all previously proposed SCD methods for multiple languages, establishing a novel state-of-the-art for SCD. Interestingly, our findings imply that there are specialised dimensions that carry information related to semantic changes of words in the sense-aware embedding space.

Due to the growing concern about privacy, privacy-preserving DNN becomes a hot research topic. Generally, the convolution and pooling operations can be supported by additive homomorphic and secure comparison, but the secure implementation of activation functions is not so straightforward for the requirements of accuracy and efficiency, especially for the non-linear ones such as exponential, sigmoid, and tanh functions. This paper pays a special attention to the implementation of such non-linear functions in semi-honest model with two-party settings, for which SIRNN is the current state-of-the-art. Different from previous works, we proposed improved implementations for these functions by using their intrinsic features as well as worthy tiny tricks. At first, we propose a novel and efficient protocol for exponential function by using a divide-and-conquer strategy with most of the computations executed locally. Exponential protocol is widely used in machine learning tasks such as Poisson regression, and is also a key component of sigmoid and tanh functions. Next, we take advantage of the symmetry of sigmoid and Tanh, and fine-tune the inputs to reduce the 2PC building blocks, which helps to save overhead and improve performance. As a result, we implement these functions with fewer fundamental building blocks. The comprehensive evaluations show that our protocols achieve state-of-the-art precision while reducing run-time by approximately 57%, 44%, and 42% for exponential (with only negative inputs), sigmoid, and Tanh functions, respectively.

In this study, we first introduce filter subspace by decomposing convolutional kernels within each network layer over a small set of filter subspace elements, referred to as filter atoms. We then fine-tune these models to extract task-specific representation by only adapting the filter atoms, a few hundred parameters typically. To potentially expand the parameter space for tuning, we further show a simple approach to generate an overcomplete filter subspace by recursively decomposing each filter atom over another set of filter atoms. The fine-tuning of filter atoms reshapes the filter subspace, enabling convolutional layers to adapt to diverse downstream tasks efficiently. Extensive experiments show that such a simple scheme surpasses previous tuning baselines for both discriminate and generative tasks.

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the existing event-driven learning algorithms, reveal their limitations, and propose novel solutions to overcome them.

The two methods are extensively evaluated on static and neuromorphic datasets to confirm their superior performance.

In addition, we theoretically and experimentally validate the energy efficiency of our methods on neuromorphic hardware. On-chip learning experiments achieved a remarkable 30-fold reduction in energy consumption over time-step-based surrogate gradient methods.

It is a fundamental question to quantify their privacy leakage, yet tight characterizations remain open even in the foundational setting of convex losses. This paper improves over previous analyses by establishing (and refining) the \"privacy amplification by iteration\" phenomenon in the unifying framework of $f$-differential privacy--which tightly captures all aspects of the privacy loss and immediately implies tighter privacy accounting in other notions of differential privacy, e.g., $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-DP and Renyi DP. Our key technical insight is the construction of shifted interpolated processes that unravel the popular shifted-divergences argument, enabling generalizations beyond divergence-based relaxations of DP. Notably, this leads to the first exact privacy analysis in the foundational setting of strongly convex optimization. Our techniques extend to many settings: convex/strongly convex, constrained/unconstrained, full/cyclic/stochastic batches, and all combinations thereof. As an immediate corollary, we recover the $f$-DP characterization of the exponential mechanism for strongly convex optimization in Gopi et al.

    "title": "Semantic Text Transmission via Prediction with Small Language Models:  Cost-Similarity Trade-off",
    "abstract": "We consider the communication of natural language text from a source to a destination over noiseless and character-erasure channels. We exploit language's inherent correlations and predictability to constrain transmission costs by allowing the destination to predict or complete words with potential dissimilarity with the source text. Concretely, our objective is to obtain achievable $(\\bar{c}, \\bar{s})$ pairs, where $\\bar{c}$ is the average transmission cost at the source and $\\bar{s}$ is the average semantic similarity measured via cosine similarity between vector embedding of words at the source and those predicted/completed at the destination. We obtain $(\\bar{c}, \\bar{s})$ pairs for neural language and first-order Markov chain-based small language models (SLM) for prediction, using both a threshold policy that transmits a word if its cosine similarity with that predicted/completed at the destination is below a threshold, and a periodic policy, which transmits words after a specific interval and predicts/completes the words in between, at the destination. We adopt an SLM for word completion. We demonstrate that, when communication occurs over a noiseless channel, the threshold policy achieves a higher $\\bar{s}$ for a given $\\bar{c}$ than the periodic policy and that the $\\bar{s}$ achieved with the neural SLM is greater than or equal to that of the Markov chain-based algorithm for the same $\\bar{c}$. The improved performance comes with a higher complexity in terms of time and computing requirements. However, when communication occurs over a character-erasure channel, all prediction algorithms and scheduling policies perform poorly. Furthermore, if character-level Huffman coding is used, the required $\\bar{c}$ to achieve a given $\\bar{s}$ is reduced, but the above observations still apply. ",

    "abstract": "Language models risk generating mindless and offensive content, which hinders their safe deployment. Therefore, it is crucial to discover and modify potential toxic outputs of pre-trained language models before deployment. In this work, we elicit toxic content by automatically searching for a prompt that directs pre-trained language models towards the generation of a specific target output. The problem is challenging due to the discrete nature of textual data and the considerable computational resources required for a single forward pass of the language model. To combat these challenges, we introduce Auto-regressive Selective Replacement Ascent (ASRA), a discrete optimization algorithm that selects prompts based on both quality and similarity with determinantal point process (DPP). Experimental results on six different pre-trained language models demonstrate the efficacy of ASRA for eliciting toxic content. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the success rate of ASRA attacks and the perplexity of target outputs, while indicating limited association with the quantity of model parameters.

    "abstract": "In recent years, text-image joint pre-training techniques have shown promising results in various tasks. However, in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks, aligning text instances with their corresponding text regions in images poses a challenge, as it requires effective alignment between text and OCR-Text (referring to the text in images as OCR-Text to distinguish from the text in natural language) rather than a holistic understanding of the overall image content. In this paper, we propose a new pre-training method called OCR-Text Destylization Modeling (ODM) that transfers diverse styles of text found in images to a uniform style based on the text prompt. With ODM, we achieve better alignment between text and OCR-Text and enable pre-trained models to adapt to the complex and diverse styles of scene text detection and spotting tasks. Additionally, we have designed a new labeling generation method specifically for ODM and combined it with our proposed Text-Controller module to address the challenge of annotation costs in OCR tasks, allowing a larger amount of unlabeled data to participate in pre-training. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance and outperforms current pre-training methods in scene text detection and spotting tasks.

In this paper, we propose a general graph partitioning algorithm WindGP, which can support fast and high-quality edge partitioning on heterogeneous machines. WindGP designs novel preprocessing techniques to simplify the metric and balance the computation cost according to the characteristics of graphs and machines. Also, best-first search is proposed instead of BFS and DFS, in order to generate clusters with high cohesion. Furthermore, WindGP adaptively tunes the partition results by sophisticated local search methods. Extensive experiments show that WindGP outperforms all state-of-the-art partition methods by 1.35 - 27 times on both dense and sparse distributed graph algorithms, and has good scalability with graph size and machine number.

Presently, two dominant paradigms for collecting tuning data are natural-instruct (human-written) and self-instruct (automatically generated). Natural-instruct includes diverse and correct codes but lacks instruction-code pairs, and exists improper code formats like nested single-line codes. In contrast, self-instruct automatically generates proper paired data. However, it suffers from low diversity due to generating duplicates and cannot ensure the correctness of codes. To bridge the both paradigms, we propose \\textbf{Semi-Instruct}. It first converts diverse but improper codes from natural-instruct into proper instruction-code pairs through a method similar to self-instruct. To verify the correctness of generated codes, we design a novel way to construct test cases by generating cases' inputs and executing correct codes from natural-instruct to get outputs. Finally, diverse and correct instruction-code pairs are retained for instruction tuning. Experiments show that semi-instruct is significantly better than natural-instruct and self-instruct.

Recent studies have reported encouraging results using deep reinforcement learning (RL) in the healthcare domain. Previous studies showed that assistive tasks can be formulated as multi-agent RL, wherein there are two agents: a caregiver and a care-receiver. However, policies trained in multi-agent RL are often sensitive to the policies of other agents. In such a case, a trained caregiver's policy may not work for different care-receivers. To alleviate this issue, we propose a framework that learns a robust caregiver's policy by training it for diverse care-receiver responses. In our framework, diverse care-receiver responses are autonomously learned through trials and errors. In addition, to robustify the care-giver's policy, we propose a strategy for sampling a care-receiver's response in an adversarial manner during the training. We evaluated the proposed method using tasks in an Assistive Gym. We demonstrate that policies trained with a popular deep RL method are vulnerable to changes in policies of other agents and that the proposed framework improves the robustness against such changes.

While deep learning approaches have demonstrated their great potential in this area, it still remains unsolved to establish a connection between multiple driving scenes (e.g., merging, roundabout, intersection) and the design of deep learning models. Current learning-based methods typically use one unified model to predict trajectories in different scenarios, which may result in sub-optimal results for one individual scene. To address this issue, we propose Multi-Scenes Network (aka. MS-Net), which is a multi-path sparse model trained by an evolutionary process. MS-Net selectively activates a subset of its parameters during the inference stage to produce prediction results for each scene. In the training stage, the motion prediction task under differentiated scenes is abstracted as a multi-task learning problem, an evolutionary algorithm is designed to encourage the network search of the optimal parameters for each scene while sharing common knowledge between different scenes. Our experiment results show that with substantially reduced parameters, MS-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on well-established pedestrian motion prediction datasets, e.g., ETH and UCY, and ranks the 2nd place on the INTERACTION challenge.

By properly designing neural network structures, the proposed controller can ensure closed-loop stability for any compatible neural network parameters. In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller. We show that in the presence of model approximation errors and external disturbances, the closed-loop stability and tracking control performance can still be guaranteed.

In either case, the proliferation of MANET-based applications depends on a multitude of factors, with trustworthiness being one of the primary challenges to be met. Despite the existence of well-known security mechanisms, additional vulnerabilities and features pertinent to this new networking paradigm might render such traditional solutions inapplicable. In particular, the absence of a central authorization facility in an open and distributed communication environment is a major challenge, especially due to the need for cooperative network operation. In particular, in MANET, any node may compromise the routing protocol functionality by disrupting the route discovery process. In this paper, we present a route discovery protocol that mitigates the detrimental effects of such malicious behavior, as to provide correct connectivity information. Our protocol guarantees that fabricated, compromised, or replayed route replies would either be rejected or never reach back the querying node. Furthermore, the protocol responsiveness is safeguarded under different types of attacks that exploit the routing protocol itself. The sole requirement of the proposed scheme is the existence of a security association between the node initiating the query and the sought destination. Specifically, no assumption is made regarding the intermediate nodes, which may exhibit arbitrary and malicious behavior. The scheme is robust in the presence of a number of non-colluding nodes, and provides accurate routing information in a timely manner. ",

    "abstract": "Learning from preference-based feedback has recently gained traction as a promising approach to align language models with human interests. While these aligned generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, their dependence on high-quality human preference data poses a bottleneck in practical applications. Specifically, noisy (incorrect and ambiguous) preference pairs in the dataset might restrict the language models from capturing human intent accurately. While practitioners have recently proposed heuristics to mitigate the effect of noisy preferences, a complete theoretical understanding of their workings remain elusive. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by by introducing a general framework for policy optimization in the presence of random preference flips. We focus on the direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm in particular since it assumes that preferences adhere to the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, raising concerns about the impact of noisy data on the learned policy. We design a novel loss function, which de-bias the effect of noise on average, making a policy trained by minimizing that loss robust to the noise. Under log-linear parameterization of the policy class and assuming good feature coverage of the SFT policy, we prove that the sub-optimality gap of the proposed robust DPO (rDPO) policy compared to the optimal policy is of the order $O(\\frac{1}{1-2\\epsilon}\\sqrt{\\frac{d}{n}})$, where $\\epsilon < 1/2$ is flip rate of labels, $d$ is policy parameter dimension and $n$ is size of dataset. Our experiments on IMDb sentiment generation and Anthropic's helpful-harmless dataset show that rDPO is robust to noise in preference labels compared to vanilla DPO and other heuristics proposed by practitioners.

    "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of joint transmission and computation resource allocation for probabilistic semantic communication (PSC) system with rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is investigated. In the considered model, the base station (BS) needs to transmit a large amount of data to multiple users with RSMA. Due to limited communication resources, the BS is required to utilize semantic communication techniques to compress the large-sized data. The semantic communication is enabled by shared probability graphs between the BS and the users. The probability graph can be used to further compress the transmission data at the BS, while the received compressed semantic information can be recovered through using the same shared probability graph at each user side. The semantic information compression progress consumes additional computation power at the BS, which inevitably decreases the transmission power due to limited total power budget. Considering both the effect of semantic compression ratio and computation power, the semantic rate expression for RSMA is first obtained. Then, based on the obtained rate expression, an optimization problem is formulated with the aim of maximizing the sum of semantic rates of all users under total power, semantic compression ratio, and rate allocation constraints. To tackle this problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed, where the rate allocation and transmit beamforming design subproblem is solved using a successive convex approximation method, and the semantic compression ratio subproblem is addressed using a greedy algorithm. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. ",

Such models are characterized by complex dynamics between neurons and spikes. These are very sensitive to the hyperparameters, making their optimization challenging. To tackle hyperparameter optimization of SNNs, we initially extended the signal loss issue of SNNs to what we call silent networks. These networks fail to emit enough spikes at their outputs due to mistuned hyperparameters or architecture. Generally, search spaces are heavily restrained, sometimes even discretized, to prevent the sampling of such networks. By defining an early stopping criterion detecting silent networks and by designing specific constraints, we were able to instantiate larger and more flexible search spaces. We applied a constrained Bayesian optimization technique, which was asynchronously parallelized, as the evaluation time of a SNN is highly stochastic. Large-scale experiments were carried-out on a multi-GPU Petascale architecture. By leveraging silent networks, results show an acceleration of the search, while maintaining good performances of both the optimization algorithm and the best solution obtained. We were able to apply our methodology to two popular training algorithms, known as spike timing dependent plasticity and surrogate gradient. Early detection allowed us to prevent worthless and costly computation, directing the search toward promising hyperparameter combinations. Our methodology could be applied to multi-objective problems, where the spiking activity is often minimized to reduce the energy consumption. In this scenario, it becomes essential to find the delicate frontier between low-spiking and silent networks. Finally, our approach may have implications for neural architecture search, particularly in defining suitable spiking architectures. ",

    "abstract": "Virtual assistants are poised to take a dramatic leap forward in terms of their dialogue capabilities, spurred by recent advances in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet a major bottleneck to achieving genuinely transformative task-oriented dialogue capabilities remains the scarcity of high quality and linguistically sophisticated data. Existing datasets, while impressive in scale, have limited domain coverage and contain few genuinely challenging conversational phenomena; those which are present are typically unlabelled, making it difficult to assess the strengths and weaknesses of models without time-consuming and costly human evaluation. Moreover, creating high quality dialogue data has until now required considerable human input, limiting both the scale of these datasets and the ability to rapidly bootstrap data for a new target domain. We aim to overcome these issues with LUCID, a modularised and highly automated LLM-driven data generation system that produces realistic, diverse and challenging dialogues. We use LUCID to generate a seed dataset of 4,277 multi-domain, multi-intent conversations across 100 intents to demonstrate its capabilities. The generated conversations include a wide range of challenging phenomena and diverse user behaviour, conveniently identifiable via a set of turn-level tags. Finally, we provide separate test sets for seen and unseen intents, allowing for convenient out-of-distribution evaluation. We release both the data generation code and the dataset itself. ",

    "abstract": "Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) provide a streamlined solution for lightweight device authentication. Delay-based Arbiter PUFs, with their ease of implementation and vast challenge space, have received significant attention; however, they are not immune to modelling attacks that exploit correlations between their inputs and outputs. Research is therefore polarized between developing modelling-resistant PUFs and devising machine learning attacks against them. This dichotomy often results in exaggerated concerns and overconfidence in PUF security, primarily because there lacks a universal tool to gauge a PUF's security. In many scenarios, attacks require additional information, such as PUF type or configuration parameters. Alarmingly, new PUFs are often branded `secure' if they lack a specific attack model upon introduction. To impartially assess the security of delay-based PUFs, we present a generic framework featuring a Mixture-of-PUF-Experts (MoPE) structure for mounting attacks on various PUFs with minimal adversarial knowledge, which provides a way to compare their performance fairly and impartially. We demonstrate the capability of our model to attack different PUF types, including the first successful attack on Heterogeneous Feed-Forward PUFs using only a reasonable amount of challenges and responses. We propose an extension version of our model, a Multi-gate Mixture-of-PUF-Experts (MMoPE) structure, facilitating multi-task learning across diverse PUFs to recognise commonalities across PUF designs. This allows a streamlining of training periods for attacking multiple PUFs simultaneously. We conclude by showcasing the potent performance of MoPE and MMoPE across a spectrum of PUF types, employing simulated, real-world unbiased, and biased data sets for analysis. ",

    "title": "Graph Homomorphism, Monotone Classes and Bounded Pathwidth",
    "abstract": "A recent paper describes a framework for studying the computational complexity of graph problems on monotone classes, that is those omitting a set of graphs as a subgraph. If the problems lie in the framework, and many do, then the computational complexity can be described for all monotone classes defined by a finite set of omitted subgraphs. It is known that certain homomorphism problems, e.g. $C_5$-Colouring, do not sit in the framework. By contrast, we show that the more general problem of Graph Homomorphism does sit in the framework. The original framework had examples where hard versus easy were NP-complete versus P, or at least quadratic versus almost linear. We give the first example of a problem in the framework such that hardness is in the polynomial hierarchy above NP. Considering a variant of the colouring game as studied by Bodlaender, we show that with the restriction of bounded alternation, the list version of this problem is contained in the framework. The hard cases are $\\Pi_{2k}^\\mathrm{P}$-complete and the easy cases are in P. The cases in P comprise those classes for which the pathwidth is bounded. Bodlaender explains that Sequential $3$-Colouring Construction Game is in P on classes with bounded vertex separation number, which coincides with bounded pathwidth on unordered graphs. However, these graphs are ordered with a playing order for the two players, which corresponds to a prefix pattern in a quantified formula. We prove that Sequential $3$-Colouring Construction Game is Pspace-complete on some class of bounded pathwidth, using a celebrated result of Atserias and Oliva. We consider several locally constrained variants of the homomorphism problem. Like $C_5$-Colouring, none of these is in the framework. However, when we consider the bounded-degree restrictions, we prove that each of these problems is in our framework. ",

We study the recipe of learning performant IWMs and show that it relies on three key aspects: conditioning, prediction difficulty, and capacity. Additionally, we show that the predictive world model learned by IWM can be adapted through finetuning to solve diverse tasks; a fine-tuned IWM world model matches or surpasses the performance of previous self-supervised methods.

    "abstract": "In this work, we develop a pipeline for historical-psychological text analysis in classical Chinese. Humans have produced texts in various languages for thousands of years; however, most of the computational literature is focused on contemporary languages and corpora. The emerging field of historical psychology relies on computational techniques to extract aspects of psychology from historical corpora using new methods developed in natural language processing (NLP). The present pipeline, called Contextualized Construct Representations (CCR), combines expert knowledge in psychometrics (i.e., psychological surveys) with text representations generated via transformer-based language models to measure psychological constructs such as traditionalism, norm strength, and collectivism in classical Chinese corpora. Considering the scarcity of available data, we propose an indirect supervised contrastive learning approach and build the first Chinese historical psychology corpus (C-HI-PSY) to fine-tune pre-trained models. We evaluate the pipeline to demonstrate its superior performance compared with other approaches. The CCR method outperforms word-embedding-based approaches across all of our tasks and exceeds prompting with GPT-4 in most tasks.

Our investigation reveals that an integrated application of diverse techniques--spanning model regularization, classifier and optimization--substantially improves the accuracy of uncertainty predictions in image classification tasks. The synergistic effect of these techniques culminates in our novel SURE approach. We rigorously evaluate SURE against the benchmark of failure prediction, a critical testbed for uncertainty estimation efficacy. Our results showcase a consistently better performance than models that individually deploy each technique, across various datasets and model architectures. When applied to real-world challenges, such as data corruption, label noise, and long-tailed class distribution, SURE exhibits remarkable robustness, delivering results that are superior or on par with current state-of-the-art specialized methods. Particularly on Animal-10N and Food-101N for learning with noisy labels, SURE achieves state-of-the-art performance without any task-specific adjustments.

Therefore, simulations have become critical and the primary way of evaluating VANETs' applications. Furthermore, the upfront challenge is the realistic capture of the networking mechanism of VANETs, which varies from situation to situation. Several factors may contribute to the successful achievement of a random realistic networking behavior. However, the biggest dependency is a powerful tool for the implementation, which could probably take into account all the configuration parameters, loss factors, mobility schemes, and other key features of a VANET, yet give out practical performance metrics with a good trade-off between investment of resources and the results.

Knowing the type of unmanned aerial vehicle can go a long way in determining any potential risks it carries. For instance, fixed-wing craft can carry more weight over longer distances, thus potentially posing a more significant threat. This paper presents a machine learning model for classifying unmanned aerial vehicles as quadrotor, hexarotor, or fixed-wing. Our approach effectively applies a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for the purpose of time series classification. We performed experiments to test the effects of changing the timestamp sampling method and addressing the imbalance in the class distribution. Through these experiments, we identified the top-performing sampling and class imbalance fixing methods. Averaging the macro f-scores across 10 folds of data, we found that the majority quadrotor class was predicted well (98.16%), and, despite an extreme class imbalance, the model could also predicted a majority of fixed-wing flights correctly (73.15%). Hexarotor instances were often misclassified as quadrotors due to the similarity of multirotors in general (42.15%). However, results remained relatively stable across certain methods, which prompted us to analyze and report on their tradeoffs.

Therefore, a simulation of the deformation of a large aerogel structure resolving the nanostructure would be extremely expensive. Thus, multi-scale or homogenization approaches have to be considered. Here, a computational scale bridging approach based on the FE$^2$ method is suggested, where the macroscopic scale is discretized using finite elements while the microstructure of the open-porous material is resolved as a network of Euler-Bernoulli beams. Here, the beam frame based RVEs (representative volume elements) have pores whose size distribution follows the measured values for a specific material. This is a well-known approach to model aerogel structures. For the computational homogenization, an approach to average the first Piola-Kirchhoff stresses in a beam frame by neglecting rotational moments is suggested. To further overcome the computationally most expensive part in the homogenization method, that is, solving the RVEs and averaging their stress fields, a surrogate model is introduced based on neural networks. The networks input is the localized deformation gradient on the macroscopic scale and its output is the averaged stress for the specific material. It is trained on data generated by the beam frame based approach. The effiency and robustness of both homogenization approaches is shown numerically, the approximation properties of the surrogate model is verified for different macroscopic problems and discretizations. Different (Quasi-)Newton solvers are considered on the macroscopic scale and compared with respect to their convergence properties. ",

    "abstract": "Modern transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are constructed with a series of decoder blocks. Each block comprises three key components: (1) QKV generation, (2) multi-head attention, and (3) feed-forward networks. In batched processing, QKV generation and feed-forward networks involve compute-intensive matrix-matrix multiplications (GEMM), while multi-head attention requires bandwidth-heavy matrix-vector multiplications (GEMV). Machine learning accelerators like TPUs or NPUs are proficient in handling GEMM but are less efficient for GEMV computations. Conversely, Processing-in-Memory (PIM) technology is tailored for efficient GEMV computation, while it lacks the computational power to effectively handle GEMM. Inspired by this insight, we propose NeuPIMs, a heterogeneous accelerator-based system that jointly exploits a conventional GEMM-focused NPU and GEMV-optimized PIM devices. The main challenge in efficiently integrating NPU and PIM lies in enabling concurrent operations on both platforms, each addressing a specific kernel type. First, existing PIMs typically operate in a \"blocked\" mode, allowing only either NPU or PIM to be active at any given time. Second, the inherent dependencies between GEMM and GEMV in LLMs restrict their parallel processing. To tackle these challenges, NeuPIMs is equipped with dual row buffers in each bank, facilitating the simultaneous management of memory read/write operations and PIM commands. Further, NeuPIMs employs a runtime sub-batch interleaving technique to maximize concurrent execution, leveraging batch parallelism to allow two independent sub-batches to be pipelined within a single NeuPIMs node. Our evaluation demonstrates that compared to an NPU-only approach and a na\\\"ive NPU-PIM integrated system, NeuPIMs achieves 2.3$\\times$ and 1.6$\\times$ throughput improvement, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Elasticity plays an important role in modern cloud computing systems. Elastic computing allows virtual machines (i.e., computing nodes) to be preempted when high-priority jobs arise, and also allows new virtual machines to participate in the computation. In 2018, Yang et al. introduced Coded Storage Elastic Computing (CSEC) to address the elasticity using coding technology, with lower storage and computation load requirements. However, CSEC is limited to certain types of computations (e.g., linear) due to the coded data storage based on linear coding. Then Centralized Uncoded Storage Elastic Computing (CUSEC) with heterogeneous computation speeds was proposed, which directly copies parts of data into the virtual machines. In all existing works in elastic computing, the storage assignment is centralized, meaning that the number and identity of all virtual machines possible used in the whole computation process are known during the storage assignment. In this paper, we consider Decentralized Uncoded Storage Elastic Computing (DUSEC) with heterogeneous computation speeds, where any available virtual machine can join the computation which is not predicted and thus coordination among different virtual machines' storage assignments is not allowed. Under a decentralized storage assignment originally proposed in coded caching by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, we propose a computing scheme with closed-form optimal computation time. We also run experiments over MNIST dataset with Softmax regression model through the Tencent cloud platform, and the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed DUSEC system approaches the state-of-art best storage assignment in the CUSEC system in computation time.

    "abstract": "Object detection limits its recognizable categories during the training phase, in which it can not cover all objects of interest for users. To satisfy the practical necessity, the incremental learning ability of the detector becomes a critical factor for real-world applications. Unfortunately, neural networks unavoidably meet catastrophic forgetting problem when it is implemented on a new task. To this end, many incremental object detection models preserve the knowledge of previous tasks by replaying samples or distillation from previous models. However, they ignore an important factor that the performance of the model mostly depends on its feature. These models try to rouse the memory of the neural network with previous samples but not to prevent forgetting. To this end, in this paper, we propose an incremental causal object detection (ICOD) model by learning causal features, which can adapt to more tasks. Traditional object detection models, unavoidably depend on the data-bias or data-specific features to get the detection results, which can not adapt to the new task. When the model meets the requirements of incremental learning, the data-bias information is not beneficial to the new task, and the incremental learning may eliminate these features and lead to forgetting. To this end, our ICOD is introduced to learn the causal features, rather than the data-bias features when training the detector. Thus, when the model is implemented to a new task, the causal features of the old task can aid the incremental learning process to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem. We conduct our model on several experiments, which shows a causal feature without data-bias can make the model adapt to new tasks better. \\keywords{Object detection, incremental learning, causal feature.

    "abstract": "The use of one-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) has been considered as a viable alternative to high resolution counterparts in realizing and commercializing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, the issue of discarding the amplitude information by one-bit quantizers has to be compensated. Thus, carefully tailored methods need to be developed for one-bit channel estimation and data detection as the conventional ones cannot be used. To address these issues, the problems of one-bit channel estimation and data detection for MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system that operates over uncorrelated frequency selective channels are investigated here. We first develop channel estimators that exploit Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA) classifier and approximated versions of it as the so-called weak classifiers in an adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) approach. Particularly, the combination of the approximated GDA classifiers with AdaBoost offers the benefit of scalability with the linear order of computations, which is critical in massive MIMO-OFDM systems. We then take advantage of the same idea for proposing the data detectors. Numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed channel estimators and data detectors compared to other methods. They show comparable/better performance to that of the state-of-the-art methods, but require dramatically lower computational complexities and run times. ",

    "abstract": "As Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) become more affordable and computing capabilities grow, they provide significant advantages for complex applications such as environmental monitoring, underwater inspections, or space exploration. However, accounting for potential communication loss or the unavailability of communication infrastructures in these application domains remains an open problem. Much of the applicable MRS research assumes that the system can sustain communication through proximity regulations and formation control or by devising a framework for separating and adhering to a predetermined plan for extended periods of disconnection. The latter technique enables an MRS to be more efficient, but breakdowns and environmental uncertainties can have a domino effect throughout the system, particularly when the mission goal is intricate or time-sensitive. To deal with this problem, our proposed framework has two main phases: i) a centralized planner to allocate mission tasks by rewarding intermittent rendezvous between robots to mitigate the effects of the unforeseen events during mission execution, and ii) a decentralized replanning scheme leveraging epistemic planning to formalize belief propagation and a Monte Carlo tree search for policy optimization given distributed rational belief updates. The proposed framework outperforms a baseline heuristic and is validated using simulations and experiments with aerial vehicles. ",

The seminal work by \\citet{Wang2020UnderstandingCR} introduced a uniformity metric that quantitatively measures the collapse degree of learned representations. Directly optimizing this metric together with alignment proves to be effective in preventing constant collapse. However, we present both theoretical and empirical evidence revealing that this metric lacks sensitivity to dimensional collapse, highlighting its limitations. To address this limitation and design a more effective uniformity metric, this paper identifies five fundamental properties, some of which the existing uniformity metric fails to meet. We subsequently introduce a novel uniformity metric that satisfies all of these desiderata and exhibits sensitivity to dimensional collapse.

    "abstract": "In this article, the use of channel state information (CSI) for indoor positioning is studied. In the considered model, a server equipped with several antennas sends pilot signals to users, while each user uses the received pilot signals to estimate channel states for user positioning. To this end, we formulate the positioning problem as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the gap between the estimated positions and the ground truth positions of users. To solve this problem, we design a complex-valued neural network (CVNN) model based federated learning (FL) algorithm. Compared to standard real-valued centralized machine learning (ML) methods, our proposed algorithm has two main advantages. First, our proposed algorithm can directly process complex-valued CSI data without data transformation. Second, our proposed algorithm is a distributed ML method that does not require users to send their CSI data to the server. Since the output of our proposed algorithm is complex-valued which consists of the real and imaginary parts, we study the use of the CVNN to implement two learning tasks. First, the proposed algorithm directly outputs the estimated positions of a user. Here, the real and imaginary parts of an output neuron represent the 2D coordinates of the user. Second, the proposed method can output two CSI features (i.e., line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight transmission link classification and time of arrival (TOA) prediction) which can be used in traditional positioning algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed CVNN based FL can reduce the mean positioning error between the estimated position and the actual position by up to 36\\%, compared to a RVNN based FL which requires to transform CSI data into real-valued data.

The substantial demand for high-quality human motion data especially in online acquirement has led to a surge in human motion research works. Prior works have mainly concentrated on dual-modality learning, such as text and motion tasks, but three-modality learning has been rarely explored. Intuitively, an extra introduced modality can enrich a model's application scenario, and more importantly, an adequate choice of the extra modality can also act as an intermediary and enhance the alignment between the other two disparate modalities. In this work, we introduce LAVIMO (LAnguage-VIdeo-MOtion alignment), a novel framework for three-modality learning integrating human-centric videos as an additional modality, thereby effectively bridging the gap between text and motion. Moreover, our approach leverages a specially designed attention mechanism to foster enhanced alignment and synergistic effects among text, video, and motion modalities. Empirically, our results on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets show that LAVIMO achieves state-of-the-art performance in various motion-related cross-modal retrieval tasks, including text-to-motion, motion-to-text, video-to-motion and motion-to-video.

During the early phase of infection, asymptomatic carriers exhibit the same activity level as susceptible individuals, which presents challenges for incorporating control measures in epidemic projection models. This paper focuses on modeling and cost-efficient activity control of susceptible and carrier individuals in the context of the susceptible-carrier-infected-removed (SCIR) epidemic model over a two-layer contact network. In this model, individuals switch from a static contact layer to create new links in a temporal layer based on state-dependent activation rates. We derive conditions for the infection to die out or persist in a homogeneous network. Considering the significant costs associated with reducing the activity of susceptible and carrier individuals, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the disease decay rate while constrained by a limited budget. We propose the use of successive geometric programming (SGP) approximation for this optimization task. Through simulation experiments on Poisson random graphs, we assess the impact of different parameters on disease prevalence. The results demonstrate that our SGP framework achieves a cost reduction of nearly 33% compared to conventional methods based on degree and closeness centrality. ",

    "abstract": "The solution of a sparse system of linear equations is ubiquitous in scientific applications. Iterative methods, such as the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG), are normally chosen over direct methods due to memory and computational complexity constraints. However, the efficiency of these methods depends on the preconditioner utilized. The development of the preconditioner normally requires some insight into the sparse linear system and the desired trade-off of generating the preconditioner and the reduction in the number of iterations. Incomplete factorization methods tend to be black box methods to generate these preconditioners but may fail for a number of reasons. These reasons include numerical issues that require searching for adequate scaling, shifting, and fill-in while utilizing a difficult to parallelize algorithm. With a move towards heterogeneous computing, many sparse applications find GPUs that are optimized for dense tensor applications like training neural networks being underutilized. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple artificial neural network trained either at compile time or in parallel to the running application on a GPU can provide an incomplete sparse Cholesky factorization that can be used as a preconditioner. This generated preconditioner is as good or better in terms of reduction of iterations than the one found using multiple preconditioning techniques such as scaling and shifting. Moreover, the generated method also works and never fails to produce a preconditioner that does not reduce the iteration count. ",

In addition, we compare linear machine learning methods and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed HODAB model.

The objective is to optimize a reward function via minimizing a measure of cumulative regret with respect to the best sequence of interventions in hindsight. The paper advances the results on CBs in three directions. First, the structural causal models (SCMs) are assumed to be unknown and drawn arbitrarily from a general class $\\mathcal{F}$ of Lipschitz-continuous functions. Existing results are often focused on (generalized) linear SCMs. Second, the interventions are assumed to be generalized soft with any desired level of granularity, resulting in an infinite number of possible interventions. The existing literature, in contrast, generally adopts atomic and hard interventions. Third, we provide general upper and lower bounds on regret. The upper bounds subsume (and improve) known bounds for special cases. The lower bounds are generally hitherto unknown. These bounds are characterized as functions of the (i) graph parameters, (ii) eluder dimension of the space of SCMs, denoted by $\\operatorname{dim}(\\mathcal{F})$, and (iii) the covering number of the function space, denoted by ${\\rm cn}(\\mathcal{F})$. Specifically, the cumulative achievable regret over horizon $T$ is $\\mathcal{O}(K d^{L-1}\\sqrt{T\\operatorname{dim}(\\mathcal{F}) \\log({\\rm cn}(\\mathcal{F}))})$, where $K$ is related to the Lipschitz constants, $d$ is the graph's maximum in-degree, and $L$ is the length of the longest causal path.

Here, the manipulator interacts with objects, and classifies them based on differing causal factors. These are parameters, such as mass or friction coefficient, that causally determine the outcomes of its interactions. Through reinforcement learning, the manipulator learns to interact in ways that reveal the underlying causal factors.

    "title": "Toward Autonomous Cooperation in Heterogeneous Nanosatellite  Constellations Using Dynamic Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "The upcoming landscape of Earth Observation missions will defined by networked heterogeneous nanosatellite constellations required to meet strict mission requirements, such as revisit times and spatial resolution. However, scheduling satellite communications in these satellite networks through efficiently creating a global satellite Contact Plan (CP) is a complex task, with current solutions requiring ground-based coordination or being limited by onboard computational resources. The paper proposes a novel approach to overcome these challenges by modeling the constellations and CP as dynamic networks and employing graph-based techniques. The proposed method utilizes a state-of-the-art dynamic graph neural network to evaluate the performance of a given CP and update it using a heuristic algorithm based on simulated annealing. The trained neural network can predict the network delay with a mean absolute error of 3.6 minutes. Simulation results show that the proposed method can successfully design a contact plan for large satellite networks, improving the delay by 29.1%, similar to a traditional approach, while performing the objective evaluations 20x faster.
