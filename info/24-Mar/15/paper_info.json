    "abstract": "Lately, researchers in artificial intelligence have been really interested in how language and vision come together, giving rise to the development of multimodal models that aim to seamlessly integrate textual and visual information. Multimodal models, an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs), have exhibited remarkable capabilities in addressing a diverse array of tasks, ranging from image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) to visual grounding. While these models have showcased significant advancements, challenges persist in accurately interpreting images and answering the question, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the multimodal capabilities of existing models. In response to the limitations observed in current Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our proposed model Veagle, incorporates a unique mechanism inspired by the successes and insights of previous works. Veagle leverages a dynamic mechanism to project encoded visual information directly into the language model. This dynamic approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of intricate details present in visual contexts. To validate the effectiveness of Veagle, we conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, emphasizing tasks such as visual question answering and image understanding. Our results indicate a improvement of 5-6 \\% in performance, with Veagle outperforming existing models by a notable margin. The outcomes underscore the model's versatility and applicability beyond traditional benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Out-of-context (OOC) detection is a challenging task involving identifying images and texts that are irrelevant to the context in which they are presented. Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are effective at various tasks, including image classification and text generation. However, the extent of their proficiency in multimodal OOC detection tasks is unclear. In this paper, we investigate the ability of LVLMs to detect multimodal OOC and show that these models cannot achieve high accuracy on OOC detection tasks without fine-tuning. However, we demonstrate that fine-tuning LVLMs on multimodal OOC datasets can further improve their OOC detection accuracy. To evaluate the performance of LVLMs on OOC detection tasks, we fine-tune MiniGPT-4 on the NewsCLIPpings dataset, a large dataset of multimodal OOC. Our results show that fine-tuning MiniGPT-4 on the NewsCLIPpings dataset significantly improves the OOC detection accuracy in this dataset. This suggests that fine-tuning can significantly improve the performance of LVLMs on OOC detection tasks. ",

Most existing MVSC methods first collect complementary information from different views and consequently derive a consensus reconstruction coefficient matrix to indicate the subspace structure of a multi-view data set. In this paper, we initially assume the existence of a consensus reconstruction coefficient matrix and then use it to build a consensus graph filter. In each view, the filter is employed for smoothing the data and designing a regularizer for the reconstruction coefficient matrix. Finally, the obtained reconstruction coefficient matrices from different views are used to create constraints for the consensus reconstruction coefficient matrix. Therefore, in the proposed method, the consensus reconstruction coefficient matrix, the consensus graph filter, and the reconstruction coefficient matrices from different views are interdependent. We provide an optimization algorithm to obtain their optimal values. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view data sets demonstrate that our approach outperforms some state-of-the-art methods. ",

We propose a framework to estimate the parallel performance of a given algorithm by analyzing the runtime behavior of its sequential version. Indeed, by approximating the runtime distribution of the sequential process with statistical methods, the runtime behavior of the parallel process can be predicted by a model based on order statistics. We apply this approach to study the parallel performance of two SAT local search solvers, namely Sparrow and CCASAT, and compare the predicted performances to the results of an actual experimentation on parallel hardware up to 384 cores. We show that the model is accurate and predicts performance close to the empirical data. Moreover, as we study different types of instances (random and crafted), we observe that the local search solvers exhibit different behaviors and that their runtime distributions can be approximated by two types of distributions: exponential (shifted and non-shifted) and lognormal.

We propose a new search space for NLFS that encourages more diverse loss functions to be explored, and a surrogate function that accurately transfers to large-scale convolutional neural networks. We search the space using regularized evolution, a mutation-only aging genetic algorithm. After evolution and a proposed loss function elimination protocol, we transferred the final loss functions across multiple architectures, datasets, and image augmentation techniques to assess generalization. In the end, we discovered three new loss functions, called NeuroLoss1, NeuroLoss2, and NeuroLoss3 that were able to outperform cross-entropy in terms of a higher mean test accuracy as a simple drop-in replacement loss function across the majority of experiments.

Recent advancements in genome sequencing have unveiled a vast diversity of protein families, but compared to the massive search space of all possible amino acid sequences, the set of known functional families is minimal. One could say nature has a limited protein \"vocabulary.\" The major question for computational biologists, therefore, is whether this vocabulary can be expanded to include useful proteins that went extinct long ago, or maybe never evolved in the first place. We outline a computational approach to solving this problem. By merging evolutionary algorithms, machine learning (ML), and bioinformatics, we can facilitate the development of completely novel proteins which have never existed before. We envision this work forming a new sub-field of computational evolution we dub evolutionary algorithms simulating molecular evolution (EASME). ",

    "abstract": "Leveraging semantically precise pseudo masks derived from image-level class knowledge for segmentation, namely image-level Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), still remains challenging. While Class Activation Maps (CAMs) using CNNs have steadily been contributing to the success of WSSS, the resulting activation maps often narrowly focus on class-specific parts (e.g., only face of human). On the other hand, recent works based on vision transformers (ViT) have shown promising results based on their self-attention mechanism to capture the semantic parts but fail in capturing complete class-specific details (e.g., entire body parts of human but also with a dog nearby). In this work, we propose Complementary Branch (CoBra), a novel dual branch framework consisting of two distinct architectures which provide valuable complementary knowledge of class (from CNN) and semantic (from ViT) to each branch. In particular, we learn Class-Aware Projection (CAP) for the CNN branch and Semantic-Aware Projection (SAP) for the ViT branch to explicitly fuse their complementary knowledge and facilitate a new type of extra patch-level supervision. Our model, through CoBra, fuses CNN and ViT's complementary outputs to create robust pseudo masks that integrate both class and semantic information effectively. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively investigate how CNN and ViT complement each other on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, showing a state-of-the-art WSSS result. This includes not only the masks generated by our model, but also the segmentation results derived from utilizing these masks as pseudo labels. ",

SFDFA estimates the weights between output and hidden neurons as feedback connections. The main contribution of this paper is to describe how exact local gradients of spikes can be computed in an online manner while taking into account the intra-neuron dependencies between post-synaptic spikes and derive a dynamical system for neuromorphic hardware compatibility. We compare the SFDFA algorithm with a number of competitor algorithms and show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher performance and convergence rates. ",

However, the widespread availability of deepfakes has given rise to a new challenge in the form of adversarial attacks. Adversaries can manipulate deepfake videos with small, imperceptible perturbations that can deceive the detection models into producing incorrect outputs. To tackle this critical issue, we introduce Adversarial Feature Similarity Learning (AFSL), which integrates three fundamental deep feature learning paradigms. By optimizing the similarity between samples and weight vectors, our approach aims to distinguish between real and fake instances. Additionally, we aim to maximize the similarity between both adversarially perturbed examples and unperturbed examples, regardless of their real or fake nature. Moreover, we introduce a regularization technique that maximizes the dissimilarity between real and fake samples, ensuring a clear separation between these two categories. With extensive experiments on popular deepfake datasets, including FaceForensics++, FaceShifter, and DeeperForensics, the proposed method outperforms other standard adversarial training-based defense methods significantly. This further demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach to protecting deepfake detectors from adversarial attacks. ",

    "abstract": "A heterogeneous micro aerial vehicles (MAV) swarm consists of resource-intensive but expensive advanced MAVs (AMAVs) and resource-limited but cost-effective basic MAVs (BMAVs), offering opportunities in diverse fields. Accurate and real-time localization is crucial for MAV swarms, but current practices lack a low-cost, high-precision, and real-time solution, especially for lightweight BMAVs. We find an opportunity to accomplish the task by transforming AMAVs into mobile localization infrastructures for BMAVs. However, turning this insight into a practical system is non-trivial due to challenges in location estimation with BMAVs' unknown and diverse localization errors and resource allocation of AMAVs given coupled influential factors. This study proposes TransformLoc, a new framework that transforms AMAVs into mobile localization infrastructures, specifically designed for low-cost and resource-constrained BMAVs. We first design an error-aware joint location estimation model to perform intermittent joint location estimation for BMAVs and then design a proximity-driven adaptive grouping-scheduling strategy to allocate resources of AMAVs dynamically. TransformLoc achieves a collaborative, adaptive, and cost-effective localization system suitable for large-scale heterogeneous MAV swarms. We implement TransformLoc on industrial drones and validate its performance. Results show that TransformLoc outperforms baselines including SOTA up to 68\\% in localization performance, motivating up to 60\\% navigation success rate improvement. ",

    "abstract": "The opioid crisis has been one of the most critical society concerns in the United States. Although the medication assisted treatment (MAT) is recognized as the most effective treatment for opioid misuse and addiction, the various side effects can trigger opioid relapse. In addition to MAT, the dietary nutrition intervention has been demonstrated its importance in opioid misuse prevention and recovery. However, research on the alarming connections between dietary patterns and opioid misuse remain under-explored. In response to this gap, in this paper, we first establish a large-scale multifaceted dietary benchmark dataset related to opioid users at the first attempt and then develop a novel framework - i.e., namely Opioid Misuse Detection with Interpretable Dietary Patterns (Diet-ODIN) - to bridge heterogeneous graph (HG) and large language model (LLM) for the identification of users with opioid misuse and the interpretation of their associated dietary patterns. Specifically, in Diet-ODIN, we first construct an HG to comprehensively incorporate both dietary and health-related information, and then we devise a holistic graph learning framework with noise reduction to fully capitalize both users' individual dietary habits and shared dietary patterns for the detection of users with opioid misuse. To further delve into the intricate correlations between dietary patterns and opioid misuse, we exploit an LLM by utilizing the knowledge obtained from the graph learning model for interpretation. The extensive experimental results based on our established benchmark with quantitative and qualitative measures demonstrate the outstanding performance of Diet-ODIN in exploring the complex interplay between opioid misuse and dietary patterns, by comparison with state-of-the-art baseline methods.

We propose Cyclic Data Parallelism, a novel paradigm shifting the execution of the micro-batches from simultaneous to sequential, with a uniform delay. At the cost of a slight gradient delay, the total memory taken by activations is constant, and the gradient communications are balanced during the training step. With Model Parallelism, our technique reduces the number of GPUs needed, by sharing GPUs across micro-batches.

To resolve this problem, we propose a Predictive Clustering of Hierarchical Vessel Behavior (PC-HiV). PC-HiV first uses hierarchical representations to transform every trajectory into a behavioral sequence. Then, it predicts evolution at each timestamp of the sequence based on the representations. By applying predictive clustering and latent encoding, PC-HiV improves clustering and predictions simultaneously. Experiments on real AIS datasets demonstrate PC-HiV's superiority over existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing behavioral evolution discrepancies between vessel types (tramp vs. liner) and within emission control areas.

Given the increasing adoption of LLM-based code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) in SE activities, it is critical to understand the characteristics of bugs contained in code generated by LLMs. This paper examines a sample of 333 bugs collected from code generated using three leading LLMs (i.e., CodeGen, PanGu-Coder, and Codex) and identifies the following 10 distinctive bug patterns: Misinterpretations, Syntax Error, Silly Mistake, Prompt-biased code, Missing Corner Case, Wrong Input Type, Hallucinated Object, Wrong Attribute, Incomplete Generation, and Non-Prompted Consideration. The bug patterns are presented in the form of a taxonomy. The identified bug patterns are validated using an online survey with 34 LLM practitioners and researchers. The surveyed participants generally asserted the significance and prevalence of the bug patterns. Researchers and practitioners can leverage these findings to develop effective quality assurance techniques for LLM-generated code.

    "abstract": "Anatomical trees play a central role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, accurately representing anatomical trees is challenging due to their varying and complex topology and geometry. Traditional methods for representing tree structures, captured using medical imaging, while invaluable for visualizing vascular and bronchial networks, exhibit drawbacks in terms of limited resolution, flexibility, and efficiency. Recently, implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for representing shapes accurately and efficiently. We propose a novel approach for representing anatomical trees using INR, while also capturing the distribution of a set of trees via denoising diffusion in the space of INRs. We accurately capture the intricate geometries and topologies of anatomical trees at any desired resolution. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate high-fidelity tree reconstruction with arbitrary resolution yet compact storage, and versatility across anatomical sites and tree complexities.

    "abstract": "With more scientific fields relying on neural networks (NNs) to process data incoming at extreme throughputs and latencies, it is crucial to develop NNs with all their parameters stored on-chip. In many of these applications, there is not enough time to go off-chip and retrieve weights. Even more so, off-chip memory such as DRAM does not have the bandwidth required to process these NNs as fast as the data is being produced (e.g., every 25 ns). As such, these extreme latency and bandwidth requirements have architectural implications for the hardware intended to run these NNs: 1) all NN parameters must fit on-chip, and 2) codesigning custom/reconfigurable logic is often required to meet these latency and bandwidth constraints. In our work, we show that many scientific NN applications must run fully on chip, in the extreme case requiring a custom chip to meet such stringent constraints. ",

    "abstract": "Partial differential equations have a wide range of applications in modeling multiple physical, biological, or social phenomena. Therefore, we need to approximate the solutions of these equations in computationally feasible terms. Nowadays, among the most popular numerical methods for solving partial differential equations in engineering, we encounter the finite difference and finite element methods. An alternative numerical method that has recently gained popularity for numerically solving partial differential equations is the use of artificial neural networks. Artificial neural networks, or neural networks for short, are mathematical structures with universal approximation properties. In addition, thanks to the extraordinary computational development of the last decade, neural networks have become accessible and powerful numerical methods for engineers and researchers. For example, imaging and language processing are applications of neural networks today that show sublime performance inconceivable years ago. This dissertation contributes to the numerical solution of partial differential equations using neural networks with the following two-fold objective: investigate the behavior of neural networks as approximators of solutions of partial differential equations and propose neural-network-based methods for frameworks that are hardly addressable via traditional numerical methods. As novel neural-network-based proposals, we first present a method inspired by the finite element method when applying mesh refinements to solve parametric problems. Secondly, we propose a general residual minimization scheme based on a generalized version of the Ritz method. Finally, we develop a memory-based strategy to overcome a usual numerical integration limitation when using neural networks to solve partial differential equations. ",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the fronthaul compression problem in a user-centric cloud radio access network, in which single-antenna users are served by a central processor (CP) cooperatively via a cluster of remote radio heads (RRHs). To satisfy the fronthaul capacity constraint, this paper proposes a transform-compress-forward scheme, which consists of well-designed transformation matrices and uniform quantizers. The transformation matrices perform dimension reduction in the uplink and dimension expansion in the downlink. To reduce the communication overhead for designing the transformation matrices, this paper further proposes a deep learning framework to first learn a suboptimal transformation matrix at each RRH based on the local channel state information (CSI), and then to refine it iteratively. To facilitate the refinement process, we propose an efficient signaling scheme that only requires the transmission of low-dimensional effective CSI and its gradient between the CP and RRH, and further, a meta-learning based gated recurrent unit network to reduce the number of signaling transmission rounds. For the sum-rate maximization problem, simulation results show that the proposed two-stage neural network can perform close to the fully cooperative global CSI based benchmark with significantly reduced communication overhead for both the uplink and the downlink. Moreover, using the first stage alone can already outperform the existing local CSI based benchmark. ",

While conventional control systems for UAVs aim to ensure flight stability and safe operation while accomplishing tasks, UAVs may experience various flight faults that can degrade performance or, in severe cases, lead to instability. Unsatisfactory performance or instability of a UAV poses risks to lives, properties, and the flying environment. Therefore, it's essential to design a system capable of detecting faults, pinpointing their location, assessing their severity, and using this information to mitigate them, enabling the vehicle to continue operating satisfactorily. Despite the importance of analysing fault performance to select optimal fault detection and tolerance strategies, limited research has been conducted, especially with real systems. This study examines the performance of a 2-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) bi-rotor helicopter's control system in the presence of various actuator faults. Results from different fault conditions demonstrate that faults degrade the performance of conventional control systems on UAVs and introduce vibrations into the system, particularly when faults cause asymmetry or imbalance. However, additional experiments reveal that effective fault diagnosis and accommodation methods can help maintain satisfactory system performance despite the presence of faults. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for resilient distributed consensus in multiagent networks when dealing with adversarial agents imprecision in states observed by normal agents. Traditional resilient distributed consensus algorithms often presume that agents have exact knowledge of their neighbors' states, which is unrealistic in practical scenarios. We show that such existing methods are inadequate when agents only have access to imprecise states of their neighbors. To overcome this challenge, we adapt a geometric approach and model an agent's state by an `imprecision region' rather than a point in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. From a given set of imprecision regions, we first present an efficient way to compute a region that is guaranteed to lie in the convex hull of true, albeit unknown, states of agents. We call this region the \\emph{invariant hull} of imprecision regions and provide its geometric characterization. Next, we use these invariant hulls to identify a \\emph{safe point} for each normal agent. The safe point of an agent lies within the convex hull of its \\emph{normal} neighbors' states and hence is used by the agent to update it's state. This leads to the aggregation of normal agents' states to safe points inside the convex hull of their initial states, or an approximation of consensus. We also illustrate our results through simulations. Our contributions enhance the robustness of resilient distributed consensus algorithms by accommodating state imprecision without compromising resilience against adversarial agents. ",

Two parallel lines of work on VPR have shown, on one side, that general-purpose off-the-shelf feature representations can provide robustness to domain shifts, and, on the other, that fused information from sequences of images improves performance. In our recent work on measuring domain gaps between image datasets, we proposed a Visual Distribution of Neuron Activations (VDNA) representation to represent datasets of images. This representation can naturally handle image sequences and provides a general and granular feature representation derived from a general-purpose model. Moreover, our representation is based on tracking neuron activation values over the list of images to represent and is not limited to a particular neural network layer, therefore having access to high- and low-level concepts. This work shows how VDNAs can be used for VPR by learning a very lightweight and simple encoder to generate task-specific descriptors. Our experiments show that our representation can allow for better robustness than current solutions to serious domain shifts away from the training data distribution, such as to indoor environments and aerial imagery.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs presents a significant challenge due to the temporal evolution of graph structures and attributes. The conventional approaches that tackle this problem typically employ an unsupervised learning framework, capturing normality patterns with exclusive normal data during training and identifying deviations as anomalies during testing. However, these methods face critical drawbacks: they either only depend on proxy tasks for general representation without directly pinpointing normal patterns, or they neglect to differentiate between spatial and temporal normality patterns, leading to diminished efficacy in anomaly detection. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal memories-enhanced graph autoencoder (STRIPE). Initially, STRIPE employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and gated temporal convolution layers to extract spatial features and temporal features, respectively. Then STRIPE incorporates separate spatial and temporal memory networks, which capture and store prototypes of normal patterns, thereby preserving the uniqueness of spatial and temporal normality. After that, through a mutual attention mechanism, these stored patterns are then retrieved and integrated with encoded graph embeddings. Finally, the integrated features are fed into the decoder to reconstruct the graph streams which serve as the proxy task for anomaly detection. This comprehensive approach not only minimizes reconstruction errors but also refines the model by emphasizing the compactness and distinctiveness of the embeddings in relation to the nearest memory prototypes. Through extensive testing, STRIPE has demonstrated a superior capability to discern anomalies by effectively leveraging the distinct spatial and temporal dynamics of dynamic graphs, significantly outperforming existing methodologies, with an average improvement of 15.39% on AUC values.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative machine learning training without sharing private data. While most FL methods assume identical data domains across clients, real-world scenarios often involve heterogeneous data domains. Federated Prototype Learning (FedPL) addresses this issue, using mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However, existing FedPL methods create the same number of prototypes for each client, leading to cross-domain performance gaps and disparities for clients with varied data distributions. To mitigate cross-domain feature representation variance, we introduce FedPLVM, which establishes variance-aware dual-level prototypes clustering and employs a novel $\\alpha$-sparsity prototype loss. The dual-level prototypes clustering strategy creates local clustered prototypes based on private data features, then performs global prototypes clustering to reduce communication complexity and preserve local data privacy. The $\\alpha$-sparsity prototype loss aligns samples from underrepresented domains, enhancing intra-class similarity and reducing inter-class similarity. Evaluations on Digit-5, Office-10, and DomainNet datasets demonstrate our method's superiority over existing approaches. ",

Existing work consider a listener as a reactive agent with reflexive behaviors to the speaker's voice and facial motions. The heart of our framework is Dyadic Interaction Modeling (DIM), a pre-training approach that jointly models speakers' and listeners' motions through masking and contrastive learning to learn representations that capture the dyadic context. To enable the generation of non-deterministic behaviors, we encode both listener and speaker motions into discrete latent representations, through VQ-VAE. The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned for motion generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in generating listener motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art according to the quantitative measures capturing the diversity and realism of generated motions.

In detail, at the plant side, a chaotic dynamic system is deployed to encode the sensor measurement, and at the estimator side, an estimator estimates both states of the physical plant and the chaotic system. With this protocol, no additional secure communication links is needed for synchronization, and the masking effect can be perfectly removed when the estimator is in steady state.

However, most AT methods suffer from robust overfitting, i.e., a significant generalization gap in adversarial robustness between the training and testing curves. In this paper, we first identify a connection between robust overfitting and the excessive memorization of noisy labels in AT from a view of gradient norm. As such label noise is mainly caused by a distribution mismatch and improper label assignments, we are motivated to propose a label refinement approach for AT. Specifically, our Self-Guided Label Refinement first self-refines a more accurate and informative label distribution from over-confident hard labels, and then it calibrates the training by dynamically incorporating knowledge from self-distilled models into the current model and thus requiring no external teachers. Empirical results demonstrate that our method can simultaneously boost the standard accuracy and robust performance across multiple benchmark datasets, attack types, and architectures. In addition, we also provide a set of analyses from the perspectives of information theory to dive into our method and suggest the importance of soft labels for robust generalization. ",

First, the weighted margin loss prioritizes positive cases, supplemented by an auxiliary loss function based on the Ejection Fraction (EF) regression task, a crucial measure of cardiac function. This approach enhances the model's resilience in the face of class imbalance. Second, recognizing the quadratic complexity of dynamic routing leading to training inefficiencies, we adopt the attention mechanism as a more computationally efficient alternative. Our results demonstrate that CardioCaps surpasses traditional machine learning baseline methods, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost with sampling methods and a class weight matrix. Furthermore, CardioCaps outperforms other deep learning baseline methods such as CNNs, ResNets, U-Nets, and ViTs, as well as advanced CapsNets methods such as EM-CapsNets and Efficient-CapsNets. Notably, our model demonstrates robustness to class imbalance, achieving high precision even in datasets with a substantial proportion of negative cases. ",

    "abstract": "In many developing countries, access to electricity remains a significant challenge. Electrification planners in these countries often have to make important decisions on the mode of electrification and the planning of electrical networks for those without access, while under resource constraints. An integrated approach to electrification planning in which traditional grid electrification is complemented off-the-grid technologies such as off-grid microgrids and stand-alone systems can enable the economic provision of electricity access in these regions. This integrated planning approach can be facilitated by determining the least-cost mode of electrification - i.e by electric grid extension or off-grid systems - for non-electrified consumers in a region under analysis, while considering technical, economic and environmental constraints. Computational clustering methods the identification of consumer clusters (either as clusters of off-grid microgrids, stand-alone systems or grid-extension projects) can be undertaken using computational clustering methods. This paper presents a novel computational approach to achieve this purpose. This methodology involves exploiting the grid network that connects all consumers, by greedily partitioning the network to identify clusters of consumers to be electrified by grid-extension and off-grid microgrid systems. Using test cases and sensitivity analyses, we implement and benchmark this top-down approach with those obtained from a bottom-up clustering methodology used by the Reference Electrification Model, a model obtainable in literature. Results presented show that the alternative top-down methodology proposed can compare favorably, in terms of global electrification costs, with a bottom-up approach to rural electrification planning.

By conceptualizing IoT devices as nodes within a graph structure, we present a detection mechanism capable of operating efficiently even in lossy network environments. We introduce various graph topologies for modeling IoT networks and evaluate them for detecting tunable futuristic DDoS attacks. By studying different levels of network connection loss and various attack situations, we demonstrate that the correlation-based hybrid graph structure is effective in spotting DDoS attacks, substantiating its good performance even in lossy network scenarios. The results indicate a remarkable performance of the GCN-based DDoS detection model with an F1 score of up to 91%. Furthermore, we observe at most a 2% drop in F1-score in environments with up to 50% connection loss. The findings from this study highlight the advantages of utilizing GCN for the security of IoT systems which benefit from high detection accuracy while being resilient to connection disruption. ",

The monitoring edge-geodetic number of $G$, denoted by $meg(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of such an MEG-set. This notion provides a graph theoretic model of the network monitoring problem. In this article, we compare $meg(G)$ with some other graph theoretic parameters stemming from the network monitoring problem and provide examples of graphs having prescribed values for each of these parameters. We also characterize graphs $G$ that have $V(G)$ as their minimum MEG-set, which settles an open problem due to Foucaud \\textit{et al.} (CALDAM 2023), and prove that some classes of graphs fall within this characterization. We also provide a general upper bound for $meg(G)$ for sparse graphs in terms of their girth, and later refine the upper bound using the chromatic number of $G$. We examine the change in $meg(G)$ with respect to two fundamental graph operations: clique-sum and subdivisions.

Existing Contract Theory-based methods are designed under the assumption that there is only one FL server in the system (i.e., the monopoly market assumption), which in unrealistic in practice. To address this limitation, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-Server FL task delegation approach (FAMuS), a novel framework based on Contract Theory and Lyapunov optimization to jointly address these intricate issues facing wireless multi-server FL networks (WMSFLN). Within a given WMSFLN, a task requester products multiple FL tasks and delegate them to FL servers which coordinate the training processes. To ensure fair treatment of FL servers, FAMuS establishes virtual queues to track their previous access to FL tasks, updating them in relation to the resulting FL model performance. The objective is to minimize the time-averaged cost in a WMSFLN, while ensuring all queues remain stable. This is particularly challenging given the incomplete information regarding FL clients' participation cost and the unpredictable nature of the WMSFLN state, which depends on the locations of the mobile clients. Extensive experiments comparing FAMuS against five state-of-the-art approaches based on two real-world datasets demonstrate that it achieves 6.91% higher test accuracy, 27.34% lower cost, and 0.63% higher fairness on average than the best-performing baseline.

As a prominent solution, Graph Augmentation Learning (GAL) has recently received increasing attention. Among prior GAL approaches, edge-dropping methods that randomly remove edges from a graph during training are effective techniques to improve the robustness of GNNs. However, randomly dropping edges often results in bypassing critical edges, consequently weakening the effectiveness of message passing. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial edge-dropping method (ADEdgeDrop) that leverages an adversarial edge predictor guiding the removal of edges, which can be flexibly incorporated into diverse GNN backbones. Employing an adversarial training framework, the edge predictor utilizes the line graph transformed from the original graph to estimate the edges to be dropped, which improves the interpretability of the edge-dropping method. The proposed ADEdgeDrop is optimized alternately by stochastic gradient descent and projected gradient descent. Comprehensive experiments on six graph benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed ADEdgeDrop outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various GNN backbones, demonstrating improved generalization and robustness.

It is the foundation of safeguarding individuals' privacy rights and ensuring responsible data handling practices in the digital age. Since privacy of object is not shift-invariant, the essence of the privacy object detection task is inferring object privacy based on scene information. However, privacy object detection has long been studied as a subproblem of common object detection tasks. Therefore, existing methods suffer from serious deficiencies in accuracy, generalization, and interpretability. Moreover, creating large-scale privacy datasets is difficult due to legal constraints and existing privacy datasets lack label granularity. The granularity of existing privacy detection methods remains limited to the image level. To address the above two issues, we introduce two benchmark datasets for object-level privacy detection and propose SHAN, Scene Heterogeneous graph Attention Network, a model constructs a scene heterogeneous graph from an image and utilizes self-attention mechanisms for scene inference to obtain object privacy. Through experiments, we demonstrated that SHAN performs excellently in privacy object detection tasks, with all metrics surpassing those of the baseline model. ",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is an essential component in autonomous driving, particularly for collision avoidance systems. Considering the inherent uncertainty of the task, numerous studies have utilized generative models to produce multiple plausible future trajectories for each agent. However, most of them suffer from restricted representation ability or unstable training issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose utilizing the diffusion model to generate the distribution of future trajectories. Two cruxes are to be settled to realize such an idea. First, the diversity of intention is intertwined with the uncertain surroundings, making the true distribution hard to parameterize. Second, the diffusion process is time-consuming during the inference phase, rendering it unrealistic to implement in a real-time driving system. We propose an Intention-aware denoising Diffusion Model (IDM), which tackles the above two problems. We decouple the original uncertainty into intention uncertainty and action uncertainty and model them with two dependent diffusion processes. To decrease the inference time, we reduce the variable dimensions in the intention-aware diffusion process and restrict the initial distribution of the action-aware diffusion process, which leads to fewer diffusion steps. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) and ETH/UCY dataset. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results, with an FDE of 13.83 pixels on the SDD dataset and 0.36 meters on the ETH/UCY dataset. Compared with the original diffusion model, IDM reduces inference time by two-thirds. Interestingly, our experiments further reveal that introducing intention information is beneficial in modeling the diffusion process of fewer steps. ",

Previous studies on insider threat detection (ITD) mainly focus on detecting abnormal users or abnormal time periods (e.g., a week or a day). However, a user may have hundreds of thousands of activities in the log, and even within a day there may exist thousands of activities for a user, requiring a high investigation budget to verify abnormal users or activities given the detection results. On the other hand, existing works are mainly post-hoc methods rather than real-time detection, which can not report insider threats in time before they cause loss. In this paper, we conduct the first study towards real-time ITD at activity level, and present a fine-grained and efficient framework LAN. Specifically, LAN simultaneously learns the temporal dependencies within an activity sequence and the relationships between activities across sequences with graph structure learning. Moreover, to mitigate the data imbalance problem in ITD, we propose a novel hybrid prediction loss, which integrates self-supervision signals {from normal activities} and supervision signals from abnormal activities into a unified loss for anomaly detection. We evaluate the performance of LAN on two widely used datasets, i.e., CERT r4.2 and CERT r5.2. Extensive and comparative experiments demonstrate the superiority of LAN, outperforming 9 state-of-the-art baselines by at least 9.92% and 6.35% in AUC for real-time ITD on CERT r4.2 and r5.2, respectively. Moreover, LAN can be also applied to post-hoc ITD, surpassing 8 competitive baselines by at least 7.70% and 4.03% in AUC on two datasets. Finally, the ablation study, parameter analysis, and compatibility analysis evaluate the impact of each module and hyper-parameter in LAN. ",

Technically, our PoIFusion follows the paradigm of query-based object detection, formulating object queries as dynamic 3D boxes. The PoIs are adaptively generated from each query box on the fly, serving as the keypoints to represent a 3D object and play the role of basic units in multi-modal fusion. Specifically, we project PoIs into the view of each modality to sample the corresponding feature and integrate the multi-modal features at each PoI through a dynamic fusion block. Furthermore, the features of PoIs derived from the same query box are aggregated together to update the query feature. Our approach prevents information loss caused by view transformation and eliminates the computation-intensive global attention, making the multi-modal 3D object detector more applicable. We conducted extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset to evaluate our approach. Remarkably, our PoIFusion achieves 74.9\\% NDS and 73.4\\% mAP, setting a state-of-the-art record on the multi-modal 3D object detection benchmark.

    "abstract": "Improving the detection of distant 3d objects is an important yet challenging task. For camera-based 3D perception, the annotation of 3d bounding relies heavily on LiDAR for accurate depth information. As such, the distance of annotation is often limited due to the sparsity of LiDAR points on distant objects, which hampers the capability of existing detectors for long-range scenarios. We address this challenge by considering only 2D box supervision for distant objects since they are easy to annotate. We propose LR3D, a framework that learns to recover the missing depth of distant objects. LR3D adopts an implicit projection head to learn the generation of mapping between 2D boxes and depth using the 3D supervision on close objects. This mapping allows the depth estimation of distant objects conditioned on their 2D boxes, making long-range 3D detection with 2D supervision feasible. Experiments show that without distant 3D annotations, LR3D allows camera-based methods to detect distant objects (over 200m) with comparable accuracy to full 3D supervision. Our framework is general, and could widely benefit 3D detection methods to a large extent. ",

This growing concern has sparked the introduction of counterfactual explanations, designed as human-understandable what if scenarios, to provide clearer insights into the decision-making process behind undesirable predictions. The generation of counterfactual explanations, however, encounters specific challenges when dealing with the sequential nature of the (business) process cases typically used in predictive process analytics. Our paper tackles this challenge by introducing a data-driven approach, REVISEDplus, to generate more feasible and plausible counterfactual explanations. First, we restrict the counterfactual algorithm to generate counterfactuals that lie within a high-density region of the process data, ensuring that the proposed counterfactuals are realistic and feasible within the observed process data distribution. Additionally, we ensure plausibility by learning sequential patterns between the activities in the process cases, utilising Declare language templates. Finally, we evaluate the properties that define the validity of counterfactuals. ",

While the issue of gun control in the US involves complex legal concerns, there are also societal issues at play. One such social issue is so-called \"gun culture,\" i.e., a general set of beliefs and actions related to gun ownership. However relatively little is known about gun culture, and even less is known when it comes to fringe online communities. This is especially worrying considering the aforementioned rise in mass shootings and numerous instances of shooters being radicalized online. To address this gap, we explore gun culture on /k/, 4chan's weapons board. More specifically, using a variety of quantitative techniques, we examine over 4M posts on /k/ and position their discussion within the larger body of theoretical understanding of gun culture. Among other things, our findings suggest that gun culture on /k/ covers a relatively diverse set of topics (with a particular focus on legal discussion), some of which are signals of fetishism. ",

    "abstract": "Active learning (AL) techniques reduce labeling costs for training neural machine translation (NMT) models by selecting smaller representative subsets from unlabeled data for annotation. Diversity sampling techniques select heterogeneous instances, while uncertainty sampling methods select instances with the highest model uncertainty. Both approaches have limitations - diversity methods may extract varied but trivial examples, while uncertainty sampling can yield repetitive, uninformative instances. To bridge this gap, we propose HUDS, a hybrid AL strategy for domain adaptation in NMT that combines uncertainty and diversity for sentence selection. HUDS computes uncertainty scores for unlabeled sentences and subsequently stratifies them. It then clusters sentence embeddings within each stratum using k-MEANS and computes diversity scores by distance to the centroid. A weighted hybrid score that combines uncertainty and diversity is then used to select the top instances for annotation in each AL iteration. Experiments on multi-domain German-English datasets demonstrate the better performance of HUDS over other strong AL baselines. We analyze the sentence selection with HUDS and show that it prioritizes diverse instances having high model uncertainty for annotation in early AL iterations. ",

Currently, overfitting remains a critical problem in event-based classification tasks for Spiking Neural Network (SNN) due to its relatively weak spatial representation capability. Data augmentation is a simple but efficient method to alleviate overfitting and improve the generalization ability of neural networks, and saliency-based augmentation methods are proven to be effective in the image processing field. However, there is no approach available for extracting saliency maps from SNNs. Therefore, for the first time, we present Spiking Layer-Time-wise Relevance Propagation rule (SLTRP) and Spiking Layer-wise Relevance Propagation rule (SLRP) in order for SNN to generate stable and accurate CAMs and saliency maps. Based on this, we propose EventRPG, which leverages relevance propagation on the spiking neural network for more efficient augmentation. Our proposed method has been evaluated on several SNN structures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in object recognition tasks including N-Caltech101, CIFAR10-DVS, with accuracies of 85.62% and 85.55%, as well as action recognition task SL-Animals with an accuracy of 91.59%.

Using a technique introduced by Whittle, we relax the hard per-stage constraint that each arriving user must be associated with exactly one mmWave base station (mBS) to a long-term constraint and then use the Lagrangian multiplier technique to convert the problem into an unconstrained problem. This decouples the process governing the system into separate Markov Decision Processes at different mBSs. We prove that the problem is Whittle indexable, present a scheme for computing the Whittle indices of different mBSs, and propose an association scheme under which, each arriving user is associated with the mBS with the smallest value of the Whittle index. Using extensive simulations, we show that the proposed Whittle index based scheme outperforms several user association schemes proposed in prior work in terms of various performance metrics such as average cost, delay, throughput, and Jain's fairness index.

In this paper, we propose a multimodal adversarial training architecture with spatial awareness capabilities.

Simultaneously, We add a Spatial-Aware Self-Attention (SASA) mechanism to help the model better capture the spatial relationships among OCR tokens. Various experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements on both the ST-VQA and TextVQA datasets and provides a novel paradigm for multimodal adversarial training.

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting the survival rate of cancer patients is crucial for aiding clinicians in planning appropriate treatment, reducing cancer-related medical expenses, and significantly enhancing patients' quality of life. Multimodal prediction of cancer patient survival offers a more comprehensive and precise approach. However, existing methods still grapple with challenges related to missing multimodal data and information interaction within modalities. This paper introduces SELECTOR, a heterogeneous graph-aware network based on convolutional mask encoders for robust multimodal prediction of cancer patient survival. SELECTOR comprises feature edge reconstruction, convolutional mask encoder, feature cross-fusion, and multimodal survival prediction modules. Initially, we construct a multimodal heterogeneous graph and employ the meta-path method for feature edge reconstruction, ensuring comprehensive incorporation of feature information from graph edges and effective embedding of nodes. To mitigate the impact of missing features within the modality on prediction accuracy, we devised a convolutional masked autoencoder (CMAE) to process the heterogeneous graph post-feature reconstruction. Subsequently, the feature cross-fusion module facilitates communication between modalities, ensuring that output features encompass all features of the modality and relevant information from other modalities. Extensive experiments and analysis on six cancer datasets from TCGA demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both modality-missing and intra-modality information-confirmed cases.

Using systematic reviews as a baseline, and publication data from the NIH Open Citation Collection, we compare the performance of the three citation-based approaches direct citation, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling with respect to recall and precision measures. In addition, we include the PubMed Related Article score as well as combined approaches in the comparison. We also provide a fairly comprehensive review of earlier research in which citation relations have been used for information retrieval purposes. The results show an advantage for co-citation over bibliographic coupling and direct citation. However, combining the three approaches outperforms the exclusive use of co-citation in the study. The results further indicate, in line with previous research, that combining citation-based approaches with textual approaches enhances the performance of seed-based information retrieval. The results from the study may guide approaches combining citation-based and textual approaches in their choice of citation similarity measures. We suggest that future research use more structured approaches to evaluate methods for seed-based retrieval of publications, including comparative approaches as well as the elaboration of common data sets and baselines for evaluation.

    "abstract": "The $\\mathrm{Caus}[-]$ construction takes a base category of ``raw materials'' and builds a category of higher order causal processes, that is a category whose types encode causal (a.k.a. signalling) constraints between collections of systems. Notable examples are categories of higher-order stochastic maps and higher-order quantum channels. Well-typedness in $\\mathrm{Caus}[-]$ corresponds to a composition of processes being causally consistent, in the sense that any choice of local processes of the prescribed types yields an overall process respecting causality constraints. It follows that closed processes always occur with probability 1, ruling out e.g. causal paradoxes arising from time loops. It has previously been shown that $\\mathrm{Caus}[\\mathcal{C}]$ gives a model of MLL+MIX and BV logic, hence these logics give sufficient conditions for causal consistency, but they fail to provide a complete characterisation. In this follow-on work, we introduce graph types as a tool to examine causal structures over graphs in this model. We explore their properties, standard forms, and equivalent definitions; in particular, a process obeys all signalling constraints of the graph iff it is expressible as an affine combination of factorisations into local causal processes connected according to the edges of the graph. The properties of graph types are then used to prove completeness for causal consistency of a new causal logic that conservatively extends pomset logic. The crucial extra ingredient is a notion of distinguished atoms that correspond to first-order states, which only admit a flow of information in one direction. Using the fact that causal logic conservatively extends pomset logic, we finish by giving a physically-meaningful interpretation to a separating statement between pomset and BV. ",

    "title": "Recursive Causal Discovery",
    "abstract": "Causal discovery, i.e., learning the causal graph from data, is often the first step toward the identification and estimation of causal effects, a key requirement in numerous scientific domains. Causal discovery is hampered by two main challenges: limited data results in errors in statistical testing and the computational complexity of the learning task is daunting. This paper builds upon and extends four of our prior publications (Mokhtarian et al., 2021; Akbari et al., 2021; Mokhtarian et al., 2022, 2023a). These works introduced the concept of removable variables, which are the only variables that can be removed recursively for the purpose of causal discovery. Presence and identification of removable variables allow recursive approaches for causal discovery, a promising solution that helps to address the aforementioned challenges by reducing the problem size successively. This reduction not only minimizes conditioning sets in each conditional independence (CI) test, leading to fewer errors but also significantly decreases the number of required CI tests. The worst-case performances of these methods nearly match the lower bound. In this paper, we present a unified framework for the proposed algorithms, refined with additional details and enhancements for a coherent presentation. A comprehensive literature review is also included, comparing the computational complexity of our methods with existing approaches, showcasing their state-of-the-art efficiency. Another contribution of this paper is the release of RCD, a Python package that efficiently implements these algorithms.

    "abstract": "Medical anomaly detection aims to identify abnormal findings using only normal training data, playing a crucial role in health screening and recognizing rare diseases. Reconstruction-based methods, particularly those utilizing autoencoders (AEs), are dominant in this field. They work under the assumption that AEs trained on only normal data cannot reconstruct unseen abnormal regions well, thereby enabling the anomaly detection based on reconstruction errors. However, this assumption does not always hold due to the mismatch between the reconstruction training objective and the anomaly detection task objective, rendering these methods theoretically unsound. This study focuses on providing a theoretical foundation for AE-based reconstruction methods in anomaly detection. By leveraging information theory, we elucidate the principles of these methods and reveal that the key to improving AE in anomaly detection lies in minimizing the information entropy of latent vectors. Experiments on four datasets with two image modalities validate the effectiveness of our theory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to theoretically clarify the principles and design philosophy of AE for anomaly detection. Code will be available upon acceptance. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce and study the problem of \\textit{binary stretch embedding} of edge-weighted graph. This problem is closely related to the well-known \\textit{addressing problem} of Graham and Pollak. Addressing problem is the problem of assigning the shortest possible length strings (called ``addresses\") over the alphabet $\\{0,1,*\\}$ to the vertices of an input graph $G$ with the following property. For every pair $u,v$ of vertices, the number of positions in which one of their addresses is $1$, and the other is $0$ is exactly equal to the distance of $u,v$ in graph $G$. When the addresses do not contain the symbol $*$, the problem is called \\textit{isometric hypercube embedding}. As far as we know, the isometric hypercube embedding was introduced by Firsov in 1965. It is known that such addresses do not exist for general graphs. Inspired by the addressing problem, in this paper, we introduce the \\textit{binary stretch embedding problem}, or BSEP for short, for the edge-weighted undirected graphs. We also argue how this problem is related to other graph embedding problems in the literature. Using tools and techniques such as Hadamard codes and the theory of linear programming, several upper and lower bounds as well as exact solutions for certain classes of graphs will be discovered. As an application of the results in this paper, we derive improved upper bounds or exact values for the maximum size of Lee metric codes of certain parameters. ",

The primary bottlenecks include 1) the ambiguity keypoints caused by object symmetries; 2) the domain gap between real and synthetic data. To circumvent these problem, we propose a new 6D pose estimation network with symmetric-aware keypoint prediction and self-training domain adaptation (SD-Net). SD-Net builds on pointwise keypoint regression and deep hough voting to perform reliable detection keypoint under clutter and occlusion. Specifically, at the keypoint prediction stage, we designe a robust 3D keypoints selection strategy considering the symmetry class of objects and equivalent keypoints, which facilitate locating 3D keypoints even in highly occluded scenes. Additionally, we build an effective filtering algorithm on predicted keypoint to dynamically eliminate multiple ambiguity and outlier keypoint candidates. At the domain adaptation stage, we propose the self-training framework using a student-teacher training scheme. To carefully distinguish reliable predictions, we harnesses a tailored heuristics for 3D geometry pseudo labelling based on semi-chamfer distance. On public Sil'eane dataset, SD-Net achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining an average precision of 96%. Testing learning and generalization abilities on public Parametric datasets, SD-Net is 8% higher than the state-of-the-art method. The code is available at https://github.com/dingthuang/SD-Net. ",

    "abstract": "IoT devices have become indispensable components of our lives, and the advancement of AI technologies will make them even more pervasive, increasing the vulnerability to malfunctions or cyberattacks and raising privacy concerns. Encryption can mitigate these challenges; however, most existing anomaly detection techniques decrypt the data to perform the analysis, potentially undermining the encryption protection provided during transit or storage. Homomorphic encryption schemes are promising solutions as they enable the processing and execution of operations on IoT data while still encrypted, however, these schemes offer only limited operations, which poses challenges to their practical usage. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving anomaly detection solution designed for homomorphically encrypted data generated by IoT devices that efficiently detects abnormal values without performing decryption. We have adapted the Histogram-based anomaly detection technique for TFHE scheme to address limitations related to the input size and the depth of computation by implementing vectorized support operations. These operations include addition, value placement in buckets, labeling abnormal buckets based on a threshold frequency, labeling abnormal values based on their range, and bucket labels. Evaluation results show that the solution effectively detects anomalies without requiring data decryption and achieves consistent results comparable to the mechanism operating on plain data. Also, it shows robustness and resilience against various challenges commonly encountered in IoT environments, such as noisy sensor data, adversarial attacks, communication failures, and device malfunctions. Moreover, the time and computational overheads determined for several solution configurations, despite being large, are reasonable compared to those reported in existing literature. ",

Synchronous joint optimization is utilized in an end-to-end manner between two components, thus not being affected by the local optimal solution of the individual task. Besides, a comprehensive optimization is established in the gradient matrix between the shared parameters for both tasks. It can converge to an optimal point with fusion detection weights. We extensively test it on several public datasets, demonstrating superior performance on not only visually appealing fusion but also favorable detection performance (e.g., 6.6% mAP50:95) over other state-of-the-art approaches.

To bridge this gap, we introduce AVIBench, a framework designed to analyze the robustness of LVLMs when facing various adversarial visual-instructions (AVIs), including four types of image-based AVIs, ten types of text-based AVIs, and nine types of content bias AVIs (such as gender, violence, cultural, and racial biases, among others). We generate 260K AVIs encompassing five categories of multimodal capabilities (nine tasks) and content bias. We then conduct a comprehensive evaluation involving 14 open-source LVLMs to assess their performance. AVIBench also serves as a convenient tool for practitioners to evaluate the robustness of LVLMs against AVIs. Our findings and extensive experimental results shed light on the vulnerabilities of LVLMs, and highlight that inherent biases exist even in advanced closed-source LVLMs like GeminiProVision and GPT-4V. This underscores the importance of enhancing the robustness, security, and fairness of LVLMs. The source code and benchmark will be made publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "Local differential privacy (LDP), which enables an untrusted server to collect aggregated statistics from distributed users while protecting the privacy of those users, has been widely deployed in practice. However, LDP protocols for frequency estimation are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker can poison the aggregated frequencies by manipulating the data sent from malicious users. Therefore, it is an open challenge to recover the accurate aggregated frequencies from poisoned ones. In this work, we propose LDPRecover, a method that can recover accurate aggregated frequencies from poisoning attacks, even if the server does not learn the details of the attacks. In LDPRecover, we establish a genuine frequency estimator that theoretically guides the server to recover the frequencies aggregated from genuine users' data by eliminating the impact of malicious users' data in poisoned frequencies. Since the server has no idea of the attacks, we propose an adaptive attack to unify existing attacks and learn the statistics of the malicious data within this adaptive attack by exploiting the properties of LDP protocols. By taking the estimator and the learning statistics as constraints, we formulate the problem of recovering aggregated frequencies to approach the genuine ones as a constraint inference (CI) problem. Consequently, the server can obtain accurate aggregated frequencies by solving this problem optimally. Moreover, LDPRecover can serve as a frequency recovery paradigm that recovers more accurate aggregated frequencies by integrating attack details as new constraints in the CI problem. Our evaluation on two real-world datasets, three LDP protocols, and untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks shows that LDPRecover is both accurate and widely applicable against various poisoning attacks.

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation for object detection typically entails transferring knowledge from one visible domain to another visible domain. However, there are limited studies on adapting from the visible to the thermal domain, because the domain gap between the visible and thermal domains is much larger than expected, and traditional domain adaptation can not successfully facilitate learning in this situation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Distinctive Dual-Domain Teacher (D3T) framework that employs distinct training paradigms for each domain. Specifically, we segregate the source and target training sets for building dual-teachers and successively deploy exponential moving average to the student model to individual teachers of each domain. The framework further incorporates a zigzag learning method between dual teachers, facilitating a gradual transition from the visible to thermal domains during training. We validate the superiority of our method through newly designed experimental protocols with well-known thermal datasets, i.e., FLIR and KAIST.

This paper introduces PreConfig, an innovative NCA tool that leverages a pretrained language model for automating network configuration tasks. PreConfig is designed to address the complexity and variety of NCA tasks by framing them as text-to-text transformation problems, thus unifying the tasks of configuration generation, translation, and analysis under a single, versatile model. Our approach overcomes existing tools' limitations by utilizing advances in natural language processing to automatically comprehend and generate network configurations without extensive manual re-engineering. We confront the challenges of integrating domain-specific knowledge into pretrained models and the scarcity of supervision data in the network configuration field. Our solution involves constructing a specialized corpus and further pretraining on network configuration data, coupled with a novel data mining technique for generating task supervision data. The proposed model demonstrates robustness in configuration generation, translation, and analysis, outperforming conventional tools in handling complex networking environments. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of PreConfig, establishing a new direction for automating network configuration tasks with pretrained language models. ",

Three different pre-trained networks were used as feature extractors from traditional MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3 and EfficientNetB0. Our results show that MAD trained on EfficientNetB0 from FERET, FRGCv2, and FRLL can reach a lower error rate in comparison with SOTA. Conversely, worse performances were reached when the system was trained only with synthetic images. A mixed approach (synthetic + digital) database may help to improve MAD and reduce the error rate.

    "abstract": "Identifying highlight moments of raw video materials is crucial for improving the efficiency of editing videos that are pervasive on internet platforms. However, the extensive work of manually labeling footage has created obstacles to applying supervised methods to videos of unseen categories. The absence of an audio modality that contains valuable cues for highlight detection in many videos also makes it difficult to use multimodal strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel model with cross-modal perception for unsupervised highlight detection. The proposed model learns representations with visual-audio level semantics from image-audio pair data via a self-reconstruction task. To achieve unsupervised highlight detection, we investigate the latent representations of the network and propose the representation activation sequence learning (RASL) module with k-point contrastive learning to learn significant representation activations. To connect the visual modality with the audio modality, we use the symmetric contrastive learning (SCL) module to learn the paired visual and audio representations. Furthermore, an auxiliary task of masked feature vector sequence (FVS) reconstruction is simultaneously conducted during pretraining for representation enhancement. During inference, the cross-modal pretrained model can generate representations with paired visual-audio semantics given only the visual modality. The RASL module is used to output the highlight scores. The experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. ",

Open-vocabulary maps, powered by Visual-Language models (VLMs), possess inherent advantages, including multimodal retrieval and open-set classes. However, existing open-vocabulary maps are constrained to closed indoor scenarios and VLM features, thereby diminishing their usability and inference capabilities. Moreover, the absence of topological relationships further complicates the accurate querying of specific instances. In this work, we propose OpenGraph, a representation of open-vocabulary hierarchical graph structure designed for large-scale outdoor environments. OpenGraph initially extracts instances and their captions from visual images using 2D foundation models, encoding the captions with features to enhance textual reasoning. Subsequently, 3D incremental panoramic mapping with feature embedding is achieved by projecting images onto LiDAR point clouds. Finally, the environment is segmented based on lane graph connectivity to construct a hierarchical graph. Validation results from real public dataset SemanticKITTI demonstrate that, even without fine-tuning the models, OpenGraph exhibits the ability to generalize to novel semantic classes and achieve the highest segmentation and query accuracy.

However, capturing large-scale scenes still poses a challenge due to their complex geometric structures and unconstrained dynamics. Without the help of 3D motion cues, previous methods often require simplified setups with slow camera motion and only a few/single dynamic actors, leading to suboptimal solutions in most urban setups. To overcome such limitations, we present RoDUS, a pipeline for decomposing static and dynamic elements in urban scenes, with thoughtfully separated NeRF models for moving and non-moving components. Our approach utilizes a robust kernel-based initialization coupled with 4D semantic information to selectively guide the learning process. This strategy enables accurate capturing of the dynamics in the scene, resulting in reduced artifacts caused by NeRF on background reconstruction, all by using self-supervision. Notably, experimental evaluations on KITTI-360 and Pandaset datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in decomposing challenging urban scenes into precise static and dynamic components. ",

To overcome these issues, we propose a novel framework with Meta prompt and Instance Contrastive learning (MIC) schemes. Firstly, we simulate a novel-class-emerging scenario to help the prompt learner that learns class and background prompts generalize to novel classes. Secondly, we design an instance-level contrastive strategy to promote intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, which benefits generalization of the detector to novel class objects. Without using knowledge distillation, ensemble model or extra training data during detector training, our proposed MIC outperforms previous SOTA methods trained with these complex techniques on LVIS. Most importantly, MIC shows great generalization ability on novel classes, e.g., with $+4.3\\%$ and $+1.9\\% \\ \\mathrm{AP}$ improvement compared with previous SOTA on COCO and Objects365, respectively.

DL models have been found to be susceptible to adversarial attacks which can be achieved by introducing small, targeted perturbations to disrupt the input data. Adversarial training has been presented as a mitigation strategy which can result in more robust models. This adversarial robustness comes with additional computational costs required to design adversarial attacks during training. The two objectives -- adversarial robustness and computational efficiency -- then appear to be in conflict of each other. In this work, we explore the effects of two different model compression methods -- structured weight pruning and quantization -- on adversarial robustness. We specifically explore the effects of fine-tuning on compressed models, and present the trade-off between standard fine-tuning and adversarial fine-tuning. Our results show that compression does not inherently lead to loss in model robustness and adversarial fine-tuning of a compressed model can yield large improvement to the robustness performance of models. We present experiments on two benchmark datasets showing that adversarial fine-tuning of compressed models can achieve robustness performance comparable to adversarially trained models, while also improving computational efficiency.

We demonstrate that S2L could occur in various standard fine-tuning strategies for diffusion models, including concept-injection methods (DreamBooth and Textual Inversion) and parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and Hypernetwork), as well as their combinations. In the worst case, S2L can amplify the state-of-the-art membership inference attack (MIA) on diffusion models by $5.4\\%$ (absolute difference) AUC and can increase extracted private samples from almost $0$ samples to $16.3$ samples on average per target domain.

We are given as input a set of random samples $(\\mathbf{x}_i,y_i) \\in [-1,1]^n \\times \\mathbb{R}$ that are noisy versions of $(\\mathbf{x}_i,p(\\mathbf{x}_i))$. More precisely, each $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is sampled independently from some distribution $\\chi$ on $[-1,1]^n$, and for each $i$ independently, $y_i$ is arbitrary (i.e., an outlier) with probability at most $\\rho < 1/2$, and otherwise satisfies $|y_i-p(\\mathbf{x}_i)|\\leq\\sigma$. The goal is to output a polynomial $\\hat{p}$, of degree at most $d$ in each variable, within an $\\ell_\\infty$-distance of at most $O(\\sigma)$ from $p$. Kane, Karmalkar, and Price [FOCS'17] solved this problem for $n=1$. We generalize their results to the $n$-variate setting, showing an algorithm that achieves a sample complexity of $O_n(d^n\\log d)$, where the hidden constant depends on $n$, if $\\chi$ is the $n$-dimensional Chebyshev distribution. The sample complexity is $O_n(d^{2n}\\log d)$, if the samples are drawn from the uniform distribution instead.

We propose to use cost-effective low-resolution ranging sensors, such as ultrasonic and infrared time-of-flight sensors by developing VIRUS-NeRF - Vision, InfraRed, and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields. Building upon Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding (Instant-NGP), VIRUS-NeRF incorporates depth measurements from ultrasonic and infrared sensors and utilizes them to update the occupancy grid used for ray marching. Experimental evaluation in 2D demonstrates that VIRUS-NeRF achieves comparable mapping performance to LiDAR point clouds regarding coverage. Notably, in small environments, its accuracy aligns with that of LiDAR measurements, while in larger ones, it is bounded by the utilized ultrasonic sensors. An in-depth ablation study reveals that adding ultrasonic and infrared sensors is highly effective when dealing with sparse data and low view variation. Further, the proposed occupancy grid of VIRUS-NeRF improves the mapping capabilities and increases the training speed by 46% compared to Instant-NGP.

In this study, we investigate the effect of hue variance in the context of video recognition and find this variance to be beneficial since static appearances are less important in videos that contain motion information. Based on this observation, we propose a data augmentation method for video recognition, named Motion Coherent Augmentation (MCA), that introduces appearance variation in videos and implicitly encourages the model to prioritize motion patterns, rather than static appearances. Concretely, we propose an operation SwapMix to efficiently modify the appearance of video samples, and introduce Variation Alignment (VA) to resolve the distribution shift caused by SwapMix, enforcing the model to learn appearance invariant representations. Comprehensive empirical evaluation across various architectures and different datasets solidly validates the effectiveness and generalization ability of MCA, and the application of VA in other augmentation methods.

    "title": "Code Revert Prediction with Graph Neural Networks: A Case Study at J.P.  Morgan Chase",
    "abstract": "Code revert prediction, a specialized form of software defect detection, aims to forecast or predict the likelihood of code changes being reverted or rolled back in software development. This task is very important in practice because by identifying code changes that are more prone to being reverted, developers and project managers can proactively take measures to prevent issues, improve code quality, and optimize development processes. However, compared to code defect detection, code revert prediction has been rarely studied in previous research. Additionally, many previous methods for code defect detection relied on independent features but ignored relationships between code scripts. Moreover, new challenges are introduced due to constraints in an industry setting such as company regulation, limited features and large-scale codebase. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a systematic empirical study for code revert prediction that integrates the code import graph with code features. Different strategies to address anomalies and data imbalance have been implemented including graph neural networks with imbalance classification and anomaly detection. We conduct the experiments on real-world code commit data within J.P. Morgan Chase which is extremely imbalanced in order to make a comprehensive comparison of these different approaches for the code revert prediction problem. ",

    "abstract": "With the advent and widespread deployment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the imperative to ensure their safety has become increasingly pronounced. However, with the integration of additional modalities, MLLMs are exposed to new vulnerabilities, rendering them prone to structured-based jailbreak attacks, where semantic content (e.g., \"harmful text\") has been injected into the images to mislead MLLMs. In this work, we aim to defend against such threats. Specifically, we propose \\textbf{Ada}ptive \\textbf{Shield} Prompting (\\textbf{AdaShield}), which prepends inputs with defense prompts to defend MLLMs against structure-based jailbreak attacks without fine-tuning MLLMs or training additional modules (e.g., post-stage content detector). Initially, we present a manually designed static defense prompt, which thoroughly examines the image and instruction content step by step and specifies response methods to malicious queries. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive auto-refinement framework, consisting of a target MLLM and a LLM-based defense prompt generator (Defender). These components collaboratively and iteratively communicate to generate a defense prompt. Extensive experiments on the popular structure-based jailbreak attacks and benign datasets show that our methods can consistently improve MLLMs' robustness against structure-based jailbreak attacks without compromising the model's general capabilities evaluated on standard benign tasks.

In this work, we highlight that Hamiltonian prediction possesses a self-consistency principle, based on which we propose an exact training method that does not require labeled data. This merit addresses the data scarcity difficulty, and distinguishes the task from other property prediction formulations with unique benefits: (1) self-consistency training enables the model to be trained on a large amount of unlabeled data, hence substantially enhances generalization; (2) self-consistency training is more efficient than labeling data with DFT for supervised training, since it is an amortization of DFT calculation over a set of molecular structures. We empirically demonstrate the better generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios, and the better efficiency from the amortization. These benefits push forward the applicability of Hamiltonian prediction to an ever larger scale. ",

    "abstract": "The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has demonstrated its effectiveness and has become the standard approach for tailoring language models to various tasks. Currently, community-based platforms offer easy access to various pre-trained models, as anyone can publish without strict validation processes. However, a released pre-trained model can be a privacy trap for fine-tuning datasets if it is carefully designed. In this work, we propose PreCurious framework to reveal the new attack surface where the attacker releases the pre-trained model and gets a black-box access to the final fine-tuned model. PreCurious aims to escalate the general privacy risk of both membership inference and data extraction. The key intuition behind PreCurious is to manipulate the memorization stage of the pre-trained model and guide fine-tuning with a seemingly legitimate configuration. The effectiveness of defending against privacy attacks on a fine-tuned model seems promising, as empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that parameter-efficient and differentially private fine-tuning techniques are invulnerable to privacy attacks. But PreCurious demonstrates the possibility of breaking up invulnerability in a stealthy manner compared to fine-tuning on a benign model. By further leveraging a sanitized dataset, PreCurious can extract originally unexposed secrets under differentially private fine-tuning. Thus, PreCurious raises warnings for users who download pre-trained models from unknown sources, rely solely on tutorials or common-sense defenses, and previously release sanitized datasets even after perfect scrubbing.

However, most existing formulations of causal identification using techniques such as d-separation and do-calculus are expressed within the mathematical language of classical probability theory on CBNs. However, there are many causal settings where probability theory and hence current causal identification techniques are inapplicable such as relational databases, dataflow programs such as hardware description languages, distributed systems and most modern machine learning algorithms. We show that this restriction can be lifted by replacing the use of classical probability theory with the alternative axiomatic foundation of symmetric monoidal categories. In this alternative axiomatization, we show how an unambiguous and clean distinction can be drawn between the general syntax of causal models and any specific semantic implementation of that causal model. This allows a purely syntactic algorithmic description of general causal identification by a translation of recent formulations of the general ID algorithm through fixing. Our description is given entirely in terms of the non-parametric ADMG structure specifying a causal model and the algebraic signature of the corresponding monoidal category, to which a sequence of manipulations is then applied so as to arrive at a modified monoidal category in which the desired, purely syntactic interventional causal model, is obtained. We use this idea to derive purely syntactic analogues of classical back-door and front-door causal adjustment, and illustrate an application to a more complex causal model. ",

We developed DungeonMaker, a fabrication-augmented HBG bridging physical and digital game elements: 1) the setup narrates a story and projects a digital game board onto a laser cutter; 2) DungeonMaker assesses player-crafted artifacts; 3) DungeonMaker's modified laser head senses and moves player- and non-player figures, and 4) can physically damage figures. An evaluation (n=4x3) indicated that DungeonMaker provides an engaging experience, may support players' connection to their figures, and potentially spark novices' interest in fabrication.

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our ability to study individual cellular distinctions and uncover unique cell characteristics. However, a significant technical challenge in scRNA-seq analysis is the occurrence of \"dropout\" events, where certain gene expressions cannot be detected. This issue is particularly pronounced in genes with low or sparse expression levels, impacting the precision and interpretability of the obtained data. To address this challenge, various imputation methods have been implemented to predict such missing values, aiming to enhance the analysis's accuracy and usefulness. A prevailing hypothesis posits that scRNA-seq data conforms to a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution. Consequently, methods have been developed to model the data according to this distribution. Recent trends in scRNA-seq analysis have seen the emergence of deep learning approaches. Some techniques, such as the variational autoencoder, incorporate the ZINB distribution as a model loss function. Graph-based methods like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) have also gained attention as deep learning methodologies for scRNA-seq analysis. This study introduces scVGAE, an innovative approach integrating GCN into a variational autoencoder framework while utilizing a ZINB loss function. This integration presents a promising avenue for effectively addressing dropout events in scRNA-seq data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of downstream analyses. scVGAE outperforms other methods in cell clustering, with the best performance in 11 out of 14 datasets.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the fusion of high spatial resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) and low spatial resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) has been recognized as an effective method for HSI super-resolution (HSI-SR). However, both HSI and MSI may be acquired under extreme conditions such as night or poorly illuminating scenarios, which may cause different exposure levels, thereby seriously downgrading the yielded HSISR. In contrast to most existing methods based on respective low-light enhancements (LLIE) of MSI and HSI followed by their fusion, a deep Unfolding HSI Super-Resolution with Automatic Exposure Correction (UHSR-AEC) is proposed, that can effectively generate a high-quality fused HSI-SR (in texture and features) even under very imbalanced exposures, thanks to the correlation between LLIE and HSI-SR taken into account. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the state-of-the-art overall performance of the proposed UHSR-AEC, including comparison with some benchmark peer methods. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has attracted significant attention in areas such as cryptography, cybersecurity, and drug discovery. Due to the advantage of parallel processing, quantum computing can speed up the response to complex challenges and the processing of large-scale datasets. However, since quantum computing usually requires sensitive datasets, privacy breaches have become a vital concern. Differential privacy (DP) is a promising privacy-preserving method in classical computing and has been extended to the quantum domain in recent years. In this survey, we categorize the existing literature based on whether internal inherent noise or external artificial noise is used as a source to achieve DP in quantum computing. We explore how these approaches are applied at different stages of a quantum algorithm (i.e., state preparation, quantum circuit, and quantum measurement). We also discuss challenges and future directions for DP in quantum computing. By summarizing recent advancements, we hope to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date overview for researchers venturing into this field. ",

    "abstract": "Stain normalization algorithms aim to transform the color and intensity characteristics of a source multi-gigapixel histology image to match those of a target image, mitigating inconsistencies in the appearance of stains used to highlight cellular components in the images. We propose a new approach, StainFuser, which treats this problem as a style transfer task using a novel Conditional Latent Diffusion architecture, eliminating the need for handcrafted color components. With this method, we curate SPI-2M the largest stain normalization dataset to date of over 2 million histology images with neural style transfer for high-quality transformations. Trained on this data, StainFuser outperforms current state-of-the-art GAN and handcrafted methods in terms of the quality of normalized images. Additionally, compared to existing approaches, it improves the performance of nuclei instance segmentation and classification models when used as a test time augmentation method on the challenging CoNIC dataset. Finally, we apply StainFuser on multi-gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and demonstrate improved performance in terms of computational efficiency, image quality and consistency across tiles over current methods.

    "abstract": "Neural network is a powerful learning paradigm for data feature learning in the era of big data. However, most neural network models are deterministic models that ignore the uncertainty of data. Fuzzy neural networks are proposed to address this problem. FDNN is a hierarchical deep neural network that derives information from both fuzzy and neural representations, the representations are then fused to form representation to be classified. FDNN perform well on uncertain data classification tasks. In this paper, we proposed a novel hierarchical fused quantum fuzzy neural network (HQFNN). Different from classical FDNN, HQFNN uses quantum neural networks to learn fuzzy membership functions in fuzzy neural network. We conducted simulated experiment on two types of datasets (Dirty-MNIST and 15-Scene), the results show that the proposed model can outperform several existing methods. In addition, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed quantum circuit. ",

We denote by $G^{epex}$ the class of graphs that are at most one edge away from being in $\\mathcal{G}$. We note that $G^{epex}$ is hereditary and prove that if a hereditary class $\\mathcal{G}$ has finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs, then so does $G^{epex}$. The hereditary class of cographs consists of all graphs $G$ that can be generated from $K_1$ using complementation and disjoint union. Cographs are precisely the graphs that do not have the $4$-vertex path as an induced subgraph. For the class of edge-apex cographs our main result bounds the order of such forbidden induced subgraphs by 8 and finds all of them by computer search. ",

    "abstract": "In the context of visual perception, the optical signal from a scene is transferred into the electronic domain by detectors in the form of image data, which are then processed for the extraction of visual information. In noisy and weak-signal environments such as thermal imaging for night vision applications, however, the performance of neural computing tasks faces a significant bottleneck due to the inherent degradation of data quality upon noisy detection. Here, we propose a concept of optical signal processing before detection to address this issue. We demonstrate that spatially redistributing optical signals through a properly designed linear transformer can enhance the detection noise resilience of visual perception tasks, as benchmarked with the MNIST classification. Our idea is supported by a quantitative analysis detailing the relationship between signal concentration and noise robustness, as well as its practical implementation in an incoherent imaging system. This compute-first detection scheme can pave the way for advancing infrared machine vision technologies widely used for industrial and defense applications. ",
