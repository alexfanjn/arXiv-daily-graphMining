    "abstract": "The explosive growth of online education environments is generating a massive volume of data, specially in text format from forums, chats, social networks, assessments, essays, among others. It produces exciting challenges on how to mine text data in order to find useful knowledge for educational stakeholders. Despite the increasing number of educational applications of text mining published recently, we have not found any paper surveying them. In this line, this work presents a systematic overview of the current status of the Educational Text Mining field. Our final goal is to answer three main research questions: Which are the text mining techniques most used in educational environments? Which are the most used educational resources? And which are the main applications or educational goals? Finally, we outline the conclusions and the more interesting future trends. ",

    "abstract": "This survey paper presents a comprehensive analysis of crime prediction methodologies, exploring the various techniques and technologies utilized in this area. The paper covers the statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning techniques employed to analyze crime data, while also examining their effectiveness and limitations. We propose a methodological taxonomy that classifies crime prediction algorithms into specific techniques. This taxonomy is structured into four tiers, including methodology category, methodology sub-category, methodology techniques, and methodology sub-techniques. Empirical and experimental evaluations are provided to rank the different techniques. The empirical evaluation assesses the crime prediction techniques based on four criteria, while the experimental evaluation ranks the algorithms that employ the same sub-technique, the different sub-techniques that employ the same technique, the different techniques that employ the same methodology sub-category, the different methodology sub-categories within the same category, and the different methodology categories. The combination of methodological taxonomy, empirical evaluations, and experimental comparisons allows for a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of crime prediction algorithms, aiding researchers in making informed decisions. Finally, the paper provides a glimpse into the future of crime prediction techniques, highlighting potential advancements and opportunities for further research in this field ",

Intrigued by the claims of emergent planning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), works have been proposed to investigate the planning effectiveness of LLMs, without considering any utilization of off-the-shelf planning techniques in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to further study the insight of the planning capability of LLMs by investigating the roles of LLMs in off-the-shelf planning frameworks. To do this, we investigate the effectiveness of embedding LLMs into one of the well-known planning frameworks, graph-based planning, proposing a novel LLMs-based planning framework with LLMs embedded in two levels of planning graphs, i.e., mutual constraints generation level and constraints solving level. We empirically exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed framework in various planning domains. ",

    "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction holds paramount significance in online advertising and recommendation scenarios. Despite the proliferation of recent CTR prediction models, the improvements in performance have remained limited, as evidenced by open-source benchmark assessments. Current researchers tend to focus on developing new models for various datasets and settings, often neglecting a crucial question: What is the key challenge that truly makes CTR prediction so demanding? In this paper, we approach the problem of CTR prediction from an optimization perspective. We explore the typical data characteristics and optimization statistics of CTR prediction, revealing a strong positive correlation between the top hessian eigenvalue and feature frequency. This correlation implies that frequently occurring features tend to converge towards sharp local minima, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance. Motivated by the recent advancements in sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), which considers the geometric aspects of the loss landscape during optimization, we present a dedicated optimizer crafted for CTR prediction, named Helen. Helen incorporates frequency-wise Hessian eigenvalue regularization, achieved through adaptive perturbations based on normalized feature frequencies. Empirical results under the open-source benchmark framework underscore Helen's effectiveness. It successfully constrains the top eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix and demonstrates a clear advantage over widely used optimization algorithms when applied to seven popular models across three public benchmark datasets on BARS.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a significant public health concern and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Despite advances in breast cancer treatments, medication non-adherence remains a major problem. As electronic health records do not typically capture patient-reported outcomes that may reveal information about medication-related experiences, social media presents an attractive resource for enhancing our understanding of the patients' treatment experiences. In this paper, we developed natural language processing (NLP) based methodologies to study information posted by an automatically curated breast cancer cohort from social media. We employed a transformer-based classifier to identify breast cancer patients/survivors on X (Twitter) based on their self-reported information, and we collected longitudinal data from their profiles. We then designed a multi-layer rule-based model to develop a breast cancer therapy-associated side effect lexicon and detect patterns of medication usage and associated side effects among breast cancer patients. 1,454,637 posts were available from 583,962 unique users, of which 62,042 were detected as breast cancer members using our transformer-based model. 198 cohort members mentioned breast cancer medications with tamoxifen as the most common. Our side effect lexicon identified well-known side effects of hormone and chemotherapy. Furthermore, it discovered a subject feeling towards cancer and medications, which may suggest a pre-clinical phase of side effects or emotional distress. This analysis highlighted not only the utility of NLP techniques in unstructured social media data to identify self-reported breast cancer posts, medication usage patterns, and treatment side effects but also the richness of social data on such clinical questions.

In this paper, we study the regularization methods' effects on various classification models when only a few labeled data are available. We compare a simple word embedding-based model, which is simple but effective, with complex models (CNN and BiLSTM). In supervised learning, adversarial training can further regularize the model. When an unlabeled dataset is available, we can regularize the model using semi-supervised learning methods such as the Pi model and virtual adversarial training. We evaluate the regularization effects on four text classification datasets (AG news, DBpedia, Yahoo! Answers, Yelp Polarity), using only 0.1% to 0.5% of the original labeled training documents. The simple model performs relatively well in fully supervised learning, but with the help of adversarial training and semi-supervised learning, both simple and complex models can be regularized, showing better results for complex models. Although the simple model is robust to overfitting, a complex model with well-designed prior beliefs can be also robust to overfitting. ",

These models have the potential to generate scientific content that is indistinguishable from that written by humans. Hence, LLMs carry severe consequences for the scientific community, which relies on the integrity and reliability of publications. This research paper presents a novel ChatGPT-generated scientific text detection method, AI-Catcher. AI-Catcher integrates two deep learning models, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The MLP learns the feature representations of the linguistic and statistical features. The CNN extracts high-level representations of the sequential patterns from the textual content. AI-Catcher is a multimodal model that fuses hidden patterns derived from MLP and CNN. In addition, a new ChatGPT-Generated scientific text dataset is collected to enhance AI-generated text detection tools, AIGTxt. AIGTxt contains 3000 records collected from published academic articles across ten domains and divided into three classes: Human-written, ChatGPT-generated, and Mixed text. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of AI-Catcher. The comparative results demonstrate the capability of AI-Catcher to distinguish between human-written and ChatGPT-generated scientific text more accurately than alternative methods. On average, AI-Catcher improved accuracy by 37.4%. ",

    "abstract": "While achieving remarkable progress in a broad range of tasks, large language models (LLMs) remain significantly limited in properly using massive external tools. Existing in-context learning approaches simply format tools into a list of plain text descriptions and input them to LLMs, from which, LLMs generate a sequence of tool calls to solve problems step by step. Such a paradigm ignores the intrinsic dependency between tools and offloads all reasoning loads to LLMs, making them restricted to a limited number of specifically designed tools. It thus remains challenging for LLMs to operate on a library of massive tools, casting a great limitation when confronted with real-world scenarios. This paper proposes ToolNet, a plug-and-play framework that scales up the number of tools to thousands with a moderate increase in token consumption. ToolNet organizes tools into a directed graph. Each node represents a tool, and weighted edges denote tool transition. Starting from an initial tool node, an LLM navigates in the graph by iteratively choosing the next one from its successors until the task is resolved. Extensive experiments show that ToolNet can achieve impressive results in challenging multi-hop tool learning datasets and is resilient to tool failures. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the online learning problem of revenue maximization in ad auctions, where the seller needs to learn the click-through rates (CTRs) of each ad candidate and charge the price of the winner through a pay-per-click manner. We focus on two models of the advertisers' strategic behaviors. First, we assume that the advertiser is completely myopic; i.e.~in each round, they aim to maximize their utility only for the current round. In this setting, we develop an online mechanism based on upper-confidence bounds that achieves a tight $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret in the worst-case and negative regret when the values are static across all the auctions and there is a gap between the highest expected value (i.e.~value multiplied by their CTR) and second highest expected value ad. Next, we assume that the advertiser is non-myopic and cares about their long term utility. This setting is much more complex since an advertiser is incentivized to influence the mechanism by bidding strategically in earlier rounds. In this setting, we provide an algorithm to achieve negative regret for the static valuation setting (with a positive gap), which is in sharp contrast with the prior work that shows $O(T^{2/3})$ regret when the valuation is generated by adversary.

    "abstract": "Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) accelerators have proven successful in handling latency- and resource-critical deep neural network (DNN) inference tasks. Among the most computationally intensive operations in a neural network (NN) is the dot product between the feature and weight vectors. Thus, some previous FPGA acceleration works have proposed mapping neurons with quantized inputs and outputs directly to lookup tables (LUTs) for hardware implementation. In these works, the boundaries of the neurons coincide with the boundaries of the LUTs. We propose relaxing these boundaries and mapping entire sub-networks to a single LUT. As the sub-networks are absorbed within the LUT, the NN topology and precision within a partition do not affect the size of the lookup tables generated. Therefore, we utilize fully connected layers with floating-point precision inside each partition, which benefit from being universal function approximators, with rigid sparsity and quantization enforced only between partitions, where the NN topology becomes exposed to the circuit topology. Although cheap to implement, this approach can lead to very deep NNs, and so to tackle challenges like vanishing gradients, we also introduce skip connections inside the partitions. The resulting methodology can be seen as training DNNs with a specific sparsity pattern that allows them to be mapped to much shallower circuit-level networks, thereby significantly improving latency. We validate our proposed method on a known latency-critical task, jet substructure tagging, and on the classical computer vision task, the digit classification using MNIST. Our approach allows for greater function expressivity within the LUTs compared to existing work, leading to lower latency NNs for the same accuracy. ",

Step one is to design and implement algorithms for exact region enumeration in networks beyond toy examples. In this work, we present parallel algorithms for exact enumeration in deep (and shallow) neural networks. Our work has three main contributions: (1) we present a novel algorithm framework and parallel algorithms for region enumeration; (2) we implement one of our algorithms on a variety of network architectures and experimentally show how the number of regions dictates runtime; and (3) we show, using our algorithm's output, how the dimension of a region's affine transformation impacts further partitioning of the region by deeper layers.

To reduce harm and misuse, efforts have been made to align these LLMs to human values using advanced training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial jailbreak attempts aiming at subverting the embedded safety guardrails. To address this challenge, this paper defines and investigates the Refusal Loss of LLMs and then proposes a method called Gradient Cuff to detect jailbreak attempts. Gradient Cuff exploits the unique properties observed in the refusal loss landscape, including functional values and its smoothness, to design an effective two-step detection strategy. Experimental results on two aligned LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B-Chat and Vicuna-7B-V1.5) and six types of jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, TAP, Base64, and LRL) show that Gradient Cuff can significantly improve the LLM's rejection capability for malicious jailbreak queries, while maintaining the model's performance for benign user queries by adjusting the detection threshold.

    "abstract": "As medical demands grow and machine learning technology advances, AI-based diagnostic and treatment systems are garnering increasing attention. Medication recommendation aims to integrate patients' long-term health records with medical knowledge, recommending accuracy and safe medication combinations for specific conditions. However, most existing researches treat medication recommendation systems merely as variants of traditional recommendation systems, overlooking the heterogeneity between medications and diseases. To address this challenge, we propose DGMed, a framework for medication recommendation. DGMed utilizes causal inference to uncover the connections among medical entities and presents an innovative feature alignment method to tackle heterogeneity issues. Specifically, this study first applies causal inference to analyze the quantified therapeutic effects of medications on specific diseases from historical records, uncovering potential links between medical entities. Subsequently, we integrate molecular-level knowledge, aligning the embeddings of medications and diseases within the molecular space to effectively tackle their heterogeneity. Ultimately, based on relationships at the entity level, we adaptively adjust the recommendation probabilities of medication and recommend medication combinations according to the patient's current health condition. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art baselines in four evaluation metrics, demonstrating superior performance in both accuracy and safety aspects. Compared to the sub-optimal model, our approach improved accuracy by 4.40%, reduced the risk of side effects by 6.14%, and increased time efficiency by 47.15%. ",

    "abstract": "When predicting a target variable $Y$ from features $X$, the prediction $\\hat{Y}$ can be performative: an agent might act on this prediction, affecting the value of $Y$ that we eventually observe. Performative predictions are deliberately prevalent in algorithmic decision support, where a Decision Support System (DSS) provides a prediction for an agent to affect the value of the target variable. When deploying a DSS in high-stakes settings (e.g. healthcare, law, predictive policing, or child welfare screening) it is imperative to carefully assess the performative effects of the DSS. In the case that the DSS serves as an alarm for a predicted negative outcome, naive retraining of the prediction model is bound to result in a model that underestimates the risk, due to effective workings of the previous model. In this work, we propose to model the deployment of a DSS as causal domain shift and provide novel cross-domain identification results for the conditional expectation $E[Y | X]$, allowing for pre- and post-hoc assessment of the deployment of the DSS, and for retraining of a model that assesses the risk under a baseline policy where the DSS is not deployed. Using a running example, we empirically show that a repeated regression procedure provides a practical framework for estimating these quantities, even when the data is affected by sample selection bias and selective labelling, offering for a practical, unified solution for multiple forms of target variable bias.

Unfortunately, these methods face a non-negligible challenge: the absence of theoretical guarantees in the design of MDTC algorithms. The dearth of theoretical underpinning poses a substantial impediment to the advancement of MDTC algorithms. To tackle this problem, we first provide a theoretical analysis of MDTC by decomposing the MDTC task into multiple domain adaptation tasks. We incorporate the margin discrepancy as the measure of domain divergence and establish a new generalization bound based on Rademacher complexity. Subsequently, we propose a margin discrepancy-based adversarial training (MDAT) approach for MDTC, in accordance with our theoretical analysis. To validate the efficacy of the proposed MDAT method, we conduct empirical studies on two MDTC benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our MDAT approach surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on both datasets. ",

The proposed methodology involves creating image representations of features extracted from an existing dataset. A GAN model is then employed to generate a more extensive dataset consisting of realistic synthetic grayscale images. Subsequently, this synthetic dataset is utilized to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to identify previously unseen Android malware applications. The study includes a comparative analysis of the CNN's performance when trained on real images versus synthetic images generated by the GAN. Furthermore, the research explores variations in performance between the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). The investigation extends to studying the impact of image size and malware obfuscation on the classification model's effectiveness. The data augmentation approach implemented in this study resulted in a notable performance enhancement of the classification model, ranging from 1.5% to 7%, depending on the dataset. The achieved F1 score reached 97.5%. Keywords--Generative Adversarial Networks, Android Malware, Data Augmentation, Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network ",

    "abstract": "Information extraction (IE) aims to extract complex structured information from the text. Numerous datasets have been constructed for various IE tasks, leading to time-consuming and labor-intensive data annotations. Nevertheless, most prevailing methods focus on training task-specific models, while the common knowledge among different IE tasks is not explicitly modeled. Moreover, the same phrase may have inconsistent labels in different tasks, which poses a big challenge for knowledge transfer using a unified model. In this study, we propose a regularization-based transfer learning method for IE (TIE) via an instructed graph decoder. Specifically, we first construct an instruction pool for datasets from all well-known IE tasks, and then present an instructed graph decoder, which decodes various complex structures into a graph uniformly based on corresponding instructions. In this way, the common knowledge shared with existing datasets can be learned and transferred to a new dataset with new labels. Furthermore, to alleviate the label inconsistency problem among various IE tasks, we introduce a task-specific regularization strategy, which does not update the gradients of two tasks with 'opposite direction'. We conduct extensive experiments on 12 datasets spanning four IE tasks, and the results demonstrate the great advantages of our proposed method ",

    "abstract": "Efficiently solving unbalanced three-phase power flow in distribution grids is pivotal for grid analysis and simulation. There is a pressing need for scalable algorithms capable of handling large-scale unbalanced power grids that can provide accurate and fast solutions. To address this, deep learning techniques, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have emerged. However, existing literature primarily focuses on balanced networks, leaving a critical gap in supporting unbalanced three-phase power grids. This letter introduces PowerFlowMultiNet, a novel multigraph GNN framework explicitly designed for unbalanced three-phase power grids. The proposed approach models each phase separately in a multigraph representation, effectively capturing the inherent asymmetry in unbalanced grids. A graph embedding mechanism utilizing message passing is introduced to capture spatial dependencies within the power system network. PowerFlowMultiNet outperforms traditional methods and other deep learning approaches in terms of accuracy and computational speed. Rigorous testing reveals significantly lower error rates and a notable hundredfold increase in computational speed for large power networks compared to model-based methods. ",

    "abstract": "The problem of search relevance in the E-commerce domain is a challenging one since it involves understanding the intent of a user's short nuanced query and matching it with the appropriate products in the catalog. This problem has traditionally been addressed using language models (LMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture semantic and inter-product behavior signals, respectively. However, the rapid development of new architectures has created a gap between research and the practical adoption of these techniques. Evaluating the generalizability of these models for deployment requires extensive experimentation on complex, real-world datasets, which can be non-trivial and expensive. Furthermore, such models often operate on latent space representations that are incomprehensible to humans, making it difficult to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different models. This lack of interpretability hinders the development and adoption of new techniques in the field. To bridge this gap, we propose Plug and Play Graph LAnguage Model (PP-GLAM), an explainable ensemble of plug and play models. Our approach uses a modular framework with uniform data processing pipelines. It employs additive explanation metrics to independently decide whether to include (i) language model candidates, (ii) GNN model candidates, and (iii) inter-product behavioral signals. For the task of search relevance, we show that PP-GLAM outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines as well as a proprietary model on real-world multilingual, multi-regional e-commerce datasets. To promote better model comprehensibility and adoption, we also provide an analysis of the explainability and computational complexity of our model. We also provide the public codebase and provide a deployment strategy for practical implementation. ",

    "abstract": "Distributed deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a key technique to reduce communication overhead without sacrificing performance in edge computing systems. Recently, entropy coding has been introduced to further reduce the communication overhead. The key idea is to train the distributed DNN jointly with an entropy model, which is used as side information during inference time to adaptively encode latent representations into bit streams with variable length. To the best of our knowledge, the resilience of entropy models is yet to be investigated. As such, in this paper we formulate and investigate the resilience of entropy models to intentional interference (e.g., adversarial attacks) and unintentional interference (e.g., weather changes and motion blur). Through an extensive experimental campaign with 3 different DNN architectures, 2 entropy models and 4 rate-distortion trade-off factors, we demonstrate that the entropy attacks can increase the communication overhead by up to 95%. By separating compression features in frequency and spatial domain, we propose a new defense mechanism that can reduce the transmission overhead of the attacked input by about 9% compared to unperturbed data, with only about 2% accuracy loss. Importantly, the proposed defense mechanism is a standalone approach which can be applied in conjunction with approaches such as adversarial training to further improve robustness.

We have conducted various tests to evaluate the performance of AutoRD and highlighted its strengths and limitations in this paper. Materials and Methods: Our system, AutoRD, is a software pipeline involving data preprocessing, entity extraction, relation extraction, entity calibration, and knowledge graph construction. We implement this using large language models and medical knowledge graphs developed from open-source medical ontologies. We quantitatively evaluate our system on entity extraction, relation extraction, and the performance of knowledge graph construction. Results: AutoRD achieves an overall F1 score of 47.3%, a 14.4% improvement compared to the base LLM. In detail, AutoRD achieves an overall entity extraction F1 score of 56.1% (rare_disease: 83.5%, disease: 35.8%, symptom_and_sign: 46.1%, anaphor: 67.5%) and an overall relation extraction F1 score of 38.6% (produces: 34.7%, increases_risk_of: 12.4%, is_a: 37.4%, is_acronym: 44.1%, is_synonym: 16.3%, anaphora: 57.5%). Our qualitative experiment also demonstrates that the performance in constructing the knowledge graph is commendable. Discussion: AutoRD demonstrates the potential of LLM applications in rare disease detection. This improvement is attributed to several design, including the integration of ontologies-enhanced LLMs. Conclusion: AutoRD is an automated end-to-end system for extracting rare disease information from text to build knowledge graphs. It uses ontologies-enhanced LLMs for a robust medical knowledge base. The superior performance of AutoRD is validated by experimental evaluations, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in healthcare.

As existing neural field methods try to predict some coordinate-based continuous target values, such as RGB for Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), all of these methods are regression models and are optimized by some regression loss. However, are regression models really better than classification models for neural field methods? In this work, we try to visit this very fundamental but overlooked question for neural fields from a machine learning perspective. We successfully propose a novel Neural Field Classifier (NFC) framework which formulates existing neural field methods as classification tasks rather than regression tasks. The proposed NFC can easily transform arbitrary Neural Field Regressor (NFR) into its classification variant via employing a novel Target Encoding module and optimizing a classification loss. By encoding a continuous regression target into a high-dimensional discrete encoding, we naturally formulate a multi-label classification task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness of NFC at the nearly free extra computational costs. Moreover, NFC also shows robustness to sparse inputs, corrupted images, and dynamic scenes. ",

    "abstract": "Graph generation generally aims to create new graphs that closely align with a specific graph distribution. Existing works often implicitly capture this distribution through the optimization of generators, potentially overlooking the intricacies of the distribution itself. Furthermore, these approaches generally neglect the insights offered by the learned distribution for graph generation. In contrast, in this work, we propose a novel self-conditioned graph generation framework designed to explicitly model graph distributions and employ these distributions to guide the generation process. We first perform self-conditioned modeling to capture the graph distributions by transforming each graph sample into a low-dimensional representation and optimizing a representation generator to create new representations reflective of the learned distribution. Subsequently, we leverage these bootstrapped representations as self-conditioned guidance for the generation process, thereby facilitating the generation of graphs that more accurately reflect the learned distributions. We conduct extensive experiments on generic and molecular graph datasets across various fields. Our framework demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art graph generation methods in terms of graph quality and fidelity to training data. ",

Identifying which parts of the data a given network is misclassifying has become as valuable as the network's overall performance. We can compress the model with quantization, but it suffers minor performance loss. The loss of performance further necessitates the need to derive the confidence estimate of the network's predictions. In line with this thinking, we introduce an Uncertainty Quantification(UQ) technique to quantify the uncertainty in the predictions from a pre-trained vision model. We subsequently leverage this information to extract valuable predictions while ignoring the non-confident predictions. We observe that our technique saves up to 80% of ignored samples from being misclassified. The code for the same is available here. ",

Potentially more useful is the prospect of inputting desired performance characteristics into a design model to extract appropriate manufacturing parameters. In this study, we demonstrate that deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with sparse datasets augmented by synthetic data can produce accurate predictive and design models. For our predictive model with known sheath and core flow rates and bath solution percentage, calculated solid microfiber dimensions are shown to be greater than 95% accurate, with porosity and Young's modulus exhibiting greater than 90% accuracy for a majority of conditions. Likewise, the design model is able to recover sheath and core flow rates with 95% accuracy when provided values for microfiber dimensions, porosity, and Young's modulus. As a result, DNN-based modeling of the microfiber fabrication process demonstrates high potential for reducing time to manufacture of microstructures with desired characteristics. ",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates traffic forecasting, which attempts to forecast the future state of traffic based on historical situations. This problem has received ever-increasing attention in various scenarios and facilitated the development of numerous downstream applications such as urban planning and transportation management. However, the efficacy of existing methods remains sub-optimal due to their tendency to model temporal and spatial relationships independently, thereby inadequately accounting for complex high-order interactions of both worlds. Moreover, the diversity of transitional patterns in traffic forecasting makes them challenging to capture for existing approaches, warranting a deeper exploration of their diversity. Toward this end, this paper proposes Conjoint Spatio-Temporal graph neural network (abbreviated as COOL), which models heterogeneous graphs from prior and posterior information to conjointly capture high-order spatio-temporal relationships. On the one hand, heterogeneous graphs connecting sequential observation are constructed to extract composite spatio-temporal relationships via prior message passing. On the other hand, we model dynamic relationships using constructed affinity and penalty graphs, which guide posterior message passing to incorporate complementary semantic information into node representations. Moreover, to capture diverse transitional properties to enhance traffic forecasting, we propose a conjoint self-attention decoder that models diverse temporal patterns from both multi-rank and multi-scale views. Experimental results on four popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed COOL provides state-of-the-art performance compared with the competitive baselines. ",

We propose a novel, theoretically principled method, Pairwise Alignment (Pair-Align) to counter graph structure shift by mitigating conditional structure shift (CSS) and label shift (LS). Pair-Align uses edge weights to recalibrate the influence among neighboring nodes to handle CSS and adjusts the classification loss with label weights to handle LS. Our method demonstrates superior performance in real-world applications, including node classification with region shift in social networks, and the pileup mitigation task in particle colliding experiments. For the first application, we also curate the largest dataset by far for GDA studies. Our method shows strong performance in synthetic and other existing benchmark datasets. ",

Although significant research progress has been made, most existing methods ignore the effect that downstream tasks play in promoting upstream dehazing. From the perspective of the haze generation mechanism, there is a potential relationship between the depth information of the scene and the hazy image. Based on this, we propose a dual-task collaborative mutual promotion framework to achieve the dehazing of a single image. This framework integrates depth estimation and dehazing by a dual-task interaction mechanism and achieves mutual enhancement of their performance. To realize the joint optimization of the two tasks, an alternative implementation mechanism with the difference perception is developed. On the one hand, the difference perception between the depth maps of the dehazing result and the ideal image is proposed to promote the dehazing network to pay attention to the non-ideal areas of the dehazing. On the other hand, by improving the depth estimation performance in the difficult-to-recover areas of the hazy image, the dehazing network can explicitly use the depth information of the hazy image to assist the clear image recovery. To promote the depth estimation, we propose to use the difference between the dehazed image and the ground truth to guide the depth estimation network to focus on the dehazed unideal areas. It allows dehazing and depth estimation to leverage their strengths in a mutually reinforcing manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than that of the state-of-the-art approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the advantages of fusing information from various modalities, multimodal learning is gaining increasing attention. Being a fundamental task of multimodal learning, Visual Grounding (VG), aims to locate objects in images through natural language expressions. Ensuring the quality of VG models presents significant challenges due to the complex nature of the task. In the black box scenario, existing adversarial testing techniques often fail to fully exploit the potential of both modalities of information. They typically apply perturbations based solely on either the image or text information, disregarding the crucial correlation between the two modalities, which would lead to failures in test oracles or an inability to effectively challenge VG models. To this end, we propose PEELING, a text perturbation approach via image-aware property reduction for adversarial testing of the VG model. The core idea is to reduce the property-related information in the original expression meanwhile ensuring the reduced expression can still uniquely describe the original object in the image. To achieve this, PEELING first conducts the object and properties extraction and recombination to generate candidate property reduction expressions. It then selects the satisfied expressions that accurately describe the original object while ensuring no other objects in the image fulfill the expression, through querying the image with a visual understanding technique. We evaluate PEELING on the state-of-the-art VG model, i.e. OFA-VG, involving three commonly used datasets. Results show that the adversarial tests generated by PEELING achieves 21.4% in MultiModal Impact score (MMI), and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for images and texts by 8.2%--15.1%. ",

Firstly, we propose a unified graph tokenizer to adapt our graph model to generalize well on unseen graph data, even when the underlying graph properties differ significantly from those encountered during training. Secondly, we develop a scalable graph transformer as the foundational encoder, which effectively captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Thirdly, we introduce a data augmentation mechanism enhanced by a LLM to alleviate the limitations of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework.

However, existing methods often struggle to effectively utilize spatial information or, if they do, they come at the cost of reducing channel dimensions or increasing the complexity of neural networks. In order to address these limitations, this paper introduces an Efficient Local Attention (ELA) method that achieves substantial performance improvements with a simple structure. By analyzing the limitations of the Coordinate Attention method, we identify the lack of generalization ability in Batch Normalization, the adverse effects of dimension reduction on channel attention, and the complexity of attention generation process. To overcome these challenges, we propose the incorporation of 1D convolution and Group Normalization feature enhancement techniques. This approach enables accurate localization of regions of interest by efficiently encoding two 1D positional feature maps without the need for dimension reduction, while allowing for a lightweight implementation. We carefully design three hyperparameters in ELA, resulting in four different versions: ELA-T, ELA-B, ELA-S, and ELA-L, to cater to the specific requirements of different visual tasks such as image classification, object detection and sementic segmentation. ELA can be seamlessly integrated into deep CNN networks such as ResNet, MobileNet, and DeepLab. Extensive evaluations on the ImageNet, MSCOCO, and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ELA module over current state-of-the-art methods in all three aforementioned visual tasks.

Attackers can exploit such leakages and other available knowledge related to the user's database to recover queries. We find that the effectiveness of query recovery attacks depends on the volume/frequency distribution of keywords. Queries containing keywords with high volumes/frequencies are more susceptible to recovery, even when countermeasures are implemented. Attackers can also effectively leverage these ``special'' queries to recover all others. By exploiting the above finding, we propose a Jigsaw attack that begins by accurately identifying and recovering those distinctive queries. Leveraging the volume, frequency, and co-occurrence information, our attack achieves $90\\%$ accuracy in three tested datasets, which is comparable to previous attacks (Oya et al., USENIX' 22 and Damie et al., USENIX' 21). With the same runtime, our attack demonstrates an advantage over the attack proposed by Oya et al (approximately $15\\%$ more accuracy when the keyword universe size is 15k). Furthermore, our proposed attack outperforms existing attacks against widely studied countermeasures, achieving roughly $60\\%$ and $85\\%$ accuracy against the padding and the obfuscation, respectively.

However, most of the present debiasing methods focus on single-variable causal inference, which is not suitable for ABSA with two input variables (the target aspect and the review). In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on multi-variable causal inference for debiasing ABSA. In this framework, different types of biases are tackled based on different causal intervention methods. For the review branch, the bias is modeled as indirect confounding from context, where backdoor adjustment intervention is employed for debiasing. For the aspect branch, the bias is described as a direct correlation with labels, where counterfactual reasoning is adopted for debiasing.

    "title": "Learn Suspected Anomalies from Event Prompts for Video Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Most models for weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) rely on multiple instance learning, aiming to distinguish normal and abnormal snippets without specifying the type of anomaly. The ambiguous nature of anomaly definitions across contexts introduces bias in detecting abnormal and normal snippets within the abnormal bag. Taking the first step to show the model why it is anomalous, a novel framework is proposed to guide the learning of suspected anomalies from event prompts. Given a textual prompt dictionary of potential anomaly events and the captions generated from anomaly videos, the semantic anomaly similarity between them could be calculated to identify the suspected anomalous events for each video snippet. It enables a new multi-prompt learning process to constrain the visual-semantic features across all videos, as well as provides a new way to label pseudo anomalies for self-training. To demonstrate effectiveness, comprehensive experiments and detailed ablation studies are conducted on four datasets, namely XD-Violence, UCF-Crime, TAD, and ShanghaiTech. Our proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in terms of AP or AUC (82.6\\%, 87.7\\%, 93.1\\%, and 97.4\\%). Furthermore, it shows promising performance in open-set and cross-dataset cases. ",

    "abstract": "Reliable detection of various objects and road users in the surrounding environment is crucial for the safe operation of automated driving systems (ADS). Despite recent progresses in developing highly accurate object detectors based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), they still remain prone to detection errors, which can lead to fatal consequences in safety-critical applications such as ADS. An effective remedy to this problem is to equip the system with run-time monitoring, named as introspection in the context of autonomous systems. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel introspection solution, which operates at the frame level for DNN-based 2D object detection and leverages neural network activation patterns. The proposed approach pre-processes the neural activation patterns of the object detector's backbone using several different modes. To provide extensive comparative analysis and fair comparison, we also adapt and implement several state-of-the-art (SOTA) introspection mechanisms for error detection in 2D object detection, using one-stage and two-stage object detectors evaluated on KITTI and BDD datasets. We compare the performance of the proposed solution in terms of error detection, adaptability to dataset shift, and, computational and memory resource requirements. Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed introspection solution outperforms SOTA methods, achieving an absolute reduction in the missed error ratio of 9% to 17% in the BDD dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Crime in the 21st century is split into a virtual and real world. However, the former has become a global menace to people's well-being and security in the latter. The challenges it presents must be faced with unified global cooperation, and we must rely more than ever on automated yet trustworthy tools to combat the ever-growing nature of online offenses. Over 10 million child sexual abuse reports are submitted to the US National Center for Missing & Exploited Children every year, and over 80% originated from online sources. Therefore, investigation centers and clearinghouses cannot manually process and correctly investigate all imagery. In light of that, reliable automated tools that can securely and efficiently deal with this data are paramount. In this sense, the scene recognition task looks for contextual cues in the environment, being able to group and classify child sexual abuse data without requiring to be trained on sensitive material. The scarcity and limitations of working with child sexual abuse images lead to self-supervised learning, a machine-learning methodology that leverages unlabeled data to produce powerful representations that can be more easily transferred to target tasks. This work shows that self-supervised deep learning models pre-trained on scene-centric data can reach 71.6% balanced accuracy on our indoor scene classification task and, on average, 2.2 percentage points better performance than a fully supervised version. We cooperate with Brazilian Federal Police experts to evaluate our indoor classification model on actual child abuse material. The results demonstrate a notable discrepancy between the features observed in widely used scene datasets and those depicted on sensitive materials. ",

Current adversarial example generation methods for SAR imagery primarily operate in the 2D digital domain, known as image adversarial examples. Recent work, while considering SAR imaging scatter mechanisms, fails to account for the actual imaging process, rendering attacks in the three-dimensional physical domain infeasible, termed pseudo physics adversarial examples. To address these challenges, this paper proposes SAR-AE-SFP-Attack, a method to generate real physics adversarial examples by altering the scattering feature parameters of target objects. Specifically, we iteratively optimize the coherent energy accumulation of the target echo by perturbing the reflection coefficient and scattering coefficient in the scattering feature parameters of the three-dimensional target object, and obtain the adversarial example after echo signal processing and imaging processing in the RaySAR simulator. Experimental results show that compared to digital adversarial attack methods, SAR-AE-SFP Attack significantly improves attack efficiency on CNN-based models (over 30\\%) and Transformer-based models (over 13\\%), demonstrating significant transferability of attack effects across different models and perspectives.

The importance of number-theoretic transform (NTT) extends beyond post-quantum cryptosystems, proving valuable in enhancing existing security protocols such as digital signature schemes and hash functions. Due to the potential for errors to significantly disrupt the operation of secure, cryptographically-protected systems, compromising data integrity, and safeguarding against side-channel attacks initiated through faults it is essential to incorporate mitigating error detection schemes. This paper introduces algorithm level fault detection schemes in NTT multiplication, representing a significant enhancement compared to previous research. We evaluate this through the simulation of a fault model, ensuring that the conducted assessments accurately mirror the obtained results. Consequently, we attain a notably comprehensive coverage of errors. Finally, we assess the performance of our efficient error detection scheme on FPGAs to showcase its implementation and resource requirements. Through implementation of our error detection approach on Xilinx/AMD Zynq Ultrascale+ and Artix-7, we achieve a comparable throughput with just a 9% increase in area and 13% increase in latency compared to the original hardware implementations.

    "abstract": "This study aims to address the pervasive challenge of quantifying uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) without logit-access. Conformal Prediction (CP), known for its model-agnostic and distribution-free features, is a desired approach for various LLMs and data distributions. However, existing CP methods for LLMs typically assume access to the logits, which are unavailable for some API-only LLMs. In addition, logits are known to be miscalibrated, potentially leading to degraded CP performance. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel CP method that (1) is tailored for API-only LLMs without logit-access; (2) minimizes the size of prediction sets; and (3) ensures a statistical guarantee of the user-defined coverage. The core idea of this approach is to formulate nonconformity measures using both coarse-grained (i.e., sample frequency) and fine-grained uncertainty notions (e.g., semantic similarity). Experimental results on both close-ended and open-ended Question Answering tasks show our approach can mostly outperform the logit-based CP baselines. ",

    "abstract": "The high cost of model training makes it increasingly desirable to develop techniques for unlearning. These techniques seek to remove the influence of a training example without having to retrain the model from scratch. Intuitively, once a model has unlearned, an adversary that interacts with the model should no longer be able to tell whether the unlearned example was included in the model's training set or not. In the privacy literature, this is known as membership inference. In this work, we discuss adaptations of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) to the setting of unlearning (leading to their ``U-MIA'' counterparts). We propose a categorization of existing U-MIAs into ``population U-MIAs'', where the same attacker is instantiated for all examples, and ``per-example U-MIAs'', where a dedicated attacker is instantiated for each example. We show that the latter category, wherein the attacker tailors its membership prediction to each example under attack, is significantly stronger. Indeed, our results show that the commonly used U-MIAs in the unlearning literature overestimate the privacy protection afforded by existing unlearning techniques on both vision and language models. Our investigation reveals a large variance in the vulnerability of different examples to per-example U-MIAs. In fact, several unlearning algorithms lead to a reduced vulnerability for some, but not all, examples that we wish to unlearn, at the expense of increasing it for other examples. Notably, we find that the privacy protection for the remaining training examples may worsen as a consequence of unlearning. We also discuss the fundamental difficulty of equally protecting all examples using existing unlearning schemes, due to the different rates at which examples are unlearned. We demonstrate that naive attempts at tailoring unlearning stopping criteria to different examples fail to alleviate these issues. ",

However, typical GT models have at least quadratic complexity and thus cannot scale to large graphs. While there are several linear GTs recently proposed, they still lag behind GNN counterparts on several popular graph datasets, which poses a critical concern on their practical expressivity. To balance the trade-off between expressivity and scalability of GTs, we propose Polynormer, a polynomial-expressive GT model with linear complexity. Polynormer is built upon a novel base model that learns a high-degree polynomial on input features. To enable the base model permutation equivariant, we integrate it with graph topology and node features separately, resulting in local and global equivariant attention models. Consequently, Polynormer adopts a linear local-to-global attention scheme to learn high-degree equivariant polynomials whose coefficients are controlled by attention scores. Polynormer has been evaluated on $13$ homophilic and heterophilic datasets, including large graphs with millions of nodes. Our extensive experiment results show that Polynormer outperforms state-of-the-art GNN and GT baselines on most datasets, even without the use of nonlinear activation functions. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning techniques have demonstrated great potential for accurately estimating brain age by analyzing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from healthy individuals. However, current methods for brain age estimation often directly utilize whole input images, overlooking two important considerations: 1) the heterogeneous nature of brain aging, where different brain regions may degenerate at different rates, and 2) the existence of age-independent redundancies in brain structure. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Dual Graph Attention based Disentanglement Multi-instance Learning (DGA-DMIL) framework for improving brain age estimation. Specifically, the 3D MRI data, treated as a bag of instances, is fed into a 2D convolutional neural network backbone, to capture the unique aging patterns in MRI. A dual graph attention aggregator is then proposed to learn the backbone features by exploiting the intra- and inter-instance relationships. Furthermore, a disentanglement branch is introduced to separate age-related features from age-independent structural representations to ameliorate the interference of redundant information on age prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we evaluate it on two datasets, UK Biobank and ADNI, containing a total of 35,388 healthy individuals. Our proposed model demonstrates exceptional accuracy in estimating brain age, achieving a remarkable mean absolute error of 2.12 years in the UK Biobank. The results establish our approach as state-of-the-art compared to other competing brain age estimation models. In addition, the instance contribution scores identify the varied importance of brain areas for aging prediction, which provides deeper insights into the understanding of brain aging. ",

Our evaluation demonstrates that SceneCraft surpasses existing LLM-based agents in rendering complex scenes, as shown by its adherence to constraints and favorable human assessments. We also showcase the broader application potential of SceneCraft by reconstructing detailed 3D scenes from the Sintel movie and guiding a video generative model with generated scenes as intermediary control signal.

Existing mobile energy storage resource (MESR)-based power distribution network (PDN) restoration schemes often neglect the interdependencies among PTIN, thus, efficient PDN restoration cannot be achieved. This paper outlines the interacting factors of power supply demand, traffic operation efficiency, communication coverage, electric vehicle (EV) deployment capability, and PDN controllability among PTIN and further develops a PTIN-interacting model to reflect the chained recovery effect of the MESR-based restoration process. On this basis, a two-stage PDN restoration scheme is proposed that utilizes three emergency resources, including EVs, mobile energy storage systems (MESSs), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to restore the power supply and communication of PDNs. This scheme first improves the distribution automation function, EV deployment capability, and traffic operation efficiency by prioritizing the recovery of communication network (CN) and urban traffic network (UTN) loads. Then, EVs and MESSs are further scheduled to achieve a better PDN restoration effect with the support of the restored CNs and UTNs. Case studies on a PDN, CN, and UTN integrated test system are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The results show that the prioritized load recovery operation for CN and UTN facilities in this scheme greatly improves the PDN restoration effect. ",

These trends make the operations of PDSs highly dependent on the support of advanced communication networks, which face two related challenges. The first is to provide sufficient flexibility, resilience, and security to meet varying demands and ensure the proper operation of gradually diversifying network services. The second is to realize the automatic identification of terminal devices, thus reducing the network maintenance burden. To solve these problems, this paper presents a novel multiservice network integration and device authentication slice-based network slicing scheme. In this scheme, the integration of PDS communication networks enables network resource sharing, and recovery from communication interruption is achieved through network slicing in the integrated network. Authentication servers periodically poll terminal devices, adjusting network slice ranges based on authentication results, thereby facilitating dynamic network slicing. Additionally, secure plug-and-play support for PDS terminal devices and network protection are achieved through device identification and dynamic adjustment of network slices. On this basis, a network optimization and upgrading methodology for load balancing and robustness enhancement is further proposed. This approach is designed to improve the performance of PDS communication networks, adapting to ongoing PDS development and the evolution of PDS services. The simulation results show that the proposed schemes endow a PDS communication network with favorable resource utilization, fault recovery, terminal device plug-and-play support, load balancing, and improved network robustness.

Our experiments on a system with two 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors show that GSL-LPA not only mitigates this issue but also surpasses FLPA, igraph LPA, and NetworKit LPA by 55x, 10,300x, and 5.8x, respectively, achieving a processing rate of 844 M edges/s on a 3.8 B edge graph. Additionally, GSL-LPA scales at a rate of 1.6x for every doubling of threads. ",

    "abstract": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) has exhibited remarkable capabilities in optimizing objectives and meeting constraints. However, the substantial computational burden associated with solving the Optimal Control Problem (OCP) at each triggering instant introduces significant delays between state sampling and control application. These delays limit the practicality of MPC in resource-constrained systems when engaging in complex tasks. The intuition to address this issue in this paper is that by predicting the successor state, the controller can solve the OCP one time step ahead of time thus avoiding the delay of the next action. To this end, we compute deviations between real and nominal system states, predicting forthcoming real states as initial conditions for the imminent OCP solution. Anticipatory computation stores optimal control based on current nominal states, thus mitigating the delay effects. Additionally, we establish an upper bound for linearization error, effectively linearizing the nonlinear system, reducing OCP complexity, and enhancing response speed. We provide empirical validation through two numerical simulations and corresponding real-world robot tasks, demonstrating significant performance improvements and augmented response speed (up to $90\\%$) resulting from the seamless integration of our proposed approach compared to conventional time-triggered MPC strategies.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) trains a black-box and high-dimensional model among different clients by exchanging parameters instead of direct data sharing, which mitigates the privacy leak incurred by machine learning. However, FL still suffers from membership inference attacks (MIA) or data reconstruction attacks (DRA). In particular, an attacker can extract the information from local datasets by constructing DRA, which cannot be effectively throttled by existing techniques, e.g., Differential Privacy (DP). In this paper, we aim to ensure a strong privacy guarantee for FL under DRA. We prove that reconstruction errors under DRA are constrained by the information acquired by an attacker, which means that constraining the transmitted information can effectively throttle DRA. To quantify the information leakage incurred by FL, we establish a channel model, which depends on the upper bound of joint mutual information between the local dataset and multiple transmitted parameters. Moreover, the channel model indicates that the transmitted information can be constrained through data space operation, which can improve training efficiency and the model accuracy under constrained information. According to the channel model, we propose algorithms to constrain the information transmitted in a single round of local training. With a limited number of training rounds, the algorithms ensure that the total amount of transmitted information is limited. Furthermore, our channel model can be applied to various privacy-enhancing techniques (such as DP) to enhance privacy guarantees against DRA. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods. ",

    "abstract": "In today's digital world, social media plays a significant role in facilitating communication and content sharing. However, the exponential rise in user-generated content has led to challenges in maintaining a respectful online environment. In some cases, users have taken advantage of anonymity in order to use harmful language, which can negatively affect the user experience and pose serious social problems. Recognizing the limitations of manual moderation, automatic detection systems have been developed to tackle this problem. Nevertheless, several obstacles persist, including the absence of a universal definition for harmful language, inadequate datasets across languages, the need for detailed annotation guideline, and most importantly, a comprehensive framework. This study aims to address these challenges by introducing, for the first time, a detailed framework adaptable to any language. This framework encompasses various aspects of harmful language detection. A key component of the framework is the development of a general and detailed annotation guideline. Additionally, the integration of sentiment analysis represents a novel approach to enhancing harmful language detection. Also, a definition of harmful language based on the review of different related concepts is presented. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, its implementation in a challenging low-resource language is conducted. We collected a Persian dataset and applied the annotation guideline for harmful detection and sentiment analysis. Next, we present baseline experiments utilizing machine and deep learning methods to set benchmarks. Results prove the framework's high performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.4% in offensive language detection and 66.2% in sentiment analysis. ",

    "abstract": "RGBT multispectral pedestrian detection has emerged as a promising solution for safety-critical applications that require day/night operations. However, the modality bias problem remains unsolved as multispectral pedestrian detectors learn the statistical bias in datasets. Specifically, datasets in multispectral pedestrian detection mainly distribute between ROTO (day) and RXTO (night) data; the majority of the pedestrian labels statistically co-occur with their thermal features. As a result, multispectral pedestrian detectors show poor generalization ability on examples beyond this statistical correlation, such as ROTX data. To address this problem, we propose a novel Causal Mode Multiplexer (CMM) framework that effectively learns the causalities between multispectral inputs and predictions. Moreover, we construct a new dataset (ROTX-MP) to evaluate modality bias in multispectral pedestrian detection. ROTX-MP mainly includes ROTX examples not presented in previous datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CMM framework generalizes well on existing datasets (KAIST, CVC-14, FLIR) and the new ROTX-MP.

They validate and check this data against traffic patterns and historical indicators of compromise. Based on the results of this analysis, a decision is made to either automatically manage the traffic or report it to an analyst for further investigation. Unfortunately, due rapidly increasing traffic volumes, there are far more events to check than operational teams can handle for effective forensic analysis. However, just as packets are grouped into flows that share a commonality, we argue that a high-level construct for grouping network flows into a set a flows that share a hypothesis is needed to significantly improve the quality of operational network response by increasing Events Per Analysts Hour (EPAH). In this paper, we propose a formalism for describing a superflow construct, which we characterize as an aggregation of one or more flows based on an analyst-specific hypothesis about traffic behavior. We demonstrate simple superflow constructions and representations, and perform a case study to explain how the formalism can be used to reduce the volume of data for forensic analysis. ",

    "abstract": "While graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity for learning circuit representations in various electronic design automation (EDA) tasks, they face challenges in scalability when applied to large graphs and exhibit limited generalizability to new designs. These limitations make them less practical for addressing large-scale, complex circuit problems. In this work we propose HOGA, a novel attention-based model for learning circuit representations in a scalable and generalizable manner. HOGA first computes hop-wise features per node prior to model training. Subsequently, the hop-wise features are solely used to produce node representations through a gated self-attention module, which adaptively learns important features among different hops without involving the graph topology. As a result, HOGA is adaptive to various structures across different circuits and can be efficiently trained in a distributed manner. To demonstrate the efficacy of HOGA, we consider two representative EDA tasks: quality of results (QoR) prediction and functional reasoning. Our experimental results indicate that (1) HOGA reduces estimation error over conventional GNNs by 46.76% for predicting QoR after logic synthesis; (2) HOGA improves 10.0% reasoning accuracy over GNNs for identifying functional blocks on unseen gate-level netlists after complex technology mapping; (3) The training time for HOGA almost linearly decreases with an increase in computing resources.

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have garnered remarkable success in novel view synthesis. Nonetheless, the task of generating high-quality images for novel views persists as a critical challenge. While the existing efforts have exhibited commendable progress, capturing intricate details, enhancing textures, and achieving superior Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics warrant further focused attention and advancement. In this work, we propose NeRF-VPT, an innovative method for novel view synthesis to address these challenges. Our proposed NeRF-VPT employs a cascading view prompt tuning paradigm, wherein RGB information gained from preceding rendering outcomes serves as instructive visual prompts for subsequent rendering stages, with the aspiration that the prior knowledge embedded in the prompts can facilitate the gradual enhancement of rendered image quality. NeRF-VPT only requires sampling RGB data from previous stage renderings as priors at each training stage, without relying on extra guidance or complex techniques. Thus, our NeRF-VPT is plug-and-play and can be readily integrated into existing methods. By conducting comparative analyses of our NeRF-VPT against several NeRF-based approaches on demanding real-scene benchmarks, such as Realistic Synthetic 360, Real Forward-Facing, Replica dataset, and a user-captured dataset, we substantiate that our NeRF-VPT significantly elevates baseline performance and proficiently generates more high-quality novel view images than all the compared state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the cascading learning of NeRF-VPT introduces adaptability to scenarios with sparse inputs, resulting in a significant enhancement of accuracy for sparse-view novel view synthesis.

This part-based parameterization technique achieves a balance between flexibility and validity using a semi-analytical shape reconstruction algorithm.

However, no matter which schema is used, the previous work ignores to inform PTMs of some features of the downstream task, i.e. train their PTMs without providing any signals related to SR.

With the recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their remarkable reasoning abilities, there is a growing trend to leverage them for KGQA. However, existing methodologies have only focused on answering factual questions, e.g., \"In which city was Silvio Berlusconi's first wife born?\", leaving questions involving commonsense reasoning that real-world users may pose more often, e.g., \"Do I need separate visas to see the Venus of Willendorf and attend the Olympics this summer?\" unaddressed. In this work, we first observe that existing LLM-based methods for KGQA struggle with hallucination on such questions, especially on queries targeting long-tail entities (e.g., non-mainstream and recent entities), thus hindering their applicability in real-world applications especially since their reasoning processes are not easily verifiable. In response, we propose Right for Right Reasons (R3), a commonsense KGQA methodology that allows for a verifiable reasoning procedure by axiomatically surfacing intrinsic commonsense knowledge of LLMs and grounding every factual reasoning step on KG triples. Through experimental evaluations across three different tasks--question answering, claim verification, and preference matching--our findings showcase R3 as a superior approach, outperforming existing methodologies and notably reducing instances of hallucination and reasoning errors.

However, existing KGQA datasets suffer from two significant limitations: (1) no existing KGQA dataset requires commonsense reasoning to arrive at an answer and (2) existing KGQA datasets focus on popular entities for which large language models (LLMs) can directly answer without hallucinating and without leveraging the KG. In this work, we seek a novel KGQA dataset that supports commonsense reasoning and focuses on long-tail entities (e.g., non-mainstream and recent entities) where LLMs frequently hallucinate, and thus create the need for novel methodologies that leverage the KG for factual and attributable commonsense inference. We create a novel Commonsense Reasoning (CR) and Long-Tail (LT) KGQA dataset with two subtasks -- question answering and claim verification -- that address both limitations (1) and (2). We construct CR-LT-KGQA by building extensions to existing reasoning datasets StrategyQA and CREAK over Wikidata. While existing KGQA methods are not applicable due to their lack of commonsense inference support, baseline evaluation of LLMs on CR-LT KGQA demonstrate a high rate of hallucination. Thus, CR-LT KGQA poses significant challenges for hallucination-prone LLMs, hence paving the way for future commonsense KGQA research to provide accurate and factual answers for long-tail entities in the era of LLMs. ",

With hundreds of graph pre-training tasks proposed, integrating knowledge acquired from multiple pre-training tasks has become a popular research topic. In this paper, we identify two important collaborative processes for this topic: (1) select: how to select an optimal task combination from a given task pool based on their compatibility, and (2) weigh: how to weigh the selected tasks based on their importance. While there currently has been a lot of work focused on weighing, comparatively little effort has been devoted to selecting. This paper proposes a novel instance-level framework for integrating multiple graph pre-training tasks, Weigh And Select (WAS), where the two collaborative processes, weighing and selecting, are combined by decoupled siamese networks. Specifically, it first adaptively learns an optimal combination of tasks for each instance from a given task pool, based on which a customized instance-level task weighing strategy is learned. Extensive experiments on 16 graph datasets across node-level and graph-level downstream tasks have demonstrated that by combining a few simple but classical tasks, WAS can achieve comparable performance to other leading counterparts.

    "abstract": "Neural implicit representation of geometric shapes has witnessed considerable advancements in recent years. However, common distance field based implicit representations, specifically signed distance field (SDF) for watertight shapes or unsigned distance field (UDF) for arbitrary shapes, routinely suffer from degradation of reconstruction accuracy when converting to explicit surface points and meshes. In this paper, we introduce a novel neural implicit representation based on unsigned orthogonal distance fields (UODFs). In UODFs, the minimal unsigned distance from any spatial point to the shape surface is defined solely in one orthogonal direction, contrasting with the multi-directional determination made by SDF and UDF. Consequently, every point in the 3D UODFs can directly access its closest surface points along three orthogonal directions. This distinctive feature leverages the accurate reconstruction of surface points without interpolation errors. We verify the effectiveness of UODFs through a range of reconstruction examples, extending from simple watertight or non-watertight shapes to complex shapes that include hollows, internal or assembling structures.

    "title": "The Implicit Bias of Heterogeneity towards Invariance and Causality",
    "abstract": "It is observed empirically that the large language models (LLM), trained with a variant of regression loss using numerous corpus from the Internet, can unveil causal associations to some extent. This is contrary to the traditional wisdom that ``association is not causation'' and the paradigm of traditional causal inference in which prior causal knowledge should be carefully incorporated into the design of methods. It is a mystery why causality, in a higher layer of understanding, can emerge from the regression task that pursues associations. In this paper, we claim the emergence of causality from association-oriented training can be attributed to the coupling effects from the heterogeneity of the source data, stochasticity of training algorithms, and over-parameterization of the learning models. We illustrate such an intuition using a simple but insightful model that learns invariance, a quasi-causality, using regression loss. To be specific, we consider multi-environment low-rank matrix sensing problems where the unknown r-rank ground-truth d*d matrices diverge across the environments but contain a lower-rank invariant, causal part. In this case, running pooled gradient descent will result in biased solutions that only learn associations in general. We show that running large-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent, whose each batch being linear measurement samples randomly selected from a certain environment, can successfully drive the solution towards the invariant, causal solution under certain conditions. This step is related to the relatively strong heterogeneity of the environments, the large step size and noises in the optimization algorithm, and the over-parameterization of the model. In summary, we unveil another implicit bias that is a result of the symbiosis between the heterogeneity of data and modern algorithms, which is, to the best of our knowledge, first in the literature.

In this paper, we present the first collective certificate, which certifies a set of target nodes simultaneously.

We further develop a customized linearization technique that allows us to relax the BQCLP into linear programming (LP) that can be efficiently solved. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our collective certification scheme significantly improves certification performance with minimal computational overhead. For instance, by solving the LP within 1 minute on the Citeseer dataset, we achieve a significant increase in the certified ratio from 0.0% to 81.2% when the injected node number is 5% of the graph size. Our step marks a crucial step towards making provable defense more practical. ",

Due to the heterogeneity and hard-to-collect medical data, this approach is especially beneficial for medical image analysis and neuroscience research, as it streamlines broad downstream tasks without the need for numerous costly annotations. However, there has been limited investigation into brain network foundation models, limiting their adaptability and generalizability for broad neuroscience studies. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, (1) we curated a comprehensive dataset by collating images from 30 datasets, which comprises 70,781 samples of 46,686 participants. Moreover, we introduce pseudo-functional connectivity (pFC) to further generates millions of augmented brain networks by randomly dropping certain timepoints of the BOLD signal. (2) We propose the BrainMass framework for brain network self-supervised learning via mask modeling and feature alignment. BrainMass employs Mask-ROI Modeling (MRM) to bolster intra-network dependencies and regional specificity. Furthermore, Latent Representation Alignment (LRA) module is utilized to regularize augmented brain networks of the same participant with similar topological properties to yield similar latent representations by aligning their latent embeddings. Extensive experiments on eight internal tasks and seven external brain disorder diagnosis tasks show BrainMass's superior performance, highlighting its significant generalizability and adaptability. Nonetheless, BrainMass demonstrates powerful few/zero-shot learning abilities and exhibits meaningful interpretation to various diseases, showcasing its potential use for clinical applications. ",

In this paper, we explore the scenario of source-free unsupervised graph domain adaptation, which tries to address the domain adaptation problem without accessing the labelled source graph. Specifically, we present a novel paradigm called GraphCTA, which performs model adaptation and graph adaptation collaboratively through a series of procedures: (1) conduct model adaptation based on node's neighborhood predictions in target graph considering both local and global information; (2) perform graph adaptation by updating graph structure and node attributes via neighborhood contrastive learning; and (3) the updated graph serves as an input to facilitate the subsequent iteration of model adaptation, thereby establishing a collaborative loop between model adaptation and graph adaptation. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on various public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms recent source-free baselines by large margins. ",

A common solution to these challenges in deep learning is the usage of a transfer learning framework, typically with a fine-tuning protocol, where a large-scale source dataset is used to pre-train a model, further fine-tuned on the target dataset. In this paper, we present a systematic study analyzing whether the usage of small-scale in-domain x-ray image datasets may provide any improvement for landmark detection over models pre-trained on large natural image datasets only. We focus on the multi-landmark localization task for three datasets, including chest, head, and hand x-ray images. Our results show that using in-domain source datasets brings marginal or no benefit with respect to an ImageNet out-of-domain pre-training.

To address this limitation, we propose the Directional Graph Attention Network (DGAT) in this paper. DGAT is able to combine the feature-based attention with the global directional information extracted from the graph topology. To this end, a new class of Laplacian matrices is proposed which can provably reduce the diffusion distance between nodes. Based on the new Laplacian, topology-guided neighbour pruning and edge adding mechanisms are proposed to remove the noisy and capture the helpful long-range neighborhood information. Besides, a global directional attention is designed to enable a topological-aware information propagation.

However, most present GNN-based methods for NIDS are supervised or semi-supervised. Network flows need to be manually annotated as supervisory labels, a process that is time-consuming or even impossible, making NIDS difficult to adapt to potentially complex attacks, especially in large-scale real-world scenarios. The existing GNN-based self-supervised methods focus on the binary classification of network flow as benign or not, and thus fail to reveal the types of attack in practice. This paper studies the application of GNNs to identify the specific types of network flows in an unsupervised manner. We first design an encoder to obtain graph embedding, that introduces the graph attention mechanism and considers the edge information as the only essential factor. Then, a self-supervised method based on graph contrastive learning is proposed. The method samples center nodes, and for each center node, generates subgraph by it and its direct neighbor nodes, and corresponding contrastive subgraph from the interpolated graph, and finally constructs positive and negative samples from subgraphs. Furthermore, a structured contrastive loss function based on edge features and graph local topology is introduced. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first GNN-based self-supervised method for the multiclass classification of network flows in NIDS. Detailed experiments conducted on four real-world databases (NF-Bot-IoT, NF-Bot-IoT-v2, NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018-v2) systematically compare our model with the state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised models, illustrating the considerable potential of our method.

Unlike conventional hierarchical federated learning algorithms, our approach combines gradient aggregation in intra-set iterations with model aggregation in inter-set iterations. We offer a comprehensive analytical framework to evaluate its optimality gap and convergence rate, comparing these aspects with those of conventional algorithms. Additionally, we develop a problem formulation to derive optimal system parameters in a closed-form solution. Our findings reveal that our algorithm consistently achieves high learning accuracy over a range of parameters and significantly outperforms other hierarchical algorithms, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions.

The need for finding a secure and efficient way to meet the requirements of large access capacity, differentiated access, maximum utilization of time slot resource and strong anti-eavesdropping ability in data link networks is well motivated.In this paper, a control sequence-based hierarchical access control scheme is proposed, which not only achieves differentiated time slots allocation for the different needs and levels of nodes, but also enhances randomness and anti-interception performance in data link networks.Based on the scheme, a new theoretical bound is derived to characterize parameter relationships for designing optimal hierarchical control sequence(HCS) set. Moreover, two flexible classes of optimal hierarchical control sequence sets are constructed.By our construction, the terminal user in the data link can access hierarchically and randomly and transmit data packets during its own hopping time slots of the successive frames to prevent eavesdropping while maintaining high throughput.

In this study, we delve into the underlying mechanisms of LLM hallucinations from the perspective of inner representations, and discover a salient pattern associated with hallucinations: correct generations tend to have sharper context activations in the hidden states of the in-context tokens, compared to the incorrect ones. Leveraging this insight, we propose an entropy-based metric to quantify the ``sharpness'' among the in-context hidden states and incorporate it into the decoding process to formulate a constrained decoding approach. Experiments on various knowledge-seeking and hallucination benchmarks demonstrate our approach's consistent effectiveness, for example, achieving up to an 8.6 point improvement on TruthfulQA.

    "abstract": "Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has exhibited impressive zero-shot proficiency on generic and common sense questions. However, LLMs' application on domain-specific vertical questions still lags behind, primarily due to the humiliation problems and deficiencies in vertical knowledge. Furthermore, the vertical data annotation process often requires labor-intensive expert involvement, thereby presenting an additional challenge in enhancing the model's vertical capabilities. In this paper, we propose SERVAL, a synergy learning pipeline designed for unsupervised development of vertical capabilities in both LLMs and small models by mutual enhancement. Specifically, SERVAL utilizes the LLM's zero-shot outputs as annotations, leveraging its confidence to teach a robust vertical model from scratch. Reversely, the trained vertical model guides the LLM fine-tuning to enhance its zero-shot capability, progressively improving both models through an iterative process. In medical domain, known for complex vertical knowledge and costly annotations, comprehensive experiments show that, without access to any gold labels, SERVAL with the synergy learning of OpenAI GPT-3.5 and a simple model attains fully-supervised competitive performance across ten widely used medical datasets. These datasets represent vertically specialized medical diagnostic scenarios (e.g., diabetes, heart diseases, COVID-19), highlighting the potential of SERVAL in refining the vertical capabilities of LLMs and training vertical models from scratch, all achieved without the need for annotations.

This research delves into its efficacy for low-resource language pairs including both the English$\\leftrightarrow$Irish and English$\\leftrightarrow$Marathi language pairs. Notably, the study identifies the optimal hyperparameters and subword model type to significantly improve the translation quality of Transformer models for low-resource language pairs. The scarcity of parallel datasets for low-resource languages can hinder MT development. To address this, gaHealth was developed, the first bilingual corpus of health data for the Irish language. Focusing on the health domain, models developed using this in-domain dataset exhibited very significant improvements in BLEU score when compared with models from the LoResMT2021 Shared Task. A subsequent human evaluation using the multidimensional quality metrics error taxonomy showcased the superior performance of the Transformer system in reducing both accuracy and fluency errors compared to an RNN-based counterpart. Furthermore, this thesis introduces adaptNMT and adaptMLLM, two open-source applications streamlined for the development, fine-tuning, and deployment of neural machine translation models. These tools considerably simplify the setup and evaluation process, making MT more accessible to both developers and translators. Notably, adaptNMT, grounded in the OpenNMT ecosystem, promotes eco-friendly natural language processing research by highlighting the environmental footprint of model development.

    "abstract": "In lung radiotherapy, infrared cameras can record the location of reflective objects on the chest to infer the position of the tumor moving due to breathing, but treatment system latencies hinder radiation beam precision. Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), is a potential solution as it can learn patterns within non-stationary respiratory data but has high complexity. This study assesses the capabilities of resource-efficient online RNN algorithms, namely unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO), sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1), and decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) to forecast respiratory motion during radiotherapy treatment accurately. We use time series containing the 3D position of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects. We propose efficient implementations for SnAp-1 and DNI based on compression of the influence and immediate Jacobian matrices and an accurate update of the linear coefficients used in credit assignment estimation, respectively. The original sampling frequency was 10Hz; we performed resampling at 3.33Hz and 30Hz. We use UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI to forecast each marker's 3D position with horizons (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) h<=2.1s and compare them with RTRL, least mean squares, and linear regression. RNNs trained online achieved similar or better accuracy than most previous works using larger training databases and deep learning, even though we used only the first minute of each sequence to predict motion within that exact sequence. SnAp-1 had the lowest normalized root mean square errors (nRMSE) averaged over the horizon values considered, equal to 0.335 and 0.157, at 3.33Hz and 10.0Hz, respectively. Similarly, UORO had the highest accuracy at 30Hz, with an nRMSE of 0.0897. DNI's inference time, equal to 6.8ms per time step at 30Hz (Intel Core i7-13700 CPU), was the lowest among the RNN methods examined. ",

    "abstract": "Robotic manipulation of deformable, one-dimensional objects (DOOs) like ropes or cables has important potential applications in manufacturing, agriculture, and surgery. In such environments, the task may involve threading through or avoiding becoming tangled with objects like racks or frames. Grasping with multiple grippers can create closed loops between the robot and DOO, and If an obstacle lies within this loop, it may be impossible to reach the goal. However, prior work has only considered the topology of the DOO in isolation, ignoring the arms that are manipulating it. Searching over possible grasps to accomplish the task without considering such topological information is very inefficient, as many grasps will not lead to progress on the task due to topological constraints. Therefore, we propose a grasp loop signature which categorizes the topology of these grasp loops and show how it can be used to guide planning. We perform experiments in simulation on two DOO manipulation tasks to show that using the signature is faster and succeeds more often than methods that rely on local geometry or finite-horizon planning. Finally, we demonstrate using the signature in the real world to manipulate a cable in a scene with obstacles using a dual-arm robot. ",

Currently, a nuanced grasp of causal inference, coupled with an understanding of causal relationships, must be manually programmed into a causal graphical model. To address this difficulty, we present initial results towards a human-centered augmented reality framework for creating causal graphical models. Concretely, our system bootstraps the causal discovery process by involving humans in selecting variables, establishing relationships, performing interventions, generating counterfactual explanations, and evaluating the resulting causal graph at every step.

    "abstract": "This work proposes to augment the lifting steps of the conventional wavelet transform with additional neural network assisted lifting steps. These additional steps reduce residual redundancy (notably aliasing information) amongst the wavelet subbands, and also improve the visual quality of reconstructed images at reduced resolutions. The proposed approach involves two steps, a high-to-low step followed by a low-to-high step. The high-to-low step suppresses aliasing in the low-pass band by using the detail bands at the same resolution, while the low-to-high step aims to further remove redundancy from detail bands, so as to achieve higher energy compaction. The proposed two lifting steps are trained in an end-to-end fashion; we employ a backward annealing approach to overcome the non-differentiability of the quantization and cost functions during back-propagation. Importantly, the networks employed in this paper are compact and with limited non-linearities, allowing a fully scalable system; one pair of trained network parameters are applied for all levels of decomposition and for all bit-rates of interest. By employing the proposed approach within the JPEG 2000 image coding standard, our method can achieve up to 17.4% average BD bit-rate saving over a wide range of bit-rates, while retaining quality and resolution scalability features of JPEG 2000.

    "abstract": "Regional solar power forecasting, which involves predicting the total power generation from all rooftop photovoltaic systems in a region holds significant importance for various stakeholders in the energy sector. However, the vast amount of solar power generation and weather time series from geographically dispersed locations that need to be considered in the forecasting process makes accurate regional forecasting challenging. Therefore, previous work has limited the focus to either forecasting a single time series (i.e., aggregated time series) which is the addition of all solar generation time series in a region, disregarding the location-specific weather effects or forecasting solar generation time series of each PV site (i.e., individual time series) independently using location-specific weather data, resulting in a large number of forecasting models. In this work, we propose two deep-learning-based regional forecasting methods that can effectively leverage both types of time series (aggregated and individual) with weather data in a region. We propose two hierarchical temporal convolutional neural network architectures (HTCNN) and two strategies to adapt HTCNNs for regional solar power forecasting. At first, we explore generating a regional forecast using a single HTCNN. Next, we divide the region into multiple sub-regions based on weather information and train separate HTCNNs for each sub-region; the forecasts of each sub-region are then added to generate a regional forecast. The proposed work is evaluated using a large dataset collected over a year from 101 locations across Western Australia to provide a day ahead forecast. We compare our approaches with well-known alternative methods and show that the sub-region HTCNN requires fewer individual networks and achieves a forecast skill score of 40.2% reducing a statistically significant error by 6.5% compared to the best counterpart.

PillarGen can produce synthetic point clouds with enhanced density and quality based on the provided input point clouds. The PillarGen model performs the following three steps: 1) pillar encoding, 2) Occupied Pillar Prediction (OPP), and 3) Pillar to Point Generation (PPG). The input point clouds are encoded using a pillar grid structure to generate pillar features. Then, OPP determines the active pillars used for point generation and predicts the center of points and the number of points to be generated for each active pillar. PPG generates the synthetic points for each active pillar based on the information provided by OPP. We evaluate the performance of PillarGen using our proprietary radar dataset, focusing on enhancing the density and quality of short-range radar data using the long-range radar data as supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that PillarGen outperforms traditional point upsampling methods in quantitative and qualitative measures. We also confirm that when PillarGen is incorporated into bird's eye view object detection, a significant improvement in detection accuracy is achieved. ",

Comprehensive experiments on COCO and ODinW-13 datasets demonstrate that ZiRa effectively safeguards the zero-shot generalization ability of VLODMs while continuously adapting to new tasks. Specifically, after training on ODinW-13 datasets, ZiRa exhibits superior performance compared to CL-DETR and iDETR, boosting zero-shot generalizability by substantial 13.91 and 8.71 AP, respectively.

    "abstract": "In recent years, neural network-based Wake Word Spotting achieves good performance on clean audio samples but struggles in noisy environments. Audio-Visual Wake Word Spotting (AVWWS) receives lots of attention because visual lip movement information is not affected by complex acoustic scenes. Previous works usually use simple addition or concatenation for multi-modal fusion. The inter-modal correlation remains relatively under-explored. In this paper, we propose a novel module called Frame-Level Cross-Modal Attention (FLCMA) to improve the performance of AVWWS systems. This module can help model multi-modal information at the frame-level through synchronous lip movements and speech signals. We train the end-to-end FLCMA based Audio-Visual Conformer and further improve the performance by fine-tuning pre-trained uni-modal models for the AVWWS task. The proposed system achieves a new state-of-the-art result (4.57% WWS score) on the far-field MISP dataset. ",

Compared to invasive-based signals which require electrode implantation surgery, non-invasive neural signals (e.g. EEG, MEG) have attracted increasing attention considering their safety and generality. However, the exploration is not adequate in three aspects: 1) previous methods mainly focus on EEG but none of the previous works address this problem on MEG with better signal quality; 2) prior works have predominantly used ``teacher-forcing\" during generative decoding, which is impractical; 3) prior works are mostly ``BART-based\" not fully auto-regressive, which performs better in other sequence tasks. In this paper, we explore the brain-to-text translation of MEG signals in a speech-decoding formation.

Recent methods attempt to enhance graph OOD generalization by generating flat environments. However, such flat environments come with inherent limitations to capture more complex data distributions. Considering the DrugOOD dataset, which contains diverse training environments (e.g., scaffold, size, etc.), flat contexts cannot sufficiently address its high heterogeneity. Thus, a new challenge is posed to generate more semantically enriched environments to enhance graph invariant learning for handling distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate hierarchical semantic environments for each graph. Firstly, given an input graph, we explicitly extract variant subgraphs from the input graph to generate proxy predictions on local environments. Then, stochastic attention mechanisms are employed to re-extract the subgraphs for regenerating global environments in a hierarchical manner. In addition, we introduce a new learning objective that guides our model to learn the diversity of environments within the same hierarchy while maintaining consistency across different hierarchies. This approach enables our model to consider the relationships between environments and facilitates robust graph invariant learning. Extensive experiments on real-world graph data have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework. Particularly, in the challenging dataset DrugOOD, our method achieves up to 1.29\\% and 2.83\\% improvement over the best baselines on IC50 and EC50 prediction tasks, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Deepfake technology has given rise to a spectrum of novel and compelling applications. Unfortunately, the widespread proliferation of high-fidelity fake videos has led to pervasive confusion and deception, shattering our faith that seeing is believing. One aspect that has been overlooked so far is that current deepfake detection approaches may easily fall into the trap of overfitting, focusing only on forgery clues within one or a few local regions. Moreover, existing works heavily rely on neural networks to extract forgery features, lacking theoretical constraints guaranteeing that sufficient forgery clues are extracted and superfluous features are eliminated. These deficiencies culminate in unsatisfactory accuracy and limited generalizability in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges through three designs: (1) We present a novel framework to capture broader forgery clues by extracting multiple non-overlapping local representations and fusing them into a global semantic-rich feature. (2) Based on the information bottleneck theory, we derive Local Information Loss to guarantee the orthogonality of local representations while preserving comprehensive task-relevant information. (3) Further, to fuse the local representations and remove task-irrelevant information, we arrive at a Global Information Loss through the theoretical analysis of mutual information.

    "abstract": "(p,q)-clique enumeration on a bipartite graph is critical for calculating clustering coefficient and detecting densest subgraph. It is necessary to carry out subgraph enumeration while protecting users' privacy from any potential attacker as the count of subgraph may contain sensitive information. Most recent studies focus on the privacy protection algorithms based on edge LDP (Local Differential Privacy). However, these algorithms suffer a large estimation error due to the great amount of required noise. In this paper, we propose a novel idea of k-stars LDP and a novel k-stars LDP algorithm for (p, q)-clique enumeration with a small estimation error, where a k-stars is a star-shaped graph with k nodes connecting to one node. The effectiveness of edge LDP relies on its capacity to obfuscate the existence of an edge between the user and his one-hop neighbors. This is based on the premise that a user should be aware of the existence of his one-hop neighbors. Similarly, we can apply this premise to k-stars as well, where an edge is a specific genre of 1-stars. Based on this fact, we first propose the k-stars neighboring list to enable our algorithm to obfuscate the existence of k-stars with Warner' s RR. Then, we propose the absolute value correction technique and the k-stars sampling technique to further reduce the estimation error. Finally, with the two-round user-collector interaction mechanism, we propose our k-stars LDP algorithm to count the number of (p, q)-clique while successfully protecting users' privacy. Both the theoretical analysis and experiments have showed the superiority of our algorithm over the algorithms based on edge LDP. ",

The goal is to partition the input points into neighborhood-preserving shards, so that the nearest neighbors of any point are contained in only a few shards. When a query arrives, a routing algorithm is used to identify the shards which should be searched for its nearest neighbors. This approach forms the backbone of distributed ANNS, where the dataset is so large that it must be split across multiple machines. In this paper, we design simple and highly efficient routing methods, and prove strong theoretical guarantees on their performance. A crucial characteristic of our routing algorithms is that they are inherently modular, and can be used with any partitioning method. This addresses a key drawback of prior approaches, where the routing algorithms are inextricably linked to their associated partitioning method. In particular, our new routing methods enable the use of balanced graph partitioning, which is a high-quality partitioning method without a naturally associated routing algorithm. Thus, we provide the first methods for routing using balanced graph partitioning that are extremely fast to train, admit low latency, and achieve high recall. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of our full partitioning and routing pipeline on billion-scale datasets, where it outperforms existing scalable partitioning methods by significant margins, achieving up to 2.14x higher QPS at 90% recall$@10$ than the best competitor.

The state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods usually rely on superpixels, however, they do not fully utilize the spatial and spectral information in HSI 3-D structure, and their optimization targets are not clustering-oriented. In this work, we first use 3-D and 2-D hybrid convolutional neural networks to extract the high-order spatial and spectral features of HSI through pre-training, and then design a superpixel graph contrastive clustering (SPGCC) model to learn discriminative superpixel representations. Reasonable augmented views are crucial for contrastive clustering, and conventional contrastive learning may hurt the cluster structure since different samples are pushed away in the embedding space even if they belong to the same class. In SPGCC, we design two semantic-invariant data augmentations for HSI superpixels: pixel sampling augmentation and model weight augmentation. Then sample-level alignment and clustering-center-level contrast are performed for better intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity of superpixel embeddings. We perform clustering and network optimization alternatively. Experimental results on several HSI datasets verify the advantages of the proposed method, e.g., on India Pines, our model improves the clustering accuracy from 58.79% to 67.59% compared to the SOTA method.

This becomes problematic when features are mutually exclusive or labels differ across modalities, leading to reduced accuracy. To overcome this, our TNF approach implements a tri-branch framework that manages three separate outputs: one for image modality, another for tabular modality, and a third hybrid output that fuses both image and tabular data. The final decision is made through an ensemble method that integrates likelihoods from all three branches. We validate the effectiveness of TNF through extensive experiments, which illustrate its superiority over traditional fusion and ensemble methods in various convolutional neural networks and transformer-based architectures across multiple datasets.

Through empirical experiments conducted on multiple state-of-the-art IIDSs and diverse datasets, we establish the criticality of these issues in deploying IIDSs. Our findings show the necessity of extensive malicious training data for supervised IIDSs, which can be impractical considering the complexity of recording and labeling attacks in actual industrial environments. Furthermore, while other IIDSs circumvent the previous issue by requiring only benign training data, these can suffer from the difficulty of setting appropriate hyperparameters, which likewise can diminish their performance. By shedding light on these challenges, we aim to enhance the understanding of the limitations and considerations necessary for deploying effective cybersecurity solutions in ICSs, which might be one reason why IIDSs see few deployments.

To achieve this, we utilize the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) framework and design a new adaptive exponentially weighted Asymptotic-Preserving (AP) loss function, which incorporates the macroscopic auxiliary equation that is derived from the original transfer equation directly and explicitly contains the information of the diffusion limit equation. Thus, as the scale parameter tends to zero, the loss function gradually transitions from the transport state to the diffusion limit state. In addition, the initial data, boundary conditions, and conservation laws serve as the regularization terms for the loss. We present several numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of MA-APNNs. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel self-adaption language-driven HOI detection method, termed as FreeA, without labeling by leveraging the adaptability of CLIP to generate latent HOI labels. To be specific, FreeA matches image features of human-object pairs with HOI text templates, and a priori knowledge-based mask method is developed to suppress improbable interactions. In addition, FreeA utilizes the proposed interaction correlation matching method to enhance the likelihood of actions related to a specified action, further refine the generated HOI labels. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that FreeA achieves state-of-the-art performance among weakly supervised HOI models. Our approach is +8.58 mean Average Precision (mAP) on HICO-DET and +1.23 mAP on V-COCO more accurate in localizing and classifying the interactive actions than the newest weakly model, and +1.68 mAP and +7.28 mAP than the latest weakly+ model, respectively.

However, due to the heterogeneity among tables, such DNN bonus is still far from being well exploited on tabular data prediction (e.g., regression or classification tasks). Condensing knowledge from diverse domains, language models (LMs) possess the capability to comprehend feature names from various tables, potentially serving as versatile learners in transferring knowledge across distinct tables and diverse prediction tasks, but their discrete text representation space is inherently incompatible with numerical feature values in tables. In this paper, we present TP-BERTa, a specifically pre-trained LM model for tabular data prediction. Concretely, a novel relative magnitude tokenization converts scalar numerical feature values to finely discrete, high-dimensional tokens, and an intra-feature attention approach integrates feature values with the corresponding feature names. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our pre-trained TP-BERTa leads the performance among tabular DNNs and is competitive with Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models in typical tabular data regime.

This paper introduces NASH, a novel approach that applies neural architecture search to machine learning hardware. Using NASH, hardware designs can achieve not only high throughput and low latency but also superior accuracy performance. We present four versions of the NASH strategy in this paper, all of which show higher accuracy than the original models. The strategy can be applied to various convolutional neural networks, selecting specific model operations among many to guide the training process toward higher accuracy. Experimental results show that applying NASH on ResNet18 or ResNet34 achieves a top 1 accuracy increase of up to 3.1% and a top 5 accuracy increase of up to 2.2% compared to the non-NASH version when tested on the ImageNet data set. We also integrated this approach into the FINN hardware model synthesis tool to automate the application of our approach and the generation of the hardware model. Results show that using FINN can achieve a maximum throughput of 324.5 fps. In addition, NASH models can also result in a better trade-off between accuracy and hardware resource utilization. The accuracy-hardware (HW) Pareto curve shows that the models with the four NASH versions represent the best trade-offs achieving the highest accuracy for a given HW utilization.

    "abstract": "Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP, despite having remarkable generalization ability, are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. This work studies the adversarial robustness of VLMs from the novel perspective of the text prompt instead of the extensively studied model weights (frozen in this work). We first show that the effectiveness of both adversarial attack and defense are sensitive to the used text prompt. Inspired by this, we propose a method to improve resilience to adversarial attacks by learning a robust text prompt for VLMs. The proposed method, named Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), is effective while being both computationally and data efficient. Extensive experiments are conducted across 15 datasets and 4 data sparsity schemes (from 1-shot to full training data settings) to show APT's superiority over hand-engineered prompts and other state-of-the-art adaption methods. APT demonstrated excellent abilities in terms of the in-distribution performance and the generalization under input distribution shift and across datasets. Surprisingly, by simply adding one learned word to the prompts, APT can significantly boost the accuracy and robustness (epsilon=4/255) over the hand-engineered prompts by +13% and +8.5% on average respectively. The improvement further increases, in our most effective setting, to +26.4% for accuracy and +16.7% for robustness. Code is available at https://github.com/TreeLLi/APT. ",

In recent times, various methodologies have emerged, capitalizing on the advantages of employing a network pre-trained on natural images for the extraction of representative features. Subsequently, these features are subjected to processing through a diverse range of techniques including memory banks, normalizing flow, and knowledge distillation, which have exhibited exceptional accuracy. This paper revisits approaches based on pre-trained features by introducing a novel method centered on target-specific embedding. To capture the most representative features of the texture under consideration, we employ a variant of a contrastive training procedure that incorporates both artificially generated defective samples and anomaly-free samples during training. Exploiting the intrinsic properties of surfaces, we derived a meaningful representation from the defect-free samples during training, facilitating a straightforward yet effective calculation of anomaly scores. The experiments conducted on the MVTEC AD and TILDA datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. ",

Thus, we dub this incremental SDF reconstruction for AW as AiSDF. Within the online framework, we infer the underlying Atlanta structure of a given scene and then estimate planar surfel regions supporting the Atlanta structure. This Atlanta-aware surfel representation provides an explicit planar map for a given scene. In addition, based on these Atlanta planar surfel regions, we adaptively sample and constrain the structural regularity in the SDF reconstruction, which enables us to improve the reconstruction quality by maintaining a high-level structure while enhancing the details of a given scene. We evaluate the proposed AiSDF on the ScanNet and ReplicaCAD datasets, where we demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of reconstructing fine details of objects implicitly, as well as structures explicitly in room-scale scenes.

    "abstract": "Link prediction typically studies the probability of future interconnection among nodes with the observation in a single social network. More often than not, real scenario is presented as a multiplex network with common (anchor) users active in multiple social networks. In the literature, most existing works study either the intra-link prediction in a single network or inter-link prediction among networks (a.k.a. network alignment), and consider two learning tasks are independent from each other, which is still away from the fact. On the representation space, the vast majority of existing methods are built upon the traditional Euclidean space, unaware of the inherent geometry of social networks. The third issue is on the scarce anchor users. Annotating anchor users is laborious and expensive, and thus it is impractical to work with quantities of anchor users. Herein, in light of the issues above, we propose to study a challenging yet practical problem of Geometry-aware Collective Link Prediction across Multiplex Network. To address this problem, we present a novel contrastive model, RCoCo, which collaborates intra- and inter-network behaviors in Riemannian spaces. In RCoCo, we design a curvature-aware graph attention network ($\\kappa-$GAT), conducting attention mechanism in Riemannian manifold whose curvature is estimated by the Ricci curvatures over the network. Thereafter, we formulate intra- and inter-contrastive loss in the manifolds, in which we augment graphs by exploring the high-order structure of community and information transfer on anchor users. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with 14 strong baselines on 8 real-world datasets, and show the effectiveness of RCoCo. ",

However, there is currently no security assessment of the web security of the 5G core network. In this paper, we present the first security assessment of the 5G core from a web security perspective. We use the STRIDE threat modeling approach to define a complete list of possible threat vectors and associated attacks. Thanks to a suite of security testing tools, we cover all of these threats and test the security of the 5G core. In particular, we test the three most relevant open-source 5G core implementations, i.e., Open5GS, Free5Gc, and OpenAirInterface. Our analysis shows that all these cores are vulnerable to at least two of our identified attack vectors, demanding increased security measures in the development of future 5G core networks. ",

This problem also has a hidden input $E_* \\subsetneq E$ of cardinality at most $k$ representing blocked edges. The objective is to travel from $s$ to $t$ with the minimum distance. At the beginning of the walk, the blockages $E_*$ are unknown: the traveller discovers that an edge is blocked when visiting one of its endpoints. Online algorithms, also called strategies, have been proposed for this problem and assessed with the competitive ratio, i.e. the ratio between the distance actually traversed by the traveller divided by the distance we would have traversed knowing the blockages in advance. Even though the optimal competitive ratio is $2k+1$ even on unit-weighted planar graphs of treewidth 2, we design a polynomial-time strategy achieving competitive ratio $9$ on unit-weighted outerplanar graphs. This value $9$ also stands as a lower bound for this family of graphs as we prove that, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, no strategy can achieve a competitive ratio $9-\\varepsilon$. Finally, we show that it is not possible to achieve a constant competitive ratio (independent of $G$ and $k$) on weighted outerplanar graphs. ",

Decision-focused Learning (DFL) is a task-oriented framework to integrate prediction and optimization by adapting predictive model to give better decision for the corresponding task. Here, an inevitable challenge arises when computing gradients of the optimal decision with respect to the parameters. Existing researches cope this issue by smoothly reforming surrogate optimization or construct surrogate loss function that mimic task loss. However, they are applied to restricted optimization domain or build functions in a local manner leading a large computational time. In this paper, we propose Input Convex Loss Network (ICLN), a novel global surrogate loss which can be implemented in a general DFL paradigm. ICLN learns task loss via Input Convex Neural Networks which is guaranteed to be convex for some inputs, while keeping the global structure for the other inputs. This enables ICLN to admit general DFL through only a single surrogate loss without any sense for choosing appropriate parametric forms. We confirm effectiveness and flexibility of ICLN by evaluating our proposed model with three stochastic decision-making problems. ",

A popular workflow in the industry, called the feature branch workflow, constrains these graphs to be of a particular shape: a unique main branch, and non-interfering feature branches. Here we focus on the uniform random generation of those graphs with n vertices, including k on the main branch, for which we provide three algorithms, for three different use-cases. The first, based on rejection, is efficient when aiming for small values of k (more precisely whenever k = O($\\sqrt$ n)). The second takes as input any number k of commits in the main branch, but requires costly precalculation. The last one is a Boltzmann generator and enables us to generate very large graphs while targeting a constant k/n ratio. All these algorithms are linear in the size of their outputs. ",

Previous explorations in sample selection have been demonstrated as an effective way for robust learning with noisy labels, however, the conventional studies focus on i.i.d data, and when moving to non-iid graph data and GNNs, two notable challenges remain: (1) nodes located near topological class boundaries are very informative for classification but cannot be successfully distinguished by the heuristic sample selection. (2) there is no available measure that considers the graph topological information to promote sample selection in a graph. To address this dilemma, we propose a $\\textit{Topological Sample Selection}$ (TSS) method that boosts the informative sample selection process in a graph by utilising topological information. We theoretically prove that our procedure minimizes an upper bound of the expected risk under target clean distribution, and experimentally show the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Data augmentation is commonly used to address this issue, as it aims to increase data variety and reduce the distribution gap between training and test data. However, common visual augmentations might not guarantee extensive robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we propose Auxiliary Fourier-basis Augmentation (AFA), a complementary technique targeting augmentation in the frequency domain and filling the augmentation gap left by visual augmentations. We demonstrate the utility of augmentation via Fourier-basis additive noise in a straightforward and efficient adversarial setting. Our results show that AFA benefits the robustness of models against common corruptions, OOD generalization, and consistency of performance of models against increasing perturbations, with negligible deficit to the standard performance of models. It can be seamlessly integrated with other augmentation techniques to further boost performance. ",

Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) approaches take noisy motion estimation as input or model motion implicitly, restricting detection performance in complex dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel Explicit Motion handling and Interactive Prompting framework for VCOD, dubbed EMIP, which handles motion cues explicitly using a frozen pre-trained optical flow fundamental model. EMIP is characterized by a two-stream architecture for simultaneously conducting camouflaged segmentation and optical flow estimation. Interactions across the dual streams are realized in an interactive prompting way that is inspired by emerging visual prompt learning. Two learnable modules, i.e. the camouflaged feeder and motion collector, are designed to incorporate segmentation-to-motion and motion-to-segmentation prompts, respectively, and enhance outputs of the both streams. The prompt fed to the motion stream is learned by supervising optical flow in a self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we show that long-term historical information can also be incorporated as a prompt into EMIP and achieve more robust results with temporal consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our EMIP achieves new state-of-the-art records on popular VCOD benchmarks. The code will be publicly available. ",

While the increasing complexity of the search models have been able to demonstrate improvements in effectiveness (measured in terms of relevance of top-retrieved results), a question worthy of a thorough inspection is - \"how explainable are these models?\", which is what this paper aims to evaluate. In particular, we propose a common evaluation platform to systematically evaluate the explainability of any ranking model (the explanation algorithm being identical for all the models that are to be evaluated). In our proposed framework, each model, in addition to returning a ranked list of documents, also requires to return a list of explanation units or rationales for each document. This meta-information from each document is then used to measure how locally consistent these rationales are as an intrinsic measure of interpretability - one that does not require manual relevance assessments. Additionally, as an extrinsic measure, we compute how relevant these rationales are by leveraging sub-document level relevance assessments. Our findings show a number of interesting observations, such as sentence-level rationales are more consistent, an increase in complexity mostly leads to less consistent explanations, and that interpretability measures offer a complementary dimension of evaluation of IR systems because consistency is not well-correlated with nDCG at top ranks.

Knowledge augmentation in FakeNewsGPT4 involves acquiring two types of forgery-specific knowledge, i.e., semantic correlation and artifact trace, and merging them into LVLMs. Specifically, we design a multi-level cross-modal reasoning module that establishes interactions across modalities for extracting semantic correlations. Concurrently, a dual-branch fine-grained verification module is presented to comprehend localized details to encode artifact traces. The generated knowledge is translated into refined embeddings compatible with LVLMs. We also incorporate candidate answer heuristics and soft prompts to enhance input informativeness. Extensive experiments on the public benchmark demonstrate that FakeNewsGPT4 achieves superior cross-domain performance compared to previous methods. Code will be available. ",

However, an open question is the extent to which these models rely on word-order/syntactic or word co-occurrence/topic-based information when processing natural language. This work contributes to this debate by addressing the question of whether these models primarily use topic as a signal, by exploring the relationship between Transformer-based models' (BERT and RoBERTa's) performance on a range of probing tasks in English, from simple lexical tasks such as sentence length prediction to complex semantic tasks such as idiom token identification, and the sensitivity of these tasks to the topic information. To this end, we propose a novel probing method which we call topic-aware probing. Our initial results indicate that Transformer-based models encode both topic and non-topic information in their intermediate layers, but also that the facility of these models to distinguish idiomatic usage is primarily based on their ability to identify and encode topic. Furthermore, our analysis of these models' performance on other standard probing tasks suggests that tasks that are relatively insensitive to the topic information are also tasks that are relatively difficult for these models.

We show how tiled graphs can combine graphs of learning spaces or antimatroids (partial hypercubes) and maturity models (total orders) to yield models of learning processes. For the visualization of these processes it is a natural approach to aim for certain optimal drawings. We show for most of the more detailed models that the drawing problems resulting from them are NP-complete. The terse model of a maturing process that ignores the details of learning, however, results in a polynomially solvable graph drawing problem. In addition, this model provides insight into the process by ordering the subjects at each test of their maturity. We investigate extremal and random instances of this problem, and provide exact results and bounds on their optimal crossing number. Graph-theoretic models offer two approaches to the design of optimal maturity models given observed data: (1) minimizing intra-subject inconsistencies, which manifest as regressions of subjects, is modeled as the well-known feedback arc set problem. We study the alternative of (2) finding a maturity model by minimizing the inter-subject inconsistencies, which manifest as crossings in the respective drawing. We show this to be NP-complete. ",

A novel training regimen is introduced that amalgamates datasets annotated with either 2D or 3D labels. This approach not only augments the detection models through the utilization of a substantially expanded dataset but also facilitates economical model deployment in real-world scenarios where only 2D annotations are readily available. Lastly, the dissertation presents an innovative pipeline tailored for unsupervised depth estimation in autonomous driving contexts. Extensive empirical analyses affirm the robustness and efficacy of this newly proposed pipeline.

To address these issues, we propose a depth-guided robust and fast point cloud fusion NeRF for sparse inputs. We perceive radiance fields as an explicit voxel grid of features. A point cloud is constructed for each input view, characterized within the voxel grid using matrices and vectors. We accumulate the point cloud of each input view to construct the fused point cloud of the entire scene. Each voxel determines its density and appearance by referring to the point cloud of the entire scene. Through point cloud fusion and voxel grid fine-tuning, inaccuracies in depth values are refined or substituted by those from other views. Moreover, our method can achieve faster reconstruction and greater compactness through effective vector-matrix decomposition.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is vulnerable to inference (e.g., membership inference, property inference, and data reconstruction) attacks that aim to infer the private information of training data or dataset. Existing defenses are only designed for one specific type of attack and sacrifice significant utility or are soon broken by adaptive attacks. We address these limitations by proposing an information-theoretic defense framework, called Inf2Guard, against the three major types of inference attacks. Our framework, inspired by the success of representation learning, posits that learning shared representations not only saves time/costs but also benefits numerous downstream tasks. Generally, Inf2Guard involves two mutual information objectives, for privacy protection and utility preservation, respectively. Inf2Guard exhibits many merits: it facilitates the design of customized objectives against the specific inference attack; it provides a general defense framework which can treat certain existing defenses as special cases; and importantly, it aids in deriving theoretical results, e.g., inherent utility-privacy tradeoff and guaranteed privacy leakage. Extensive evaluations validate the effectiveness of Inf2Guard for learning privacy-preserving representations against inference attacks and demonstrate the superiority over the baselines. ",

    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has advanced the benchmark in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, large amounts of labelled training data are required to train LLMs. Furthermore, data annotation and training are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Zero and few-shot learning have recently emerged as viable options for labelling data using large pre-trained models. Hate speech detection in mix-code low-resource languages is an active problem area where the use of LLMs has proven beneficial. In this study, we have compiled a dataset of 100 YouTube comments, and weakly labelled them for coarse and fine-grained misogyny classification in mix-code Hinglish. Weak annotation was applied due to the labor-intensive annotation process. Zero-shot learning, one-shot learning, and few-shot learning and prompting approaches have then been applied to assign labels to the comments and compare them to human-assigned labels. Out of all the approaches, zero-shot classification using the Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) large model and few-shot prompting using Generative Pre-trained Transformer- 3 (ChatGPT-3) achieve the best results ",

    "abstract": "Fine classification of city-scale buildings from satellite remote sensing imagery is a crucial research area with significant implications for urban planning, infrastructure development, and population distribution analysis. However, the task faces big challenges due to low-resolution overhead images acquired from high altitude space-borne platforms and the long-tail sample distribution of fine-grained urban building categories, leading to severe class imbalance problem. To address these issues, we propose a deep network approach to fine-grained classification of urban buildings using open-access satellite images. A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based super-resolution method is first introduced to enhance the spatial resolution of satellite images, which benefits from domain-adaptive knowledge distillation. Then, a new fine-grained classification network with Category Information Balancing Module (CIBM) and Contrastive Supervision (CS) technique is proposed to mitigate the problem of class imbalance and improve the classification robustness and accuracy. Experiments on Hong Kong data set with 11 fine building types revealed promising classification results with a mean Top-1 accuracy of 60.45\\%, which is on par with street-view image based approaches. Extensive ablation study shows that CIBM and CS improve Top-1 accuracy by 2.6\\% and 3.5\\% compared to the baseline method, respectively. And both modules can be easily inserted into other classification networks and similar enhancements have been achieved. Our research contributes to the field of urban analysis by providing a practical solution for fine classification of buildings in challenging mega city scenarios solely using open-access satellite images. The proposed method can serve as a valuable tool for urban planners, aiding in the understanding of economic, industrial, and population distribution. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised pre-training has been proved to be effective in learning transferable representations that benefit various visual tasks. This paper asks this question: can self-supervised pre-training learn general facial representations for various facial analysis tasks? Recent efforts toward this goal are limited to treating each face image as a whole, i.e., learning consistent facial representations at the image-level, which overlooks the consistency of local facial representations (i.e., facial regions like eyes, nose, etc). In this work, we make a first attempt to propose a novel self-supervised facial representation learning framework to learn consistent global and local facial representations, Facial Region Awareness (FRA). Specifically, we explicitly enforce the consistency of facial regions by matching the local facial representations across views, which are extracted with learned heatmaps highlighting the facial regions. Inspired by the mask prediction in supervised semantic segmentation, we obtain the heatmaps via cosine similarity between the per-pixel projection of feature maps and facial mask embeddings computed from learnable positional embeddings, which leverage the attention mechanism to globally look up the facial image for facial regions. To learn such heatmaps, we formulate the learning of facial mask embeddings as a deep clustering problem by assigning the pixel features from the feature maps to them. The transfer learning results on facial classification and regression tasks show that our FRA outperforms previous pre-trained models and more importantly, using ResNet as the unified backbone for various tasks, our FRA achieves comparable or even better performance compared with SOTA methods in facial analysis tasks.

    "abstract": "Thanks to the development of basic models, infrared small target detection (ISTD) algorithms have made significant progress. Specifically, the structures combining convolutional networks with transformers can well extract both local and global features. At the same time, they also inherit defects from the basic model, e.g., the quadratic computational complexity of transformers, which impacts efficiency. Inspired by a recent basic model with linear complexity for long-distance modeling, called Mamba, we explore the potential of this state space model in ISTD in this paper. However, direct application is unsuitable since local features, which are critical to detecting small targets, cannot be fully exploited. Instead, we tailor a Mamba-in-Mamba (MiM-ISTD) structure for efficient ISTD. For example, we treat the local patches as \"visual sentences\" and further decompose them into sub-patches as \"visual words\" to further explore the locality. The interactions among each word in a given visual sentence will be calculated with negligible computational costs. By aggregating the word and sentence features, the representation ability of MiM-ISTD can be significantly bolstered. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1k prove the superior accuracy and efficiency of our method. Specifically, MiM-ISTD is $10 \\times$ faster than the SOTA and reduces GPU memory usage by 73.4$\\%$ per $2048 \\times 2048$ image during inference, overcoming the computation$\\&$memory constraints on performing Mamba-based understanding on high-resolution infrared images.Source code is available at https://github.com/txchen-USTC/MiM-ISTD.

These attackers have different motives and follow diverse tactics to achieve their nefarious objectives. In this work, we focus on the impact of CrossPath attacks in SDNs and introduce our framework, Mirage, which not only detects but also mitigates this attack. Our framework, Mirage, detects SDN switches that become unreachable due to being under attack, takes proactive measures to prevent Adversarial Path Reconnaissance, and effectively mitigates CrossPath attacks in SDNs. A CrossPath attack is a form of link flood attack that indirectly attacks the control plane by overwhelming the shared links that connect the data and control planes with data plane traffic. This attack is exclusive to in band SDN, where the data and the control plane, both utilize the same physical links for transmitting and receiving traffic. Our framework, Mirage, prevents attackers from launching adversarial path reconnaissance to identify shared links in a network, thereby thwarting their abuse and preventing this attack. Mirage not only stops adversarial path reconnaissance but also includes features to quickly counter ongoing attacks once detected. Mirage uses path diversity to reroute network packet to prevent timing based measurement. Mirage can also enforce short lived flow table rules to prevent timing attacks. These measures are carefully designed to enhance the security of the SDN environment. Moreover, we share the results of our experiments, which clearly show Mirage's effectiveness in preventing path reconnaissance, detecting CrossPath attacks, and mitigating ongoing threats. Our framework successfully protects the network from these harmful activities, giving valuable insights into SDN security. ",

However, it is true that reference images are difficult to obtain in the real world, as well as collected images by cameras suffer from noise. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a perceptive self-supervised learning network for noisy image watermark removal (PSLNet) in this paper. PSLNet depends on a parallel network to remove noise and watermarks. The upper network uses task decomposition ideas to remove noise and watermarks in sequence. The lower network utilizes the degradation model idea to simultaneously remove noise and watermarks. Specifically, mentioned paired watermark images are obtained in a self supervised way, and paired noisy images (i.e., noisy and reference images) are obtained in a supervised way. To enhance the clarity of obtained images, interacting two sub-networks and fusing obtained clean images are used to improve the effects of image watermark removal in terms of structural information and pixel enhancement. Taking into texture information account, a mixed loss uses obtained images and features to achieve a robust model of noisy image watermark removal. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method is very effective in comparison with popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for noisy image watermark removal.

The precision of prevailing deep learning-driven traffic prediction models typically sees an upward trend with a rise in the volume of training data. However, the procurement of comprehensive spatiotemporal datasets for traffic is often fraught with challenges, primarily stemming from the substantial costs associated with data collection and retention. Consequently, developing a model that can achieve accurate predictions and good generalization ability in areas with limited historical traffic data is a challenging problem. It is noteworthy that the rapidly advancing pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) of recent years have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in cross-modality knowledge transfer and few-shot learning. Recognizing the sequential nature of traffic data, similar to language, we introduce TPLLM, a novel traffic prediction framework leveraging LLMs. In this framework, we construct a sequence embedding layer based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a graph embedding layer based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to extract sequence features and spatial features, respectively. These are subsequently integrated to form inputs that are suitable for LLMs. A Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning approach is applied to TPLLM, thereby facilitating efficient learning and minimizing computational demands. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that TPLLM exhibits commendable performance in both full-sample and few-shot prediction scenarios, effectively supporting the development of ITS in regions with scarce historical traffic data.

Even simple MLPs show strong inductive biases: uniform sampling in weight space yields a very biased distribution of functions in terms of complexity. But unlike common wisdom, NNs do not have an inherent \"simplicity bias\". This property depends on components such as ReLUs, residual connections, and layer normalizations. Alternative architectures can be built with a bias for any level of complexity. Transformers also inherit all these properties from their building blocks. Implications.

Existing CPT implementations take common learning rate schedules (e.g., cyclical cosine sched- ules) and use them for low precision training without adequate comparisons to alternative scheduling options. We define a diverse suite of CPT schedules and analyze their performance across a variety of DNN training regimes, some of which are unexplored in the low precision training literature (e.g., node classification with graph neural networks). From these experiments, we discover alternative CPT schedules that offer further improvements in training efficiency and model performance, as well as derive a set of best practices for choosing CPT schedules. Going further, we find that a correlation exists between model performance and training cost, and that changing the underlying CPT schedule can control the tradeoff between these two variables. To explain the direct correlation between model performance and training cost, we draw a connection between quantized training and critical learning periods, suggesting that aggressive quantization is a form of learning impairment that can permanently damage model performance.

Reference-based phishing detectors (RBPDs), which compare the logos on a target webpage to a known set of logos, have emerged as the state-of-the-art approach. However, a major limitation of existing RBPDs is that they rely on a manually constructed brand knowledge base, making it infeasible to scale to a large number of brands, which results in false negative errors due to the insufficient brand coverage of the knowledge base. To address this issue, we propose an automated knowledge collection pipeline, using which we collect and release a large-scale multimodal brand knowledge base, KnowPhish, containing 20k brands with rich information about each brand. KnowPhish can be used to boost the performance of existing RBPDs in a plug-and-play manner. A second limitation of existing RBPDs is that they solely rely on the image modality, ignoring useful textual information present in the webpage HTML. To utilize this textual information, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based approach to extract brand information of webpages from text. Our resulting multimodal phishing detection approach, KnowPhish Detector (KPD), can detect phishing webpages with or without logos.

This increase in reliability, coupled with the mass generation and consumption of information stemming from the increasing complexity of the network and the integration of artificial intelligence agents, affects transport networks, which will be required to allow the feasibility of such services to materialize. To this end, traditional recovery schemes are inadequate to ensure the resilience requirements of next-generation critical services given the increasingly dynamic nature of the network. The work presented in this paper proposes a probabilistic and fault-tolerant robust traffic grooming model for OTN-over-DWDM networks.

However, the straightforward decomposition of 4D dynamic scenes into multiple 2D plane-based representations proves insufficient for re-rendering high-fidelity scenes with complex motions. In response, we present a novel direction-aware representation (DaRe) approach that captures scene dynamics from six different directions. This learned representation undergoes an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover plane-based information. DaReNeRF computes features for each space-time point by fusing vectors from these recovered planes. Combining DaReNeRF with a tiny MLP for color regression and leveraging volume rendering in training yield state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for complex dynamic scenes. Notably, to address redundancy introduced by the six real and six imaginary direction-aware wavelet coefficients, we introduce a trainable masking approach, mitigating storage issues without significant performance decline.

    "abstract": "Natural language processing research has begun to embrace the notion of annotator subjectivity, motivated by variations in labelling. This approach understands each annotator's view as valid, which can be highly suitable for tasks that embed subjectivity, e.g., sentiment analysis. However, this construction may be inappropriate for tasks such as hate speech detection, as it affords equal validity to all positions on e.g., sexism or racism. We argue that the conflation of hate and offence can invalidate findings on hate speech, and call for future work to be situated in theory, disentangling hate from its orthogonal concept, offence. ",

    "abstract": "Context: Edge graphs are graphs whose edges are labelled with identifiers, and nodes can have multiple edges between them. They are used to model a wide range of systems, including networks with distances or degrees of connection and complex relational data. Inquiry: Unfortunately, the homogeneity of this graph structure prevents an effective representation in (functional) programs. Either their interface is riddled with partial functions, or the representations are computationally inefficient to process. Approach: We present a novel data type for edge graphs, based on total and recursive definitions, that prevents usage errors from partial APIs and promotes structurally recursive computations. We follow an algebraic approach and provide a set of primitive constructors and combinators, along with equational laws that identify semantically equivalent constructions. Knowledge: This algebra translates directly into an implementation using algebraic data types, and its homomorphisms give rise to functions for manipulating and transforming these edge graphs. Grounding: We exploit the fact that many common graph algorithms are such homomorphisms to implement them in our framework. Importance: In giving a theoretical grounding for the edge graph data type, we can formalise properties such as soundness and completeness of the representation while also minimising usage errors and maximising re-usability.

    "abstract": "Query performance (e.g., execution time) prediction is a critical component of modern DBMSes. As a pioneering cloud data warehouse, Amazon Redshift relies on an accurate execution time prediction for many downstream tasks, ranging from high-level optimizations, such as automatically creating materialized views, to low-level tasks on the critical path of query execution, such as admission, scheduling, and execution resource control. Unfortunately, many existing execution time prediction techniques, including those used in Redshift, suffer from cold start issues, inaccurate estimation, and are not robust against workload/data changes. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical execution time predictor: the Stage predictor. The Stage predictor is designed to leverage the unique characteristics and challenges faced by Redshift. The Stage predictor consists of three model states: an execution time cache, a lightweight local model optimized for a specific DB instance with uncertainty measurement, and a complex global model that is transferable across all instances in Redshift. We design a systematic approach to use these models that best leverages optimality (cache), instance-optimization (local model), and transferable knowledge about Redshift (global model). Experimentally, we show that the Stage predictor makes more accurate and robust predictions while maintaining a practical inference latency and memory overhead. Overall, the Stage predictor can improve the average query execution latency by $20\\%$ on these instances compared to the prior query performance predictor in Redshift. ",

In this work, we enhance PINC for modeling highly nonlinear systems such as gas-lifted oil wells. By introducing skip connections in the PINC network and refining certain terms in the ODE, we achieve more accurate gradients during training, resulting in an effective modeling process for the oil well system. Our proposed improved PINC demonstrates superior performance, reducing the validation prediction error by an average of 67% in the oil well application and significantly enhancing gradient flow through the network layers, increasing its magnitude by four orders of magnitude compared to the original PINC. Furthermore, experiments showcase the efficacy of Model Predictive Control (MPC) in regulating the bottom-hole pressure of the oil well using the improved PINC model, even in the presence of noisy measurements.

This study presents a unified prediction and planning framework that concurrently models short-term aleatoric uncertainty (SAU), long-term aleatoric uncertainty (LAU), and epistemic uncertainty (EU) to predict and establish a robust foundation for planning in dynamic contexts. The framework uses Gaussian mixture models and deep ensemble methods, to concurrently capture and assess SAU, LAU, and EU, where traditional methods do not integrate these uncertainties simultaneously. Additionally, uncertainty-aware planning is introduced, considering various uncertainties. The study's contributions include comparisons of uncertainty estimations, risk modeling, and planning methods in comparison to existing approaches. The proposed methods were rigorously evaluated using the CommonRoad benchmark and settings with limited perception. These experiments illuminated the advantages and roles of different uncertainty factors in autonomous driving processes. In addition, comparative assessments of various uncertainty modeling strategies underscore the benefits of modeling multiple types of uncertainties, thus enhancing planning accuracy and reliability. The proposed framework facilitates the development of methods for UAP and surpasses existing uncertainty-aware risk models, particularly when considering diverse traffic scenarios.

Therefore, ensuring their robustness against common and realistic adversarial semantic transformations, such as rotation and shifting in the physical world, is crucial for the safety of AVs. While empirical evidence suggests that MSFs exhibit improved robustness compared to single-modal models, they are still vulnerable to adversarial semantic transformations. Despite the proposal of empirical defenses, several works show that these defenses can be attacked again by new adaptive attacks. So far, there is no certified defense proposed for MSFs. In this work, we propose the first robustness certification framework COMMIT certify robustness of multi-sensor fusion systems against semantic attacks. In particular, we propose a practical anisotropic noise mechanism that leverages randomized smoothing with multi-modal data and performs a grid-based splitting method to characterize complex semantic transformations. We also propose efficient algorithms to compute the certification in terms of object detection accuracy and IoU for large-scale MSF models. Empirically, we evaluate the efficacy of COMMIT in different settings and provide a comprehensive benchmark of certified robustness for different MSF models using the CARLA simulation platform. We show that the certification for MSF models is at most 48.39% higher than that of single-modal models, which validates the advantages of MSF models. We believe our certification framework and benchmark will contribute an important step towards certifiably robust AVs in practice. ",

Inflation is influenced by range of factors, one of which is inflation expectations. Many central banks take this factor into consideration while implementing monetary policy within the inflation targeting regime. Nowadays, a lot of people are active users of the Internet, especially social networks. There is a hypothesis that people search, read, and discuss mainly only those issues that are of particular interest to them. It is logical to assume that the dynamics of prices may also be in the focus of user discussions. So, such discussions could be regarded as an alternative source of more rapid information about inflation expectations. This study is based on unstructured data from Vkontakte social network to analyze upward and downward inflationary trends (on the example of the Omsk region). The sample of more than 8.5 million posts was collected between January 2010 and May 2022. The authors used BERT neural networks to solve the problem. These models demonstrated better results than the benchmarks (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree classifier, etc.). It makes possible to define pro-inflationary and disinflationary types of keywords in different contexts and get their visualization with SHAP method. This analysis provides additional operational information about inflationary processes at the regional level The proposed approach can be scaled for other regions. At the same time the limitation of the work is the time and power costs for the initial training of similar models for all regions of Russia. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting anomalies is important for identifying inefficiencies, errors, or fraud in business processes. Traditional process mining approaches focus on analyzing 'flattened', sequential, event logs based on a single case notion. However, many real-world process executions exhibit a graph-like structure, where events can be associated with multiple cases. Flattening event logs requires selecting a single case identifier which creates a gap with the real event data and artificially introduces anomalies in the event logs. Object-centric process mining avoids these limitations by allowing events to be related to different cases. This study proposes a novel framework for anomaly detection in business processes that exploits graph neural networks and the enhanced information offered by object-centric process mining. We first reconstruct and represent the process dependencies of the object-centric event logs as attributed graphs and then employ a graph convolutional autoencoder architecture to detect anomalous events. Our results show that our approach provides promising performance in detecting anomalies at the activity type and attributes level, although it struggles to detect anomalies in the temporal order of events.

There are two main challenges for typical deep learning-based methods for quantitative finance. First, they struggle to fuse textual and numerical information flexibly for stock movement prediction. Second, traditional methods lack clarity and interpretability, which impedes their application in scenarios where the justification for predictions is essential. To solve the above challenges, we propose Ploutos, a novel financial LLM framework that consists of PloutosGen and PloutosGPT. The PloutosGen contains multiple primary experts that can analyze different modal data, such as text and numbers, and provide quantitative strategies from different perspectives. Then PloutosGPT combines their insights and predictions and generates interpretable rationales. To generate accurate and faithful rationales, the training strategy of PloutosGPT leverage rearview-mirror prompting mechanism to guide GPT-4 to generate rationales, and a dynamic token weighting mechanism to finetune LLM by increasing key tokens weight.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the application of Gaussian Processes (GPs) for predicting mean-reverting time series with an underlying structure, using relatively unexplored functional and augmented data structures. While many conventional forecasting methods concentrate on the short-term dynamics of time series data, GPs offer the potential to forecast not just the average prediction but the entire probability distribution over a future trajectory. This is particularly beneficial in financial contexts, where accurate predictions alone may not suffice if incorrect volatility assessments lead to capital losses. Moreover, in trade selection, GPs allow for the forecasting of multiple Sharpe ratios adjusted for transaction costs, aiding in decision-making. The functional data representation utilized in this study enables longer-term predictions by leveraging information from previous years, even as the forecast moves away from the current year's training data. Additionally, the augmented representation enriches the training set by incorporating multiple targets for future points in time, facilitating long-term predictions. Our implementation closely aligns with the methodology outlined in, which assessed effectiveness on commodity futures. However, our testing methodology differs. Instead of real data, we employ simulated data with similar characteristics. We construct a testing environment to evaluate both data representations and models under conditions of increasing noise, fat tails, and inappropriate kernels-conditions commonly encountered in practice. By simulating data, we can compare our forecast distribution over time against a full simulation of the actual distribution of our test set, thereby reducing the inherent uncertainty in testing time series models on real data. We enable feature prediction through augmentation and employ sub-sampling to ensure the feasibility of GPs. ",

This study presents a transformer-based framework for automatically assessing dysarthria severity from raw speech data. It can offer an objective, repeatable, accessible, standardised and cost-effective and compared to traditional methods requiring human expert assessors. We develop a transformer framework, called Speaker-Agnostic Latent Regularisation (SALR), incorporating a multi-task learning objective and contrastive learning for speaker-independent multi-class dysarthria severity classification. The multi-task framework is designed to reduce reliance on speaker-specific characteristics and address the intrinsic intra-class variability of dysarthric speech. We evaluated on the Universal Access Speech dataset using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation, our model demonstrated superior performance over traditional machine learning approaches, with an accuracy of $70.48\\%$ and an F1 score of $59.23\\%$. Our SALR model also exceeded the previous benchmark for AI-based classification, which used support vector machines, by $16.58\\%$. We open the black box of our model by visualising the latent space where we can observe how the model substantially reduces speaker-specific cues and amplifies task-specific ones, thereby showing its robustness.

We start from a unique Cauchy datum, which is holomorphic ramified around the smooth locus and is sufficiently singular. Then, we expect the existence of a solution which should be holomorphic ramified around the singular locus S defined by the vanishing of the discriminant of an algebraic equation. Notice, moreover, that the monodromy of the Cauchy datum is Abelian, whereas one of the solutions is non-Abelian. Moreover, the singular locus S depends on the Cauchy datum in contrast to the Leray principle (stated for linear problems only). This phenomenon is due to the fact that the PDE is genuinely nonlinear and that the Cauchy datum is sufficiently singular. First, we investigate the case of the inviscid Burgers equation. Later, we state a general conjecture that describes the expected phenomenon. We view this Conjecture as a working programme allowing us to develop interesting new Mathematics. We also state another Conjecture 2, which is a particular case of the general Conjecture but keeps all the flavour and difficulty of the subject. Then, we propose a new algorithm with a map F such that a fixed point of F would give a solution to the problem associated with Conjecture 2. Then, we perform convincing, elaborate numerical tests that suggest that a Banach norm should exist for which the mapping F should be a contraction so that the solution (with the above specific algebraic structure) should be unique.

    "abstract": "The Center for Disease Control estimates that over 37 million US adults suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD), yet 9 out of 10 of these individuals are unaware of their condition due to the absence of symptoms in the early stages. It has a significant impact on patients' quality of life, particularly when it progresses to the need for dialysis. Early prediction of dialysis is crucial as it can significantly improve patient outcomes and assist healthcare providers in making timely and informed decisions. However, developing an effective machine learning (ML)-based Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for early dialysis prediction poses a key challenge due to the imbalanced nature of data. To address this challenge, this study evaluates various data augmentation techniques to understand their effectiveness on real-world datasets. We propose a new approach named Binary Gaussian Copula Synthesis (BGCS). BGCS is tailored for binary medical datasets and excels in generating synthetic minority data that mirrors the distribution of the original data. BGCS enhances early dialysis prediction by outperforming traditional methods in detecting dialysis patients. For the best ML model, Random Forest, BCGS achieved a 72% improvement, surpassing the state-of-the-art augmentation approaches. Also, we present a ML-based CDSS, designed to aid clinicians in making informed decisions. CDSS, which utilizes decision tree models, is developed to improve patient outcomes, identify critical variables, and thereby enable clinicians to make proactive decisions, and strategize treatment plans effectively for CKD patients who are more likely to require dialysis in the near future. Through comprehensive feature analysis and meticulous data preparation, we ensure that the CDSS's dialysis predictions are not only accurate but also actionable, providing a valuable tool in the management and treatment of CKD.

In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, the agents of a network have continuous-valued opinions, which they adjust when they interact with agents whose opinions are sufficiently close to theirs. The employed content-spread model introduces a twist into BCMs by using bounded confidence for the content spread itself. To study the spread of content, we define an analogue of the basic reproduction number from disease dynamics that we call an \\emph{opinion reproduction number}. A critical value of the opinion reproduction number indicates whether or not there is an ``infodemic'' (i.e., a large content-spreading cascade) of content that reflects a particular opinion. By determining this critical value, one can determine whether or not an opinion will die off or propagate widely as a cascade in a population of agents. Using configuration-model networks, we quantify the size and shape of content dissemination using a variety of summary statistics, and we illustrate how network structure and spreading model parameters affect these statistics. We find that content spreads most widely when the agents have large expected mean degree or large receptiveness to content. When the amount of content spread only slightly exceeds the critical opinion reproduction number (i.e., the infodemic threshold), there can be longer dissemination trees than when the expected mean degree or receptiveness is larger, even though the total number of content shares is smaller.

    "abstract": "We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work. ",

The first is established on the distributed gradient tracking algorithm, by appropriately perturbing the initial values and parameters that contain the privacy-sensitive data with Gaussian and truncated Laplacian noises, respectively. Rigorous proofs are established to show the achievable trade-off between the ({\\epsilon}, {\\delta})-differential privacy and the computation accuracy. The second solver is established on the combination of the distributed shuffling mechanism and the average consensus algorithm, which enables each agent to obtain a noisy version of parameters characterizing the global gradient. As a result, the least-squares optimization problem can be eventually solved by each agent locally in such a way that any given ({\\epsilon}, {\\delta})-differential privacy requirement can be preserved while the solution may be computed with the accuracy independent of the network size, which makes the latter more suitable for large-scale distributed least-squares problems. Numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of both solvers. ",

    "abstract": "Likelihood-based deep generative models such as score-based diffusion models and variational autoencoders are state-of-the-art machine learning models approximating high-dimensional distributions of data such as images, text, or audio. One of many downstream tasks they can be naturally applied to is out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, seminal work by Nalisnick et al. which we reproduce showed that deep generative models consistently infer higher log-likelihoods for OOD data than data they were trained on, marking an open problem. In this work, we analyse using the gradient of a data point with respect to the parameters of the deep generative model for OOD detection, based on the simple intuition that OOD data should have larger gradient norms than training data. We formalise measuring the size of the gradient as approximating the Fisher information metric. We show that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) has large absolute diagonal values, motivating the use of chi-square distributed, layer-wise gradient norms as features. We combine these features to make a simple, model-agnostic and hyperparameter-free method for OOD detection which estimates the joint density of the layer-wise gradient norms for a given data point. We find that these layer-wise gradient norms are weakly correlated, rendering their combined usage informative, and prove that the layer-wise gradient norms satisfy the principle of (data representation) invariance. Our empirical results indicate that this method outperforms the Typicality test for most deep generative models and image dataset pairings. ",

In response to blurred boundaries and high variability characteristic of lesion areas in COVID-19 CT images, we introduce CDSE-UNet: a novel UNet-based segmentation model that integrates Canny operator edge detection and a dual-path SENet feature fusion mechanism. This model enhances the standard UNet architecture by employing the Canny operator for edge detection in sample images, paralleling this with a similar network structure for semantic feature extraction. A key innovation is the Double SENet Feature Fusion Block, applied across corresponding network layers to effectively combine features from both image paths. Moreover, we have developed a Multiscale Convolution approach, replacing the standard Convolution in UNet, to adapt to the varied lesion sizes and shapes. This addition not only aids in accurately classifying lesion edge pixels but also significantly improves channel differentiation and expands the capacity of the model. Our evaluations on public datasets demonstrate CDSE-UNet's superior performance over other leading models, particularly in segmenting large and small lesion areas, accurately delineating lesion edges, and effectively suppressing noise ",

A system trained only with a dataset using microphone arrays in a fixed position would be unable to adapt to the fast relative motion of sound events associated with self-motion, resulting in the degradation of SELD performance. To address this, we designed 6DoF SELD Dataset for wearable systems, the first SELD dataset considering the self-motion of microphones. Furthermore, we proposed a multi-modal SELD system that jointly utilizes audio and motion tracking sensor signals. These sensor signals are expected to help the system find useful acoustic cues for SELD on the basis of the current self-motion state. Experimental results on our dataset show that the proposed method effectively improves SELD performance with a mechanism to extract acoustic features conditioned by sensor signals. ",

However, the diagnostic model is still trained on the black box model and might lack the attention of FCs in important regions during the training. To enhance the explainability and improve diagnostic performance, providing prior knowledge on neurodegeneration-related regions when healthy subjects (HC) develop into subject cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for the diagnostic model is a key step. To better determine the neurodegeneration-related regions, we employ counterfactual reasoning to generate the target label FC matrices derived from source label FC and then subtract source label FC with target label FC. The counterfactual reasoning architecture is constructed by adaptive forward and backward transformer generative adversarial network (AFBT GAN), which is specifically designed by network property in FC and inverse patch embedding operation in the transformer. The specific design can make the model focus more on the current network correlation and employ the global insight of the transformer to reconstruct FC, which both help the generation of high-quality target label FC. The validation experiments are conducted on both clinical and public datasets, the generated attention map are both vital correlated to cognitive function and the diagnostic performance is also significant.

We study an interesting subclass of weakly modular graphs that satisfies a stronger version of the triangle condition, known as the \\emph{triangle diamond condition ($TDC$)}. and term this subclass of weakly modular graphs as the \\emph{diamond-weakly modular graphs}. It is observed that this class contains the class of bridged graphs and the class of weakly bridged graphs. The interval function $I_G$ of a connected graph $G$ with vertex set $V$ is an important concept in metric graph theory and is one of the prime example of a transit function; a set function defined on the Cartesian product $V\\times V$ to the power set of $V$ satisfying the expansive, symmetric and idempotent axioms. In this paper, we derive an interesting axiom denoted as $(J0')$, obtained from a well-known axiom introduced by Marlow Sholander in 1952, denoted as $(J0)$. It is proved that the axiom $(J0')$ is a characterizing axiom of the diamond-weakly modular graphs. We propose certain types of independent first-order betweenness axioms on an arbitrary transit function $R$ and prove that an arbitrary transit function becomes the interval function of a diamond-weakly modular graph if and only if $R$ satisfies these betweenness axioms.

High accuracy and stability by means of a limited amount of training data is achieved by implementing physics-informed regularizations and the back stress information. The off-loading of the Neural Network is applied to the maximal extent. The proposed model architecture is simpler and more efficient compared to existing solutions from the literature, while representing a complete three-dimensional material model. The validation of the approach is carried out by means of surrogate data obtained with the Armstrong-Frederick kinematic hardening model. The Mean Squared Error is assumed as the loss function which stipulates several restrictions: deviatoric character of internal variables, compliance with the flow rule, the differentiation of elastic and plastic steps and the associativity of the flow rule. The latter, however, has a minor impact on the accuracy, which implies the generalizability of the model for a broad spectrum of evolution laws for internal variables. Numerical tests simulating several load cases are shown in detail and validated for accuracy and stability. ",

Pole-like features encoded in HD maps such as traffic signs, traffic lights or street lights can be used as landmarks for localization. For this purpose, they first need to be detected by the vehicle using its embedded sensors. While geometric models can be used to process 3D point clouds retrieved by lidar sensors, modern image-based approaches rely on deep neural network and therefore heavily depend on annotated training data. In this paper, a 2D HD map is used to automatically annotate pole-like features in images. In the absence of height information, the map features are represented as pole bases at the ground level. We show how an additional lidar sensor can be used to filter out occluded features and refine the ground projection. We also demonstrate how an object detector can be trained to detect a pole base. To evaluate our methodology, it is first validated with data manually annotated from semantic segmentation and then compared to our own automatically generated annotated data recorded in the city of Compi{\\`e}gne, France. Erratum: In the original version [1], an error occurred in the accuracy evaluation of the different models studied and the evaluation method applied on the detection results was not clearly defined.

We translate the fairness framework commonly considered in sociology in order to address sampling bias in ecology. By incorporating the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) as an additional penalty term in the loss we optimize, we ensure that the structure of the latent space is independent of continuous variables, which are related to the sampling process. Finally, we show how our approach can change our understanding of ecological networks when applied to the Spipoll data set, a citizen science monitoring program of plant-pollinator interactions to which many observers contribute, making it prone to sampling bias.

Considering the $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP framework, we show that SGD with heavy-tailed perturbations achieves $(0, \\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/n))$-DP for a broad class of loss functions which can be non-convex, where $n$ is the number of data points. As a remarkable byproduct, contrary to prior work that necessitates bounded sensitivity for the gradients or clipping the iterates, our theory reveals that under mild assumptions, such a projection step is not actually necessary. We illustrate that the heavy-tailed noising mechanism achieves similar DP guarantees compared to the Gaussian case, which suggests that it can be a viable alternative to its light-tailed counterparts.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the performance of a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN) and a comparable classical Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for detection and classification problem using a radar. Specifically, we take a fairly complex radar time-series model derived from electromagnetic theory, namely the Martin-Mulgrew model, that is used to simulate radar returns of objects with rotating blades, such as drones. We find that when that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high, CNN outperforms the HQNN for detection and classification. However, in the low SNR regime (which is of greatest interest in practice) the performance of HQNN is found to be superior to that of the CNN of a similar architecture. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a multilayer inhomogeneous random graph model (MIRG), whose layers may consist of both single-edge and multi-edge graphs. In the single layer case, it has been shown that the regular variation of the weight distribution underlying the inhomogeneous random graph implies the regular variation of the typical degree distribution. We extend this correspondence to the multilayer case by showing that the multivariate regular variation of the weight distribution implies the multivariate regular variation of the asymptotic degree distribution. Furthermore, in certain circumstances, the extremal dependence structure present in the weight distribution will be adopted by the asymptotic degree distribution. By considering the asymptotic degree distribution, a wider class of Chung-Lu and Norros-Reittu graphs may be incorporated into the MIRG layers. Additionally, we prove consistency of the Hill estimator when applied to degrees of the MIRG that have a tail index greater than 1. Simulation results indicate that, in practice, hidden regular variation may be consistently detected from an observed MIRG. ",

    "abstract": "Regression methods are fundamental for scientific and technological applications. However, fitted models can be highly unreliable outside of their training domain, and hence the quantification of their uncertainty is crucial in many of their applications. Based on the solution of a constrained optimization problem, we propose \"prediction rigidities\" as a method to obtain uncertainties of arbitrary pre-trained regressors. We establish a strong connection between our framework and Bayesian inference, and we develop a last-layer approximation that allows the new method to be applied to neural networks. This extension affords cheap uncertainties without any modification to the neural network itself or its training procedure. We show the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of regression tasks, ranging from simple toy models to applications in chemistry and meteorology. ",

    "abstract": "Realizing sufficient separability between the distributions of healthy and pathological samples is a critical obstacle for pathology detection convolutional models. Moreover, these models exhibit a bias for contrast-based images, with diminished performance on texture-based medical images. This study introduces the notion of a population-level context for pathology detection and employs a graph theoretic approach to model and incorporate it into the latent code of an autoencoder via a refinement module we term PopuSense. PopuSense seeks to capture additional intra-group variations inherent in biomedical data that a local or global context of the convolutional model might miss or smooth out. Experiments on contrast-based and texture-based images, with minimal adaptation, encounter the existing preference for intensity-based input. Nevertheless, PopuSense demonstrates improved separability in contrast-based images, presenting an additional avenue for refining representations learned by a model. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a framework based on differential privacy (DP) for querying electric power measurements to detect system anomalies or bad data caused by false data injections (FDIs). Our DP approach conceals consumption and system matrix data, while simultaneously enabling an untrusted third party to test hypotheses of anomalies, such as an FDI attack, by releasing a randomized sufficient statistic for hypothesis-testing. We consider a measurement model corrupted by Gaussian noise and a sparse noise vector representing the attack, and we observe that the optimal test statistic is a chi-square random variable. To detect possible attacks, we propose a novel DP chi-square noise mechanism that ensures the test does not reveal private information about power injections or the system matrix. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for detecting FDIs while preserving the privacy of sensitive power system data. ",
