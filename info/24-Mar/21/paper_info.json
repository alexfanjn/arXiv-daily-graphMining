    "abstract": "This paper examines the use of tensor networks, which can efficiently represent high-dimensional quantum states, in language modeling. It is a distillation and continuation of the work done in (van der Poel, 2023). To do so, we will abstract the problem down to modeling Motzkin spin chains, which exhibit long-range correlations reminiscent of those found in language. The Matrix Product State (MPS), also known as the tensor train, has a bond dimension which scales as the length of the sequence it models. To combat this, we use the factored core MPS, whose bond dimension scales sub-linearly. We find that the tensor models reach near perfect classifying ability, and maintain a stable level of performance as the number of valid training examples is decreased. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial patch attacks, crafted to compromise the integrity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), significantly impact Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems designed for object detection and classification tasks. The primary purpose of this work is to defend models against real-world physical attacks that target object detection and classification. We analyze attack techniques and propose a robust defense approach. We successfully reduce model confidence by over 20% using adversarial patch attacks that exploit object shape, texture and position. Leveraging the inpainting pre-processing technique, we effectively restore the original confidence levels, demonstrating the importance of robust defenses in mitigating these threats. Following fine-tuning of an AI model for traffic sign classification, we subjected it to a simulated pixelized patch-based physical adversarial attack, resulting in misclassifications. Our inpainting defense approach significantly enhances model resilience, achieving high accuracy and reliable localization despite the adversarial attacks. This contribution advances the resilience and reliability of object detection and classification networks against adversarial challenges, providing a robust foundation for critical applications. ",

In this paper, we introduce a prompt selection and augmentation algorithm aimed at improving mathematical reasoning and robot arm operations.

This algorithm improves LLM performance by selecting a set of examples that increase diversity, minimize redundancy, and increase relevance to the question. When combined with the Program-of-Thought prompting, our algorithm demonstrates an improvement in performance on the GSM8K and SVAMP benchmarks, with increases of 0.3% and 1.1% respectively. Furthermore, in simulated tabletop environments, our algorithm surpasses the Code-as-Policies approach by achieving a 3.4% increase in successful task completions and a decrease of over 70% in the number of examples used. Its ability to discard examples that contribute little to solving the problem reduces the inferencing time of an LLM-powered robotics system. This algorithm also offers important benefits for industrial process automation by streamlining the development and deployment process, reducing manual programming effort, and enhancing code reusability.

    "abstract": "With the increased use of network technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) in many real-world applications, new types of cyberattacks have been emerging. To safeguard critical infrastructures from these emerging threats, it is crucial to deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that can detect different types of attacks accurately while minimizing false alarms. Machine learning approaches have been used extensively in IDS and they are mainly using flat multi-class classification to differentiate normal traffic and different types of attacks. Though cyberattack types exhibit a hierarchical structure where similar granular attack subtypes can be grouped into more high-level attack types, hierarchical classification approach has not been explored well. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of hierarchical classification approach in IDS. We use a three-level hierarchical classification model to classify various network attacks, where the first level classifies benign or attack, the second level classifies coarse high-level attack types, and the third level classifies a granular level attack types. Our empirical results of using 10 different classification algorithms in 10 different datasets show that there is no significant difference in terms of overall classification performance (i.e., detecting normal and different types of attack correctly) of hierarchical and flat classification approaches. However, flat classification approach misclassify attacks as normal whereas hierarchical approach misclassify one type of attack as another attack type. In other words, the hierarchical classification approach significantly minimises attacks from misclassified as normal traffic, which is more important in critical systems. ",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have been shown to impose severe threats to real security-critical scenarios. Although previous works can achieve high attack success rates, they either require access to victim models which may significantly reduce their threats in practice, or perform visually noticeable in stealthiness. Besides, there is still room to improve the attack success rates in the scenario that different poisoned samples may have different target labels (a.k.a., the all-to-all setting). In this study, we propose a novel imperceptible backdoor attack framework, named Impart, in the scenario where the attacker has no access to the victim model. Specifically, in order to enhance the attack capability of the all-to-all setting, we first propose a label-specific attack. Different from previous works which try to find an imperceptible pattern and add it to the source image as the poisoned image, we then propose to generate perturbations that align with the target label in the image feature by a surrogate model. In this way, the generated poisoned images are attached with knowledge about the target class, which significantly enhances the attack capability. ",

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of deep learning across various domains, concerns about its security have grown significantly. Among these, backdoor attacks pose a serious security threat to deep neural networks (DNNs). In recent years, backdoor attacks on neural networks have become increasingly sophisticated, aiming to compromise the security and trustworthiness of models by implanting hidden, unauthorized functionalities or triggers, leading to misleading predictions or behaviors. To make triggers less perceptible and imperceptible, various invisible backdoor attacks have been proposed. However, most of them only consider invisibility in the spatial domain, making it easy for recent defense methods to detect the generated toxic images.To address these challenges, this paper proposes an invisible backdoor attack called DEBA. DEBA leverages the mathematical properties of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to embed imperceptible backdoors into models during the training phase, thereby causing them to exhibit predefined malicious behavior under specific trigger conditions. Specifically, we first perform SVD on images, and then replace the minor features of trigger images with those of clean images, using them as triggers to ensure the effectiveness of the attack. As minor features are scattered throughout the entire image, the major features of clean images are preserved, making poisoned images visually indistinguishable from clean ones. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that DEBA is highly effective, maintaining high perceptual quality and a high attack success rate for poisoned images. Furthermore, we assess the performance of DEBA under existing defense measures, showing that it is robust and capable of significantly evading and resisting the effects of these defense measures. ",

    "abstract": "Cyber-security attacks pose a significant threat to the operation of autonomous systems. Particularly impacted are the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in smart buildings, which depend on data gathered by sensors and Machine Learning (ML) models using the captured data. As such, attacks that alter the readings of these sensors can severely affect the HVAC system operations impacting residents' comfort and energy reduction goals. Such attacks may induce changes in the online data distribution being fed to the ML models, violating the fundamental assumption of similarity in training and testing data distribution. This leads to a degradation in model prediction accuracy due to a phenomenon known as Concept Drift (CD) - the alteration in the relationship between input features and the target variable. Addressing CD requires identifying the source of drift to apply targeted mitigation strategies, a process termed drift explanation. This paper proposes a Feature Drift Explanation (FDE) module to identify the drifting features. FDE utilizes an Auto-encoder (AE) that reconstructs the activation of the first layer of the regression Deep Learning (DL) model and finds their latent representations. When a drift is detected, each feature of the drifting data is replaced by its representative counterpart from the training data. The Minkowski distance is then used to measure the divergence between the altered drifting data and the original training data. The results show that FDE successfully identifies 85.77 % of drifting features and showcases its utility in the DL adaptation method under the CD phenomenon. As a result, the FDE method is an effective strategy for identifying drifting features towards thwarting cyber-security attacks. ",

Our framework establishes upper bounds on the overall privacy guarantees by utilising two new technical notions: a variant of DP termed Smooth DP and the bounded sensitivity of the pre-processing algorithms. In addition to the generic framework, we provide explicit overall privacy guarantees for multiple data-dependent pre-processing algorithms, such as data imputation, quantization, deduplication and PCA, when used in combination with several DP algorithms. Notably, this framework is also simple to implement, allowing direct integration into existing DP pipelines. ",

Based on the observation that point tracking bears a great resemblance to object detection and tracking, we borrow designs from DETR-like algorithms to address the task of TAP. In the proposed framework, in each video frame, each tracking point is represented as a point query, which consists of a positional part and a content part. As in DETR, each query (its position and content feature) is naturally updated layer by layer. Its visibility is predicted by its updated content feature. Queries belonging to the same tracking point can exchange information through self-attention along the temporal dimension. As all such operations are well-designed in DETR-like algorithms, the model is conceptually very simple. We also adopt some useful designs such as cost volume from optical flow models and develop simple designs to provide long temporal information while mitigating the feature drifting issue. Our framework demonstrates strong performance with state-of-the-art performance on various TAP datasets with faster inference speed. ",

Building on this, we extend the RailSem19 dataset with ego-path annotations, facilitating further research in this direction. At the heart of our study lies TEP-Net, an end-to-end deep learning framework tailored for ego-path detection, featuring a configurable model architecture, a dynamic data augmentation strategy, and a domain-specific loss function. Leveraging a regression-based approach, TEP-Net outperforms SOTA: while addressing the track detection problem in a more nuanced way than previously, our model achieves 97.5% IoU on the test set and is faster than all existing methods. Further comparative analysis highlights the relevance of the conceptual choices behind TEP-Net, demonstrating its inherent propensity for robustness across diverse environmental conditions and operational dynamics.

However, although system optimization substantially influences the performance of SFL under resource-constrained systems, the problem remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we provide a convergence analysis of SFL which quantifies the impact of model splitting (MS) and client-side model aggregation (MA) on the learning performance, serving as a theoretical foundation. Then, we propose AdaptSFL, a novel resource-adaptive SFL framework, to expedite SFL under resource-constrained edge computing systems. Specifically, AdaptSFL adaptively controls client-side MA and MS to balance communication-computing latency and training convergence. Extensive simulations across various datasets validate that our proposed AdaptSFL framework takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy than benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.

In such systems, topology and node functionality of the network are randomly initialized. To create a network that solves a task, weights are applied to output nodes and learning is achieved by adjusting those weights with conventional machine learning methods. However, performance is often limited compared to networks where all parameters are learned. Herein, we explore an alternative learning approach for unclocked, recurrent networks in FPGAs. We use evolutionary computation to evolve the Boolean functions of network nodes. In one type of implementation the output nodes are used directly to perform a task and all learning is via evolution of the network's node functions. In a second type of implementation a back-end classifier is used as in traditional reservoir computing. In that case, both evolution of node functions and adjustment of output node weights contribute to learning. We demonstrate the practicality of node function evolution, obtaining an accuracy improvement of ~30% on an image classification task while processing at a rate of over three million samples per second. We additionally demonstrate evolvability of network memory and dynamic output signals. ",

PSO-Fed reduces the communication load by enabling clients to exchange only a fraction of their model estimates with the server at each update round. Partial sharing of model estimates also enhances the robustness of the algorithm against model-poisoning attacks. To gain better insights into this phenomenon, we analyze the performance of the PSO-Fed algorithm in the presence of Byzantine clients, malicious actors who may subtly tamper with their local models by adding noise before sharing them with the server. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that PSO-Fed maintains convergence in both mean and mean-square senses, even under the strain of model-poisoning attacks. We further derive the theoretical mean square error (MSE) of PSO-Fed, linking it to various parameters such as stepsize, attack probability, number of Byzantine clients, client participation rate, partial-sharing ratio, and noise variance. We also show that there is a non-trivial optimal stepsize for PSO-Fed when faced with model-poisoning attacks. The results of our extensive numerical experiments affirm our theoretical assertions and highlight the superior ability of PSO-Fed to counteract Byzantine attacks, outperforming other related leading algorithms.

Despite this, the adoption of label noise management remains limited, and label noise is largely ignored. To this end, there is a critical need to conduct a scoping review focusing on the problem space. This scoping review aims to comprehensively review label noise management in deep learning-based medical prediction problems, which includes label noise detection, label noise handling, and evaluation. Research involving label uncertainty is also included. Methods: Our scoping review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched 4 databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and Semantic Scholar. Our search terms include \"noisy label AND medical / healthcare / clinical\", \"un-certainty AND medical / healthcare / clinical\", and \"noise AND medical / healthcare / clinical\". Results: A total of 60 papers met inclusion criteria between 2016 and 2023. A series of practical questions in medical research are investigated. These include the sources of label noise, the impact of label noise, the detection of label noise, label noise handling techniques, and their evaluation. Categorization of both label noise detection methods and handling techniques are provided. Discussion: From a methodological perspective, we observe that the medical community has been up to date with the broader deep-learning community, given that most techniques have been evaluated on medical data. We recommend considering label noise as a standard element in medical research, even if it is not dedicated to handling noisy labels. Initial experiments can start with easy-to-implement methods, such as noise-robust loss functions, weighting, and curriculum learning. ",

First, we release a comprehensive data set that encompasses both clean accuracy and robust accuracy for a vast array of adversarially trained networks from the NAS-Bench-201 search space on image datasets. Then, leveraging the neural tangent kernel (NTK) tool from deep learning theory, we establish a generalization theory for searching architecture in terms of clean accuracy and robust accuracy under multi-objective adversarial training. We firmly believe that our benchmark and theoretical insights will significantly benefit the NAS community through reliable reproducibility, efficient assessment, and theoretical foundation, particularly in the pursuit of robust architectures.

    "title": "Multi-fidelity surrogate with heterogeneous input spaces for modeling  melt pools in laser-directed energy deposition",
    "abstract": "Multi-fidelity (MF) modeling is a powerful statistical approach that can intelligently blend data from varied fidelity sources. This approach finds a compelling application in predicting melt pool geometry for laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED). One major challenge in using MF surrogates to merge a hierarchy of melt pool models is the variability in input spaces. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel approach for constructing an MF surrogate for predicting melt pool geometry by integrating models of varying complexity, that operate on heterogeneous input spaces. The first thermal model incorporates five input parameters i.e., laser power, scan velocity, powder flow rate, carrier gas flow rate, and nozzle height. In contrast, the second thermal model can only handle laser power and scan velocity. A mapping is established between the heterogeneous input spaces so that the five-dimensional space can be morphed into a pseudo two-dimensional space. Predictions are then blended using a Gaussian process-based co-kriging method. The resulting heterogeneous multi-fidelity Gaussian process (Het-MFGP) surrogate not only improves predictive accuracy but also offers computational efficiency by reducing evaluations required from the high-dimensional, high-fidelity thermal model. The results underscore the benefits of employing Het-MFGP for modeling melt pool behavior in L-DED. The framework successfully demonstrates how to leverage multimodal data and handle scenarios where certain input parameters may be difficult to model or measure. ",

While model merging has emerged as a promising approach for LLM development due to its cost-effectiveness, it currently relies on human intuition and domain knowledge, limiting its potential. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach that overcomes this limitation by automatically discovering effective combinations of diverse open-source models, harnessing their collective intelligence without requiring extensive additional training data or compute. Our approach operates in both parameter space and data flow space, allowing for optimization beyond just the weights of the individual models. This approach even facilitates cross-domain merging, generating models like a Japanese LLM with Math reasoning capabilities. Surprisingly, our Japanese Math LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of established Japanese LLM benchmarks, even surpassing models with significantly more parameters, despite not being explicitly trained for such tasks. Furthermore, a culturally-aware Japanese VLM generated through our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in describing Japanese culture-specific content, outperforming previous Japanese VLMs. This work not only contributes new state-of-the-art models back to the open-source community, but also introduces a new paradigm for automated model composition, paving the way for exploring alternative, efficient approaches to foundation model development.

Instead of sending the raw data, our approach requires users to send a 3D representation, distributing the high computation cost of training centralized NeRFs between the users. It learns photorealistic scene representations by decomposing users' 3D views into personal and global NeRFs and a novel optimally weighted aggregation of only the latter. We validate the advantage of our approach to learn NeRFs with photorealism and minimal server computation cost on structured synthetic and real-world photo tourism datasets. We further analyze how secure aggregation of global NeRFs in DecentNeRF minimizes the undesired reconstruction of personal content by the server. ",

In response to the need for effective coordination of EVs within the distribution network, this paper presents a safety-aware reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to manage EV charging stations while ensuring the satisfaction of system constraints. Unlike existing methods, our proposed algorithm does not rely on explicit penalties for constraint violations, eliminating the need for penalty coefficient tuning. Furthermore, managing EV charging stations is further complicated by multiple uncertainties, notably the variability in solar energy generation and energy prices. To address this challenge, we develop an off-policy RL algorithm to efficiently utilize data to learn patterns in such uncertain environments. Our algorithm also incorporates a maximum entropy framework to enhance the RL algorithm's exploratory process, preventing convergence to local optimal solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional RL algorithms in managing EV charging in the distribution network. ",

In this paper, we design a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based reliable block propagation optimization framework for blockchain-enabled Web 3.0. We first innovatively apply a data-freshness metric called age of information to measure block propagation efficiency in public blockchains. To achieve the reliability of block propagation, we introduce a reputation mechanism based on the subjective logic model, including the local and recommended opinions to calculate the miner reputation value. Moreover, considering that the GAT possesses the excellent ability to process graph-structured data, we utilize the GAT with reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal block propagation trajectory. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits the most outstanding block propagation efficiency and reliability compared with traditional routing algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Given data with noisy labels, over-parameterized deep networks suffer overfitting mislabeled data, resulting in poor generalization. The memorization effect of deep networks shows that although the networks have the ability to memorize all noisy data, they would first memorize clean training data, and then gradually memorize mislabeled training data. A simple and effective method that exploits the memorization effect to combat noisy labels is early stopping. However, early stopping cannot distinguish the memorization of clean data and mislabeled data, resulting in the network still inevitably overfitting mislabeled data in the early training stage.In this paper, to decouple the memorization of clean data and mislabeled data, and further reduce the side effect of mislabeled data, we perform additive decomposition on network parameters. Namely, all parameters are additively decomposed into two groups, i.e., parameters $\\mathbf{w}$ are decomposed as $\\mathbf{w}=\\bm{\\sigma}+\\bm{\\gamma}$. Afterward, the parameters $\\bm{\\sigma}$ are considered to memorize clean data, while the parameters $\\bm{\\gamma}$ are considered to memorize mislabeled data. Benefiting from the memorization effect, the updates of the parameters $\\bm{\\sigma}$ are encouraged to fully memorize clean data in early training, and then discouraged with the increase of training epochs to reduce interference of mislabeled data. The updates of the parameters $\\bm{\\gamma}$ are the opposite. In testing, only the parameters $\\bm{\\sigma}$ are employed to enhance generalization. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks confirm the superior performance of our method. ",

However, research on detecting pornographic language within human-machine interaction dialogues is an important subject that is rarely studied. To advance in this direction, we introduce CensorChat, a dialogue monitoring dataset aimed at detecting whether the dialogue session contains pornographic content. To this end, we collect real-life human-machine interaction dialogues in the wild and break them down into single utterances and single-turn dialogues, with the last utterance spoken by the chatbot. We propose utilizing knowledge distillation of large language models to annotate the dataset. Specifically, first, the raw dataset is annotated by four open-source large language models, with the majority vote determining the label. Second, we use ChatGPT to update the empty label from the first step. Third, to ensure the quality of the validation and test sets, we utilize GPT-4 for label calibration. If the current label does not match the one generated by GPT-4, we employ a self-criticism strategy to verify its correctness. Finally, to facilitate the detection of pornographic text, we develop a series of text classifiers using a pseudo-labeled dataset. Detailed data analysis demonstrates that leveraging knowledge distillation techniques with large language models provides a practical and cost-efficient method for developing pornographic text detectors.

Compared to the vannila CNN, FDY requires several times more parameters. In this paper, a more efficient solution named frequency-aware convolution (FAC) is proposed. In FAC, frequency-positional information is encoded in a vector and added to the input spectrogram. To match the amplitude of input, the encoding vector is scaled adaptively and channel-independently. Experiments are carried out in the context of DCASE 2022 task 4, and the results demonstrate that FAC can achieve comparable performance to that of FDY with only 515 additional parameters, while FDY requires 8.02 million additional parameters.

Although effective, these methods rely on weak annotations or additional multi-modal data like images, and the potential benefits inherent in the point cloud sequence are still underexplored. To this end, we explore the feasibility of self-supervised motion prediction with only unlabeled LiDAR point clouds. Initially, we employ an optimal transport solver to establish coarse correspondences between current and future point clouds as the coarse pseudo motion labels. Training models directly using such coarse labels leads to noticeable spatial and temporal prediction inconsistencies. To mitigate these issues, we introduce three simple spatial and temporal regularization losses, which facilitate the self-supervised training process effectively.

We propose a novel multi-robot optimal planning algorithm that integrates mutual observations and introduces reachability constraints for enhanced security. This ensures that, even with adversarial movements, compromised robots cannot breach forbidden regions without missing scheduled co-observations. The reachability constraint uses ellipsoidal over-approximation for efficient intersection checking and gradient computation. To enhance system resilience and tackle feasibility challenges, we also introduce sub-teams. These cohesive units replace individual robot assignments along each route, enabling redundant robots to deviate for co-observations across different trajectories, securing multiple sub-teams without requiring modifications. We formulate the cross-trajectory co-observation plan by solving a network flow coverage problem on the checkpoint graph generated from the original unsecured MRS trajectories, providing the same security guarantees against plan-deviation attacks.

The primary overhead of GNN update stems from graph propagation and weight transformation, both involving operations on graph-scale matrices. Previous studies attempt to reduce the computational budget by leveraging graph-level or network-level sparsification techniques, resulting in downsized graph or weights. In this work, we propose Unifews, which unifies the two operations in an entry-wise manner considering individual matrix elements, and conducts joint edge-weight sparsification to enhance learning efficiency. The entry-wise design of Unifews enables adaptive compression across GNN layers with progressively increased sparsity, and is applicable to a variety of architectural designs with on-the-fly operation simplification. Theoretically, we establish a novel framework to characterize sparsified GNN learning in view of a graph optimization process, and prove that Unifews effectively approximates the learning objective with bounded error and reduced computational load. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our method in diverse settings. Unifews is advantageous in jointly removing more than 90% of edges and weight entries with comparable or better accuracy than baseline models. The sparsification offers remarkable efficiency improvements including 10-20x matrix operation reduction and up to 100x acceleration in graph propagation time for the largest graph at the billion-edge scale.

This technique empowers the model to autonomously devise \"solution plans\" to tackle intricate programming challenges, thereby improving its performance in code generation. Nevertheless, smaller models have been struggling to keep up with LLMs in deducing these plans, adversely affecting their code generation capabilities. Given the considerable size and associated deployment costs, along with concerns about data security, many teams opt for deploying smaller models for code generation. Consequently, there arises a compelling need for transferring LLMs' code generation reasoning abilities to the smaller models. In this paper, we propose the CodePLAN framework, which aims to transfer LLMs' reasoning capabilities to smaller models through distillation. We adopt a multi-task learning approach, jointly undertaking code generation and solution plan generation tasks, to enhance the code generation capabilities of the smaller model. To ensure the superior quality of the solution plans, we advocate for the utilization of backward reasoning and plan sampling strategies. Our experiments show that in comparison to the conventional fine-tuning approach, our approach improves the smaller model's code generation performance (measured in pass@1 metric) by over 130% on the challenging APPS benchmark.

There is a gap in the present literature in computationally analyzing how community members discuss the strengths and needs of the community. To address this gap, we introduce the task of identifying, extracting, and categorizing community needs and assets from conversational data using sophisticated natural language processing methods. To facilitate this task, we introduce the first dataset about community needs and assets consisting of 3,511 conversations from Reddit, annotated using crowdsourced workers. Using this dataset, we evaluate an utterance-level classification model compared to sentiment classification and a popular large language model (in a zero-shot setting), where we find that our model outperforms both baselines at an F1 score of 94% compared to 49% and 61% respectively. Furthermore, we observe through our study that conversations about needs have negative sentiments and emotions, while conversations about assets focus on location and entities.

    "abstract": "In the robot follow-ahead task, a mobile robot is tasked to maintain its relative position in front of a moving human actor while keeping the actor in sight. To accomplish this task, it is important that the robot understand the full 3D pose of the human (since the head orientation can be different than the torso) and predict future human poses so as to plan accordingly. This prediction task is especially tricky in a complex environment with junctions and multiple corridors. In this work, we address the problem of forecasting the full 3D trajectory of a human in such environments. Our main insight is to show that one can first predict the 2D trajectory and then estimate the full 3D trajectory by conditioning the estimator on the predicted 2D trajectory. With this approach, we achieve results comparable or better than the state-of-the-art methods three times faster. As part of our contribution, we present a new dataset where, in contrast to existing datasets, the human motion is in a much larger area than a single room. We also present a complete robot system that integrates our human pose forecasting network on the mobile robot to enable real-time robot follow-ahead and present results from real-world experiments in multiple buildings on campus.

Conventional methods for OOD detection that rely on single-modal information, often struggle to capture the rich variety of OOD instances. The primary difficulty in OOD detection arises when an input image has numerous similarities to a particular class in the in-distribution (ID) dataset, e.g., wolf to dog, causing the model to misclassify it. Nevertheless, it may be easy to distinguish these classes in the semantic domain. To this end, in this paper, a novel method called ODPC is proposed, in which specific prompts to generate OOD peer classes of ID semantics are designed by a large language model as an auxiliary modality to facilitate detection. Moreover, a contrastive loss based on OOD peer classes is devised to learn compact representations of ID classes and improve the clarity of boundaries between different classes. The extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that the method we propose can yield state-of-the-art results. ",

    "abstract": "As an essential task in autonomous driving (AD), motion prediction aims to predict the future states of surround objects for navigation. One natural solution is to estimate the position of other agents in a step-by-step manner where each predicted time-step is conditioned on both observed time-steps and previously predicted time-steps, i.e., autoregressive prediction. Pioneering works like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition. However, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps are independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single linear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously. They dominate most motion prediction leaderboards due to the simplicity of training MLPs compared to autoregressive networks. In this paper, we introduce the GPT style next token prediction into motion forecasting. In this way, the input and output could be represented in a unified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible. However, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units -words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal and semantic relations. To this end, we propose to adopt three factorized attention modules with different neighbors for information aggregation and different position encoding styles to capture their relations, e.g., encoding the transformation between coordinate systems for spatial relativity while adopting RoPE for temporal relativity. Empirically, by equipping with the aforementioned tailored designs, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Waymo Open Motion and Waymo Interaction datasets. Notably, AMP outperforms other recent autoregressive motion prediction methods: MotionLM and StateTransformer, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed designs. ",

Our results revealed that single transformer-based classifiers achieved decent performance on in-distribution dataset but limited generalization ability on out-of-distribution dataset. To improve it, we combined the individual classifiers models using adaptive ensemble algorithms, which improved the average accuracy significantly from 91.8% to 99.2% on an in-distribution test set and from 62.9% to 72.5% on an out-of-distribution test set.

Unfortunately, synthesizing novel views remains to be a challenge for input views with heterogeneous brightness level captured under low-light condition. The condition is pretty common in the real world. It causes low-contrast images where details are concealed in the darkness and camera sensor noise significantly degrades the image quality. To tackle this problem, we propose to learn to decompose illumination, reflectance, and noise from input views according to that reflectance remains invariant across heterogeneous views. To cope with heterogeneous brightness and noise levels across multi-views, we learn an illumination embedding and optimize a noise map individually for each view. To allow intuitive editing of the illumination, we design an illumination adjustment module to enable either brightening or darkening of the illumination component. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that this approach enables effective intrinsic decomposition for low-light multi-view noisy images and achieves superior visual quality and numerical performance for synthesizing novel views compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Traditional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T1-MRI) research focus on identifying brain atrophy regions but often fails to address the intricate connectivity between them. This limitation underscores the necessity of focuing on inter-regional connectivity for a comprehensive understand of the brain's complex network. Moreover, there is a pressing demand for methods that adaptively preserve and extract critical information, particularly specialized subgraph mining techniques for brain networks. These are essential for developing high-quality feature representations that reveal critical spatial impacts of structural brain changes and its topology. In this paper, we propose Brain-SubGNN, a novel graph representation network to mine and enhance critical subgraphs based on T1-MRI. This network provides a subgraph-level interpretation, enhancing interpretability and insights for graph analysis. The process begins by extracting node features and a correlation matrix between nodes to construct a task-oriented brain network. Brain-SubGNN then adaptively identifies and enhances critical subgraphs, capturing both loop and neighbor subgraphs. This method reflects the loop topology and local changes, indicative of long-range connections, and maintains local and global brain attributes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and advantages of Brain-SubGNN, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for understanding and diagnosing early-stage dementia.

In this paper, we propose a secure control scheme for computing linear quadratic control in a networked control system utilizing two networked controllers, a privacy encoder and a control restorer. Specifically, the encoder generates two state signals blurred with random noise and sends them to the controllers, while the restorer reconstructs the correct control signal. The proposed design effectively preserves the privacy of the control system's state without sacrificing the control performance. We theoretically quantify the privacy-preserving performance in terms of the state estimation error of the controllers and the disclosure probability. Additionally, the proposed privacy-preserving scheme is also proven to satisfy differential privacy. Moreover, we extend the proposed privacy-preserving scheme and evaluation method to cases where collusion between two controllers occurs.

For such a challenging task, popular normalizing flow (NF) based AD methods may fall into a \"homogeneous mapping\" issue,where the NF-based AD models are biased to generate similar latent representations for both normal and abnormal features, and thereby lead to a high missing rate of anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Gaussian mixture normalizing flow modeling method for accomplishing unified Anomaly Detection, which we call HGAD. Our HGAD consists of two key components: inter-class Gaussian mixture modeling and intra-class mixed class centers learning. Compared to the previous NF-based AD methods, the hierarchical Gaussian mixture modeling approach can bring stronger representation capability to the latent space of normalizing flows, so that even complex multi-class distribution can be well represented and learned in the latent space. In this way, we can avoid mapping different class distributions into the same single Gaussian prior, thus effectively avoiding or mitigating the \"homogeneous mapping\" issue. We further indicate that the more distinguishable different class centers, the more conducive to avoiding the bias issue. Thus, we further propose a mutual information maximization loss for better structuring the latent feature space. We evaluate our method on four real-world AD benchmarks, where we can significantly improve the previous NF-based AD methods and also outperform the SOTA unified AD methods. ",

Thus, we aim to address this gap by creating a novel corpus and developing a model for prompt-based manipulation of voice characteristics in text-to-speech synthesis, facilitating a broader range of voice characteristics.

This involves automatically gathering voice-related speech data from the Internet, ensuring its quality, and manually annotating it using crowdsourcing. We implement this method with Japanese language data and analyze the results to validate its effectiveness. Subsequently, we propose a construction method of the model to retrieve speech from voice characteristics descriptions based on a contrastive learning method. We train the model using not only conservative contrastive learning but also feature prediction learning to predict quantitative speech features corresponding to voice characteristics.

We rely on a large-scale two-week long field experiment (from 1/19/2023 to 2/3/2023) on 28,457 Twitter users. We created 28 bots utilizing GPT-2 that replied to users tweeting about sports, entertainment, or lifestyle with a contextual reply containing two hardcoded elements: a URL to the topic-relevant section of quality news organization and an encouragement to follow its Twitter account. To further test differential effects by gender of the bots, treated users were randomly assigned to receive responses by bots presented as female or male. We examine whether our over-time intervention enhances the following of news media organization, the sharing and the liking of news content and the tweeting about politics and the liking of political content. We find that the treated users followed more news accounts and the users in the female bot treatment were more likely to like news content than the control. Most of these results, however, were small in magnitude and confined to the already politically interested Twitter users, as indicated by their pre-treatment tweeting about politics. These findings have implications for social media and news organizations, and also offer direction for future work on how Large Language Models and other computational interventions can effectively enhance individual on-platform engagement with quality news and public affairs.

We evaluate both models on their linearization accuracy and capability to capture both fast and slow dynamic system responses. We then select the most suitable model for estimation purposes, and integrate it within a moving horizon estimator. This estimator is formulated as a convex quadratic program, to facilitate robust, real-time centroidal state estimation. Through extensive simulation experiments on a quadruped robot executing various dynamic gaits, our data-driven framework outperforms conventional filtering techniques based on nonlinear dynamics. Our estimator addresses challenges posed by force/torque measurement noise in highly dynamic motions and accurately recovers the centroidal states, demonstrating the adaptability and effectiveness of the Koopman-based linear representation for complex locomotive behaviors. Importantly, our model based on dynamic mode decomposition, trained with two locomotion patterns (trot and jump), successfully estimates the centroidal states for a different motion (bound) without retraining.

This may lead to incorrect instance-level classification. We propose a counting network trained to produce the bag-level majority labels estimated by counting the number of instances for each class. This led to the consistency of the majority class between the network outputs and one obtained by counting the number of instances. Experimental results show that our counting network outperforms conventional MIL methods on four datasets The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Shiku-Kaito/Counting-Network-for-Learning-from-Majority-Label.

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) has garnered significant research attention in the field of remote sensing due to its ability to reduce the dependency on large amounts of annotated data. However, two challenges persist in this area: (1) axis-aligned proposals, which can result in misalignment for arbitrarily oriented objects, and (2) the scarcity of annotated data still limits the performance for unseen object categories. To address these issues, we propose a novel FSOD method for remote sensing images called Few-shot Oriented object detection with Memorable Contrastive learning (FOMC). Specifically, we employ oriented bounding boxes instead of traditional horizontal bounding boxes to learn a better feature representation for arbitrary-oriented aerial objects, leading to enhanced detection performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address oriented object detection in the few-shot setting for remote sensing images. To address the challenging issue of object misclassification, we introduce a supervised contrastive learning module with a dynamically updated memory bank. This module enables the use of large batches of negative samples and enhances the model's capability to learn discriminative features for unseen classes. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the DOTA and HRSC2016 datasets, and our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the few-shot oriented object detection task. Code and pretrained models will be released. ",

    "abstract": "Depth-based 3D hand pose estimation is an important but challenging research task in human-machine interaction community. Recently, dense regression methods have attracted increasing attention in 3D hand pose estimation task, which provide a low computational burden and high accuracy regression way by densely regressing hand joint offset maps. However, large-scale regression offset values are often affected by noise and outliers, leading to a significant drop in accuracy. To tackle this, we re-formulate 3D hand pose estimation as a dense ordinal regression problem and propose a novel Dense Ordinal Regression 3D Pose Network (DOR3D-Net). Specifically, we first decompose offset value regression into sub-tasks of binary classifications with ordinal constraints. Then, each binary classifier can predict the probability of a binary spatial relationship relative to joint, which is easier to train and yield much lower level of noise. The estimated hand joint positions are inferred by aggregating the ordinal regression results at local positions with a weighted sum. Furthermore, both joint regression loss and ordinal regression loss are used to train our DOR3D-Net in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on public datasets (ICVL, MSRA, NYU and HANDS2017) show that our design provides significant improvements over SOTA methods. ",

First, cell migration in a consecutive frame is large since they move their head during scanning. Second, cell detection is often inconsistent in consecutive frames due to touching cells and low-contrast images, and these inconsistent detections affect the tracking performance worse. In this paper, we propose a cell tracking method to address these issues, which has two main contributions. First, we introduce cell position heatmap-based non-rigid alignment with test-time fine-tuning, which can warp the detected points to near the positions at the next frame. Second, we propose a pairwise detection method, which uses the information of detection results at the previous frame for detecting cells at the current frame.

We first investigate whether long-content transcriptions can improve the vanilla conformer transducer (C-T) models. Our experiments indicate that the vanilla C-T models do not exhibit improved performance when utilizing long-content transcriptions, possibly due to the predictor network of C-T models not functioning as a pure language model. Instead, FNT shows its potential in utilizing long-content information, where we propose the LongFNT model and explore the impact of long-content information in both text (LongFNT-Text) and speech (LongFNT-Speech). The proposed LongFNT-Text and LongFNT-Speech models further complement each other to achieve better performance, with transcription history proving more valuable to the model. The effectiveness of our LongFNT approach is evaluated on LibriSpeech and GigaSpeech corpora, and obtains relative 19% and 12% word error rate reduction, respectively. Furthermore, we extend the LongFNT model to the streaming scenario, which is named SLongFNT , consisting of SLongFNT-Text and SLongFNT-Speech approaches to utilize long-content text and speech information. Experiments show that the proposed SLongFNT model achieves relative 26% and 17% WER reduction on LibriSpeech and GigaSpeech respectively while keeping a good latency, compared to the FNT baseline. Overall, our proposed LongFNT and SLongFNT highlight the significance of considering long-content speech and transcription knowledge for improving both non-streaming and streaming speech recognition systems.

Setting the Kuramoto model into the context of dynamic consensus and making use of the $n$th order discrete average consensus algorithm, this paper extends the standard Kuramoto model in such a way that frequency and phase synchronization are separated. This in turn leads to an algorithm achieve the required frequency and phase synchronization also for a finite number of agents. Simulations show the viability of this extended Kuramoto model. ",

The complexity of these questions have been investigated recently from a practical point of view and approximated by heuristic algorithms. We complement these achievements by giving a theoretical framework that enables us to interchange security and efficiency questions in neural networks and analyze their computational complexities.

Our method takes inspiration from the unique \"fingerprints\" that image generation processes consistently introduce into the frequency domain. These fingerprints manifest as structured and distinctly recognizable frequency patterns. We propose to train detectors using only pristine images injecting in part of them crafted frequency patterns, simulating the effects of various deepfake generation techniques without being specific to any. These synthetic patterns are based on generic shapes, grids, or auras. We evaluated our approach using diverse architectures across 25 different generation methods. The models trained with our approach were able to perform state-of-the-art deepfake detection, demonstrating also superior generalization capabilities in comparison with previous methods. Indeed, they are untied to any specific generation technique and can effectively identify deepfakes regardless of how they were made. ",

In this work, we proposed that the influence of token entropy should be fully considered in the watermark detection process, that is, the weight of each token should be adjusted according to its entropy during watermark detection, rather than setting the weight of all tokens to the same value as in previous methods. Specifically, we proposed an Entropy-based Watermark Detection (EWD) that gives higher-entropy tokens higher weights during watermark detection, so as to better reflect the degree of watermarking. Furthermore, the proposed detection process is training-free and fully automated. %In actual detection, we use a proxy-LLM to calculate the entropy of each token, without the need to use the original LLM. In the experiment, we found that our method can achieve better detection performance in low-entropy scenarios, and our method is also general and can be applied to texts with different entropy distributions.

While different approaches have been explored to interface LLMs with ``perceptual backbones'' that process, e.g., visual or audio data, they are often explored for different tasks, different datasets, and using different perceptual backbones and language models, hindering direct comparison of the interfacing mechanisms. To remedy this lack of comparability between methods, we present an extensive experimental evaluation of different interfacing mechanisms, across multiple tasks (including image, video, and audio captioning as well as visual question answering), datasets and backbones, paying special attention to low-data settings.

Compared with its counterpart (replay-based CIL) that stores historical samples, the EFCIL suffers more from forgetting issues under the exemplar-free constraint. In this paper, inspired by the recently developed analytic learning (AL) based CIL, we propose a representation enhanced analytic learning (REAL) for EFCIL. The REAL constructs a dual-stream base pretraining (DS-BPT) and a representation enhancing distillation (RED) process to enhance the representation of the extractor. The DS-BPT pretrains model in streams of both supervised learning and self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) for base knowledge extraction. The RED process distills the supervised knowledge to the SSCL pretrained backbone and facilitates a subsequent AL-basd CIL that converts the CIL to a recursive least-square problem. Our method addresses the issue of insufficient discriminability in representations of unseen data caused by a frozen backbone in the existing AL-based CIL. Empirical results on various datasets including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1k, demonstrate that our REAL outperforms the state-of-the-arts in EFCIL, and achieves comparable or even more superior performance compared with the replay-based methods.

While effective, these methods exhibit certain limitations, such as missing novel objects in 3D box estimation or applying rigorous priors, leading to biases towards objects near the camera or of rectangular geometries. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a universal \\textsc{Find n' Propagate} approach for 3D OV tasks, aimed at maximizing the recall of novel objects and propagating this detection capability to more distant areas thereby progressively capturing more. In particular, we utilize a greedy box seeker to search against 3D novel boxes of varying orientations and depth in each generated frustum and ensure the reliability of newly identified boxes by cross alignment and density ranker. Additionally, the inherent bias towards camera-proximal objects is alleviated by the proposed remote simulator, which randomly diversifies pseudo-labeled novel instances in the self-training process, combined with the fusion of base samples in the memory bank. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 53% improvement in novel recall across diverse OV settings, VLMs, and 3D detectors. Notably, we achieve up to a 3.97-fold increase in Average Precision (AP) for novel object classes. The source code is made available in the supplementary material. ",

    "abstract": "As Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), a popular approach for code intelligence, continue to grow in size, the computational cost of their usage has become prohibitively expensive. Prompt learning, a recent development in the field of natural language processing, emerges as a potential solution to address this challenge. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of prompt learning in code intelligence tasks. We unveil its reliance on manually designed prompts, which often require significant human effort and expertise. Moreover, we discover existing automatic prompt design methods are very limited to code intelligence tasks due to factors including gradient dependence, high computational demands, and limited applicability. To effectively address both issues, we propose Genetic Auto Prompt (GenAP), which utilizes an elaborate genetic algorithm to automatically design prompts. With GenAP, non-experts can effortlessly generate superior prompts compared to meticulously manual-designed ones. GenAP operates without the need for gradients or additional computational costs, rendering it gradient-free and cost-effective. Moreover, GenAP supports both understanding and generation types of code intelligence tasks, exhibiting great applicability. We conduct GenAP on three popular code intelligence PLMs with three canonical code intelligence tasks including defect prediction, code summarization, and code translation. The results suggest that GenAP can effectively automate the process of designing prompts. Specifically, GenAP outperforms all other methods across all three tasks (e.g., improving accuracy by an average of 2.13% for defect prediction). To the best of our knowledge, GenAP is the first work to automatically design prompts for code intelligence PLMs. ",

In our previous work, we have shown that Bayesian Physics-informed Neural Networks (BPINNs) outperform conventional system identification methods in identifying the power system dynamic behavior under measurement noise. This paper takes the next natural step and addresses the more significant challenge, exploring how BPINN perform in estimating power system dynamics under increasing uncertainty from many Inverter-based Resources (IBRs) connected to the grid. These introduce a different type of uncertainty, compared to noisy measurements. The BPINN combines the advantages of Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), such as inverse problem applicability, with Bayesian approaches for uncertainty quantification. We explore the BPINN performance on a wide range of systems, starting from a single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system and 3-bus system to extract important insights, to the 14-bus CIGRE distribution grid, and the large IEEE 118-bus system. We also investigate approaches that can accelerate the BPINN training, such as pretraining and transfer learning. Throughout this paper, we show that in presence of uncertainty, the BPINN achieves orders of magnitude lower errors than the widely popular method for system identification SINDy and significantly lower errors than PINN, while transfer learning helps reduce training time by up to 80 %.

Current prevailing CSI feedback approaches improve precision by employing advanced deep-learning methods to learn representative CSI features for a subsequent compression process. Diverging from previous works, we treat the CSI compression problem in the context of implicit neural representations. Specifically, each CSI matrix is viewed as a neural function that maps the CSI coordinates (antenna number and subchannel) to the corresponding channel gains. Instead of transmitting the parameters of the implicit neural functions directly, we transmit modulations based on the CSI matrix derived through a meta-learning algorithm. Modulations are then applied to a shared base network to generate the elements of the CSI matrix. Modulations corresponding to the CSI matrix are quantized and entropy-coded to further reduce the communication bandwidth, thus achieving extreme CSI compression ratios. Numerical results show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and showcases flexibility in feedback strategies. ",

    "abstract": "Long-term human motion prediction (LHMP) is essential for safely operating autonomous robots and vehicles in populated environments. It is fundamental for various applications, including motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction and safety monitoring. However, accurate prediction of human trajectories is challenging due to complex factors, including, for example, social norms and environmental conditions. The influence of such factors can be captured through Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial motion patterns learned from (possibly scattered and partial) past observations of motion in the environment and which can be used for data-efficient, interpretable motion prediction (MoD-LHMP). To address the limitations of prior work, especially regarding accuracy and sensitivity to anomalies in long-term prediction, we propose the Laminar Component Enhanced LHMP approach (LaCE-LHMP). Our approach is inspired by data-driven airflow modelling, which estimates laminar and turbulent flow components and uses predominantly the laminar components to make flow predictions. Based on the hypothesis that human trajectory patterns also manifest laminar flow (that represents predictable motion) and turbulent flow components (that reflect more unpredictable and arbitrary motion), LaCE-LHMP extracts the laminar patterns in human dynamics and uses them for human motion prediction. We demonstrate the superior prediction performance of LaCE-LHMP through benchmark comparisons with state-of-the-art LHMP methods, offering an unconventional perspective and a more intuitive understanding of human movement patterns.

At the core of our method is a Siamese convolutional neural encoder that learns the user embeddings by contrasting the image and personal saliency map pairs of different users. Evaluations on two public saliency datasets show that the generated embeddings have high discriminative power, are effective at refining universal saliency maps to the individual users, and generalise well across users and images. Finally, based on our model's ability to encode individual user characteristics, our work points towards other applications that can benefit from reusable embeddings of gaze behaviour. ",

This paper provides a revisit to the fundamental results. In particular, counterexamples to the most basic min-plus service models, which have been proposed for TSNs and used for computing delay bounds, indicate that the packetization effect has often been overlooked. To address, the max-plus branch of NC is also considered in this paper, whose models handle packetized traffic more explicitly. It is found that mapping the min-plus models to the max-plus models may bring in an immediate improvement over delay bounds derived from the min-plus analysis. In addition, an integrated analytical approach that combines models from both the min-plus and the max-plus NC branches is introduced. In this approach, the max-plus $g$-server model is extended and the extended model, called $g^{x}$-server, is used together with the min-plus arrival curve traffic model. By applying the integrated NC approach, service and delay bounds are derived for several settings that are fundamental in TSNs. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in non-invasive detection of cardiac hemodynamic instability (CHDI) primarily focus on applying machine learning techniques to a single data modality, e.g. cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite their potential, these approaches often fall short especially when the size of labeled patient data is limited, a common challenge in the medical domain. Furthermore, only a few studies have explored multimodal methods to study CHDI, which mostly rely on costly modalities such as cardiac MRI and echocardiogram. In response to these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal variational autoencoder ($\\text{CardioVAE}_\\text{X,G}$) to integrate low-cost chest X-ray (CXR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) modalities with pre-training on a large unlabeled dataset. Specifically, $\\text{CardioVAE}_\\text{X,G}$ introduces a novel tri-stream pre-training strategy to learn both shared and modality-specific features, thus enabling fine-tuning with both unimodal and multimodal datasets. We pre-train $\\text{CardioVAE}_\\text{X,G}$ on a large, unlabeled dataset of $50,982$ subjects from a subset of MIMIC database and then fine-tune the pre-trained model on a labeled dataset of $795$ subjects from the ASPIRE registry. Comprehensive evaluations against existing methods show that $\\text{CardioVAE}_\\text{X,G}$ offers promising performance (AUROC $=0.79$ and Accuracy $=0.77$), representing a significant step forward in non-invasive prediction of CHDI.

    "abstract": "Recent research has begun to examine the potential of automatically finding and fixing accessibility issues that manifest in software. However, while recent work makes important progress, it has generally been skewed toward identifying issues that affect users with certain disabilities, such as those with visual or hearing impairments. However, there are other groups of users with different types of disabilities that also need software tooling support to improve their experience. As such, this paper aims to automatically identify accessibility issues that affect users with motor-impairments. To move toward this goal, this paper introduces a novel approach, called MotorEase, capable of identifying accessibility issues in mobile app UIs that impact motor-impaired users. Motor-impaired users often have limited ability to interact with touch-based devices, and instead may make use of a switch or other assistive mechanism -- hence UIs must be designed to support both limited touch gestures and the use of assistive devices. MotorEase adapts computer vision and text processing techniques to enable a semantic understanding of app UI screens, enabling the detection of violations related to four popular, previously unexplored UI design guidelines that support motor-impaired users, including: (i) visual touch target size, (ii) expanding sections, (iii) persisting elements, and (iv) adjacent icon visual distance. We evaluate MotorEase on a newly derived benchmark, called MotorCheck, that contains 555 manually annotated examples of violations to the above accessibility guidelines, across 1599 screens collected from 70 applications via a mobile app testing tool. Our experiments illustrate that MotorEase is able to identify violations with an average accuracy of ~90%, and a false positive rate of less than 9%, outperforming baseline techniques. ",

The YOLOv5 series is currently one of the most advanced and widely used methods for object detection. However, it faces inherent challenges, such as high computational load on devices and insufficient detection accuracy. To address these concerns, this paper presents an enhanced lightweight YOLOv5 technique customized for mobile devices, specifically intended for identifying objects associated with transmission lines. The C3Ghost module is integrated into the convolutional network of YOLOv5 to reduce floating point operations per second (FLOPs) in the feature channel fusion process and improve feature expression performance. In addition, a FasterNet module is introduced to replace the c3 module in the YOLOv5 Backbone. The FasterNet module uses Partial Convolutions to process only a portion of the input channels, improving feature extraction efficiency and reducing computational overhead. To address the imbalance between simple and challenging samples in the dataset and the diversity of aspect ratios of bounding boxes, the wIoU v3 LOSS is adopted as the loss function. To validate the performance of the proposed approach, Experiments are conducted on a custom dataset of transmission line poles. The results show that the proposed model achieves a 1% increase in detection accuracy, a 13% reduction in FLOPs, and a 26% decrease in model parameters compared to the existing YOLOv5.In the ablation experiment, it was also discovered that while the Fastnet module and the CSghost module improved the precision of the original YOLOv5 baseline model, they caused a decrease in the mAP@.5-.95 metric. However, the improvement of the wIoUv3 loss function significantly mitigated the decline of the mAP@.5-.95 metric. ",

    "abstract": "The security of blockchain systems depends on the distribution of mining power across participants. If sufficient mining power is controlled by one entity, they can force their own version of events. This may allow them to double spend coins, for example. For Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains, however, the distribution of mining power cannot be read directly from the blockchain and must instead be inferred from the number of blocks mined in a specific sample window. We introduce a framework to quantify this statistical uncertainty for the Nakamoto coefficient, which is a commonly-used measure of blockchain decentralization. We show that aggregating blocks over a day can lead to considerable uncertainty, with Bitcoin failing more than half the hypothesis tests ({\\alpha} = 0.05) when using a daily granularity. For these reasons, we recommend that blocks are aggregated over a sample window of at least 7 days. Instead of reporting a single value, our approach produces a range of possible Nakamoto coefficient values that have statistical support at a particular significance level {\\alpha}. ",

    "abstract": "The lack of transparency of Deep Neural Networks continues to be a limitation that severely undermines their reliability and usage in high-stakes applications. Promising approaches to overcome such limitations are Prototype-Based Self-Explainable Neural Networks (PSENNs), whose predictions rely on the similarity between the input at hand and a set of prototypical representations of the output classes, offering therefore a deep, yet transparent-by-design, architecture. So far, such models have been designed by considering pointwise estimates for the prototypes, which remain fixed after the learning phase of the model. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic reformulation of PSENNs, called Prob-PSENN, which replaces point estimates for the prototypes with probability distributions over their values. This provides not only a more flexible framework for an end-to-end learning of prototypes, but can also capture the explanatory uncertainty of the model, which is a missing feature in previous approaches. In addition, since the prototypes determine both the explanation and the prediction, Prob-PSENNs allow us to detect when the model is making uninformed or uncertain predictions, and to obtain valid explanations for them. Our experiments demonstrate that Prob-PSENNs provide more meaningful and robust explanations than their non-probabilistic counterparts, thus enhancing the explainability and reliability of the models.

Even though significant empirical advances have been made on this problem, a theoretical understanding remains absent. We initiate the theoretical investigation into principled approaches for representation learning and focus on learning the latent state representations of the underlying MDP using video data. We study two types of settings: one where there is iid noise in the observation, and a more challenging setting where there is also the presence of exogenous noise, which is non-iid noise that is temporally correlated, such as the motion of people or cars in the background. We study three commonly used approaches: autoencoding, temporal contrastive learning, and forward modeling. We prove upper bounds for temporal contrastive learning and forward modeling in the presence of only iid noise. We show that these approaches can learn the latent state and use it to do efficient downstream RL with polynomial sample complexity. When exogenous noise is also present, we establish a lower bound result showing that the sample complexity of learning from video data can be exponentially worse than learning from action-labeled trajectory data. This partially explains why reinforcement learning with video pre-training is hard. We evaluate these representational learning methods in two visual domains, yielding results that are consistent with our theoretical findings. ",

While Radiance Field-based methods achieve state-of-the-art quality in challenging scenarios such as in-the-wild captures and large-scale scenes, they often suffer from excessively high compute requirements linked to volumetric rendering. Gaussian Splatting-based methods, on the other hand, rely on rasterization and naturally achieve real-time rendering but suffer from brittle optimization heuristics that underperform on more challenging scenes. In this work, we present RadSplat, a lightweight method for robust real-time rendering of complex scenes. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we use radiance fields as a prior and supervision signal for optimizing point-based scene representations, leading to improved quality and more robust optimization. Next, we develop a novel pruning technique reducing the overall point count while maintaining high quality, leading to smaller and more compact scene representations with faster inference speeds. Finally, we propose a novel test-time filtering approach that further accelerates rendering and allows to scale to larger, house-sized scenes. We find that our method enables state-of-the-art synthesis of complex captures at 900+ FPS. ",

    "abstract": "Relying on either deep models or physical models are two mainstream approaches for solving inverse sample reconstruction problems in programmable illumination computational microscopy. Solutions based on physical models possess strong generalization capabilities while struggling with global optimization of inverse problems due to a lack of insufficient physical constraints. In contrast, deep learning methods have strong problem-solving abilities, but their generalization ability is often questioned because of the unclear physical principles. Besides, conventional deep models are difficult to apply to some specific scenes because of the difficulty in acquiring high-quality training data and their limited capacity to generalize across different scenarios. In this paper, to combine the advantages of deep models and physical models together, we propose a hybrid framework consisting of three sub-neural networks (two deep learning networks and one physics-based network). We first obtain a result with rich semantic information through a light deep learning neural network and then use it as the initial value of the physical network to make its output comply with physical process constraints. These two results are then used as the input of a fusion deep learning neural work which utilizes the paired features between the reconstruction results of two different models to further enhance imaging quality. The final result integrates the advantages of both deep models and physical models and can quickly solve the computational reconstruction inverse problem in programmable illumination computational microscopy and achieve better results. We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework with theoretical analysis and actual experiments on resolution targets and biological samples. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum circuit transformation aims to produce equivalent circuits while optimizing for various aspects such as circuit depth, gate count, and compatibility with modern Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. There are two techniques for circuit transformation. The first is a rule-based approach that greedily cancels out pairs of gates that equate to the identity unitary operation. Rule-based approaches are used in quantum compilers such as Qiskit, tket, and Quilc. The second is a search-based approach that tries to find an equivalent quantum circuit by exploring the quantum circuits search space. Search-based approaches typically rely on machine learning techniques such as generative models and Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose AltGraph, a novel search-based circuit transformation approach that generates equivalent quantum circuits using existing generative graph models. We use three main graph models: DAG Variational Autoencoder (D-VAE) with two variants: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and Deep Generative Model for Graphs (DeepGMG) that take a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the quantum circuit as input and output a new DAG from which we reconstruct the equivalent quantum circuit. Next, we perturb the latent space to generate equivalent quantum circuits some of which may be more compatible with the hardware coupling map and/or enable better optimization leading to reduced gate count and circuit depth. AltGraph achieves on average a 37.55% reduction in the number of gates and a 37.75% reduction in the circuit depth post-transpiling compared to the original transpiled circuit with only 0.0074 Mean Squared Error (MSE) in the density matrix.

Through rigorous evaluation on simulated color Doppler images derived from a patient-specific computational fluid dynamics model and in vivo Doppler acquisitions, both approaches demonstrate comparable reconstruction performance to the original iVFM algorithm.

Notably, nnU-Net shows superior robustness on sparse and truncated Doppler data while maintaining independence from explicit boundary conditions. Overall, our results highlight the effectiveness of these methods in reconstructing intraventricular vector blood flow.

Introduced in the 1970s, this concept has been since then extensively studied from both combinatorial and algorithmic point of view. We propose a generalization of the concept of resolving sets to temporal graphs, i.e., graphs with edge sets that change over discrete time-steps. In this setting, the $\\textit{temporal distance}$ from $u$ to $v$ is the earliest possible time-step at which a journey with strictly increasing time-steps on edges leaving $u$ reaches $v$, i.e., the first time-step at which $v$ could receive a message broadcast from $u$. A $\\textit{temporal resolving set}$ of a temporal graph $\\mathcal{G}$ is a subset $R$ of its vertices such that every vertex of $\\mathcal{G}$ is uniquely identified by its temporal distances from vertices of $R$. We study the problem of finding a minimum-size temporal resolving set, and show that it is NP-complete even on very restricted graph classes and with strong constraints on the time-steps: temporal complete graphs where every edge appears in either time-step 1 or 2, temporal trees where every edge appears in at most two consecutive time-steps, and even temporal subdivided stars where every edge appears in at most two (not necessarily consecutive) time-steps. On the other hand, we give polynomial-time algorithms for temporal paths and temporal stars where every edge appears in exactly one time-step, and give a combinatorial analysis and algorithms for several temporal graph classes where the edges appear in periodic time-steps.

Traditional bubble dynamics models including atomistic approaches and continuum-based methods segment the bubble dynamics into distinct scale-specific models. In order to bridge the gap between microscale stochastic fluid models and continuum-based fluid models for bubble dynamics, we develop a composite neural operator model to unify the analysis of nonlinear bubble dynamics across microscale and macroscale regimes by integrating a many-body dissipative particle dynamics (mDPD) model with a continuum-based Rayleigh-Plesset (RP) model through a novel neural network architecture, which consists of a deep operator network for learning the mean behavior of bubble growth subject to pressure variations and a long short-term memory network for learning the statistical features of correlated fluctuations in microscale bubble dynamics. Training and testing data are generated by conducting mDPD and RP simulations for nonlinear bubble dynamics with initial bubble radii ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 micrometers. Results show that the trained composite neural operator model can accurately predict bubble dynamics across scales, with a 99% accuracy for the time evaluation of the bubble radius under varying external pressure while containing correct size-dependent stochastic fluctuations in microscale bubble growth dynamics. The composite neural operator is the first deep learning surrogate for multiscale bubble growth dynamics that can capture correct stochastic fluctuations in microscopic fluid phenomena, which sets a new direction for future research in multiscale fluid dynamics modeling.

    "abstract": "As algorithmic trading and electronic markets continue to transform the landscape of financial markets, detecting and deterring rogue agents to maintain a fair and efficient marketplace is crucial. The explosion of large datasets and the continually changing tricks of the trade make it difficult to adapt to new market conditions and detect bad actors. To that end, we propose a framework that can be adapted easily to various problems in the space of detecting market manipulation. Our approach entails initially employing a labelling algorithm which we use to create a training set to learn a weakly supervised model to identify potentially suspicious sequences of order book states. The main goal here is to learn a representation of the order book that can be used to easily compare future events. Subsequently, we posit the incorporation of expert assessment to scrutinize specific flagged order book states. In the event of an expert's unavailability, recourse is taken to the application of a more complex algorithm on the identified suspicious order book states. We then conduct a similarity search between any new representation of the order book against the expert labelled representations to rank the results of the weak learner. We show some preliminary results that are promising to explore further in this direction ",

    "abstract": "This paper outlines our submission for the 4th COV19D competition as part of the `Domain adaptation, Explainability, Fairness in AI for Medical Image Analysis' (DEF-AI-MIA) workshop at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR). The competition consists of two challenges. The first is to train a classifier to detect the presence of COVID-19 from over one thousand CT scans from the COV19-CT-DB database. The second challenge is to perform domain adaptation by taking the dataset from Challenge 1 and adding a small number of scans (some annotated and other not) for a different distribution. We preprocessed the CT scans to segment the lungs, and output volumes with the lungs individually and together. We then trained 3D ResNet and Swin Transformer models on these inputs. We annotated the unlabeled CT scans using an ensemble of these models and chose the high-confidence predictions as pseudo-labels for fine-tuning. This resulted in a best cross-validation mean F1 score of 93.39\\% for Challenge 1 and a mean F1 score of 92.15 for Challenge 2. ",

    "abstract": "Developing reliable mechanisms for continuous local learning is a central challenge faced by biological and artificial systems. Yet, how the environmental factors and structural constraints on the learning network influence the optimal plasticity mechanisms remains obscure even for simple settings. To elucidate these dependencies, we study meta-learning via evolutionary optimization of simple reward-modulated plasticity rules in embodied agents solving a foraging task. We show that unconstrained meta-learning leads to the emergence of diverse plasticity rules. However, regularization and bottlenecks to the model help reduce this variability, resulting in interpretable rules. Our findings indicate that the meta-learning of plasticity rules is very sensitive to various parameters, with this sensitivity possibly reflected in the learning rules found in biological networks. When included in models, these dependencies can be used to discover potential objective functions and details of biological learning via comparisons with experimental observations. ",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of computing robust controllable sets for discrete-time linear systems with additive uncertainty. We propose a tractable and scalable approach to inner- and outer-approximate robust controllable sets using constrained zonotopes, when the additive uncertainty set is a symmetric, convex, and compact set. Our least-squares-based approach uses novel closed-form approximations of the Pontryagin difference between a constrained zonotopic minuend and a symmetric, convex, and compact subtrahend. Unlike existing approaches, our approach does not rely on convex optimization solvers, and is projection-free for ellipsoidal and zonotopic uncertainty sets. We also propose a least-squares-based approach to compute a convex, polyhedral outer-approximation to constrained zonotopes, and characterize sufficient conditions under which all these approximations are exact. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of our approach in several case studies, including the design of abort-safe rendezvous trajectories for a spacecraft in near-rectilinear halo orbit under uncertainty. Our approach can inner-approximate a 20-step robust controllable set for a 100-dimensional linear system in under 15 seconds on a standard computer. ",
