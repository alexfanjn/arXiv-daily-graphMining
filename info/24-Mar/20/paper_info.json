    "title": "Mobile Application for Oral Disease Detection using Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "The mouth, often regarded as a window to the internal state of the body, plays an important role in reflecting one's overall health. Poor oral hygiene has far-reaching consequences, contributing to severe conditions like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, while inadequate care leads to discomfort, pain, and costly treatments. Federated Learning (FL) for object detection can be utilized for this use case due to the sensitivity of the oral image data of the patients. FL ensures data privacy by storing the images used for object detection on the local device and trains the model on the edge. The updated weights are federated to a central server where all the collected weights are updated via The Federated Averaging algorithm. Finally, we have developed a mobile app named OralH which provides user-friendly solutions, allowing people to conduct self-assessments through mouth scans and providing quick oral health insights. Upon detection of the issues, the application alerts the user about potential oral health concerns or diseases and provides details about dental clinics in the user's locality. Designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), the platform ensures ubiquitous access, catering to users across devices for a seamless experience. The application aims to provide state-of-the-art segmentation and detection techniques, leveraging the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify oral hygiene issues and diseases. This study deals with the benefits of leveraging FL in healthcare with promising real-world results. ",

    "abstract": "A dictionary attack in a biometric system entails the use of a small number of strategically generated images or templates to successfully match with a large number of identities, thereby compromising security. We focus on dictionary attacks at the template level, specifically the IrisCodes used in iris recognition systems. We present an hitherto unknown vulnerability wherein we mix IrisCodes using simple bitwise operators to generate alpha-mixtures - alpha-wolves (combining a set of \"wolf\" samples) and alpha-mammals (combining a set of users selected via search optimization) that increase false matches. We evaluate this vulnerability using the IITD, CASIA-IrisV4-Thousand and Synthetic datasets, and observe that an alpha-wolf (from two wolves) can match upto 71 identities @FMR=0.001%, while an alpha-mammal (from two identities) can match upto 133 other identities @FMR=0.01% on the IITD dataset.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a data augmentation method for improving the robustness of driving object detectors against domain shift. Domain shift problem arises when there is a significant change between the distribution of the source data domain used in the training phase and that of the target data domain in the deployment phase. Domain shift is known as one of the most popular reasons resulting in the considerable drop in the performance of deep neural network models. In order to address this problem, one effective approach is to increase the diversity of training data. To this end, we propose a data synthesis module that can be utilized to train more robust and effective object detectors. By adopting YOLOv4 as a base object detector, we have witnessed a remarkable improvement in performance on both the source and target domain data.

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the dominant cause of death and hospitalization across the globe. Atherosclerosis, an inflammatory condition that gradually narrows arteries and has potentially fatal effects, is the most frequent cause of CAD. Nonetheless, the circulation regularly adapts in the presence of atherosclerosis, through the formation of collateral arteries, resulting in significant long-term health benefits. Therefore, timely detection of coronary collateral circulation (CCC) is crucial for CAD personalized medicine. We propose a novel deep learning based method to detect CCC in angiographic images. Our method relies on a convolutional backbone to extract spatial features from each frame of an angiography sequence. The features are then concatenated, and subsequently processed by another convolutional layer that processes embeddings temporally. Due to scarcity of data, we also experiment with pretraining the backbone on coronary artery segmentation, which improves the results consistently. Moreover, we experiment with few-shot learning to further improve performance, given our low data regime. We present our results together with subgroup analyses based on Rentrop grading, collateral flow, and collateral grading, which provide valuable insights into model performance. Overall, the proposed method shows promising results in detecting CCC, and can be further extended to perform landmark based CCC detection and CCC quantification. ",

    "abstract": "Co-Salient Object Detection (CoSOD) is a rapidly growing task, extended from Salient Object Detection (SOD) and Common Object Segmentation (Co-Segmentation). It is aimed at detecting the co-occurring salient object in the given image group. Many effective approaches have been proposed on the basis of existing datasets. However, there is still no standard and efficient training set in CoSOD, which makes it chaotic to choose training sets in the recently proposed CoSOD methods. First, the drawbacks of existing training sets in CoSOD are analyzed in a comprehensive way, and potential improvements are provided to solve existing problems to some extent. In particular, in this thesis, a new CoSOD training set is introduced, named Co-Saliency of ImageNet (CoSINe) dataset. The proposed CoSINe is the largest number of groups among all existing CoSOD datasets. The images obtained here span a wide variety in terms of categories, object sizes, etc. In experiments, models trained on CoSINe can achieve significantly better performance with fewer images compared to all existing datasets. Second, to make the most of the proposed CoSINe, a novel CoSOD approach named Hierarchical Instance-aware COnsensus MinEr (HICOME) is proposed, which efficiently mines the consensus feature from different feature levels and discriminates objects of different classes in an object-aware contrastive way. As extensive experiments show, the proposed HICOME achieves SoTA performance on all the existing CoSOD test sets. Several useful training tricks suitable for training CoSOD models are also provided. Third, practical applications are given using the CoSOD technique to show the effectiveness. Finally, the remaining challenges and potential improvements of CoSOD are discussed to inspire related work in the future. The source code, the dataset, and the online demo will be publicly available at github.com/ZhengPeng7/CoSINe. ",

    "abstract": "Exploiting unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for delivery services is expected to reduce delivery time and human resource costs. However, the proximity of these UAVs to the ground can make them an ideal target for opportunistic criminals. Consequently, UAVs may be hacked, diverted from their destinations, or used for malicious purposes. Furthermore, as a decentralized (peer-to-peer) technology, the blockchain has immense potential to enable secure, decentralized, and cooperative communication among UAVs. With this goal in mind, we propose the Blockchain-Empowered, Immutable, and Reliable Delivery Service (BIRDS) framework to address data security challenges. BIRDS deploys communication hubs across a scalable network. Following the registration phase of BIRDS, UAV node selection is carried out based on a specific consensus proof-of-competence (PoC), where UAVs are evaluated solely on their credibility. The chosen finalist is awarded a certificate for the BIRDS global order fulfillment system. The simulation results demonstrate that BIRDS requires fewer UAVs compared to conventional solutions, resulting in reduced costs and emissions. The proposed BIRDS framework caters to the requirements of numerous users while necessitating less network traffic and consuming low energy. ",

However, the eLearning process can give rise to a spatial and temporal gap that poses interesting challenges for assessment of not only content, but also students' acquisition of core skills such as self-regulated learning. Our objective was to discover students' self-regulated learning processes during an eLearning course by using Process Mining Techniques. We applied a new algorithm in the educational domain called Inductive Miner over the interaction traces from 101 university students in a course given over one semester on the Moodle 2.0 platform. Data was extracted from the platform's event logs with 21629 traces in order to discover students' self-regulation models that contribute to improving the instructional process. The Inductive Miner algorithm discovered optimal models in terms of fitness for both Pass and Fail students in this dataset, as well as models at a certain level of granularity that can be interpreted in educational terms, which are the most important achievement in model discovery. We can conclude that although students who passed did not follow the instructors' suggestions exactly, they did follow the logic of a successful self-regulated learning process as opposed to their failing classmates. The Process Mining models also allow us to examine which specific actions the students performed, and it was particularly interesting to see a high presence of actions related to forum-supported collaborative learning in the Pass group and an absence of those in the Fail group.

    "abstract": "With the rise of text-to-image (T2I) generative AI models reaching wide audiences, it is critical to evaluate model robustness against non-obvious attacks to mitigate the generation of offensive images. By focusing on ``implicitly adversarial'' prompts (those that trigger T2I models to generate unsafe images for non-obvious reasons), we isolate a set of difficult safety issues that human creativity is well-suited to uncover. To this end, we built the Adversarial Nibbler Challenge, a red-teaming methodology for crowdsourcing a diverse set of implicitly adversarial prompts. We have assembled a suite of state-of-the-art T2I models, employed a simple user interface to identify and annotate harms, and engaged diverse populations to capture long-tail safety issues that may be overlooked in standard testing. The challenge is run in consecutive rounds to enable a sustained discovery and analysis of safety pitfalls in T2I models. In this paper, we present an in-depth account of our methodology, a systematic study of novel attack strategies and discussion of safety failures revealed by challenge participants. We also release a companion visualization tool for easy exploration and derivation of insights from the dataset. The first challenge round resulted in over 10k prompt-image pairs with machine annotations for safety. A subset of 1.5k samples contains rich human annotations of harm types and attack styles. We find that 14% of images that humans consider harmful are mislabeled as ``safe'' by machines. We have identified new attack strategies that highlight the complexity of ensuring T2I model robustness. Our findings emphasize the necessity of continual auditing and adaptation as new vulnerabilities emerge. We are confident that this work will enable proactive, iterative safety assessments and promote responsible development of T2I models. ",

Nonetheless, retrieval-augmented generation exacerbates safety concerns, since adversaries may successfully evade the entire system by subtly manipulating the most vulnerable part of a claim. To this end, we propose evaluating the robustness of generative search engines in the realistic and high-risk setting, where adversaries have only black-box system access and seek to deceive the model into returning incorrect responses. Through a comprehensive human evaluation of various generative search engines, such as Bing Chat, PerplexityAI, and YouChat across diverse queries, we demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial factual questions in inducing incorrect responses. Moreover, retrieval-augmented generation exhibits a higher susceptibility to factual errors compared to LLMs without retrieval. These findings highlight the potential security risks of these systems and emphasize the need for rigorous evaluation before deployment. ",

    "abstract": "The echocardiographic measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is fundamental to the diagnosis and classification of patients with heart failure (HF). In order to quantify LVEF automatically and accurately, this paper proposes a new pipeline method based on deep neural networks and ensemble learning. Within the pipeline, an Atrous Convolutional Neural Network (ACNN) was first trained to segment the left ventricle (LV), before employing the area-length formulation based on the ellipsoid single-plane model to calculate LVEF values. This formulation required inputs of LV area, derived from segmentation using an improved Jeffrey's method, as well as LV length, derived from a novel ensemble learning model. To further improve the pipeline's accuracy, an automated peak detection algorithm was used to identify end-diastolic and end-systolic frames, avoiding issues with human error. Subsequently, single-beat LVEF values were averaged across all cardiac cycles to obtain the final LVEF. This method was developed and internally validated in an open-source dataset containing 10,030 echocardiograms. The Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.83 for LVEF prediction compared to expert human analysis (p<0.001), with a subsequent area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.97 to 0.99) for categorisation of HF with reduced ejection (HFrEF; LVEF<40%). In an external dataset with 200 echocardiograms, this method achieved an AUC of 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.88 to 0.91) for HFrEF assessment. This study demonstrates that an automated neural network-based calculation of LVEF is comparable to expert clinicians performing time-consuming, frame-by-frame manual evaluation of cardiac systolic function.

However, existing methods typically require dense scene measurements and often rely on RGB images for 3D geometry reconstruction, with thermal information being projected post-reconstruction.

To address this challenge, we propose ThermoNeRF, a novel multimodal approach based on Neural Radiance Fields, capable of rendering new RGB and thermal views of a scene jointly. To overcome the lack of texture in thermal images, we use paired RGB and thermal images to learn scene density, while distinct networks estimate color and temperature information. Furthermore, we introduce ThermoScenes, a new dataset to palliate the lack of available RGB+thermal datasets for scene reconstruction. Experimental results validate that ThermoNeRF achieves accurate thermal image synthesis, with an average mean absolute error of 1.5$^\\circ$C, an improvement of over 50% compared to using concatenated RGB+thermal data with Nerfacto, a state-of-the-art NeRF method.

However, existing studies fail to simultaneously address these crucial properties. This paper introduces a novel, practical and lightweight framework, namely Graph-Jigsaw Conditioned Diffusion Model for Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection (GiCiSAD) to overcome the challenges associated with SVAD. GiCiSAD consists of three novel modules: the Graph Attention-based Forecasting module to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in the data, the Graph-level Jigsaw Puzzle Maker module to distinguish subtle region-level discrepancies between normal and abnormal motions, and the Graph-based Conditional Diffusion model to generate a wide spectrum of human motions. Extensive experiments on four widely used skeleton-based video datasets show that GiCiSAD outperforms existing methods with significantly fewer training parameters, establishing it as the new state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Transforming unstructured text into structured and meaningful forms, organized by useful category labels, is a fundamental step in text mining for downstream analysis and application. However, most existing methods for producing label taxonomies and building text-based label classifiers still rely heavily on domain expertise and manual curation, making the process expensive and time-consuming. This is particularly challenging when the label space is under-specified and large-scale data annotations are unavailable. In this paper, we address these challenges with Large Language Models (LLMs), whose prompt-based interface facilitates the induction and use of large-scale pseudo labels. We propose TnT-LLM, a two-phase framework that employs LLMs to automate the process of end-to-end label generation and assignment with minimal human effort for any given use-case. In the first phase, we introduce a zero-shot, multi-stage reasoning approach which enables LLMs to produce and refine a label taxonomy iteratively. In the second phase, LLMs are used as data labelers that yield training samples so that lightweight supervised classifiers can be reliably built, deployed, and served at scale. We apply TnT-LLM to the analysis of user intent and conversational domain for Bing Copilot (formerly Bing Chat), an open-domain chat-based search engine. Extensive experiments using both human and automatic evaluation metrics demonstrate that TnT-LLM generates more accurate and relevant label taxonomies when compared against state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency for classification at scale. We also share our practical experiences and insights on the challenges and opportunities of using LLMs for large-scale text mining in real-world applications. ",

    "title": "A Unified Model for Longitudinal Multi-Modal Multi-View Prediction with  Missingness",
    "abstract": "Medical records often consist of different modalities, such as images, text, and tabular information. Integrating all modalities offers a holistic view of a patient's condition, while analyzing them longitudinally provides a better understanding of disease progression. However, real-world longitudinal medical records present challenges: 1) patients may lack some or all of the data for a specific timepoint, and 2) certain modalities or views might be absent for all patients during a particular period. In this work, we introduce a unified model for longitudinal multi-modal multi-view (MMMV) prediction with missingness. Our method allows as many timepoints as desired for input, and aims to leverage all available data, regardless of their availability. We conduct extensive experiments on the knee osteoarthritis dataset from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) for pain and Kellgren-Lawrence grade (KLG) prediction at a future timepoint. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing results from our unified model to specific models that use the same modality and view combinations during training and evaluation. We also show the benefit of having extended temporal data and provide post-hoc analysis for a deeper understanding of each modality/view's importance for different tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Aggregate peak Electric Vehicle (EV) charging demand has become an increasingly concerning issue for network operators, impacting their reliable operations. Various network tariff schemes have been proposed to limit peak demand by incentivizing flexible asset users to shift their demand from peak periods. However, fewer studies quantify the overall effect of these tariff schemes, which operate at the level of individual connections, on the aggregate load. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a multi-level segmented network tariff on aggregate EV charging demand. The interaction between peak-reducing network tariffs and dynamic energy prices is studied, shedding light on the competition between peak-reducing (network tariffs) and peak-forming (wholesale prices) charging behaviour. Results based on real charging transactions from over 650 public charging stations (CS) in the Netherlands show that the segmented network tariff with flat energy prices results in more diverse load profiles with increasing aggregation compared to cost-optimized dispatch based on dynamic day-ahead prices. The average peak demand for charging with segmented network tariffs and flat energy prices is reduced by 49% and 29% compared to optimized charging under dynamic day-ahead energy prices and unoptimized (dumb) charging, respectively.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the synchronization of heterogeneous pulse-coupled oscillators (PCOs), where some of the oscillators might be faulty or malicious. The oscillators interact through identical pulses at discrete instants and evolve continuously with different frequencies otherwise. Despite the presence of misbehaviors, benign oscillators aim to reach synchronization. To achieve this objective, two resilient synchronization protocols are developed in this paper by adapting the real-valued mean-subsequence reduced (MSR) algorithm to pulse-based interactions. The first protocol relies on packet-based communication to transmit absolute frequencies, while the second protocol operates purely with pulses to calculate relative frequencies. In both protocols, each normal oscillator periodically counts the received pulses to detect possible malicious behaviors. By disregarding suspicious pulses from its neighbors, the oscillator updates both its phases and frequencies. The paper establishes sufficient conditions on the initial states and graph structure under which resilient synchronization is achieved in the PCO network. Specifically, the normal oscillators can either detect the presence of malicious nodes or synchronize in both phases and frequencies. Additionally, a comparison between the two algorithms reveals a trade-off between relaxed initial conditions and reduced communication burden. ",

In this study, we formally define hallucination and propose a framework for its quantitative detection in a zero-shot setting, leveraging our definition and the assumption that model outputs entail task and sample specific inputs. In detecting hallucinations, our solution achieves an accuracy of 0.78 in a model-aware setting and 0.61 in a model-agnostic setting.

    "abstract": "Generating receding-horizon motion trajectories for autonomous vehicles in real-time while also providing safety guarantees is challenging. This is because a future trajectory needs to be planned before the previously computed trajectory is completely executed. This becomes even more difficult if the trajectory is required to satisfy continuous-time collision-avoidance constraints while accounting for a large number of obstacles. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel real-time, receding-horizon motion planning algorithm named REachability-based trajectory Design via Exact Formulation of Implicit NEural signed Distance functions (REDEFINED). REDEFINED first applies offline reachability analysis to compute zonotope-based reachable sets that overapproximate the motion of the ego vehicle. During online planning, REDEFINED leverages zonotope arithmetic to construct a neural implicit representation that computes the exact signed distance between a parameterized swept volume of the ego vehicle and obstacle vehicles. REDEFINED then implements a novel, real-time optimization framework that utilizes the neural network to construct a collision avoidance constraint. REDEFINED is compared to a variety of state-of-the-art techniques and is demonstrated to successfully enable the vehicle to safely navigate through complex environments.

Previous research tackled this challenge using collected motion data and conventional Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to classify heavy drinking episodes, but with impractical accuracy and computational efficiency for mobile devices. Consequently, we have elected to use Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) to design a just-in-time intervention approach that is practical for smartphones, smart wearables, and IoT deployment. HDC is a framework that has proven results in processing real-time sensor data efficiently. This approach offers several advantages, including low latency, minimal power consumption, and high parallelism. We explore various HDC encoding designs and combine them with various HDC learning models to create an optimal and feasible approach for mobile devices.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of comparing a pair of geometric networks that may not be similarly defined, i.e., when they do not have one-to-one correspondences between their nodes and edges. Our motivating application is to compare power distribution networks of a region. Due to the lack of openly available power network datasets, researchers synthesize realistic networks resembling their actual counterparts. But the synthetic digital twins may vary significantly from one another and from actual networks due to varying underlying assumptions and approaches. Hence the user wants to evaluate the quality of networks in terms of their structural similarity to actual power networks. But the lack of correspondence between the networks renders most standard approaches, e.g., subgraph isomorphism and edit distance, unsuitable. We propose an approach based on the multiscale flat norm, a notion of distance between objects defined in the field of geometric measure theory, to compute the distance between a pair of planar geometric networks. Using a triangulation of the domain containing the input networks, the flat norm distance between two networks at a given scale can be computed by solving a linear program. In addition, this computation automatically identifies the 2D regions (patches) that capture where the two networks are different. We demonstrate through 2D examples that the flat norm distance can capture the variations of inputs more accurately than the commonly used Hausdorff distance. As a notion of stability, we also derive upper bounds on the flat norm distance between a simple 1D curve and its perturbed version as a function of the radius of perturbation for a restricted class of perturbations. We demonstrate our approach on a set of actual power networks from a county in the USA. ",

    "abstract": "Achieving a holistic and long-term understanding through accurate network modeling is essential for orchestrating future networks with increasing service diversity and infrastructure complexities. However, due to unselective data collection and uniform processing, traditional modeling approaches undermine the efficacy and timeliness of network orchestration. Additionally, temporal disparities arising from various modeling delays further impair the centralized decision-making with distributed models. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical digital twin paradigm adapting to real-time network situations for problem-centered model construction. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive attribute selection mechanism that evaluates the distinct modeling values of diverse network attributes, considering their relevance to current network scenarios and inherent modeling complexity. By prioritizing critical attributes at higher layers, an efficient evaluation of network situations is achieved to identify target areas. Subsequently, scalable network modeling facilitates the inclusion of all identified elements at the lower layers, where more fine-grained digital twins are developed to generate targeted solutions for user association and power allocation. Furthermore, virtual-physical domain synchronization is implemented to maintain accurate temporal alignment between the digital twins and their physical counterparts, spanning from the construction to the utilization of the proposed paradigm. Extensive simulations validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in efficiently identifying pressing issues and delivering network orchestration solutions in complex 6G HetNets.

    "abstract": "The problem of online social network manipulation for community canvassing is of real concern in today's world. Motivated by the study of voter models, opinion and polarization dynamics on networks, we model community canvassing as a dynamic process over a network enabled via gradient-based attacks on GNNs. Existing attacks on GNNs are all single-step and do not account for the dynamic cascading nature of information diffusion in networks. We consider the realistic scenario where an adversary uses a GNN as a proxy to predict and manipulate voter preferences, especially uncertain voters. Gradient-based attacks on the GNN inform the adversary of strategic manipulations that can be made to proselytize targeted voters. In particular, we explore $\\textit{minimum budget attacks for community canvassing}$ (MBACC). We show that the MBACC problem is NP-Hard and propose Dynamic Multi-Step Adversarial Community Canvassing (MAC) to address it. MAC makes dynamic local decisions based on the heuristic of low budget and high second-order influence to convert and perturb target voters. MAC is a dynamic multi-step attack that discovers low-budget and high-influence targets from which efficient cascading attacks can happen. We evaluate MAC against single-step baselines on the MBACC problem with multiple underlying networks and GNN models. Our experiments show the superiority of MAC which is able to discover efficient multi-hop attacks for adversarial community canvassing.

    "title": "VQ-NeRV: A Vector Quantized Neural Representation for Videos",
    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INR) excel in encoding videos within neural networks, showcasing promise in computer vision tasks like video compression and denoising. INR-based approaches reconstruct video frames from content-agnostic embeddings, which hampers their efficacy in video frame regression and restricts their generalization ability for video interpolation. To address these deficiencies, Hybrid Neural Representation for Videos (HNeRV) was introduced with content-adaptive embeddings. Nevertheless, HNeRV's compression ratios remain relatively low, attributable to an oversight in leveraging the network's shallow features and inter-frame residual information. In this work, we introduce an advanced U-shaped architecture, Vector Quantized-NeRV (VQ-NeRV), which integrates a novel component--the VQ-NeRV Block. This block incorporates a codebook mechanism to discretize the network's shallow residual features and inter-frame residual information effectively. This approach proves particularly advantageous in video compression, as it results in smaller size compared to quantized features. Furthermore, we introduce an original codebook optimization technique, termed shallow codebook optimization, designed to refine the utility and efficiency of the codebook. The experimental evaluations indicate that VQ-NeRV outperforms HNeRV on video regression tasks, delivering superior reconstruction quality (with an increase of 1-2 dB in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)), better bit per pixel (bpp) efficiency, and improved video inpainting outcomes.

    "abstract": "Although social media platforms are a prominent arena for users to engage in interpersonal discussions and express opinions, the facade and anonymity offered by social media may allow users to spew hate speech and offensive content. Given the massive scale of such platforms, there arises a need to automatically identify and flag instances of hate speech. Although several hate speech detection methods exist, most of these black-box methods are not interpretable or explainable by design. To address the lack of interpretability, in this paper, we propose to use state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract features in the form of rationales from the input text, to train a base hate speech classifier, thereby enabling faithful interpretability by design. Our framework effectively combines the textual understanding capabilities of LLMs and the discriminative power of state-of-the-art hate speech classifiers to make these classifiers faithfully interpretable. Our comprehensive evaluation on a variety of social media hate speech datasets demonstrate: (1) the goodness of the LLM-extracted rationales, and (2) the surprising retention of detector performance even after training to ensure interpretability.

However, such systems are often not designed to be transparent about their limitations; a user may easily prompt a model with an instruction without any idea of whether the responses should be expected to be accurate, or if the system is even capable of performing the task. We propose a third party performance prediction framework, where a separate model is trained to predict the metric resulting from evaluating an instruction-following system on a task while assuming access only to its inputs and outputs at inference time. We perform this analysis with a variety of both open and closed instruction-following models as well as multiple performance predictors, and examine the effect of various factors such as model size, number of training tasks, and prompt format. Our findings indicate that third-party performance prediction is very challenging, and much work remains in developing predictors that can automatically reveal the limitations of modern instruction-following natural language processing systems.

    "abstract": "Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) data is characterized as dynamic, heterogenous, and non-stationary, leading to the continuous challenge of spatial-temporal graph learning. In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Graph Selective State Space Block (GS3B) to precisely characterize the dynamic evolution of STG networks. STG-Mamba is formulated as an Encoder-Decoder architecture, which takes GS3B as the basic module, for efficient sequential data modeling. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of SSSMs, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for adaptive graph structure upgrading. KFGN smoothly fits in the context of selective state space evolution, and at the same time keeps linear complexity. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time.

    "abstract": "Learned Index Structures (LIS) view a sorted index as a model that learns the data distribution, takes a data element key as input, and outputs the predicted position of the key. The original LIS can only handle lookup operations with no support for updates, rendering it impractical to use for typical workloads. To address this limitation, recent studies have focused on designing efficient dynamic learned indexes. ALEX, as the pioneering dynamic learned index structures, enables dynamism by incorporating a series of design choices, including adaptive key space partitioning, dynamic model retraining, and sophisticated engineering and policies that prioritize read/write performance. While these design choices offer improved average-case performance, the emphasis on flexibility and performance increases the attack surface by allowing adversarial behaviors that maximize ALEX's memory space and time complexity in worst-case scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation of algorithmic complexity attacks (ACAs) targeting the worst-case scenarios of ALEX. We introduce new ACAs that fall into two categories, space ACAs and time ACAs, which target the memory space and time complexity, respectively. First, our space ACA on data nodes exploits ALEX's gapped array layout and uses Multiple-Choice Knapsack (MCK) to generate an optimal adversarial insertion plan for maximizing the memory consumption at the data node level. Second, our space ACA on internal nodes exploits ALEX's catastrophic cost mitigation mechanism, causing an out-of-memory error with only a few hundred adversarial insertions. Third, our time ACA generates pathological insertions to increase the disparity between the actual key distribution and the linear models of data nodes, deteriorating the runtime performance by up to 1,641X compared to ALEX operating under legitimate workloads.

    "abstract": "Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models exhibit remarkable capabilities in comprehending both images and text, yet they remain susceptible to multimodal adversarial examples (AEs). Strengthening adversarial attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can stimulate further research on constructing reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks (e.g., Image-Text Retrieval(ITR), Visual Grounding(VG), Image Captioning(IC)).

Recent advances in literature have studied the network representations of deep neural networks. However, there has been little work that studies representations learned by SNNs, especially using unsupervised local learning methods like spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Recent work by \\cite{barannikov2021representation} has introduced a novel method to compare topological mappings of learned representations called Representation Topology Divergence (RTD). Though useful, this method is engineered particularly for feedforward deep neural networks and cannot be used for recurrent networks like Recurrent SNNs (RSNNs). This paper introduces a novel methodology to use RTD to measure the difference between distributed representations of RSNN models with different learning methods. We propose a novel reformulation of RSNNs using feedforward autoencoder networks with skip connections to help us compute the RTD for recurrent networks. Thus, we investigate the learning capabilities of RSNN trained using STDP and the role of heterogeneity in the synaptic dynamics in learning such representations. We demonstrate that heterogeneous STDP in RSNNs yield distinct representations than their homogeneous and surrogate gradient-based supervised learning counterparts. Our results provide insights into the potential of heterogeneous SNN models, aiding the development of more efficient and biologically plausible hybrid artificial intelligence systems. ",

    "abstract": "With the recent advancements in single-image-based human mesh recovery, there is a growing interest in enhancing its performance in certain extreme scenarios, such as occlusion, while maintaining overall model accuracy. Although obtaining accurately annotated 3D human poses under occlusion is challenging, there is still a wealth of rich and precise 2D pose annotations that can be leveraged. However, existing works mostly focus on directly leveraging 2D pose coordinates to estimate 3D pose and mesh. In this paper, we present PostoMETRO($\\textbf{Pos}$e $\\textbf{to}$ken enhanced $\\textbf{ME}$sh $\\textbf{TR}$ansf$\\textbf{O}$rmer), which integrates occlusion-resilient 2D pose representation into transformers in a token-wise manner. Utilizing a specialized pose tokenizer, we efficiently condense 2D pose data to a compact sequence of pose tokens and feed them to the transformer together with the image tokens. This process not only ensures a rich depiction of texture from the image but also fosters a robust integration of pose and image information. Subsequently, these combined tokens are queried by vertex and joint tokens to decode 3D coordinates of mesh vertices and human joints. Facilitated by the robust pose token representation and the effective combination, we are able to produce more precise 3D coordinates, even under extreme scenarios like occlusion. Experiments on both standard and occlusion-specific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PostoMETRO. Qualitative results further illustrate the clarity of how 2D pose can help 3D reconstruction. Code will be made available. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in modeling graph-structured data, like other machine learning models, GNNs are also susceptible to making biased predictions based on sensitive attributes, such as race and gender. For fairness consideration, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods propose to filter out sensitive information from inputs or representations, e.g., edge dropping or feature masking. However, we argue that such filtering-based strategies may also filter out some non-sensitive feature information, leading to a sub-optimal trade-off between predictive performance and fairness. To address this issue, we unveil an innovative neutralization-based paradigm, where additional Fairness-facilitating Features (F3) are incorporated into node features or representations before message passing. The F3 are expected to statistically neutralize the sensitive bias in node representations and provide additional nonsensitive information. We also provide theoretical explanations for our rationale, concluding that F3 can be realized by emphasizing the features of each node's heterogeneous neighbors (neighbors with different sensitive attributes). We name our method as FairSIN, and present three implementation variants from both data-centric and model-centric perspectives. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets with three different GNN backbones show that FairSIN significantly improves fairness metrics while maintaining high prediction accuracies. ",

Such temporal misalignment introduces inconsistent constraints for state estimation, leading to a significant positioning drift especially in high dynamic motion scenarios. In this article, we focus on online temporal calibration to reduce the positioning drift caused by the time offset for high dynamic motion VIO. For the time offset observation model, most existing methods rely on accurate state estimation or stable visual tracking. For the prediction model, current methods oversimplify the time offset as a constant value with white Gaussian noise. However, these ideal conditions are seldom satisfied in real high dynamic scenarios, resulting in the poor performance. In this paper, we introduce online time offset modeling networks (TON) to enhance real-time temporal calibration. TON improves the accuracy of time offset observation and prediction modeling. Specifically, for observation modeling, we propose feature velocity observation networks to enhance velocity computation for features in unstable visual tracking conditions. For prediction modeling, we present time offset prediction networks to learn its evolution pattern. To highlight the effectiveness of our method, we integrate the proposed TON into both optimization-based and filter-based VIO systems.

    "abstract": "Training a deep neural network using gradient-based methods necessitates the calculation of gradients at each level. However, using backpropagation or reverse mode differentiation, to calculate the gradients necessities significant memory consumption, rendering backpropagation an inefficient method for computing gradients. This paper focuses on analyzing the performance of the well-known Frank-Wolfe algorithm, a.k.a. conditional gradient algorithm by having access to the forward mode of automatic differentiation to compute gradients. We provide in-depth technical details that show the proposed Algorithm does converge to the optimal solution with a sub-linear rate of convergence by having access to the noisy estimate of the true gradient obtained in the forward mode of automated differentiation, referred to as the Projected Forward Gradient. In contrast, the standard Frank-Wolfe algorithm, when provided with access to the Projected Forward Gradient, fails to converge to the optimal solution. We demonstrate the convergence attributes of our proposed algorithms using a numerical example. ",

    "abstract": "Events are essential components of speech and texts, describing the changes in the state of entities. The event extraction task aims to identify and classify events and find their participants according to event schemas. Manually predefined event schemas have limited coverage and are hard to migrate across domains. Therefore, the researchers propose Liberal Event Extraction (LEE), which aims to extract events and discover event schemas simultaneously. However, existing LEE models rely heavily on external language knowledge bases and require the manual development of numerous rules for noise removal and knowledge alignment, which is complex and laborious. To this end, we propose a Prompt-based Graph Model for Liberal Event Extraction (PGLEE). Specifically, we use a prompt-based model to obtain candidate triggers and arguments, and then build heterogeneous event graphs to encode the structures within and between events. Experimental results prove that our approach achieves excellent performance with or without predefined event schemas, while the automatically detected event schemas are proven high quality. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant interest in recent years due to their ability to handle arbitrarily structured data represented as graphs. GNNs generally follow the message-passing scheme to locally update node feature representations. A graph readout function is then employed to create a representation for the entire graph. Several studies proposed different GNNs by modifying the aggregation and combination strategies of the message-passing framework, often inspired by heuristics. Nevertheless, several studies have begun exploring GNNs from a theoretical perspective based on the graph isomorphism problem which inherently assumes countable node feature representations. Yet, there are only a few theoretical works exploring GNNs with uncountable node feature representations. This paper presents a new perspective on the representational capabilities of GNNs across all levels - node-level, neighborhood-level, and graph-level - when the space of node feature representation is uncountable. From the results, a novel soft-isomorphic relational graph convolution network (SIR-GCN) is proposed that emphasizes non-linear and contextualized transformations of neighborhood feature representations. The mathematical relationship of SIR-GCN and three widely used GNNs is explored to highlight the contribution. Validation on synthetic datasets then demonstrates that SIR-GCN outperforms comparable models even in simple node and graph property prediction tasks. ",

    "abstract": "We present UniBind, a flexible and efficient approach that learns a unified representation space for seven diverse modalities -- images, text, audio, point cloud, thermal, video, and event data. Existing works, eg., ImageBind, treat the image as the central modality and build an image-centered representation space; however, the space may be sub-optimal as it leads to an unbalanced representation space among all modalities. Moreover, the category names are directly used to extract text embeddings for the downstream tasks, making it hardly possible to represent the semantics of multi-modal data. The 'out-of-the-box' insight of our UniBind is to make the alignment center modality-agnostic and further learn a unified and balanced representation space, empowered by the large language models (LLMs). UniBind is superior in its flexible application to all CLIP-style models and delivers remarkable performance boosts. To make this possible, we 1) construct a knowledge base of text embeddings with the help of LLMs and multi-modal LLMs; 2) adaptively build LLM-augmented class-wise embedding center on top of the knowledge base and encoded visual embeddings; 3) align all the embeddings to the LLM-augmented embedding center via contrastive learning to achieve a unified and balanced representation space. UniBind shows strong zero-shot recognition performance gains over prior arts by an average of 6.36%. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance, eg., a 6.75% gain on ImageNet, on the multi-modal fine-tuning setting while reducing 90% of the learnable parameters. ",

Building upon the concept of implicit mapping and positioning systems, our approach extends its applicability to real-world scenarios.

To handle diverse environments without prior knowledge, we incorporate an octree-based structure for scene division and dynamic expansion. To achieve real-time performance, we propose a high-performance multi-process framework. This ensures the system's suitability for applications with stringent time constraints. Additionally, we adopt the idea of multi-maps to handle large-scale scenes, and leverage loop detection and hierarchical pose optimization strategies to reduce long-term pose drift and remove duplicate geometry. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods in terms of reconstruction quality and accuracy across various scenarios.

Recent concentrated research on provenance graph-based detection has proved its effectiveness in attack detection and investigation. However, implementing these approaches in practice encounters challenges such as high overhead, slow responsiveness, and low interpretability and extensibility. Towards practical attack detection and investigation with provenance graphs, we propose TAGS, a tag-propagation-based streaming provenance graph alignment system. Utilizing the tag-based intermediate result caching mechanism alongside carefully crafted propagation rules, we eliminate the need to store and duplicate raw data processing. This approach effectively mitigates in-memory storage requirements and minimizes data processing overhead, facilitating rapid on-stream graph alignment while significantly conserving CPU and memory resources. As a result, TAGS can detect and investigate various cyber-attacks in real-time. Moreover, TAGS allows analysts to customize attack query graphs flexibly to identify extended attacks in data streams. We conduct experimental evaluations on two large-scale public datasets containing 257.42 GB of audit logs with 12 relevant query graphs of varying sizes, covering multiple attack techniques and scenarios. The results demonstrate that TAGS is sufficiently efficient to process 176K events per second while sufficiently accurately identifying all 29 alignments in massive data. Moreover, it can effectively handle the dependency explosion problem with steady, low-level memory consumption (less than 300MB), producing only 3 false positives. Overall, the performance of TAGS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. ",

This typically results in ad-hoc solutions, which may only work for the consensus protocols under consideration. In this work, we aim to safely incorporate neural networks in the ETM to provide a general and flexible solution while ensuring guaranteed performance. To decouple the stability analysis of the consensus protocol from the abstraction of the neural network in the ETM, we first derive design criteria for the consensus and ETM pair, which allow independent analysis of each element under mild constraints. As a result, we propose NN-ETM, a novel ETM featuring a neural network, which provides an all-purpose solution to optimize communication in consensus problems while preserving the stability guarantees of the consensus protocol.

However, the substantial domain divergence between natural and medical images limits the effectiveness of these methodologies in medical anomaly detection. This paper introduces a novel lightweight multi-level adaptation and comparison framework to repurpose the CLIP model for medical anomaly detection. Our approach integrates multiple residual adapters into the pre-trained visual encoder, enabling a stepwise enhancement of visual features across different levels. This multi-level adaptation is guided by multi-level, pixel-wise visual-language feature alignment loss functions, which recalibrate the model's focus from object semantics in natural imagery to anomaly identification in medical images. The adapted features exhibit improved generalization across various medical data types, even in zero-shot scenarios where the model encounters unseen medical modalities and anatomical regions during training. Our experiments on medical anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art models, with an average AUC improvement of 6.24% and 7.33% for anomaly classification, 2.03% and 2.37% for anomaly segmentation, under the zero-shot and few-shot settings, respectively.

However, while most existing approaches prioritize optimizing spatiotemporal representations with advanced detection backbones and early aggregation functions, the crucial issue of adaptive event sampling remains largely unaddressed. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which operate on an event-driven paradigm through sparse spike communication, emerge as a natural fit for addressing this challenge. In this study, we discover that the neural dynamics of spiking neurons align closely with the behavior of an ideal temporal event sampler. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive sampling module that leverages recurrent convolutional SNNs enhanced with temporal memory, facilitating a fully end-to-end learnable framework for event-based detection. Additionally, we introduce Residual Potential Dropout (RPD) and Spike-Aware Training (SAT) to regulate potential distribution and address performance degradation encountered in spike-based sampling modules. Through rigorous testing on neuromorphic datasets for event-based detection, our approach demonstrably surpasses existing state-of-the-art spike-based methods, achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters and time steps. For instance, our method achieves a 4.4\\% mAP improvement on the Gen1 dataset, while requiring 38\\% fewer parameters and three time steps. Moreover, the applicability and effectiveness of our adaptive sampling methodology extend beyond SNNs, as demonstrated through further validation on conventional non-spiking detection models. ",

On the other hand, the research on various new practical anomaly detection settings is limited by the scale of the dataset, posing a risk of overfitting in evaluation results.

It has a larger range of defect area and ratio proportions, making it more challenging than previous datasets.

In addition, beyond the general unsupervised anomaly detection setting, we propose a new setting for Fully Unsupervised Industrial Anomaly Detection (FUIAD) based on the observation that the yield rate in industrial production is usually greater than 60%, which has more practical application value.

    "abstract": "In any spacecraft landing mission, precision soft landing in a fuel-efficient way while also avoiding nearby hazardous terrain is of utmost importance. Very few existing literature have attempted addressing both the problems of precision soft landing and terrain avoidance simultaneously. To this end, an optimal terrain avoidance landing guidance (OTALG) was recently developed, which showed promising performance in avoiding the terrain while consuming near-minimum fuel. However, its performance significantly degrades in the face of external disturbances, indicating lack of robustness. In order to mitigate this problem, in this paper, a novel near fuel-optimal guidance law is developed to avoid terrain and land precisely and softly at the desired landing site, under atmospheric perturbations and thrust deviations and constraints. Expanding the OTALG formulation by using sliding mode control with multiple sliding surfaces (MSS), the presented guidance law, named `MSS-OTALG', improves in terms of precision soft landing accuracy. Further, the sliding parameter is designed to allow the lander to avoid terrain by leaving the trajectory enforced by the sliding mode, and eventually returning to it when the terrain avoidance phase is completed. And finally, the robustness of the MSS-OTALG is established by proving practical fixed-time stability. Extensive numerical simulations are also presented to showcase its performance in terms of terrain avoidance, low fuel consumption and accuracy of precision soft landing. Comparative studies against existing relevant literature validates a balanced trade-off of all these performance measures achieved by the developed MSS-OTALG. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become vitally important in modern recommender systems, effectively improving performance and interpretability. Fundamentally, recommender systems aim to identify user interests based on historical interactions and recommend suitable items. However, existing works overlook two key challenges: (1) an interest corresponds to a potentially large set of related items, and (2) the lack of explicit, fine-grained exploitation of KG information and interest connectivity. This leads to an inability to reflect distinctions between entities and interests when modeling them in a single way. Additionally, the granularity of concepts in the knowledge graphs used for recommendations tends to be coarse, failing to match the fine-grained nature of user interests. This homogenization limits the precise exploitation of knowledge graph data and interest connectivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel embedding-based model called InBox. Specifically, various knowledge graph entities and relations are embedded as points or boxes, while user interests are modeled as boxes encompassing interaction history. Representing interests as boxes enables containing collections of item points related to that interest. We further propose that an interest comprises diverse basic concepts, and box intersection naturally supports concept combination. Across three training steps, InBox significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like HAKG and KGIN on recommendation tasks. Further analysis provides meaningful insights into the variable value of different KG data for recommendations. In summary, InBox advances recommender systems through box-based interest and concept modeling for sophisticated knowledge graph exploitation. ",

    "abstract": "To solve high-dimensional parameter-dependent partial differential equations (pPDEs), a neural network architecture is presented. It is constructed to map parameters of the model data to corresponding finite element solutions. To improve training efficiency and to enable control of the approximation error, the network mimics an adaptive finite element method (AFEM). It outputs a coarse grid solution and a series of corrections as produced in an AFEM, allowing a tracking of the error decay over successive layers of the network. The observed errors are measured by a reliable residual based a posteriori error estimator, enabling the reduction to only few parameters for the approximation in the output of the network. This leads to a problem adapted representation of the solution on locally refined grids. Furthermore, each solution of the AFEM is discretized in a hierarchical basis. For the architecture, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are chosen. The hierarchical basis then allows to handle sparse images for finely discretized meshes. Additionally, as corrections on finer levels decrease in amplitude, i.e., importance for the overall approximation, the accuracy of the network approximation is allowed to decrease successively. This can either be incorporated in the number of generated high fidelity samples used for training or the size of the network components responsible for the fine grid outputs. The architecture is described and preliminary numerical examples are presented. ",

However one of the reasons developers and companies avoid harnessing their full potential is the questionable security of the generated code. This paper first reviews the current state-of-the-art and identifies areas for improvement on this issue. Then, we propose a systematic approach based on prompt-altering methods to achieve better code security of (even proprietary black-box) AI-based code generators such as GitHub Copilot, while minimizing the complexity of the application from the user point-of-view, the computational resources, and operational costs. In sum, we propose and evaluate three prompt altering methods: (1) scenario-specific, (2) iterative, and (3) general clause, while we discuss their combination. Contrary to the audit of code security, the latter two of the proposed methods require no expert knowledge from the user. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods on the GitHub Copilot using the OpenVPN project in realistic scenarios, and we demonstrate that the proposed methods reduce the number of insecure generated code samples by up to 16\\% and increase the number of secure code by up to 8\\%. Since our approach does not require access to the internals of the AI models, it can be in general applied to any AI-based code synthesizer, not only GitHub Copilot. ",

In GBRBM-based anomaly detection, normal and anomalous data are classified based on a score that is identical to an energy function of the marginal GBRBM. However, the classification threshold is difficult to set to an appropriate value, as this score cannot be interpreted. In this study, we propose a measure that improves score's interpretability based on its cumulative distribution, and establish a guideline for setting the threshold using the interpretable measure. The results of numerical experiments show that the guideline is reasonable when setting the threshold solely using normal data points. Moreover, because identifying the measure involves computationally infeasible evaluation of the minimum score value, we also propose an evaluation method for the minimum score based on simulated annealing, which is widely used for optimization problems. The proposed evaluation method was also validated using numerical experiments. ",

In this paper, we introduce the concept of the learning gap, emphasizing its accurate correlation with generalization. Experiments show that the learning gap, in the form of feature maps from the penultimate layer of networks, aligns with variations of generalization performance.

In this work, we expose such vulnerabilities in CLIP's downstream models and show that foundation models can serve as a basis for attacking their downstream systems. In particular, we propose a simple yet effective adversarial attack strategy termed Patch Representation Misalignment (PRM). Solely based on open-sourced CLIP vision encoders, this method produces adversaries that simultaneously fool more than 20 downstream models spanning 4 common vision-language tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image captioning and visual question-answering).

Specifically, we first use a Farthest-Point Sampling (FPS) training strategy to construct a task-relevant style sample representation space for fusing with content features. Then, we propose a dynamic feature extraction module to generate features with diverse styles to improve the performance and effectiveness of the feature extractor. Finally, a domain separation strategy is used to retain domain-related features to help distinguish between real and fake faces.

Recently, various self-supervised category-level pose estimation methods have been proposed to reduce the requirement of the annotated datasets. However, most methods rely on synthetic data or 3D CAD model for self-supervised training, and they are typically limited to addressing single-object pose problems without considering multi-objective tasks or shape reconstruction. To overcome these challenges and limitations, we introduce a diffusion-driven self-supervised network for multi-object shape reconstruction and categorical pose estimation, only leveraging the shape priors. Specifically, to capture the SE(3)-equivariant pose features and 3D scale-invariant shape information, we present a Prior-Aware Pyramid 3D Point Transformer in our network. This module adopts a point convolutional layer with radial-kernels for pose-aware learning and a 3D scale-invariant graph convolution layer for object-level shape representation, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a pretrain-to-refine self-supervised training paradigm to train our network. It enables proposed network to capture the associations between shape priors and observations, addressing the challenge of intra-class shape variations by utilising the diffusion mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets and a self-built dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised category-level baselines and even surpasses some fully-supervised instance-level and category-level methods.

Our algorithm performs well in practice, being able to compute the scanwidth of synthetic networks up to 30 reticulations and 100 leaves within 500 seconds. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic that obtains an average practical approximation ratio of 1.5 on these networks.

Recent advancements in model architectures such as CLIP have enabled researchers to begin studying the interplay between the modalities of text and images in a shared latent space. However, CLIP models fail to handle situations on social media when modalities present in a post expand above two. Social media dynamics often require understanding the interplay between not only text and images, but video as well. In this paper we explore an extension of the contrastive loss function to allow for any number of modalities, and demonstrate its usefulness in trimodal spaces on social media. By extending CLIP into three dimensions we can further aide understanding social media landscapes where all three modalities are present (an increasingly common situation). We use a newly collected public data set of Telegram posts containing all three modalities to train, and then demonstrate the usefulness of, a trimodal model in two OSINT scenarios: classifying a social media artifact post as either pro-Russian or pro-Ukrainian and identifying which account a given artifact originated from. While trimodal CLIP models have been explored before (though not on social media data), we also display a novel quadmodal CLIP model. This model can learn the interplay between text, image, video, and audio. We demonstrate new state-of-the-art baseline results on retrieval for quadmodel models moving forward. ",

For evaluation, we build a simple U-shaped encoder-decoder network, named sU-Net, for glioblastoma segmentation using T1Gd and FLAIR MRI scans, varying the encoder's training method, using FLIM, MS-FLIM, and backpropagation algorithm. Also, we compared these sU-Nets with two State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) deep-learning models using two datasets.

To solve these issues, this paper proposes a new classification-oriented framework DreamDA, which enables data synthesis and label generation by way of diffusion models. DreamDA generates diverse samples that adhere to the original data distribution by considering training images in the original data as seeds and perturbing their reverse diffusion process. In addition, since the labels of the generated data may not align with the labels of their corresponding seed images, we introduce a self-training paradigm for generating pseudo labels and training classifiers using the synthesized data.

In this paper, we develop a freshness-aware block propagation optimization framework for 6G-based Web 3.0. We first propose a novel metric called Age of Block Information (AoBI) based on the concept of age of information to quantify block freshness. To make block propagation optimization tractable, we classify miners into five different states and propose a block propagation model for public blockchains inspired by epidemic models. Moreover, considering that the miners are bounded rational, we propose an incentive mechanism based on the evolutionary game for block propagation to improve block propagation efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with other block propagation mechanisms, the proposed scheme has a higher block forwarding probability, which improves block propagation efficiency. ",

Thus, considerable efforts have been made to quickly and accurately estimate the performances of neural architectures, without full training or evaluation, for given tasks and datasets. Neural architecture encoding has played a crucial role in the estimation, and graphbased methods, which treat an architecture as a graph, have shown prominent performance. For enhanced representation learning of neural architectures, we introduce FlowerFormer, a powerful graph transformer that incorporates the information flows within a neural architecture. FlowerFormer consists of two key components: (a) bidirectional asynchronous message passing, inspired by the flows; (b) global attention built on flow-based masking. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of FlowerFormer over existing neural encoding methods, and its effectiveness extends beyond computer vision models to include graph neural networks and auto speech recognition models.

    "title": "Global-guided Focal Neural Radiance Field for Large-scale Scene  Rendering",
    "abstract": "Neural radiance fields~(NeRF) have recently been applied to render large-scale scenes. However, their limited model capacity typically results in blurred rendering results. Existing large-scale NeRFs primarily address this limitation by partitioning the scene into blocks, which are subsequently handled by separate sub-NeRFs. These sub-NeRFs, trained from scratch and processed independently, lead to inconsistencies in geometry and appearance across the scene. Consequently, the rendering quality fails to exhibit significant improvement despite the expansion of model capacity. In this work, we present global-guided focal neural radiance field (GF-NeRF) that achieves high-fidelity rendering of large-scale scenes. Our proposed GF-NeRF utilizes a two-stage (Global and Focal) architecture and a global-guided training strategy. The global stage obtains a continuous representation of the entire scene while the focal stage decomposes the scene into multiple blocks and further processes them with distinct sub-encoders. Leveraging this two-stage architecture, sub-encoders only need fine-tuning based on the global encoder, thus reducing training complexity in the focal stage while maintaining scene-wide consistency. Spatial information and error information from the global stage also benefit the sub-encoders to focus on crucial areas and effectively capture more details of large-scale scenes. Notably, our approach does not rely on any prior knowledge about the target scene, attributing GF-NeRF adaptable to various large-scale scene types, including street-view and aerial-view scenes. We demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity, natural rendering results on various types of large-scale datasets. Our project page: https://shaomq2187.github.io/GF-NeRF/ ",

    "abstract": "Compositional 3D scene synthesis has diverse applications across a spectrum of industries such as robotics, films, and video games, as it closely mirrors the complexity of real-world multi-object environments. Early works typically employ shape retrieval based frameworks which naturally suffer from limited shape diversity. Recent progresses have been made in shape generation with powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, which increases the shape fidelity. However, these approaches separately treat 3D shape generation and layout generation. The synthesized scenes are usually hampered by layout collision, which implies that the scene-level fidelity is still under-explored. In this paper, we aim at generating realistic and reasonable 3D scenes from scene graph. To enrich the representation capability of the given scene graph inputs, large language model is utilized to explicitly aggregate the global graph features with local relationship features. With a unified graph convolution network (GCN), graph features are extracted from scene graphs updated via joint layout-shape distribution. During scene generation, an IoU-based regularization loss is introduced to constrain the predicted 3D layouts. Benchmarked on the SG-FRONT dataset, our method achieves better 3D scene synthesis, especially in terms of scene-level fidelity. The source code will be released after publication. ",

    "abstract": "Spacecraft operations are highly critical, demanding impeccable reliability and safety. Ensuring the optimal performance of a spacecraft requires the early detection and mitigation of anomalies, which could otherwise result in unit or mission failures. With the advent of deep learning, a surge of interest has been seen in leveraging these sophisticated algorithms for anomaly detection in space operations. This study aims to compare the efficacy of various deep learning architectures in detecting anomalies in spacecraft data. The deep learning models under investigation include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformer-based architectures. Each of these models was trained and validated using a comprehensive dataset sourced from multiple spacecraft missions, encompassing diverse operational scenarios and anomaly types. Initial results indicate that while CNNs excel in identifying spatial patterns and may be effective for some classes of spacecraft data, LSTMs and RNNs show a marked proficiency in capturing temporal anomalies seen in time-series spacecraft telemetry. The Transformer-based architectures, given their ability to focus on both local and global contexts, have showcased promising results, especially in scenarios where anomalies are subtle and span over longer durations. Additionally, considerations such as computational efficiency, ease of deployment, and real-time processing capabilities were evaluated. While CNNs and LSTMs demonstrated a balance between accuracy and computational demands, Transformer architectures, though highly accurate, require significant computational resources. In conclusion, the choice of deep learning architecture for spacecraft anomaly detection is highly contingent on the nature of the data, the type of anomalies, and operational constraints. ",

A global mesh is directly derived from PoNQ by efficiently leveraging the knowledge of the local quadric errors. Besides marking the first use of QEM within a neural shape representation, our contribution guarantees both topological and geometrical properties by ensuring that a PoNQ mesh does not self-intersect and is always the boundary of a volume. Notably, our representation does not rely on a regular grid, is supervised directly by the target surface alone, and also handles open surfaces with boundaries and/or sharp features. We demonstrate the efficacy of PoNQ through a learning-based mesh prediction from SDF grids and show that our method surpasses recent state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both surface and edge-based metrics.

Our study explores the dynamic nature of bot engagement related to Extinction Rebellion climate change protests from 18 November 2019 to 10 December 2019. We find that bots exert a greater influence on human behavior than vice versa during heated online periods. To assess the causal impact of human-bot communication, we compared communication histories between human users who directly interacted with bots and matched human users who did not. Our findings demonstrate a consistent negative impact of bot interactions on subsequent human sentiment, with exposed users displaying significantly more negative sentiment than their counterparts. Furthermore, the nature of bot interaction influences human tweeting activity and the sentiment towards protests. Political astroturfing bots increase activity, whereas other bots decrease it. Sentiment changes towards protests depend on the user's original support level, indicating targeted manipulation. However, bot interactions do not change activists' engagement towards protests. Despite the seemingly minor impact of individual bot encounters, the cumulative effect is profound due to the large volume of bot communication. Our findings underscore the importance of unrestricted access to social media data for studying the prevalence and influence of social bots, as with new technological advancements distinguishing between bots and humans becomes nearly impossible.

We develop a pessimistic model-based algorithm and establish its sample complexity bound under minimal data coverage assumptions, which outperforms prior art by at least $\\tilde{O}(d)$, where $d$ is the feature dimension.

    "abstract": "The 6TiSCH protocol stack was proposed to ensure high-performance communications in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, the lack of sufficient time slots for nodes outside the 6TiSCH's Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) to transmit their Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) messages and cell reservation requests significantly hinders their integration into the DODAG. This oversight not only prolongs the device's join time but also increases energy consumption during the network formation phase. Moreover, challenges emerge due to the substantial number of control packets employed by both the 6TiSCH Scheduling Function (SF) and routing protocol (RPL), thus draining more energy resources, increasing medium contention, and decreasing spatial reuse. Furthermore, an SF that overlooks previously allocated slots when assigning new ones to the same node may increase jitter, and more complications ensue when it neglects the state of the TSCH queue, thus leading to packet dropping due to queue saturation. Additional complexity arises when the RPL disregards the new parent's schedule saturation during parent switching, which results in inefficient energy and time usage. To address these issues, we introduce in this paper novel mechanisms, strategically situated at the intersection of SF and RPL that are designed to balance the control packet distribution and adaptively manage parent switching. Our proposal, implemented within the 6TiSCH simulator, demonstrates significant improvements across vital performance metrics, such as node's joining time, jitter, latency, energy consumption, and amount of traffic, in comparison to the conventional 6TiSCH benchmark.

This transformation allows the capture of intricate texture details within a volume composed of a fixed number of Gaussians. To better optimize the representation of these details, we propose a unique pruning and densifying method named the Candidate Pool Strategy, enhancing detail fidelity through selective optimization.

It initially constructs a basic geometric structure, followed by the prediction of complete Gaussian attributes. Our framework, GVGEN, demonstrates superior performance in qualitative and quantitative assessments compared to existing 3D generation methods. Simultaneously, it maintains a fast generation speed ($\\sim$7 seconds), effectively striking a balance between quality and efficiency. ",

To this end, we propagate the distributional uncertainty of the state through the dynamical system, and, using an affine feedback control law, we steer the ambiguity set of the state to a prescribed, terminal ambiguity set. We also enforce distributionally robust CVaR constraints for the transient motion of the state so as to reside within a prescribed constraint space.

In the past few years, there has been increasing interest in developing self-supervised denoising networks that only require noisy images, without the need for clean ground truth for training.

Additionally, these methods commonly depend on assumptions about noise characteristics, thereby constraining their applicability in real-world scenarios. Inspired by the properties of the Frobenius norm expansion, we discover that incorporating a trace term reduces the optimization goal disparity between self-supervised and supervised methods, thereby enhancing the performance of self-supervised learning. To exploit this insight, we propose a trace-constraint loss function and design the low-trace adaptation Noise2Noise (LoTA-N2N) model that bridges the gap between self-supervised and supervised learning. Furthermore, we have discovered that several existing self-supervised denoising frameworks naturally fall within the proposed trace-constraint loss as subcases. Extensive experiments conducted on natural and confocal image datasets indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance within the realm of zero-shot self-supervised image denoising approaches, without relying on any assumptions regarding the noise.

    "abstract": "The ability to efficiently predict adsorption properties of zeolites can be of large benefit in accelerating the design process of novel materials. The existing configuration space for these materials is wide, while existing molecular simulation methods are computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a model which is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude faster at adsorption properties compared to molecular simulations. To validate the model, we generated datasets containing various aluminium configurations for the MOR, MFI, RHO and ITW zeolites along with their heat of adsorptions and Henry coefficients for CO$_2$, obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. The predictions obtained from the Machine Learning model are in agreement with the values obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations, confirming that the model can be used for property prediction. Furthermore, we show that the model can be used for identifying adsorption sites. Finally, we evaluate the capability of our model for generating novel zeolite configurations by using it in combination with a genetic algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we approach the problem of uncertainty quantification in deep learning through a predictive framework, which captures uncertainty in model parameters by specifying our assumptions about the predictive distribution of unseen future data. Under this view, we show that deep ensembling (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) is a fundamentally mis-specified model class, since it assumes that future data are supported on existing observations only -- a situation rarely encountered in practice. To address this limitation, we propose MixupMP, a method that constructs a more realistic predictive distribution using popular data augmentation techniques. MixupMP operates as a drop-in replacement for deep ensembles, where each ensemble member is trained on a random simulation from this predictive distribution. Grounded in the recently-proposed framework of Martingale posteriors (Fong et al., 2023), MixupMP returns samples from an implicitly defined Bayesian posterior. Our empirical analysis showcases that MixupMP achieves superior predictive performance and uncertainty quantification on various image classification datasets, when compared with existing Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches.
