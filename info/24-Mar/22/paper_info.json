    "abstract": "This article deals with the study of predicting the confinement effect of carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) on concrete cylinder strength using metaheuristics-based artificial neural networks. A detailed database of 708 CFRP confined concrete cylinders is developed from previously published research with information on 8 parameters including geometrical parameters like the diameter (d) and height (h) of a cylinder, unconfined compressive strength of concrete (fco'), thickness (nt), the elastic modulus of CFRP (Ef), unconfined concrete strain confined concrete strain and the ultimate compressive strength of confined concrete fcc'. Three metaheuristic models are implemented including particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), and bat algorithm (BA). These algorithms are trained on the data using an objective function of mean square error and their predicted results are validated against the experimental studies and finite element analysis. The study shows that the hybrid model of PSO predicted the strength of CFRP-confined concrete cylinders with maximum accuracy of 99.13% and GWO predicted the results with an accuracy of 98.17%. The high accuracy of axial compressive strength predictions demonstrated that these prediction models are a reliable solution to the empirical methods. The prediction models are especially suitable for avoiding full-scale time-consuming experimental tests that make the process quick and economical. ",

UAV equipped with the world model can make real-time autonomous decisions and engage in online planning using active inference. During planning, UAV can score different policies based on the expected surprise, allowing it to choose among alternative futures. Additionally, UAV can anticipate the outcomes of its actions using the world model and assess the expected surprise in a self-supervised manner.

We then propose linearly constrained weights (LCW) to reduce the activation shift in both fully connected and convolutional layers. The impact of reducing the activation shift in a neural network is studied from the perspective of how the variance of variables in the network changes through layer operations in both forward and backward chains. We also discuss its relationship to the vanishing gradient problem. Experimental results show that LCW enables a deep feedforward network with sigmoid activation functions to be trained efficiently by resolving the vanishing gradient problem. Moreover, combined with batch normalization, LCW improves generalization performance of both feedforward and convolutional networks. ",

Its adaptability to integrate seamlessly with other relevant applications endows the graph model-based clustering analysis with the ability to robustly extract \"natural associations\" or \"graph structures\" within datasets, facilitating the modelling of relationships between data points. Despite its efficacy, the current clustering method utilizing the graph-based model overlooks the uncertainty associated with random walk access between nodes and the embedded structural information in the data. To address this gap, we present a novel Clustering method for Maximizing Decoding Information within graph-based models, named CMDI. CMDI innovatively incorporates two-dimensional structural information theory into the clustering process, consisting of two phases: graph structure extraction and graph vertex partitioning. Within CMDI, graph partitioning is reformulated as an abstract clustering problem, leveraging maximum decoding information to minimize uncertainty associated with random visits to vertices. Empirical evaluations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CMDI outperforms classical baseline methods, exhibiting a superior decoding information ratio (DI-R). Furthermore, CMDI showcases heightened efficiency, particularly when considering prior knowledge (PK). These findings underscore the effectiveness of CMDI in enhancing decoding information quality and computational efficiency, positioning it as a valuable tool in graph-based clustering analyses. ",

    "abstract": "Overheating anomaly detection is essential for the quality and reliability of parts produced by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM). In this research, we focus on the detection of overheating anomalies using photodiode sensor data. Photodiode sensors can collect high-frequency data from the melt pool, reflecting the process dynamics and thermal history. Hence, the proposed method offers a machine learning (ML) framework to utilize photodiode sensor data for layer-wise detection of overheating anomalies. In doing so, three sets of features are extracted from the raw photodiode data: MSMM (mean, standard deviation, median, maximum), MSQ (mean, standard deviation, quartiles), and MSD (mean, standard deviation, deciles). These three datasets are used to train several ML classifiers. Cost-sensitive learning is used to handle the class imbalance between the \"anomalous\" layers (affected by overheating) and \"nominal\" layers in the benchmark dataset. To boost detection accuracy, our proposed ML framework involves utilizing the majority voting ensemble (MVE) approach. The proposed method is demonstrated using a case study including an open benchmark dataset of photodiode measurements from an LPBF specimen with deliberate overheating anomalies at some layers. The results from the case study demonstrate that the MSD features yield the best performance for all classifiers, and the MVE classifier (with a mean F1-score of 0.8654) surpasses the individual ML classifiers. Moreover, our machine learning methodology achieves superior results (9.66% improvement in mean F1-score) in detecting layer-wise overheating anomalies, surpassing the existing methods in the literature that use the same benchmark dataset.

In the absence of external standards, a model cannot recognize its failure during the training phase. We extend the two-player game of generative adversarial networks to the multi-player game.

To demonstrate CapsNets robustness, we compare their performance with original CNNs on electrocardiogram data, a medical time series sensor data with complex patterns and noise. Our study provides empirical evidence that CapsNets function as noise stabilizers, as investigated by manual and adversarial attack experiments using the fast gradient sign method and three manual attacks, including offset shifting, gradual drift, and temporal lagging. In summary, CapsNets outperform CNNs in both manual and adversarial attacked data. Our findings suggest that CapsNets can be effectively applied to various sensor systems to improve their resilience to noise attacks. These results have significant implications for designing and implementing robust machine learning models in real world applications.

However, most existing methods rely on the access to the label distribution of the groups, which is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. As a result, unsupervised group robustness strategies are sought. Based on the insight that a trained model's classification strategies can be inferred accurately based on explainability heatmaps, we introduce ExMap, an unsupervised two stage mechanism designed to enhance group robustness in traditional classifiers. ExMap utilizes a clustering module to infer pseudo-labels based on a model's explainability heatmaps, which are then used during training in lieu of actual labels. Our empirical studies validate the efficacy of ExMap - We demonstrate that it bridges the performance gap with its supervised counterparts and outperforms existing partially supervised and unsupervised methods. Additionally, ExMap can be seamlessly integrated with existing group robustness learning strategies.

In light of these challenges, we introduce CoMo, a Controllable Motion generation model, adept at accurately generating and editing motions by leveraging the knowledge priors of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, CoMo decomposes motions into discrete and semantically meaningful pose codes, with each code encapsulating the semantics of a body part, representing elementary information such as \"left knee slightly bent\". Given textual inputs, CoMo autoregressively generates sequences of pose codes, which are then decoded into 3D motions. Leveraging pose codes as interpretable representations, an LLM can directly intervene in motion editing by adjusting the pose codes according to editing instructions. Experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves competitive performance in motion generation compared to state-of-the-art models while, in human studies, CoMo substantially surpasses previous work in motion editing abilities.

    "abstract": "Cross-view geo-localization aims at localizing a ground-level query image by matching it to its corresponding geo-referenced aerial view. In real-world scenarios, the task requires accommodating diverse ground images captured by users with varying orientations and reduced field of views (FoVs). However, existing learning pipelines are orientation-specific or FoV-specific, demanding separate model training for different ground view variations. Such models heavily depend on the North-aligned spatial correspondence and predefined FoVs in the training data, compromising their robustness across different settings. To tackle this challenge, we propose ConGeo, a single- and cross-modal Contrastive method for Geo-localization: it enhances robustness and consistency in feature representations to improve a model's invariance to orientation and its resilience to FoV variations, by enforcing proximity between ground view variations of the same location. As a generic learning objective for cross-view geo-localization, when integrated into state-of-the-art pipelines, ConGeo significantly boosts the performance of three base models on four geo-localization benchmarks for diverse ground view variations and outperforms competing methods that train separate models for each ground view variation.

In this work, we present the first successful signal injection attack on a ZIPA system. Most existing ZIPA systems assume there is a negligible amount of influence from the unsecured outside space on the secured inside space. In reality, environmental signals do leak from adjacent unsecured spaces and influence the environment of the secured space. Our attack takes advantage of this fact to perform a signal injection attack on the popular Schurmann & Sigg algorithm.

Indirect encoding methods, where each gene can encode for multiple weights, shorten the genome to reduce the dimensions of the search space and better exploit permutations and symmetries. The Geometric Encoding for Neural network Evolution (GENE) introduced an indirect encoding where the weight of a connection is computed as the (pseudo-)distance between the two linked neurons, leading to a genome size growing linearly with the number of genes instead of quadratically in direct encoding. However GENE still relies on hand-crafted distance functions with no prior optimization. Here we show that better performing distance functions can be found for GENE using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) in a meta-evolution approach, hence optimizing the encoding to create a search space that is easier to exploit. We show that GENE with a learned function can outperform both direct encoding and the hand-crafted distances, generalizing on unseen problems, and we study how the encoding impacts neural network properties.

Fake News (FN) proliferation on online websites and Online Social Networks (OSNs) has increased profusely. Various fact-checking websites include news in English and barely provide information about FN in regional languages. Thus the Urdu FN purveyors cannot be discerned using factchecking portals. SOTA approaches for Fake News Detection (FND) count upon appropriately labelled and large datasets. FND in regional and resource-constrained languages lags due to the lack of limited-sized datasets and legitimate lexical resources. The previous datasets for Urdu FND are limited-sized, domain-restricted, publicly unavailable and not manually verified where the news is translated from English into Urdu. In this paper, we curate and contribute the first largest publicly available dataset for Urdu FND, Ax-to-Grind Urdu, to bridge the identified gaps and limitations of existing Urdu datasets in the literature. It constitutes 10,083 fake and real news on fifteen domains collected from leading and authentic Urdu newspapers and news channel websites in Pakistan and India. FN for the Ax-to-Grind dataset is collected from websites and crowdsourcing. The dataset contains news items in Urdu from the year 2017 to the year 2023. Expert journalists annotated the dataset. We benchmark the dataset with an ensemble model of mBERT,XLNet, and XLM RoBERTa. The selected models are originally trained on multilingual large corpora. The results of the proposed model are based on performance metrics, F1-score, accuracy, precision, recall and MCC value. ",

Based on our interactions via focus groups with the members of four environmental justice communities impacted by a major highway construction, a common concern is a sense of uncertainty about project activities and loss of social connectedness, leading to increased stress, depression, anxiety and diminished well-being. This paper addresses this concern by developing a localized social media system called PureConnect with a goal to raise the level of awareness about the project and increase social connectedness among the community members. PureConnect has been designed using active engagement with four environmental justice communities affected by a major highway construction. It has been deployed in the real world among the members of the four environmental justice communities, and a detailed analysis of the data collected from this deployment as well as surveys show that PureConnect is potentially useful in improving community members' well-being and the members appreciate the functionalities it provides.

    "title": "Adaptive Finite Element Interpolated Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "The use of neural networks to approximate partial differential equations (PDEs) has gained significant attention in recent years. However, the approximation of PDEs with localised phenomena, e.g., sharp gradients and singularities, remains a challenge, due to ill-defined cost functions in terms of pointwise residual sampling or poor numerical integration. In this work, we introduce $h$-adaptive finite element interpolated neural networks. The method relies on the interpolation of a neural network onto a finite element space that is gradually adapted to the solution during the training process to equidistribute a posteriori error indicator. The use of adaptive interpolation is essential in preserving the non-linear approximation capabilities of the neural networks to effectively tackle problems with localised features. The training relies on a gradient-based optimisation of a loss function based on the (dual) norm of the finite element residual of the interpolated neural network. Automatic mesh adaptation (i.e., refinement and coarsening) is performed based on a posteriori error indicators till a certain level of accuracy is reached. The proposed methodology can be applied to indefinite and nonsymmetric problems. We carry out a detailed numerical analysis of the scheme and prove several a priori error estimates, depending on the expressiveness of the neural network compared to the interpolation mesh. Our numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the method in capturing sharp gradients and singularities for forward PDE problems, both in 2D and 3D scenarios. We also show that the proposed preconditioning strategy (i.e., using a dual residual norm of the residual as a cost function) enhances training robustness and accelerates convergence. ",

    "abstract": "Predictions of opaque black-box systems are frequently deployed in high-stakes applications such as healthcare. For such applications, it is crucial to assess how models handle samples beyond the domain of training data. While several metrics and tests exist to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) data from in-distribution (InD) data to a deep neural network (DNN), their performance varies significantly across datasets, models, and tasks, which limits their practical use. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis-driven approach to quantify whether a new sample is InD or OoD. Given a trained DNN and some input, we first feed the input through the DNN and compute an ensemble of OoD metrics, which we term latent responses. We then formulate the OoD detection problem as a hypothesis test between latent responses of different groups, and use permutation-based resampling to infer the significance of the observed latent responses under a null hypothesis. We adapt our method to detect an unseen sample of bacteria to a trained deep learning model, and show that it reveals interpretable differences between InD and OoD latent responses. Our work has implications for systematic novelty detection and informed decision-making from classifiers trained on a subset of labels. ",

With recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL), the performance of SER models has significantly improved. However, designing an optimal DL architecture requires specialised knowledge and experimental assessments. Fortunately, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides a potential solution for automatically determining the best DL model. The Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is a particularly efficient method for discovering optimal models. This study presents emoDARTS, a DARTS-optimised joint CNN and Sequential Neural Network (SeqNN: LSTM, RNN) architecture that enhances SER performance. The literature supports the selection of CNN and LSTM coupling to improve performance. While DARTS has previously been used to choose CNN and LSTM operations independently, our technique adds a novel mechanism for selecting CNN and SeqNN operations in conjunction using DARTS. Unlike earlier work, we do not impose limits on the layer order of the CNN. Instead, we let DARTS choose the best layer order inside the DARTS cell. We demonstrate that emoDARTS outperforms conventionally designed CNN-LSTM models and surpasses the best-reported SER results achieved through DARTS on CNN-LSTM by evaluating our approach on the IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, and MSP-Podcast datasets.

Our team embarked on a knowledge engineering process to develop a causal knowledge base consisting of several causal BNs for diverse aspects of COVID-19. The unique challenges of the setting lead to experiments with the elicitation approach, and what emerged was a knowledge engineering method we call Causal Knowledge Engineering (CKE).

    "abstract": "Human motion prediction is consisting in forecasting future body poses from historically observed sequences. It is a longstanding challenge due to motion's complex dynamics and uncertainty. Existing methods focus on building up complicated neural networks to model the motion dynamics. The predicted results are required to be strictly similar to the training samples with L2 loss in current training pipeline. However, little attention has been paid to the uncertainty property which is crucial to the prediction task. We argue that the recorded motion in training data could be an observation of possible future, rather than a predetermined result. In addition, existing works calculate the predicted error on each future frame equally during training, while recent work indicated that different frames could play different roles. In this work, a novel computationally efficient encoder-decoder model with uncertainty consideration is proposed, which could learn proper characteristics for future frames by a dynamic function. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our uncertainty consideration approach has obvious advantages both in quantity and quality. Moreover, the proposed method could produce motion sequences with much better quality that avoids the intractable shaking artefacts. We believe our work could provide a novel perspective to consider the uncertainty quality for the general motion prediction task and encourage the studies in this field.

Creating forested environment point cloud datasets is expensive, requires high-precision sensors, and is time-consuming as manual point classification is required. Moreover, forest areas could be inaccessible or dangerous for humans, further complicating data collection. Then, a question arises whether it is possible to use synthetic data to train deep learning networks without the need to rely on large volumes of real forest data. To answer this question, we developed a realistic simulator that procedurally generates synthetic forest scenes. Thanks to this, we have conducted a comparative study of different state-of-the-art point-based deep learning networks for forest segmentation.

Numerous research efforts have been dedicated to better incorporate Hough voting into the 3D object detection pipeline. However, due to the noisy, cluttered, and partial nature of real 3D scans, existing voting-based methods often receive votes from the partial surfaces of individual objects together with severe noises, leading to sub-optimal detection performance. In this work, we focus on the distributional properties of point clouds and formulate the voting process as generating new points in the high-density region of the distribution of object centers. To achieve this, we propose a new method to move random 3D points toward the high-density region of the distribution by estimating the score function of the distribution with a noise conditioned score network. Specifically, we first generate a set of object center proposals to coarsely identify the high-density region of the object center distribution. To estimate the score function, we perturb the generated object center proposals by adding normalized Gaussian noise, and then jointly estimate the score function of all perturbed distributions. Finally, we generate new votes by moving random 3D points to the high-density region of the object center distribution according to the estimated score function. Extensive experiments on two large scale indoor 3D scene datasets, SUN RGB-D and ScanNet V2, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.

It is clear that the pivotal factor for successful navigation lies in the comprehensive scene understanding. Previous VLN agents employ monocular frameworks to extract 2D features of perspective views directly. Though straightforward, they struggle for capturing 3D geometry and semantics, leading to a partial and incomplete environment representation. To achieve a comprehensive 3D representation with fine-grained details, we introduce a Volumetric Environment Representation (VER), which voxelizes the physical world into structured 3D cells. For each cell, VER aggregates multi-view 2D features into such a unified 3D space via 2D-3D sampling. Through coarse-to-fine feature extraction and multi-task learning for VER, our agent predicts 3D occupancy, 3D room layout, and 3D bounding boxes jointly. Based on online collected VERs, our agent performs volume state estimation and builds episodic memory for predicting the next step. Experimental results show our environment representations from multi-task learning lead to evident performance gains on VLN.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Passive Transformable Omni-Ball (PTOB), an advanced omnidirectional wheel engineered to enhance step-climbing performance, incorporate built-in actuators, diminish vibrations, and fortify structural integrity. By modifying the omni-ball's structure from two to three segments, we have achieved improved in-wheel actuation and a reduction in vibrational feedback. Additionally, we have implemented a sliding mechanism in the follower wheels to boost the wheel's step-climbing abilities. A prototype with a 127 mm diameter PTOB was constructed, which confirmed its functionality for omnidirectional movement and internal actuation. Compared to a traditional omni-wheel, the PTOB demonstrated a comparable level of vibration while offering superior capabilities. Extensive testing in varied settings showed that the PTOB can adeptly handle step obstacles up to 45 mm, equivalent to 35 $\\%$ of the wheel's diameter, in both the forward and lateral directions. The PTOB showcased robust construction and proved to be versatile in navigating through environments with diverse obstacles. ",

A novelty of this approach is that local online multiscale basis functions are computed rapidly and frequently by utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs). More precisely, we employ the training set of stochastic permeability realizations and the computed relating online multiscale basis functions to train neural networks. The nonlinear map between such permeability fields and online multiscale basis functions is developed by our proposed deep learning algorithm. That is, in a new way, the predicted online multiscale basis functions incorporate the nonlinearity treatment of the Richards equation and refect any time-dependent changes in the problem's properties. Multiple numerical experiments in two-dimensional model problems show the good performance of this technique, in terms of predictions of the online multiscale basis functions and thus finding solutions.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown tremendous success in following user instructions and generating helpful responses. Nevertheless, their robustness is still far from optimal, as they may generate significantly inconsistent responses due to minor changes in the verbalized instructions. Recent literature has explored this inconsistency issue, highlighting the importance of continued improvement in the robustness of response generation. However, systematic analysis and solutions are still lacking. In this paper, we quantitatively define the inconsistency problem and propose a two-stage training framework consisting of instruction-augmented supervised fine-tuning and consistency alignment training. The first stage helps a model generalize on following instructions via similar instruction augmentations. In the second stage, we improve the diversity and help the model understand which responses are more aligned with human expectations by differentiating subtle differences in similar responses. The training process is accomplished by self-rewards inferred from the trained model at the first stage without referring to external human preference resources. We conduct extensive experiments on recent publicly available LLMs on instruction-following tasks and demonstrate the effectiveness of our training framework. ",

    "abstract": "Traditional approaches to neuroevolution often start from scratch. This becomes prohibitively expensive in terms of computational and data requirements when targeting modern, deep neural networks. Using a warm start could be highly advantageous, e.g., using previously trained networks, potentially from different sources. This moreover enables leveraging the benefits of transfer learning (in particular vastly reduced training effort). However, recombining trained networks is non-trivial because architectures and feature representations typically differ. Consequently, a straightforward exchange of layers tends to lead to a performance breakdown. We overcome this by matching the layers of parent networks based on their connectivity, identifying potential crossover points. To correct for differing feature representations between these layers we employ stitching, which merges the networks by introducing new layers at crossover points. To train the merged network, only stitching layers need to be considered. New networks can then be created by selecting a subnetwork by choosing which stitching layers to (not) use. Assessing their performance is efficient as only their evaluation on data is required. We experimentally show that our approach enables finding networks that represent novel trade-offs between performance and computational cost, with some even dominating the original networks. ",

Most recent studies predict counterfactual outcomes by learning a covariate representation that is independent of the treatment variable. However, such independence constraints neglect much of the covariate information that is useful for counterfactual prediction, especially when the treatment variables are continuous. To tackle the above issue, in this paper, we first theoretically demonstrate the importance of the balancing and prognostic representations for unbiased estimation of the heterogeneous dose-response curves, that is, the learned representations are constrained to satisfy the conditional independence between the covariates and both of the treatment variables and the potential responses. Based on this, we propose a novel Contrastive balancing Representation learning Network using a partial distance measure, called CRNet, for estimating the heterogeneous dose-response curves without losing the continuity of treatments. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrating that our proposal significantly outperforms previous methods. ",

Training with noisy data is an inevitable problem in real-world anomaly detection but is seldom discussed. This paper considers label-level noise in image sensory anomaly detection for the first time. To solve this problem, we proposed a memory-based unsupervised AD method, SoftPatch, which efficiently denoises the data at the patch level. Noise discriminators are utilized to generate outlier scores for patch-level noise elimination before coreset construction. The scores are then stored in the memory bank to soften the anomaly detection boundary. Compared with existing methods, SoftPatch maintains a strong modeling ability of normal data and alleviates the overconfidence problem in coreset. Comprehensive experiments in various noise scenes demonstrate that SoftPatch outperforms the state-of-the-art AD methods on the MVTecAD and BTAD benchmarks and is comparable to those methods under the setting without noise.

Our extensive experiments on two widely used corpora, AMI and DIHARD, reveal the performance trend of speaker diarization in the presence of domain mismatch. We observe that the performance difference between two different domain conditions can be attributed to the role of spectral clustering. In particular, keeping other modules unchanged, we show that differences in optimal tuning parameters as well as speaker count estimation originates due to the mismatch.

This is certainly a massive threat to the environment. To tackle this challenge, this study presents a novel framework for audio deepfake detection that can be seamlessly trained using standard CPU resources.

However, they face challenges when dealing with high computational complexity and multi-view head poses in real-world scenarios. We introduce a lightweight attentional network incorporating multi-scale feature fusion (LANMSFF) to tackle these issues. For the first challenge, we have carefully designed a lightweight fully convolutional network (FCN). We address the second challenge by presenting two novel components, namely mass attention (MassAtt) and point wise feature selection (PWFS) blocks. The MassAtt block simultaneously generates channel and spatial attention maps to recalibrate feature maps by emphasizing important features while suppressing irrelevant ones. On the other hand, the PWFS block employs a feature selection mechanism that discards less meaningful features prior to the fusion process. This mechanism distinguishes it from previous methods that directly fuse multi-scale features.

However, designing specific tasks for each type of graph data is often costly and lacks generalizability. Recent endeavors under the \"Pre-training + Fine-tuning\" or \"Pre-training + Prompt\" paradigms aim to design a unified framework capable of generalizing across multiple graph tasks. Among these, graph autoencoders (GAEs), generative self-supervised models, have demonstrated their potential in effectively addressing various graph tasks. Nevertheless, these methods typically employ multi-stage training and require adaptive designs, which on one hand make it difficult to be seamlessly applied to diverse graph tasks and on the other hand overlook the negative impact caused by discrepancies in task objectives between the different stages. To address these challenges, we propose GA^2E, a unified adversarially masked autoencoder capable of addressing the above challenges seamlessly. Specifically, GA^2E proposes to use the subgraph as the meta-structure, which remains consistent across all graph tasks (ranging from node-, edge-, and graph-level to transfer learning) and all stages (both during training and inference). Further, GA^2E operates in a \\textbf{\"Generate then Discriminate\"} manner. It leverages the masked GAE to reconstruct the input subgraph whilst treating it as a generator to compel the reconstructed graphs resemble the input subgraph. Furthermore, GA^2E introduces an auxiliary discriminator to discern the authenticity between the reconstructed (generated) subgraph and the input subgraph, thus ensuring the robustness of the graph representation through adversarial training mechanisms. We validate GA^2E's capabilities through extensive experiments on 21 datasets across four types of graph tasks. ",

In this paper, we propose LLM4GraphGen to explore the ability of LLMs for graph generation with systematical task designs and extensive experiments. Specifically, we propose several tasks tailored with comprehensive experiments to address key questions regarding LLMs' understanding of different graph structure rules, their ability to capture structural type distributions, and their utilization of domain knowledge for property-based graph generation. Our evaluations demonstrate that LLMs, particularly GPT-4, exhibit preliminary abilities in graph generation tasks, including rule-based and distribution-based generation. We also observe that popular prompting methods, such as few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting, do not consistently enhance performance. Besides, LLMs show potential in generating molecules with specific properties. These findings may serve as foundations for designing good LLMs based models for graph generation and provide valuable insights and further research. ",

Additionally, in light of the emergence of custom-band multispectral cameras, the present research outlines a strategy for identifying the specific wavelengths necessary for effective bee-mite separation, suitable for implementation in a custom-band camera.

To study this task, we present WikiFactDiff, a dataset that describes the evolution of factual knowledge between two dates as a collection of simple facts divided into three categories: new, obsolete, and static. We describe several update scenarios arising from various combinations of these three types of basic update. The facts are represented by subject-relation-object triples; indeed, WikiFactDiff was constructed by comparing the state of the Wikidata knowledge base at 4 January 2021 and 27 February 2023. Those fact are accompanied by verbalization templates and cloze tests that enable running update algorithms and their evaluation metrics. Contrary to other datasets, such as zsRE and CounterFact, WikiFactDiff constitutes a realistic update setting that involves various update scenarios, including replacements, archival, and new entity insertions.

    "abstract": "In federated learning, data heterogeneity significantly impacts performance. A typical solution involves segregating these parameters into shared and personalized components, a concept also relevant in multi-task learning. Addressing this, we propose \"Loop Improvement\" (LI), a novel method enhancing this separation and feature extraction without necessitating a central server or data interchange among participants. Our experiments reveal LI's superiority in several aspects: In personalized federated learning environments, LI consistently outperforms the advanced FedALA algorithm in accuracy across diverse scenarios. Additionally, LI's feature extractor closely matches the performance achieved when aggregating data from all clients. In global model contexts, employing LI with stacked personalized layers and an additional network also yields comparable results to combined client data scenarios. Furthermore, LI's adaptability extends to multi-task learning, streamlining the extraction of common features across tasks and obviating the need for simultaneous training. This approach not only enhances individual task performance but also achieves accuracy levels on par with classic multi-task learning methods where all tasks are trained simultaneously. LI integrates a loop topology with layer-wise and end-to-end training, compatible with various neural network models. This paper also delves into the theoretical underpinnings of LI's effectiveness, offering insights into its potential applications. The code is on https://github.com/axedge1983/LI ",

In the EEA-ENB, particular attention is dedicated to Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC), whose application is often limited to small and homogeneous test cases due to the lack of standardized large-scale scenarios for testing, and due to the large computation time required to obtain a centralized MPC action for performance comparison with DMPC strategies under consideration. The second problem is exacerbated when the scale of the system grows. To address these challenges and to provide a real-world-based and control-independent benchmark, the EEA-ENB has been developed.

The classical methods which rely on user-item interaction matrices has limitations, especially in scenarios where there is a lack of interaction data for new items. Knowledge graph (KG)-based recommendation systems have emerged as a promising solution. However, most KG-based methods adopt node embeddings, which do not provide personalized recommendations for different users and cannot generalize well to the new items. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-enhanced User-Centric subgraph Network (KUCNet), a subgraph learning approach with graph neural network (GNN) for effective recommendation. KUCNet constructs a U-I subgraph for each user-item pair that captures both the historical information of user-item interactions and the side information provided in KG. An attention-based GNN is designed to encode the U-I subgraphs for recommendation. Considering efficiency, the pruned user-centric computation graph is further introduced such that multiple U-I subgraphs can be simultaneously computed and that the size can be pruned by Personalized PageRank. Our proposed method achieves accurate, efficient, and interpretable recommendations especially for new items. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of KUCNet over state-of-the-art KG-based and collaborative filtering (CF)-based methods. ",

Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy, their size can be effectively reduced by \"tensorization\" while maintaining accuracy. Tensorization consists of replacing the convolution kernels with compact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or quantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly training the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards low-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the accuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how truncating the convolution kernels of dense (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we truncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50 pre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We found that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be truncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but not in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation compression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how information is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated models could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs of re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of convolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum. Our results can be applied to tensorize and compress CNN models more effectively. ",

Current technologies typically employ knowledge editing methods or specific prompts to modify LM outputs. However, existing knowledge editing methods are costly and inefficient, struggling to produce appropriate text. Additionally, prompt engineering is opaque and requires significant effort to find suitable prompts. To address these issues, we introduce a new method called PSPEM (Prefix Soft Prompt Editing Method), that can be used for a lifetime with just one training. It resolves the inefficiencies and generalizability issues in knowledge editing methods and overcomes the opacity of prompt engineering by automatically seeking optimal soft prompts. Specifically, PSPEM utilizes a prompt encoder and an encoding converter to refine key information in prompts and uses prompt alignment techniques to guide model generation, ensuring text consistency and adherence to the intended structure and content, thereby maintaining an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy. We have validated the effectiveness of PSPEM through knowledge editing and attribute inserting. On the COUNTERFACT dataset, PSPEM achieved nearly 100\\% editing accuracy and demonstrated the highest level of fluency. We further analyzed the similarities between PSPEM and original prompts and their impact on the model's internals. The results indicate that PSPEM can serve as an alternative to original prompts, supporting the model in effective editing. ",

Similar to existing regularized adaptive methods, the subproblem for computing the update direction of RAMDA involves a nonsmooth regularizer and a diagonal preconditioner, and therefore does not possess a closed-form solution in general. We thus also carefully devise an implementable inexactness condition that retains convergence guarantees similar to the exact versions, and propose a companion efficient solver for the subproblems of both RAMDA and existing methods to make them practically feasible. We leverage the theory of manifold identification in variational analysis to show that, even in the presence of such inexactness, the iterates of RAMDA attain the ideal structure induced by the regularizer at the stationary point of asymptotic convergence. This structure is locally optimal near the point of convergence, so RAMDA is guaranteed to obtain the best structure possible among all methods converging to the same point, making it the first regularized adaptive method outputting models that possess outstanding predictive performance while being (locally) optimally structured. Extensive numerical experiments in large-scale modern computer vision, language modeling, and speech tasks show that the proposed RAMDA is efficient and consistently outperforms state of the art for training structured neural network.

When dealing with few-shot settings, i.e. with a small set of input views, the training could overfit those views, leading to artifacts and geometric and chromatic inconsistencies in the resulting rendering. Regularization is a valid solution that helps NeRF generalization. On the other hand, each of the most recent NeRF regularization techniques aim to mitigate a specific rendering problem. Starting from this observation, in this paper we propose CombiNeRF, a framework that synergically combines several regularization techniques, some of them novel, in order to unify the benefits of each. In particular, we regularize single and neighboring rays distributions and we add a smoothness term to regularize near geometries. After these geometric approaches, we propose to exploit Lipschitz regularization to both NeRF density and color networks and to use encoding masks for input features regularization. We show that CombiNeRF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with few-shot settings in several publicly available datasets. We also present an ablation study on the LLFF and NeRF-Synthetic datasets that support the choices made. We release with this paper the open-source implementation of our framework. ",

Federated learning has gained significant research interest in recent years as a result. Current research on federated learning primarily focuses on preserving privacy during the training phase. However, model evaluation has not been adequately addressed, despite the potential for significant privacy leaks during this phase as well. In this paper, we demonstrate that the state-of-the-art AUC computation method for federated learning systems, which utilizes differential privacy, still leaks sensitive information about the test data while also requiring a trusted central entity to perform the computations. More importantly, we show that the performance of this method becomes completely unusable as the data size decreases. In this context, we propose an efficient, accurate, robust, and more secure evaluation algorithm capable of computing the AUC in horizontal federated learning systems. Our approach not only enhances security compared to the current state-of-the-art but also surpasses the state-of-the-art AUC computation method in both approximation performance and computational robustness, as demonstrated by experimental results. To illustrate, our approach can efficiently calculate the AUC of a federated learning system involving 100 parties, achieving 99.93% accuracy in just 0.68 seconds, regardless of data size, while providing complete data privacy.

    "abstract": "Safe and efficient object manipulation is a key enabler of many real-world robot applications. However, this is challenging because robot operation must be robust to a range of sensor and actuator uncertainties. In this paper, we present a physics-informed causal-inference-based framework for a robot to probabilistically reason about candidate actions in a block stacking task in a partially observable setting. We integrate a physics-based simulation of the rigid-body system dynamics with a causal Bayesian network (CBN) formulation to define a causal generative probabilistic model of the robot decision-making process. Using simulation-based Monte Carlo experiments, we demonstrate our framework's ability to successfully: (1) predict block tower stability with high accuracy (Pred Acc: 88.6%); and, (2) select an approximate next-best action for the block stacking task, for execution by an integrated robot system, achieving 94.2% task success rate. We also demonstrate our framework's suitability for real-world robot systems by demonstrating successful task executions with a domestic support robot, with perception and manipulation sub-system integration. Hence, we show that by embedding physics-based causal reasoning into robots' decision-making processes, we can make robot task execution safer, more reliable, and more robust to various types of uncertainty.

This lets us estimate the likelihood of test videos and detect video anomalies by thresholding the likelihood estimates. We train our video anomaly detector using a modification of denoising score matching, a method that injects training data with noise to facilitate modeling its distribution. To eliminate hyperparameter selection, we model the distribution of noisy video features across a range of noise levels and introduce a regularizer that tends to align the models for different levels of noise. At test time, we combine anomaly indications at multiple noise scales with a Gaussian mixture model. Running our video anomaly detector induces minimal delays as inference requires merely extracting the features and forward-propagating them through a shallow neural network and a Gaussian mixture model. Our experiments on five popular video anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, both in the object-centric and in the frame-centric setup. ",

However, as a more practical scenario, aerial-ground person re-identification (AGPReID) among heterogeneous cameras has received minimal attention. To alleviate the disruption of discriminative identity representation by dramatic view discrepancy as the most significant challenge in AGPReID, the view-decoupled transformer (VDT) is proposed as a simple yet effective framework. Two major components are designed in VDT to decouple view-related and view-unrelated features, namely hierarchical subtractive separation and orthogonal loss, where the former separates these two features inside the VDT, and the latter constrains these two to be independent. In addition, we contribute a large-scale AGPReID dataset called CARGO, consisting of five/eight aerial/ground cameras, 5,000 identities, and 108,563 images. Experiments on two datasets show that VDT is a feasible and effective solution for AGPReID, surpassing the previous method on mAP/Rank1 by up to 5.0%/2.7% on CARGO and 3.7%/5.2% on AG-ReID, keeping the same magnitude of computational complexity.

In particular, channel transformations (e.g., solarize, grayscale, brightness adjustments) are integrated into data augmentation pipelines for remote sensing (RS) image classification tasks. However, contradicting beliefs exist about their proper applications to RS images. A common point of critique is that the application of channel augmentation techniques may lead to physically inconsistent spectral data (i.e., pixel signatures). To shed light on the open debate, we propose an approach to estimate whether a channel augmentation technique affects the physical information of RS images. To this end, the proposed approach estimates a score that measures the alignment of a pixel signature within a time series that can be naturally subject to deviations caused by factors such as acquisition conditions or phenological states of vegetation. We compare the scores associated with original and augmented pixel signatures to evaluate the physical consistency. Experimental results on a multi-label image classification task show that channel augmentations yielding a score that exceeds the expected deviation of original pixel signatures can not improve the performance of a baseline model trained without augmentation.

Our approach builds on the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, which optimizes a set of 3D Gaussians to approximate a radiance field from images. We propose first extracting a base mesh from Gaussians during optimization, then building and refining an adaptive layer of Gaussians with a variable thickness around the mesh to better capture the fine details and volumetric effects near the surface, such as hair or grass. We call this layer Gaussian Frosting, as it resembles a coating of frosting on a cake. The fuzzier the material, the thicker the frosting. We also introduce a parameterization of the Gaussians to enforce them to stay inside the frosting layer and automatically adjust their parameters when deforming, rescaling, editing or animating the mesh. Our representation allows for efficient rendering using Gaussian splatting, as well as editing and animation by modifying the base mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various synthetic and real scenes, and show that it outperforms existing surface-based approaches.

However, many concerns regarding the credibility of these offsetting claims have been raised. Moreover, the credit market is manual, therefore inefficient and unscalable, and non-fungible, therefore illiquid. To address these issues, we propose an efficient digital methodology that combines remote sensing data, modern econometric techniques, and on-chain certification and trading to create a new digital carbon asset (the PACT stablecoin) against which carbon offsetting claims can be transparently verified. PACT stablecoins are produced as outputs from a reproducible computational pipeline for estimating the climate benefits of carbon offset projects that not only quantifies the CO2 emissions involved, but also allows for similar credits to be pooled based on their co-benefits such as biodiversity and jurisdictional attributes, increasing liquidity through fungibility within pools. We implement and evaluate the PACT carbon stablecoin on the Tezos blockchain, which is designed to facilitate low-cost transactions while minimizing environmental impact. Our implementation includes a contract for a registry for tracking issuance, ownership, and retirement of credits, and a custodian contract to bridge on-chain and off-chain transactions. Our work brings scale and trust to the voluntary carbon market by providing a transparent, scalable, and efficient framework for high integrity carbon credit transactions. ",

We examine the accuracy of this estimate for different network structures and compare it to the true change in $\\lambda$ after an edge removal or edge addition. We then derive a first-order approximation of the change in the leading eigenvector. We also consider the effects of edge additions on Kuramoto dynamics on networks, and we express the Kuramoto order parameter in terms of dynamical importance.

We begin with substituting the built-in algorithm in AIRL with soft actor-critic (SAC) during the policy optimization process to enhance sample efficiency, thanks to the off-policy formulation of SAC and identifiable Markov decision process (MDP) models with respect to AIRL. It indeed exhibits a significant improvement in policy imitation but accidentally brings drawbacks to transferable reward recovery. To learn this issue, we illustrate that the SAC algorithm itself is not feasible to disentangle the reward function comprehensively during the AIRL training process, and propose a hybrid framework, PPO-AIRL + SAC, for satisfactory transfer effect. Additionally, we analyze the capability of environments to extract disentangled rewards from an algebraic theory perspective. ",

Recognizing the complementary strengths and weaknesses of both text and visual prompts, we introduce T-Rex2 that synergizes both prompts within a single model through contrastive learning. T-Rex2 accepts inputs in diverse formats, including text prompts, visual prompts, and the combination of both, so that it can handle different scenarios by switching between the two prompt modalities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that T-Rex2 exhibits remarkable zero-shot object detection capabilities across a wide spectrum of scenarios. We show that text prompts and visual prompts can benefit from each other within the synergy, which is essential to cover massive and complicated real-world scenarios and pave the way towards generic object detection.

    "abstract": "In the image acquisition process, various forms of degradation, including noise, haze, and rain, are frequently introduced. These degradations typically arise from the inherent limitations of cameras or unfavorable ambient conditions. To recover clean images from degraded versions, numerous specialized restoration methods have been developed, each targeting a specific type of degradation. Recently, all-in-one algorithms have garnered significant attention by addressing different types of degradations within a single model without requiring prior information of the input degradation type. However, these methods purely operate in the spatial domain and do not delve into the distinct frequency variations inherent to different degradation types. To address this gap, we propose an adaptive all-in-one image restoration network based on frequency mining and modulation. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different degradation types impact the image content on different frequency subbands, thereby requiring different treatments for each restoration task. Specifically, we first mine low- and high-frequency information from the input features, guided by the adaptively decoupled spectra of the degraded image. The extracted features are then modulated by a bidirectional operator to facilitate interactions between different frequency components. Finally, the modulated features are merged into the original input for a progressively guided restoration. With this approach, the model achieves adaptive reconstruction by accentuating the informative frequency subbands according to different input degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different image restoration tasks, including denoising, dehazing, deraining, motion deblurring, and low-light image enhancement.

Contemporary approaches typically leverage 2D machine-generated segments, integrating them for 3D consistency. While the majority of these methods are based on NeRFs, they face a potential weakness that the instance/semantic embedding features derive from independent MLPs, thus preventing the segmentation network from learning the geometric details of the objects directly through radiance and density. In this paper, we propose ClusteringSDF, a novel approach to achieve both segmentation and reconstruction in 3D via the neural implicit surface representation, specifically Signal Distance Function (SDF), where the segmentation rendering is directly integrated with the volume rendering of neural implicit surfaces. Although based on ObjectSDF++, ClusteringSDF no longer requires the ground-truth segments for supervision while maintaining the capability of reconstructing individual object surfaces, but purely with the noisy and inconsistent labels from pre-trained models.As the core of ClusteringSDF, we introduce a high-efficient clustering mechanism for lifting the 2D labels to 3D and the experimental results on the challenging scenes from ScanNet and Replica datasets show that ClusteringSDF can achieve competitive performance compared against the state-of-the-art with significantly reduced training time.

It is shown in this paper that approaches based on reinforcement learning (RL) can be adapted based on any \"surrogate information state\" that is adapted to the observations. Hence we are left to choose both the surrogate information state process and the algorithm. For the former, it is argued that there are many choices available, based on a rich theory of asymptotic statistics for QCD. Two approaches to RL design are considered: (i) Stochastic gradient descent based on an actor-critic formulation. Theory is largely complete for this approach: the algorithm is unbiased, and will converge to a local minimum. However, it is shown that variance of stochastic gradients can be very large, necessitating the need for commensurately long run times; (ii) Q-learning algorithms based on a version of the projected Bellman equation. It is shown that the algorithm is stable, in the sense of bounded sample paths, and that a solution to the projected Bellman equation exists under mild conditions.

    "abstract": "Several causal discovery algorithms have been proposed. However, when the sample size is small relative to the number of variables, the accuracy of estimating causal graphs using existing methods decreases. And some methods are not feasible when the sample size is smaller than the number of variables. To circumvent these problems, some researchers proposed causal structure learning algorithms using divide-and-conquer approaches. For learning the entire causal graph, the approaches first split variables into several subsets according to the conditional independence relationships among the variables, then apply a conventional causal discovery algorithm to each subset and merge the estimated results. Since the divide-and-conquer approach reduces the number of variables to which a causal structure learning algorithm is applied, it is expected to improve the estimation accuracy of causal graphs, especially when the sample size is small relative to the number of variables and the model is sparse. However, existing methods are either computationally expensive or do not provide sufficient accuracy when the sample size is small. This paper proposes a new algorithm for grouping variables based the ancestral relationships among the variables, under the LiNGAM assumption, where the causal relationships are linear, and the mutually independent noise are distributed as continuous non-Gaussian distributions. We call the proposed algorithm CAG. The time complexity of the ancestor finding in CAG is shown to be cubic to the number of variables. Extensive computer experiments confirm that the proposed method outperforms the original DirectLiNGAM without grouping variables and other divide-and-conquer approaches not only in estimation accuracy but also in computation time when the sample size is small relative to the number of variables and the model is sparse.

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art approach for semi-supervised anomalous sound detection is to first learn an embedding space by using auxiliary classification tasks based on meta information or self-supervised learning and then estimate the distribution of normal data. In this work, AdaProj a novel loss function is presented. In contrast to commonly used angular margin losses, which project data of each class as close as possible to their corresponding class centers, AdaProj learns to project data onto class-specific subspaces. By doing so, the resulting distributions of embeddings belonging to normal data are not required to be as restrictive as other loss functions allowing a more detailed view on the data. In experiments conducted on the DCASE2022 and DCASE2023 datasets, it is shown that using AdaProj to learn an embedding space significantly outperforms other commonly used loss functions and results in a state-of-the-art performance on the DCASE2023 dataset.

    "abstract": "Quantum artificial intelligence is a frontier of artificial intelligence research, pioneering quantum AI-powered circuits to address problems beyond the reach of deep learning with classical architectures. This work implements a large-scale quantum-activated recurrent neural network possessing more than 3 trillion hardware nodes/cm$^2$, originating from repeatable atomic-scale nucleation dynamics in an amorphous material integrated on-chip, controlled with 0.07 nW electric power per readout channel. Compared to the best-performing reservoirs currently reported, this implementation increases the scale of the network by two orders of magnitude and reduces the power consumption by six, reaching power efficiencies in the range of the human brain, dissipating 0.2 nW/neuron. When interrogated by a classical input, the chip implements a large-scale hardware security model, enabling dictionary-free authentication secure against statistical inference attacks, including AI's present and future development, even for an adversary with a copy of all the classical components available. Experimental tests report 99.6% reliability, 100% user authentication accuracy, and an ideal 50% key uniqueness. Due to its quantum nature, the chip supports a bit density per feature size area three times higher than the best technology available, with the capacity to store more than $2^{1104}$ keys in a footprint of 1 cm$^2$. Such a quantum-powered platform could help counteract the emerging form of warfare led by the cybercrime industry in breaching authentication to target small to large-scale facilities, from private users to intelligent energy grids.

There have been several studies on the properties of posterior concentrations of BNNs. However, most of these studies only demonstrate results in BNN models with sparse or heavy-tailed priors. Surprisingly, no theoretical results currently exist for BNNs using Gaussian priors, which are the most commonly used one. The lack of theory arises from the absence of approximation results of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that are non-sparse and have bounded parameters. In this paper, we present a new approximation theory for non-sparse DNNs with bounded parameters. Additionally, based on the approximation theory, we show that BNNs with non-sparse general priors can achieve near-minimax optimal posterior concentration rates to the true model. ",

The detection pipeline uses Gal-DINO computer-vision networks (Gupta et al., 2024) to predict the categories of radio morphology and bounding boxes for radio sources, as well as their potential infrared host positions. The Gal-DINO network is trained and evaluated on approximately 5,000 visually inspected radio galaxies and their infrared hosts, encompassing both compact and extended radio morphologies. We find that the Intersection over Union (IoU) for the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes is larger than 0.5 for 99% of the radio sources, and 98% of predicted host positions are within $3^{\\prime \\prime}$ of the ground truth infrared host in the evaluation set. The catalogue construction pipeline uses the predictions of the trained network on the radio and infrared image cutouts based on the catalogue of radio components identified using the Selavy source finder algorithm. Confidence scores of the predictions are then used to prioritize Selavy components with higher scores and incorporate them first into the catalogue. This results in identifications for a total of 211,625 radio sources, with 201,211 classified as compact and unresolved. The remaining 10,414 are categorized as extended radio morphologies, including 582 FR-I, 5,602 FR-II, 1,494 FR-x (uncertain whether FR-I or FR-II), 2,375 R (single-peak resolved) radio galaxies, and 361 with peculiar and other rare morphologies. We cross-match the radio sources in the catalogue with the infrared and optical catalogues, finding infrared cross-matches for 73% and photometric redshifts for 36% of the radio galaxies. ",

Most existing solutions operate in an offline fashion and are not suited to the low-latency causal processing constraints imposed by applications in live-streamed content such as augmented hearing. We introduce a family of context-aware low-latency causal TSE models suitable for real-time processing. First, we explore the utility of context by providing the TSE model with oracle information about what sound classes make up the input mixture, where the objective of the model is to extract one or more sources of interest indicated by the user. Since the practical applications of oracle models are limited due to their assumptions, we introduce a composite multi-task training objective involving separation and classification losses. Our evaluation involving single- and multi-source extraction shows the benefit of using context information in the model either by means of providing full context or via the proposed multi-task training loss without the need for full context information. Specifically, we show that our proposed model outperforms size- and latency-matched Waveformer, a state-of-the-art model for real-time TSE. ",

    "abstract": "Supervised deep learning techniques show promise in medical image analysis. However, they require comprehensive annotated data sets, which poses challenges, particularly for rare diseases. Consequently, unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) emerges as a viable alternative for pathology segmentation, as only healthy data is required for training. However, recent UAD anomaly scoring functions often focus on intensity only and neglect structural differences, which impedes the segmentation performance. This work investigates the potential of Structural Similarity (SSIM) to bridge this gap. SSIM captures both intensity and structural disparities and can be advantageous over the classical $l1$ error. However, we show that there is more than one optimal kernel size for the SSIM calculation for different pathologies. Therefore, we investigate an adaptive ensembling strategy for various kernel sizes to offer a more pathology-agnostic scoring mechanism. We demonstrate that this ensembling strategy can enhance the performance of DMs and mitigate the sensitivity to different kernel sizes across varying pathologies, highlighting its promise for brain MRI anomaly detection.

    "abstract": "The integration of deep learning techniques with biophotonic setups has opened new horizons in bioimaging. A compelling trend in this field involves deliberately compromising certain measurement metrics to engineer better bioimaging tools in terms of cost, speed, and form-factor, followed by compensating for the resulting defects through the utilization of deep learning models trained on a large amount of ideal, superior or alternative data. This strategic approach has found increasing popularity due to its potential to enhance various aspects of biophotonic imaging. One of the primary motivations for employing this strategy is the pursuit of higher temporal resolution or increased imaging speed, critical for capturing fine dynamic biological processes. This approach also offers the prospect of simplifying hardware requirements/complexities, thereby making advanced imaging standards more accessible in terms of cost and/or size. This article provides an in-depth review of the diverse measurement aspects that researchers intentionally impair in their biophotonic setups, including the point spread function, signal-to-noise ratio, sampling density, and pixel resolution. By deliberately compromising these metrics, researchers aim to not only recuperate them through the application of deep learning networks, but also bolster in return other crucial parameters, such as the field-of-view, depth-of-field, and space-bandwidth product. Here, we discuss various biophotonic methods that have successfully employed this strategic approach. These techniques span broad applications and showcase the versatility and effectiveness of deep learning in the context of compromised biophotonic data. Finally, by offering our perspectives on the future possibilities of this rapidly evolving concept, we hope to motivate our readers to explore novel ways of balancing hardware compromises with compensation via AI.

    "abstract": "The estimation of causal effects with observational data continues to be a very active research area. In recent years, researchers have developed new frameworks which use machine learning to relax classical assumptions necessary for the estimation of causal effects. In this paper, we review one of the most prominent methods - \"double/debiased machine learning\" (DML) - and empirically evaluate it by comparing its performance on simulated data relative to more traditional statistical methods, before applying it to real-world data. Our findings indicate that the application of a suitably flexible machine learning algorithm within DML improves the adjustment for various nonlinear confounding relationships. This advantage enables a departure from traditional functional form assumptions typically necessary in causal effect estimation. However, we demonstrate that the method continues to critically depend on standard assumptions about causal structure and identification. When estimating the effects of air pollution on housing prices in our application, we find that DML estimates are consistently larger than estimates of less flexible methods. From our overall results, we provide actionable recommendations for specific choices researchers must make when applying DML in practice. ",

    "abstract": "In minimally invasive endovascular procedures, contrast-enhanced angiography remains the most robust imaging technique. However, it is at the expense of the patient and clinician's health due to prolonged radiation exposure. As an alternative, interventional ultrasound has notable benefits such as being radiation-free, fast to deploy, and having a small footprint in the operating room. Yet, ultrasound is hard to interpret, and highly prone to artifacts and noise. Additionally, interventional radiologists must undergo extensive training before they become qualified to diagnose and treat patients effectively, leading to a shortage of staff, and a lack of open-source datasets. In this work, we seek to address both problems by introducing a self-supervised deep learning architecture to segment catheters in longitudinal ultrasound images, without demanding any labeled data. The network architecture builds upon AiAReSeg, a segmentation transformer built with the Attention in Attention mechanism, and is capable of learning feature changes across time and space. To facilitate training, we used synthetic ultrasound data based on physics-driven catheter insertion simulations, and translated the data into a unique CT-Ultrasound common domain, CACTUSS, to improve the segmentation performance. We generated ground truth segmentation masks by computing the optical flow between adjacent frames using FlowNet2, and performed thresholding to obtain a binary map estimate. Finally, we validated our model on a test dataset, consisting of unseen synthetic data and images collected from silicon aorta phantoms, thus demonstrating its potential for applications to clinical data in the future.

To address this challenge, we propose VibNet, a learning-based framework tailored to enhance the robustness and accuracy of needle detection in ultrasound images, even when the target becomes invisible to the naked eye. Inspired by Eulerian Video Magnification techniques, we utilize an external step motor to induce low-amplitude periodic motion on the needle. These subtle vibrations offer the potential to generate robust frequency features for detecting the motion patterns around the needle. To robustly and precisely detect the needle leveraging these vibrations, VibNet integrates learning-based Short-Time-Fourier-Transform and Hough-Transform modules to achieve successive sub-goals, including motion feature extraction in the spatiotemporal space, frequency feature aggregation, and needle detection in the Hough space. Based on the results obtained on distinct ex vivo porcine and bovine tissue samples, the proposed algorithm exhibits superior detection performance with efficient computation and generalization capability.
