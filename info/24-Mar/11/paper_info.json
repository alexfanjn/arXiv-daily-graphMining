    "title": "Social Orientation: A New Feature for Dialogue Analysis",
    "abstract": "There are many settings where it is useful to predict and explain the success or failure of a dialogue. Circumplex theory from psychology models the social orientations (e.g., Warm-Agreeable, Arrogant-Calculating) of conversation participants and can be used to predict and explain the outcome of social interactions. Our work is novel in its systematic application of social orientation tags to modeling conversation outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a new data set of dialogue utterances machine-labeled with social orientation tags. We show that social orientation tags improve task performance, especially in low-resource settings, on both English and Chinese language benchmarks. We also demonstrate how social orientation tags help explain the outcomes of social interactions when used in neural models. Based on these results showing the utility of social orientation tags for dialogue outcome prediction tasks, we release our data sets, code, and models that are fine-tuned to predict social orientation tags on dialogue utterances.

    "abstract": "We propose an efficient solver for the privacy funnel (PF) method, leveraging its difference-of-convex (DC) structure. The proposed DC separation results in a closed-form update equation, which allows straightforward application to both known and unknown distribution settings. For known distribution case, we prove the convergence (local stationary points) of the proposed non-greedy solver, and empirically show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in characterizing the privacy-utility trade-off. The insights of our DC approach apply to unknown distribution settings where labeled empirical samples are available instead. Leveraging the insights, our alternating minimization solver satisfies the fundamental Markov relation of PF in contrast to previous variational inference-based solvers. Empirically, we evaluate the proposed solver with MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our results show that under a comparable reconstruction quality, an adversary suffers from higher prediction error from clustering our compressed codes than that with the compared methods. Most importantly, our solver is independent to private information in inference phase contrary to the baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Graphs with abundant attributes are essential in modeling interconnected entities and improving predictions in various real-world applications. Traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are commonly used for modeling attributed graphs, need to be re-trained every time when applied to different graph tasks and datasets. Although the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a new paradigm in natural language processing, the generative potential of LLMs in graph mining remains largely under-explored. To this end, we propose a novel framework MuseGraph, which seamlessly integrates the strengths of GNNs and LLMs and facilitates a more effective and generic approach for graph mining across different tasks and datasets. Specifically, we first introduce a compact graph description via the proposed adaptive input generation to encapsulate key information from the graph under the constraints of language token limitations. Then, we propose a diverse instruction generation mechanism, which distills the reasoning capabilities from LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to create task-specific Chain-of-Thought-based instruction packages for different graph tasks. Finally, we propose a graph-aware instruction tuning with a dynamic instruction package allocation strategy across tasks and datasets, ensuring the effectiveness and generalization of the training process. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in different graph tasks, showcasing the potential of our MuseGraph in enhancing the accuracy of graph-oriented downstream tasks while keeping the generation powers of LLMs. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs have garnered significant research attention and are widely used to enhance downstream applications. However, most current studies mainly focus on static knowledge graphs, whose facts do not change with time, and disregard their dynamic evolution over time. As a result, temporal knowledge graphs have attracted more attention because a large amount of structured knowledge exists only within a specific period. Knowledge graph representation learning aims to learn low-dimensional vector embeddings for entities and relations in a knowledge graph. The representation learning of temporal knowledge graphs incorporates time information into the standard knowledge graph framework and can model the dynamics of entities and relations over time. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of temporal knowledge graph representation learning and its applications. We begin with an introduction to the definitions, datasets, and evaluation metrics for temporal knowledge graph representation learning. Next, we propose a taxonomy based on the core technologies of temporal knowledge graph representation learning methods, and provide an in-depth analysis of different methods in each category. Finally, we present various downstream applications related to the temporal knowledge graphs. In the end, we conclude the paper and have an outlook on the future research directions in this area. ",

To address this gap, our work delves into an extensive examination of the privacy analysis of FL when used for training LLMs, both from theoretical and practical perspectives. In particular, we design two active membership inference attacks with guaranteed theoretical success rates to assess the privacy leakages of various adapted FL configurations. Our theoretical findings are translated into practical attacks, revealing substantial privacy vulnerabilities in popular LLMs, including BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and OpenAI's GPTs, across multiple real-world language datasets. Additionally, we conduct thorough experiments to evaluate the privacy leakage of these models when data is protected by state-of-the-art differential privacy (DP) mechanisms. ",

    "abstract": "Chronic diseases such as diabetes are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Numerous research studies have been attempted with various deep learning models in diagnosis. However, most previous studies had certain limitations, including using publicly available datasets (e.g. MIMIC), and imbalanced data. In this study, we collected five-year electronic health records (EHRs) from the Taiwan hospital database, including 1,420,596 clinical notes, 387,392 laboratory test results, and more than 1,505 laboratory test items, focusing on research pre-training large language models. We proposed a novel Large Language Multimodal Models (LLMMs) framework incorporating multimodal data from clinical notes and laboratory test results for the prediction of chronic disease risk. Our method combined a text embedding encoder and multi-head attention layer to learn laboratory test values, utilizing a deep neural network (DNN) module to merge blood features with chronic disease semantics into a latent space. In our experiments, we observe that clinicalBERT and PubMed-BERT, when combined with attention fusion, can achieve an accuracy of 73% in multiclass chronic diseases and diabetes prediction. By transforming laboratory test values into textual descriptions and employing the Flan T-5 model, we achieved a 76% Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC), demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging numerical text data for training and inference in language models. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of early-stage diabetes prediction. ",

On this basis, we propose a model-agnostic Topic-enriched Diffusion (TopicDiff) approach for capturing multimodal topic information in MCE tasks. Particularly, we integrate the diffusion model into neural topic model to alleviate the diversity deficiency problem of neural topic model in capturing topic information. Detailed evaluations demonstrate the significant improvements of TopicDiff over the state-of-the-art MCE baselines, justifying the importance of multimodal topic information to MCE and the effectiveness of TopicDiff in capturing such information. Furthermore, we observe an interesting finding that the topic information in acoustic and vision is more discriminative and robust compared to the language. ",

    "abstract": "Causal inference is a fundamental research topic for discovering the cause-effect relationships in many disciplines. However, not all algorithms are equally well-suited for a given dataset. For instance, some approaches may only be able to identify linear relationships, while others are applicable for non-linearities. Algorithms further vary in their sensitivity to noise and their ability to infer causal information from coupled vs. non-coupled time series. Therefore, different algorithms often generate different causal relationships for the same input. To achieve a more robust causal inference result, this publication proposes a novel data-driven two-phase multi-split causal ensemble model to combine the strengths of different causality base algorithms. In comparison to existing approaches, the proposed ensemble method reduces the influence of noise through a data partitioning scheme in the first phase. To achieve this, the data are initially divided into several partitions and the base algorithms are applied to each partition. Subsequently, Gaussian mixture models are used to identify the causal relationships derived from the different partitions that are likely to be valid. In the second phase, the identified relationships from each base algorithm are then merged based on three combination rules. The proposed ensemble approach is evaluated using multiple metrics, among them a newly developed evaluation index for causal ensemble approaches. We perform experiments using three synthetic datasets with different volumes and complexity, which are specifically designed to test causality detection methods under different circumstances while knowing the ground truth causal relationships. In these experiments, our causality ensemble outperforms each of its base algorithms. In practical applications, the use of the proposed method could hence lead to more robust and reliable causality results. ",

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have significant potential for agile communication and relief coordination in post-disaster scenarios, particularly when ground infrastructure is compromised. However, efficiently coordinating and securing flocks of heterogeneous UAVs from different service providers poses significant challenges related to privacy, scalability, lightweight consensus protocols, and comprehensive cybersecurity mechanisms. This study introduces a robust blockchain-enabled framework designed to tackle these technical challenges through a combination of consensus protocols, smart contracts, and cryptographic techniques. First, we propose a consortium blockchain architecture that ensures secure and private multi-agency coordination by controlling access and safeguarding the privacy of sensitive data. Second, we develop an optimized hybrid consensus protocol that merges Delegated Proof of Stake and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DPOS-PBFT), aiming to achieve an effective balance between efficiency, security, and resilience against node failures. Finally, we introduce decentralized flocking algorithms that facilitate adaptable and autonomous operations among specialized UAV clusters, ensuring critical disaster relief functions under conditions of uncertain connectivity. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the system achieved linear scaling of throughput up to 500 UAV nodes, with only a 50ms increase in latency from 10 to 500 nodes. The framework maintained high throughput and low latency despite spoofing, denial-of-service (DoS), and tampering attacks, showing strong cyber resilience. Communication latencies were kept under 10ms for diverse UAV operations through self-optimizing network intelligence, with median values around 2-3ms. ",

Therefore, introducing recent deep learning models to industrial environments holds the potential to increase productivity and enable new applications. However, gathering and labeling sufficient data is often intractable, complicating the implementation of such projects. Hence, image synthesis methods are commonly used to generate synthetic training data from 3D models and annotate them automatically, although it results in a sim-to-real domain gap. In this paper, we investigate the sim-to-real generalization performance of standard object detectors on the complex industrial application of terminal strip object detection. Combining domain randomization and domain knowledge, we created an image synthesis pipeline for automatically generating the training data. Moreover, we manually annotated 300 real images of terminal strips for the evaluation. The results show the cruciality of the objects of interest to have the same scale in either domain. Nevertheless, under optimized scaling conditions, the sim-to-real performance difference in mean average precision amounts to 2.69 % for RetinaNet and 0.98 % for Faster R-CNN, qualifying this approach for industrial requirements.

While these architectures are currently state-of-the-art in numerous applications, their success heavily relies on the accuracy of the forward model. This assumption can be limiting in many physical applications due to model simplifications or uncertainties in the apparatus. To address forward model mismatch, we introduce an untrained forward model residual block within the model-based architecture to match the data consistency in the measurement domain for each instance. We propose two variants in well-known model-based architectures (LU and DEQ) and prove convergence under mild conditions. The experiments show significant quality improvement in removing artifacts and preserving details across three distinct applications, encompassing both linear and nonlinear inverse problems.

    "title": "Corrective or Backfire: Characterizing and Predicting User Response to  Social Correction",
    "abstract": "Online misinformation poses a global risk with harmful implications for society. Ordinary social media users are known to actively reply to misinformation posts with counter-misinformation messages, which is shown to be effective in containing the spread of misinformation. Such a practice is defined as \"social correction\". Nevertheless, it remains unknown how users respond to social correction in real-world scenarios, especially, will it have a corrective or backfire effect on users. Investigating this research question is pivotal for developing and refining strategies that maximize the efficacy of social correction initiatives. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to characterize and predict the user response to social correction in a data-driven manner through the lens of X (Formerly Twitter), where the user response is instantiated as the reply that is written toward a counter-misinformation message. Particularly, we first create a novel dataset with 55, 549 triples of misinformation tweets, counter-misinformation replies, and responses to counter-misinformation replies, and then curate a taxonomy to illustrate different kinds of user responses. Next, fine-grained statistical analysis of reply linguistic and engagement features as well as repliers' user attributes is conducted to illustrate the characteristics that are significant in determining whether a reply will have a corrective or backfire effect. Finally, we build a user response prediction model to identify whether a social correction will be corrective, neutral, or have a backfire effect, which achieves a promising F1 score of 0.816. Our work enables stakeholders to monitor and predict user responses effectively, thus guiding the use of social correction to maximize their corrective impact and minimize backfire effects.

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) has various desirable properties, such as robustness to post-processing, group privacy, and amplification by subsampling, which can be derived independently of each other. Our goal is to determine whether stronger privacy guarantees can be obtained by considering multiple of these properties jointly. To this end, we focus on the combination of group privacy and amplification by subsampling. To provide guarantees that are amenable to machine learning algorithms, we conduct our analysis in the framework of R\\'enyi-DP, which has more favorable composition properties than $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP. As part of this analysis, we develop a unified framework for deriving amplification by subsampling guarantees for R\\'enyi-DP, which represents the first such framework for a privacy accounting method and is of independent interest. We find that it not only lets us improve upon and generalize existing amplification results for R\\'enyi-DP, but also derive provably tight group privacy amplification guarantees stronger than existing principles. These results establish the joint study of different DP properties as a promising research direction. ",

However, the information transmission between the camera and retinal cells is often limited by the low resolution of the electrode array and the lack of specificity for different ganglion cell types, resulting in suboptimal stimulations. In this work, we propose to utilize normalizing flow-based conditional invertible neural networks to optimize retinal implant stimulation in an unsupervised manner. The invertibility of these networks allows us to use them as a surrogate for the computational model of the visual system, while also encoding input camera signals into optimized electrical stimuli on the electrode array. Compared to other methods, such as trivial downsampling, linear models, and feed-forward convolutional neural networks, the flow-based invertible neural network and its conditional extension yield better visual reconstruction qualities w.r.t. various metrics using a physiologically validated simulation tool.

We demonstrate that due to relative stability of singular vectors to noise we are able to reconstruct correct conservation laws without the need for excessive parameter tuning.

The formulation relies on the key idea that when the targets move along lines, their trajectories become convex sets within the space-time coordinate system. The problem then reduces to finding the shortest path within a graph of convex sets, subject to some speed constraints. We compare our formulation with the current state-of-the-art Mixed Integer Conic Program (MICP) solver for the MT-TSP. The experimental results show that our formulation outperforms the MICP for instances with up to 20 targets, with up to two orders of magnitude reduction in runtime, and up to a 60\\% tighter optimality gap.

Known as fingerprints, this information is written into the object using various bit embedding techniques; examples include varying the height of the molten thermoplastic layers, and depositing metallic powder with different magnetic properties. Yet, the practicality of theses techniques in real-world forensic settings is hindered by the adversarial nature of this problem. That is, the 3D-printing process is out of reach of any law enforcement agencies; it is the adversary who controls all aspects of printing and possesses the printed object. To combat these threats, law enforcement agencies can regulate the manufacturing of 3D printers, on which they may enforce a fingerprinting scheme, and collect adversarially tampered remains (e.g., fragments of a broken 3D-printed firearm) during forensic investigation. Therefore, it is important to devise fingerprinting techniques so that the fingerprint could be extracted even if printing is carried out by the adversary. To this end, we present SIDE (Secure Information Embedding and Extraction), a fingerprinting framework that tackles the adversarial nature of forensic fingerprinting in 3D prints by offering both secure information embedding and secure information extraction.

Second, certain functional variables can be excluded from being observed without affecting the identifiability of a causal effect, which may significantly reduce the number of needed variables in observational data.

Though different from the original graphs, these augmented graphs retain the original graph's structural characteristics. Here, we propose a unique method for generating these augmented graphs by leveraging the control properties of networks. The core concept revolves around perturbing the original graph to create a new one while preserving the controllability properties specific to networks and graphs. Compared to the existing methods, we demonstrate that this innovative approach enhances the effectiveness of contrastive learning frameworks, leading to superior results regarding the accuracy of the classification tasks.

The base station (BS) exploits the hybrid beamforming to communicate with multiple near users (NUs) and far users (FUs) using the NOMA principle. Based on this framework, two novel beamforming schemes are proposed. 1) For the case of the grouped users distributed in the same direction, a beam-steering scheme is developed. The metric of beam pattern error (BPE) is introduced for the characterization of the gap between the hybrid beamformers and the desired ideal beamformers, where a two-layer algorithm is proposed to minimize BPE by optimizing hybrid beamformers. Then, the optimal power allocation strategy is obtained to maximize the sum achievable rate of the network. 2) For the case of users randomly distributed, a beam-splitting scheme is proposed, where two sub-beamformers are extracted from the single beamformer to serve different users in the same group. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed for hybrid beamformer optimization, and the optimal power allocation is also derived. Numerical results validate that: 1) the proposed beamforming schemes exhibit superior performance compared with the existing imperfect-resolution-based beamforming scheme; 2) the communication rate of the proposed transmission framework is sensitive to the imperfect distance knowledge of NUs but not to that of FUs.

Based on this motivation, we present our ForgetNet, which does not use historical embeddings and thus is consistent with the Markov nature of the tasks. To address challenges in training ForgetNet at early stages, we further introduce G-ForgetNet, which uses a gating mechanism to allow for the selective integration of historical embeddings. Such an enhanced capability provides valuable computational pathways during the model's early training phase. Our extensive experiments, based on the CLRS-30 algorithmic reasoning benchmark, demonstrate that both ForgetNet and G-ForgetNet achieve better generalization capability than existing methods. Furthermore, we investigate the behavior of the gating mechanism, highlighting its degree of alignment with our intuitions and its effectiveness for robust performance. ",

The small size of anomalous regions in many real-world datasets necessitates processing the images at a high resolution. This frequently poses significant challenges concerning memory consumption during the model training and inference stages, leaving some existing methods impractical for widespread adoption. To overcome this challenge, we present the tiled ensemble approach, which reduces memory consumption by dividing the input images into a grid of tiles and training a dedicated model for each tile location. The tiled ensemble is compatible with any existing anomaly detection model without the need for any modification of the underlying architecture. By introducing overlapping tiles, we utilize the benefits of traditional stacking ensembles, leading to further improvements in anomaly detection capabilities beyond high resolution alone. We perform a comprehensive analysis using diverse underlying architectures, including Padim, PatchCore, FastFlow, and Reverse Distillation, on two standard anomaly detection datasets: MVTec and VisA. Our method demonstrates a notable improvement across setups while remaining within GPU memory constraints, consuming only as much GPU memory as a single model needs to process a single tile. ",

This work intends to reduce this gap using extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments in state-of-the-art architectures similar to the initial stages of adversarial attacks in image classification. The results suggest that models are susceptible to attacks even on low levels of perturbation. We also show experiments with 3D transformations that affect the model performance, in particular, we show that most models are sensitive to simple rotations and translations which do not alter joint distances. We conclude that similar to earlier CNN models, motion forecasting tasks are susceptible to small perturbations and simple 3D transformations. ",

The substantial risks posed by these attacks underscore the need for a thorough understanding of the threats. Yet, research in this area faces challenges due to the lack of a unified goal for such attacks and their reliance on manually crafted prompts, complicating comprehensive assessments of prompt injection robustness. We introduce a unified framework for understanding the objectives of prompt injection attacks and present an automated gradient-based method for generating highly effective and universal prompt injection data, even in the face of defensive measures. With only five training samples (0.3% relative to the test data), our attack can achieve superior performance compared with baselines. Our findings emphasize the importance of gradient-based testing, which can avoid overestimation of robustness, especially for defense mechanisms. ",

Most existing US tracking methods, e.g., those based on optical flow or feature matching, were initially designed for RGB images before being applied to US. Therefore domain shift can impact their performance. Training could be supervised by ground-truth correspondences, but these are expensive to acquire in US. To solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised pixel-level tracking model called PIPsUS. Our model can track an arbitrary number of points in one forward pass and exploits temporal information by considering multiple, instead of just consecutive, frames. We developed a new self-supervised training strategy that utilizes a long-term point-tracking model trained for RGB images as a teacher to guide the model to learn realistic motions and use data augmentation to enforce tracking from US appearance. We evaluate our method on neck and oral US and echocardiography, showing higher point tracking accuracy when compared with fast normalized cross-correlation and tuned optical flow.

    "abstract": "Closeness Centrality (CC) and Betweenness Centrality (BC) are crucial metrics in network analysis, providing essential reference for discerning the significance of nodes within complex networks. These measures find wide applications in critical tasks, such as community detection and network dismantling. However, their practical implementation on extensive networks remains computationally demanding due to their high time complexity. To mitigate these computational challenges, numerous approximation algorithms have been developed to expedite the computation of CC and BC. Nevertheless, even these approximations still necessitate substantial processing time when applied to large-scale networks. Furthermore, their output proves sensitive to even minor perturbations within the network structure. In this work, We redefine the CC and BC node ranking problem as a machine learning problem and propose the CNCA-IGE model, which is an encoder-decoder model based on inductive graph neural networks designed to rank nodes based on specified CC or BC metrics. We incorporate the MLP-Mixer model as the decoder in the BC ranking prediction task to enhance the model's robustness and capacity. Our approach is evaluated on diverse synthetic and real-world networks of varying scales, and the experimental results demonstrate that the CNCA-IGE model outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models, significantly reducing execution time while improving performance.

To address this, we propose an end-to-end automated meshing algorithm that enables robust incorporation of patient-specific calcification onto a given heart mesh. The algorithm provides a substantial speed-up from several hours of manual meshing to $\\sim$1 minute of automated computation, and it solves an important problem that cannot be addressed with recent template registration-based heart meshing techniques.

There is a strong demand for computational tasks to be processed at computational nodes as timely as possible. However, a measure of timeliness in computation is lacking. In this letter, we introduce the novel concept, Age of Computing, to capture computation freshness in 3CNs. We develop two methods for calculating this metric, applicable to a wide range of 3CNs. These calculations are applied to a queue-theoretic system comprising a source and a computational node, resulting in the derivation of two expressions for the AoC. Utilizing these expressions, we establish an upper bound and a tight lower bound. Subsequently, we illustrate two fundamental tradeoffs in M/M/1 systems: the communication-computation tradeoff, which arises from the utilization of the computation power under the joint influence of communication and computation efficiency, and the AoC-delay tradeoff, rooted in the fact that AoC assesses comprehensive and system-wide computation freshness while delay measures instantaneous and individual task computation freshness. While our models are simpler than their real-world counterparts, we believe the insights gained provide a valuable starting point for understanding computation freshness in 3CNs. ",

To examine these differences, we develop an evaluation framework to simulate social interactions with LLMs in various settings (omniscient, non-omniscient). Our experiments show that interlocutors simulated omnisciently are much more successful at accomplishing social goals compared to non-omniscient agents, despite the latter being the more realistic setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that learning from omniscient simulations improves the apparent naturalness of interactions but scarcely enhances goal achievement in cooperative scenarios. Our findings indicate that addressing information asymmetry remains a fundamental challenge for LLM-based agents. ",

Existing work on DyGNNs with out-of-distribution settings only focuses on the time domain, failing to handle cases involving distribution shifts in the spectral domain. In this paper, we discover that there exist cases with distribution shifts unobservable in the time domain while observable in the spectral domain, and propose to study distribution shifts on dynamic graphs in the spectral domain for the first time. However, this investigation poses two key challenges: i) it is non-trivial to capture different graph patterns that are driven by various frequency components entangled in the spectral domain; and ii) it remains unclear how to handle distribution shifts with the discovered spectral patterns. To address these challenges, we propose Spectral Invariant Learning for Dynamic Graphs under Distribution Shifts (SILD), which can handle distribution shifts on dynamic graphs by capturing and utilizing invariant and variant spectral patterns. Specifically, we first design a DyGNN with Fourier transform to obtain the ego-graph trajectory spectrums, allowing the mixed dynamic graph patterns to be transformed into separate frequency components. We then develop a disentangled spectrum mask to filter graph dynamics from various frequency components and discover the invariant and variant spectral patterns. Finally, we propose invariant spectral filtering, which encourages the model to rely on invariant patterns for generalization under distribution shifts. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method for both node classification and link prediction tasks under distribution shifts. ",

The key challenge of the TTG task is how to associate text with the spatial structure of the road network and traffic data for generating traffic situations. To this end, we propose ChatTraffic, the first diffusion model for text-to-traffic generation. To guarantee the consistency between synthetic and real data, we augment a diffusion model with the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to extract spatial correlations of traffic data. In addition, we construct a large dataset containing text-traffic pairs for the TTG task. We benchmarked our model qualitatively and quantitatively on the released dataset.

Minimizing risks from models is challenging because the attack surface is so large. It is not tractable to exhaustively search for inputs that may cause a model to fail. Red-teaming and adversarial training (AT) are commonly used to make AI systems more robust. However, they have not been sufficient to avoid many real-world failure modes that differ from the ones adversarially trained on. In this work, we utilize latent adversarial training (LAT) to defend against vulnerabilities without generating inputs that elicit them. LAT leverages the compressed, abstract, and structured latent representations of concepts that the network actually uses for prediction. We use LAT to remove trojans and defend against held-out classes of adversarial attacks. We show in image classification, text classification, and text generation tasks that LAT usually improves both robustness and performance on clean data relative to AT. This suggests that LAT can be a promising tool for defending against failure modes that are not explicitly identified by developers. ",

First, it generates six orthographic view images from a single input image, then feeds these images into a convolutional U-Net, leveraging its strong pixel-level alignment capabilities and significant bandwidth to create a high-resolution triplane. CRM further employs Flexicubes as geometric representation, facilitating direct end-to-end optimization on textured meshes.

First, we adopt a pre-trained human body encoder to process each individual camera view, such that human body models and parameters can be reconstructed for each view. Next, instead of simply averaging models across views, we train a network to determine the weights of individual views for their fusion, based on the parameters estimated for joints and hands of human body as well as camera positions. Further, we turn to the mesh surface of human body for dynamic fusion, such that facial expression can be seamlessly integrated into the model of human body. Our method has demonstrated superior performance in reconstructing human body upon two public datasets. More importantly, our method can flexibly support ad-hoc deployment of an arbitrary number of cameras, which has significant potential in related applications.

While existing methods have shown impressive results under standard conditions, they often face challenges in reliably performing in scenarios such as low-light or rainy conditions due to the absence of diverse training data.

The approach addresses this limitation by utilizing stable diffusion to generate synthetic images that mimic challenging conditions. Additionally, a self-training mechanism is introduced to enhance the model's depth estimation capability in such challenging environments. To enhance the utilization of the stable diffusion prior further, the DINOv2 encoder is integrated into the depth model architecture, enabling the model to leverage rich semantic priors and improve its scene understanding. Furthermore, a teacher loss is introduced to guide the student models in acquiring meaningful knowledge independently, thus reducing their dependency on the teacher models.

In this paper, we propose RadarDistill, a novel knowledge distillation (KD) method, which can improve the representation of radar data by leveraging LiDAR data. RadarDistill successfully transfers desirable characteristics of LiDAR features into radar features using three key components: Cross-Modality Alignment (CMA), Activation-based Feature Distillation (AFD), and Proposal-based Feature Distillation (PFD). CMA enhances the density of radar features through multiple layers of dilation operations, effectively addressing the challenges of inefficient knowledge transfer from LiDAR to radar. AFD is designed to transfer knowledge from significant areas of the LiDAR features, specifically those regions where activation intensity exceeds a predetermined threshold. PFD guides the radar network to mimic LiDAR network features in the object proposals for accurately detected results while moderating features for misdetected proposals like false positives. Our comparative analyses conducted on the nuScenes datasets demonstrate that RadarDistill achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for radar-only object detection task, recording 20.5% in mAP and 43.7% in NDS.

    "abstract": "The existing graph neural architecture search (GNAS) methods heavily rely on supervised labels during the search process, failing to handle ubiquitous scenarios where supervisions are not available. In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised graph neural architecture search, which remains unexplored in the literature. The key problem is to discover the latent graph factors that drive the formation of graph data as well as the underlying relations between the factors and the optimal neural architectures. Handling this problem is challenging given that the latent graph factors together with architectures are highly entangled due to the nature of the graph and the complexity of the neural architecture search process. To address the challenge, we propose a novel Disentangled Self-supervised Graph Neural Architecture Search (DSGAS) model, which is able to discover the optimal architectures capturing various latent graph factors in a self-supervised fashion based on unlabeled graph data. Specifically, we first design a disentangled graph super-network capable of incorporating multiple architectures with factor-wise disentanglement, which are optimized simultaneously. Then, we estimate the performance of architectures under different factors by our proposed self-supervised training with joint architecture-graph disentanglement. Finally, we propose a contrastive search with architecture augmentations to discover architectures with factor-specific expertise. Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance against several baseline methods in an unsupervised manner. ",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) stand at the forefront of a number of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite the widespread adoption of LLMs in NLP, much of their potential in broader fields remains largely unexplored, and significant limitations persist in their design and implementation. Notably, LLMs struggle with structured data, such as graphs, and often falter when tasked with answering domain-specific questions requiring deep expertise, such as those in biology and chemistry. In this paper, we explore a fundamental question: Can LLMs effectively handle molecule prediction tasks? Rather than pursuing top-tier performance, our goal is to assess how LLMs can contribute to diverse molecule tasks. We identify several classification and regression prediction tasks across six standard molecule datasets. Subsequently, we carefully design a set of prompts to query LLMs on these tasks and compare their performance with existing Machine Learning (ML) models, which include text-based models and those specifically designed for analysing the geometric structure of molecules. Our investigation reveals several key insights: Firstly, LLMs generally lag behind ML models in achieving competitive performance on molecule tasks, particularly when compared to models adept at capturing the geometric structure of molecules, highlighting the constrained ability of LLMs to comprehend graph data. Secondly, LLMs show promise in enhancing the performance of ML models when used collaboratively. Lastly, we engage in a discourse regarding the challenges and promising avenues to harness LLMs for molecule prediction tasks.

The probability of accidents occurring in the operation of transformer equipment is high, so it has become a focus of material inspection in recent years. However, the large amount of raw data from sample testing is not being used effectively. Given the above problems, this paper aims to mine the relationship between the unqualified distribution transformer inspection items by using the association rule algorithm based on the distribution transformer inspection data collected from 2017 to 2021 and sorting out the key inspection items. At the same time, the unqualified judgment basis of the relevant items is given, and the internal relationship between the inspection items is clarified to a certain extent. Furthermore, based on material and equipment inspection reports, correlations between failed inspection items, and expert knowledge, the knowledge graph of material equipment inspection management is constructed in the graph database Neo4j. The experimental results show that the FP-Growth method performs significantly better than the Apriori method and can accurately assess the relationship between failed distribution transformer inspection items. Finally, the knowledge graph network is visualized to provide a systematic knowledge base for material inspection, which is convenient for knowledge query and management. This method can provide a scientific guidance program for operation and maintenance personnel to do equipment maintenance and also offers a reference for the state evaluation of other high-voltage equipment.

Although recent advances in machine learning offer promising methods to predict human trajectories in crowded areas, it remains unclear how one can safely incorporate these learned models into a control loop due to the uncertain nature of human motion, which can make predictions of these models imprecise. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce a distributionally robust chance-constrained model predictive control (DRCC-MPC) which: (i) adopts a probability of collision as a pre-specified, interpretable risk metric, and (ii) offers robustness against discrepancies between actual human trajectories and their predictions. We consider the risk of collision in the form of a chance constraint, providing an interpretable measure of robot safety. To enable real-time evaluation of chance constraints, we consider conservative approximations of chance constraints in the form of distributionally robust Conditional Value at Risk constraints. The resulting formulation offers computational efficiency as well as robustness with respect to out-of-distribution human motion. With the parallelization of a sampling-based optimization technique, our method operates in real-time, demonstrating successful and safe navigation in a number of case studies with real-world pedestrian data.

Conventional robustness evaluations have relied on adversarial accuracy, which measures a model's performance under a specific perturbation intensity. However, this singular metric does not fully encapsulate the overall resilience of a model against varying degrees of perturbation. To address this gap, we propose a new metric termed adversarial hypervolume, assessing the robustness of deep learning models comprehensively over a range of perturbation intensities from a multi-objective optimization standpoint. This metric allows for an in-depth comparison of defense mechanisms and recognizes the trivial improvements in robustness afforded by less potent defensive strategies. Additionally, we adopt a novel training algorithm that enhances adversarial robustness uniformly across various perturbation intensities, in contrast to methods narrowly focused on optimizing adversarial accuracy. Our extensive empirical studies validate the effectiveness of the adversarial hypervolume metric, demonstrating its ability to reveal subtle differences in robustness that adversarial accuracy overlooks. This research contributes a new measure of robustness and establishes a standard for assessing and benchmarking the resilience of current and future defensive models against adversarial threats. ",

However, in real-world scenarios, massive multimodal data are harvested from the Internet, which inevitably contains Partially Mismatched Pairs (PMPs). Undoubtedly, such semantical irrelevant data will remarkably harm the cross-modal retrieval performance. Previous efforts tend to mitigate this problem by estimating a soft correspondence to down-weight the contribution of PMPs. In this paper, we aim to address this challenge from a new perspective: the potential semantic similarity among unpaired samples makes it possible to excavate useful knowledge from mismatched pairs. To achieve this, we propose L2RM, a general framework based on Optimal Transport (OT) that learns to rematch mismatched pairs. In detail, L2RM aims to generate refined alignments by seeking a minimal-cost transport plan across different modalities. To formalize the rematching idea in OT, first, we propose a self-supervised cost function that automatically learns from explicit similarity-cost mapping relation. Second, we present to model a partial OT problem while restricting the transport among false positives to further boost refined alignments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate our L2RM significantly improves the robustness against PMPs for existing models. The code is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/L2RM. ",

Whilst related research contributes to enabling TinyML solutions on constrained hardware, there is a need to amplify real-world applications by optimising energy consumption in battery-powered systems. The work presented extends and contributes to TinyML research by optimising battery-powered image-based anomaly detection Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Whilst previous work in this area has yielded the capabilities of on-device inferencing and training, there has yet to be an investigation into optimising the management of such capabilities using machine learning approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), to improve the deployment battery life of such systems. Using modelled simulations, the battery life effects of an RL algorithm are benchmarked against static and dynamic optimisation approaches, with the foundation laid for a hardware benchmark to follow. It is shown that using RL within a TinyML-enabled IoT system to optimise the system operations, including cloud anomaly processing and on-device training, yields an improved battery life of 22.86% and 10.86% compared to static and dynamic optimisation approaches respectively. The proposed solution can be deployed to resource-constrained hardware, given its low memory footprint of 800 B, which could be further reduced. This further facilitates the real-world deployment of such systems, including key sectors such as smart agriculture. ",

    "abstract": "Visual perimetry is an important eye examination that helps detect vision problems caused by ocular or neurological conditions. During the test, a patient's gaze is fixed at a specific location while light stimuli of varying intensities are presented in central and peripheral vision. Based on the patient's responses to the stimuli, the visual field mapping and sensitivity are determined. However, maintaining high levels of concentration throughout the test can be challenging for patients, leading to increased examination times and decreased accuracy. In this work, we present RLPeri, a reinforcement learning-based approach to optimize visual perimetry testing. By determining the optimal sequence of locations and initial stimulus values, we aim to reduce the examination time without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we incorporate reward shaping techniques to further improve the testing performance. To monitor the patient's responses over time during testing, we represent the test's state as a pair of 3D matrices. We apply two different convolutional kernels to extract spatial features across locations as well as features across different stimulus values for each location. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach results in a 10-20% reduction in examination time while maintaining the accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art methods. With the presented approach, we aim to make visual perimetry testing more efficient and patient-friendly, while still providing accurate results. ",

By adding perturbation to the latent vector, APPLE decorates the latent vector of segmentors such that no fairness-related features can be passed to the decoder of the segmentors while preserving the architecture and parameters of the segmentor. Experiments on two segmentation datasets and five segmentors (three U-Net-like and two SAM-like) illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several unfairness mitigation methods.

    "abstract": "Recently, arbitrary-scale point cloud upsampling mechanism became increasingly popular due to its efficiency and convenience for practical applications. To achieve this, most previous approaches formulate it as a problem of surface approximation and employ point-based networks to learn surface representations. However, learning surfaces from sparse point clouds is more challenging, and thus they often suffer from the low-fidelity geometry approximation. To address it, we propose an arbitrary-scale Point cloud Upsampling framework using Voxel-based Network (\\textbf{PU-VoxelNet}). Thanks to the completeness and regularity inherited from the voxel representation, voxel-based networks are capable of providing predefined grid space to approximate 3D surface, and an arbitrary number of points can be reconstructed according to the predicted density distribution within each grid cell. However, we investigate the inaccurate grid sampling caused by imprecise density predictions. To address this issue, a density-guided grid resampling method is developed to generate high-fidelity points while effectively avoiding sampling outliers. Further, to improve the fine-grained details, we present an auxiliary training supervision to enforce the latent geometric consistency among local surface patches. Extensive experiments indicate the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches not only in terms of fixed upsampling rates but also for arbitrary-scale upsampling. ",

By leveraging features from local neighborhoods, and cross-instance attention score, we design a grouping module that further performs lane-wise clustering between neighboring and seeding points.

We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the average training latency subject to long-term energy consumption constraint. The difficulties in solving this problem are the lack of future information and mixed integer programming (MIP). To solve it, we propose an online algorithm leveraging the Lyapunov theory, named OPEN, which decomposes it into a new MIP problem only with the current information. Then, a two-layer optimization method is proposed to solve the MIP problem.

In this paper, we begin by introducing a lightweight way to quantify uncertainties in rewards, relying solely on the last layer embeddings of the reward model, without the need for computationally expensive reward ensembles. AdvPO then addresses a distributionally robust optimization problem centred around the confidence interval of the reward model's predictions for policy improvement. Through comprehensive experiments on the Anthropic HH and TL;DR summarization datasets, we illustrate the efficacy of AdvPO in mitigating the overoptimization issue, consequently resulting in enhanced performance as evaluated through human-assisted evaluation.

    "abstract": "Previous face forgery detection methods mainly focus on appearance features, which may be easily attacked by sophisticated manipulation. Considering the majority of current face manipulation methods generate fake faces based on a single frame, which do not take frame consistency and coordination into consideration, artifacts on frame sequences are more effective for face forgery detection. However, current sequence-based face forgery detection methods use general video classification networks directly, which discard the special and discriminative motion information for face manipulation detection. To this end, we propose an effective sequence-based forgery detection framework based on an existing video classification method. To make the motion features more expressive for manipulation detection, we propose an alternative motion consistency block instead of the original motion features module. To make the learned features more generalizable, we propose an auxiliary anomaly detection block. With these two specially designed improvements, we make a general video classification network achieve promising results on three popular face forgery datasets. ",

Ensuring the quality of equipment entering the grid is a core task in material management. Currently, the inspection of incoming materials involves the generation of sampling plans, sampling, sealing, sample delivery, and testing. Due to the lack of a comprehensive control system and effective control measures, it is not possible to trace the execution process of business operations afterward. This inability to trace hampers the investigation of testing issues and risk control, as it lacks effective data support. Additionally, a significant amount of original record information for key parameters in the testing process, which is based on sampling operation standards, has not been effectively utilized. To address these issues, we conduct researches on key monitoring technologies in the typical material inspection process based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and analyze the key parameters in inspection results. For purpose of complete the above tasks, this paper investigates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms for quality prediction in material equipment based on key inspection parameters. In summary, this paper aims to provide professional and reliable quality data support for various business processes within the company, including material procurement, engineering construction, and equipment operation.

It is also exploited for model stealing attacks, where adversaries use KD to mimic the functionality of a teacher model. Recent developments in this domain have been influenced by the Stingy Teacher model, which provided empirical analysis showing that sparse outputs can significantly degrade the performance of student models. Addressing the risk of intellectual property leakage, our work introduces an approach to train a teacher model that inherently protects its logits, influenced by the Nasty Teacher concept. Differing from existing methods, we incorporate sparse outputs of adversarial examples with standard training data to strengthen the teacher's defense against student distillation. Our approach carefully reduces the relative entropy between the original and adversarially perturbed outputs, allowing the model to produce adversarial logits with minimal impact on overall performance.

    "abstract": "In the ever-evolving digital audio landscape, Spotify, well-known for its music and talk content, has recently introduced audiobooks to its vast user base. While promising, this move presents significant challenges for personalized recommendations. Unlike music and podcasts, audiobooks, initially available for a fee, cannot be easily skimmed before purchase, posing higher stakes for the relevance of recommendations. Furthermore, introducing a new content type into an existing platform confronts extreme data sparsity, as most users are unfamiliar with this new content type. Lastly, recommending content to millions of users requires the model to react fast and be scalable. To address these challenges, we leverage podcast and music user preferences and introduce 2T-HGNN, a scalable recommendation system comprising Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) and a Two Tower (2T) model. This novel approach uncovers nuanced item relationships while ensuring low latency and complexity. We decouple users from the HGNN graph and propose an innovative multi-link neighbor sampler. These choices, together with the 2T component, significantly reduce the complexity of the HGNN model. Empirical evaluations involving millions of users show significant improvement in the quality of personalized recommendations, resulting in a +46% increase in new audiobooks start rate and a +23% boost in streaming rates. Intriguingly, our model's impact extends beyond audiobooks, benefiting established products like podcasts. ",

Our method, DARL, employs a decoder-only Transformer to predict image patches autoregressively. We find that training with Mean Squared Error (MSE) alone leads to strong representations. To enhance the image generation ability, we replace the MSE loss with the diffusion objective by using a denoising patch decoder. We show that the learned representation can be improved by using tailored noise schedules and longer training in larger models. Notably, the optimal schedule differs significantly from the typical ones used in standard image diffusion models. Overall, despite its simple architecture, DARL delivers performance remarkably close to state-of-the-art masked prediction models under the fine-tuning protocol. This marks an important step towards a unified model capable of both visual perception and generation, effectively combining the strengths of autoregressive and denoising diffusion models. ",

We prove the effectiveness of SocialPET on two stance datasets, Multi-target and P-Stance, outperforming competitive stance detection models as well as the base model, PET, where the labeled instances for the target under study is as few as 100.

To overcome this limitation and enhance the reconstruction of 3D structural features, we propose an innovative approach that integrates existing 2D features with 3D features to guide the model learning process. Specifically, we introduce the 3D-ID Loss, which leverages the high-dimensional structure features extracted from a Spectral-Based Graph Convolution Encoder applied to the facial mesh. This approach surpasses the sole reliance on the 3D information provided by the facial mesh vertices coordinates. Our model is trained using 2D-3D data pairs from a combination of datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NoW benchmark. ",

In contrast, image generation methods can work well on very small datasets, and can find mappings between unpaired datasets, meaning an effectively unlimited amount of paired synthetic data can be generated. In this work, we demonstrate that representation learning can be significantly improved by synthetically generating paired information, both compared to training on either single-modality (up to 4.4x error reduction) or authentic multi-modal paired datasets (up to 5.6x error reduction).

Scoring systems are widely used for swift and efficient risk prediction. However, existing methods for constructing survival scores presume that data originates from a single source, posing privacy challenges in collaborations with multiple data owners. We propose a novel framework for building federated scoring systems for multi-site survival outcomes, ensuring both privacy and communication efficiency. We applied our approach to sites with heterogeneous survival data originating from emergency departments in Singapore and the United States. Additionally, we independently developed local scores at each site. In testing datasets from each participant site, our proposed federated scoring system consistently outperformed all local models, evidenced by higher integrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (iAUC) values, with a maximum improvement of 11.6%. Additionally, the federated score's time-dependent AUC(t) values showed advantages over local scores, exhibiting narrower confidence intervals (CIs) across most time points. The model developed through our proposed method exhibits effective performance on each local site, signifying noteworthy implications for healthcare research. Sites participating in our proposed federated scoring model training gained benefits by acquiring survival models with enhanced prediction accuracy and efficiency. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of our privacy-preserving federated survival score generation framework and its applicability to real-world heterogeneous survival data. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attack methods based on point manipulation for 3D point cloud classification have revealed the fragility of 3D models, yet the adversarial examples they produce are easily perceived or defended against. The trade-off between the imperceptibility and adversarial strength leads most point attack methods to inevitably introduce easily detectable outlier points upon a successful attack. Another promising strategy, shape-based attack, can effectively eliminate outliers, but existing methods often suffer significant reductions in imperceptibility due to irrational deformations. We find that concealing deformation perturbations in areas insensitive to human eyes can achieve a better trade-off between imperceptibility and adversarial strength, specifically in parts of the object surface that are complex and exhibit drastic curvature changes. Therefore, we propose a novel shape-based adversarial attack method, HiT-ADV, which initially conducts a two-stage search for attack regions based on saliency and imperceptibility scores, and then adds deformation perturbations in each attack region using Gaussian kernel functions. Additionally, HiT-ADV is extendable to physical attack. We propose that by employing benign resampling and benign rigid transformations, we can further enhance physical adversarial strength with little sacrifice to imperceptibility. Extensive experiments have validated the superiority of our method in terms of adversarial and imperceptible properties in both digital and physical spaces.

As prior studies leverage large-scale labeled NLI datasets for fine-tuning masked language models to yield sentence embeddings, task performance for languages other than English is often left behind. In this study, we directly compared two data augmentation techniques as potential solutions for monolingual STS: (a) cross-lingual transfer that exploits English resources alone as training data to yield non-English sentence embeddings as zero-shot inference, and (b) machine translation that coverts English data into pseudo non-English training data in advance. In our experiments on monolingual STS in Japanese and Korean, we find that the two data techniques yield performance on par. Rather, we find a superiority of the Wikipedia domain over the NLI domain for these languages, in contrast to prior studies that focused on NLI as training data. Combining our findings, we demonstrate that the cross-lingual transfer of Wikipedia data exhibits improved performance, and that native Wikipedia data can further improve performance for monolingual STS.

However, the massive spoiler reviews detract from the movie-watching experience, making spoiler detection an important task. Previous methods simply focus on reviews' text content, ignoring the heterogeneity of information in the platform. For instance, the metadata and the corresponding user's information of a review could be helpful. Besides, the spoiler language of movie reviews tends to be genre-specific, thus posing a domain generalization challenge for existing methods. To this end, we propose MMoE, a multi-modal network that utilizes information from multiple modalities to facilitate robust spoiler detection and adopts Mixture-of-Experts to enhance domain generalization. MMoE first extracts graph, text, and meta feature from the user-movie network, the review's textual content, and the review's metadata respectively. To handle genre-specific spoilers, we then adopt Mixture-of-Experts architecture to process information in three modalities to promote robustness. Finally, we use an expert fusion layer to integrate the features from different perspectives and make predictions based on the fused embedding. Experiments demonstrate that MMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely-used spoiler detection datasets, surpassing previous SOTA methods by 2.56\\% and 8.41\\% in terms of accuracy and F1-score.

Specifically, DPMN first attempts to design two forms of deep prompt tuning and light prompt tuning for the PLMs. The effects of different prompt lengths, tuning strategies, and prompt initialization methods on detecting abusive language are studied. In addition, we propose a Task Head based on Bi-LSTM and FFN, which can be used as a short text classifier. Eventually, DPMN utilizes multi-task learning to improve detection metrics further. The multi-task network has the function of transferring effective knowledge. The proposed DPMN is evaluated against eight typical methods on three public datasets: OLID, SOLID, and AbuseAnalyzer.

However, decentralised multi-agent systems are inherently vulnerable to disruption. To develop a resilient consensus approach, inspiration is taken from the study of social systems and their dynamics; specifically, the Deffuant Model. A dynamic algorithm is presented enabling efficient consensus to be reached with an unknown number of disruptors present within a multi-agent system. By inverting typical social tolerance, agents filter out extremist non-standard opinions that would drive them away from consensus. This approach allows distributed systems to deal with unknown disruptions, without knowledge of the network topology or the numbers and behaviours of the disruptors. A disruptor-agnostic algorithm is particularly suitable to real-world applications where this information is typically unknown. Faster and tighter convergence can be achieved across a range of scenarios with the social dynamics inspired algorithm, compared with standard Mean-Subsequence-Reduced-type methods. ",

Large language models (LLMs) show promise for programming tasks, motivating their application to decompilation. However, there does not exist any open-source LLM for decompilation. Moreover, existing decompilation evaluation systems mainly consider token-level accuracy and largely ignore code executability, which is the most important feature of any program. Therefore, we release the first open-access decompilation LLMs ranging from 1B to 33B pre-trained on 4 billion tokens of C source code and the corresponding assembly code. The open-source LLMs can serve as baselines for further development in the field. To ensure practical program evaluation, we introduce Decompile-Eval, the first dataset that considers re-compilability and re-executability for decompilation. The benchmark emphasizes the importance of evaluating the decompilation model from the perspective of program semantics. Experiments indicate that our LLM4Decompile has demonstrated the capability to accurately decompile 21% of the assembly code, which achieves a 50% improvement over GPT-4. Our code, dataset, and models are released at https://github.com/albertan017/LLM4Decompile ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the effect of momentum on the optimisation trajectory of gradient descent. We leverage a continuous-time approach in the analysis of momentum gradient descent with step size $\\gamma$ and momentum parameter $\\beta$ that allows us to identify an intrinsic quantity $\\lambda = \\frac{ \\gamma }{ (1 - \\beta)^2 }$ which uniquely defines the optimisation path and provides a simple acceleration rule. When training a $2$-layer diagonal linear network in an overparametrised regression setting, we characterise the recovered solution through an implicit regularisation problem. We then prove that small values of $\\lambda$ help to recover sparse solutions. Finally, we give similar but weaker results for stochastic momentum gradient descent. We provide numerical experiments which support our claims. ",

We propose a new mixture-of-experts prior, softly guiding each modality's latent representation towards a shared aggregate posterior. This approach results in a superior latent representation and allows each encoding to preserve information from its uncompressed original features better.

Previous fusion-based 3D occupancy predictions relied on depth estimation for processing 2D image features. However, depth estimation is an ill-posed problem, hindering the accuracy and robustness of these methods. Furthermore, fine-grained occupancy prediction demands extensive computational resources. We introduce OccFusion, a multi-modal fusion method free from depth estimation, and a corresponding point cloud sampling algorithm for dense integration of image features. Building on this, we propose an active training method and an active coarse to fine pipeline, enabling the model to adaptively learn more from complex samples and optimize predictions specifically for challenging areas such as small or overlapping objects. The active methods we propose can be naturally extended to any occupancy prediction model. Experiments on the OpenOccupancy benchmark show our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-modal methods in IoU across all categories. Additionally, our model is more efficient during both the training and inference phases, requiring far fewer computational resources.

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art face recognition systems are typically trained on a single computer, utilizing extensive image datasets collected from various number of users. However, these datasets often contain sensitive personal information that users may hesitate to disclose. To address potential privacy concerns, we explore the application of federated learning, both with and without secure aggregators, in the context of both supervised and unsupervised face recognition systems. Federated learning facilitates the training of a shared model without necessitating the sharing of individual private data, achieving this by training models on decentralized edge devices housing the data. In our proposed system, each edge device independently trains its own model, which is subsequently transmitted either to a secure aggregator or directly to the central server. To introduce diverse data without the need for data transmission, we employ generative adversarial networks to generate imposter data at the edge. Following this, the secure aggregator or central server combines these individual models to construct a global model, which is then relayed back to the edge devices. Experimental findings based on the CelebA datasets reveal that employing federated learning in both supervised and unsupervised face recognition systems offers dual benefits. Firstly, it safeguards privacy since the original data remains on the edge devices. Secondly, the experimental results demonstrate that the aggregated model yields nearly identical performance compared to the individual models, particularly when the federated model does not utilize a secure aggregator. Hence, our results shed light on the practical challenges associated with privacy-preserving face image training, particularly in terms of the balance between privacy and accuracy. ",

Pseudo-labeling methods, although initially powerful, struggle with multi-scenario incremental learning due to their tendency to forget past knowledge. To overcome this, we introduce a new approach called Vision-Language Model assisted Pseudo-Labeling (VLM-PL). This technique uses Vision-Language Model (VLM) to verify the correctness of pseudo ground-truths (GTs) without requiring additional model training. VLM-PL starts by deriving pseudo GTs from a pre-trained detector. Then, we generate custom queries for each pseudo GT using carefully designed prompt templates that combine image and text features. This allows the VLM to classify the correctness through its responses. Furthermore, VLM-PL integrates refined pseudo and real GTs from upcoming training, effectively combining new and old knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on the Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets not only highlight VLM-PL's exceptional performance in multi-scenario but also illuminate its effectiveness in dual-scenario by achieving state-of-the-art results in both.

Quantization usually involves mapping a high-precision real number to a lower-precision value, aiming at reducing the size of the model at hand. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first application of quantization on the robustness of NLP models. In our experiments, we evaluate the impact of quantization on BERT and DistilBERT models in text classification using SST-2, Emotion, and MR datasets. We also evaluate the performance of these models against TextFooler, PWWS, and PSO adversarial attacks. Our findings show that quantization significantly improves (by an average of 18.68%) the adversarial accuracy of the models. Furthermore, we compare the effect of quantization versus that of the adversarial training approach on robustness. Our experiments indicate that quantization increases the robustness of the model by 18.80% on average compared to adversarial training without imposing any extra computational overhead during training. Therefore, our results highlight the effectiveness of quantization in improving the robustness of NLP models. ",

    "abstract": "In the Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem, products composed of up to L resources are sold to stochastically arriving customers. We take a randomized rounding approach to NRM, motivated by developments in Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS). The goal is to take a fractional solution to NRM that satisfies the resource constraints in expectation, and implement it in an online policy that satisfies the resource constraints in any state, while (approximately) preserving all of the sales that were prescribed by the fractional solution. OCRS cannot be naively applied to NRM or revenue management problems in general, because customer substitution induces a negative correlation in products being demanded. We start by deriving an OCRS that achieves a guarantee of 1/(1+L) for NRM with customer substitution, matching a common benchmark in the literature. We then show how to beat this benchmark for all integers L>1 assuming no substitution, i.e., in the standard OCRS setting. By contrast, we show that this benchmark is unbeatable using OCRS or any fractional relaxation if there is customer substitution, for all integers L that are the power of a prime number. Finally, we show how to beat 1/(1+L) even with customer substitution, if the products comprise one item from each of up to L groups. Our results have corresponding implications for Online Combinatorial Auctions, in which buyers bid for bundles of up to L items, and buyers being single-minded is akin to no substitution. Our final result also beats 1/(1+L) for Prophet Inequality on the intersection of L partition matroids. All in all, our paper provides a unifying framework for applying OCRS to these problems, delineating the impact of substitution, and establishing a separation between the guarantees achievable with vs. without substitution under general resource constraints parametrized by L.

A large-scale pre-trained model is used to build class-reference embeddings or prototypes, which are compared to region proposal contents for label prediction. In addition, we propose to fine-tune prototypes on available training images to boost performance and learn differences between similar classes, such as aircraft types. We perform extensive evaluations on two remote sensing datasets containing challenging and rare objects. Moreover, we study the performance of both visual and image-text features, namely DINOv2 and CLIP, including two CLIP models specifically tailored for remote sensing applications. Results indicate that visual features are largely superior to vision-language models, as the latter lack the necessary domain-specific vocabulary. Lastly, the developed detector outperforms fully supervised and few-shot methods evaluated on the SIMD and DIOR datasets, despite minimal training parameters. ",

In this paper, we extend these results by proving that these guarantees hold true when using gradient descent with an appropriately chosen step-size/learning rate. We also show that the discretization only affects the overparametrization bound for a two-layer DIP network by a constant and thus that the different guarantees found for the gradient flow will hold for gradient descent.

Notably, neglecting this assumption can result in significant errors, a fact that is often disregarded in the causal analysis of brain networks. In this study, we propose an algorithmic identification approach for determining essential exogenous nodes that satisfy the critical need for causal sufficiency to adhere to it in such inquiries. Our approach consists of three main steps: First, by capturing the essence of the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm, we conduct independence tests for pairs of regions within a network, as well as for the same pairs conditioned on nodes from other networks. Next, we distinguish candidate confounders by analyzing the differences between the conditional and unconditional results, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Subsequently, we utilize Non-Factorized identifiable Variational Autoencoders (NF-iVAE) along with the Correlation Coefficient index (CCI) metric to identify the confounding variables within these candidate nodes. Applying our method to the Human Connectome Projects (HCP) movie-watching task data, we demonstrate that while interactions exist between dorsal and ventral regions, only dorsal regions serve as confounders for the visual networks, and vice versa. These findings align consistently with those resulting from the neuroscientific perspective. Finally, we show the reliability of our results by testing 30 independent runs for NF-iVAE initialization.

To highlight this issue, we propose a negative sample augmentation method in this paper. Specifically, a negative augmentation approach is proposed to generate massive negatives for self-supervised learning. Firstly, we perform a sequential noise modeling technology to generate realistic infrared data. Secondly, we fuse the extracted noise with the original data to facilitate diversity and fidelity in the generated data. Lastly, we proposed a negative augmentation strategy to enrich diversity as well as maintain semantic invariance.

However, the current public UAV datasets might ignore the diverse altitudes, vehicle attributes, fine-grained instance-level annotation in mostly side view with blurred vehicle roof, so none of them is good to study the adversarial patch based vehicle detection attack problem.

We propose a network reconstruction method that inherits the best of the two approaches by reconstructing a directed weighted network from noisy data under the assumption that the network is sparse and the dynamics are governed by a linear (or weakly-nonlinear) stochastic dynamical system. The two steps of our method are i) constructing an (infinite) family of candidate networks by solving the covariance matrix Lyapunov equation for the state matrix and ii) using L1-regularization to select a sparse solution.

Autonomous robotic rehabilitation significantly reduces human workloads in the long and tedious rehabilitation process. However, training a rehabilitation robot is challenging due to the data scarcity issue. This challenge arises from privacy concerns (e.g., the risk of leaking private disease and identity information of patients) during clinical data access and usage. Data from various patients and hospitals cannot be shared for adequate robot training, further compromising rehabilitation safety and limiting implementation scopes. To address this challenge, this work developed a novel federated joint learning (FJL) method to jointly train robots across hospitals. FJL also adopted a long short-term memory network (LSTM)-Transformer learning mechanism to effectively explore the complex tempo-spatial relations among patient mobility conditions and robotic rehabilitation motions. To validate FJL's effectiveness in training a robot network, a clinic-simulation combined experiment was designed. Real rehabilitation exercise data from 200 patients with stroke diseases (upper limb hemiplegia, Parkinson's syndrome, and back pain syndrome) were adopted. Inversely driven by clinical data, 300,000 robotic rehabilitation guidances were simulated. FJL proved to be effective in joint rehabilitation learning, performing 20% - 30% better than baseline methods. ",

    "abstract": "Increasingly, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming a reality, such as the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in vehicles that assist drivers in driving and parking functions with vehicles today. The localization problem for AVs relies primarily on multiple sensors, including cameras, LiDARs, and radars. Manufacturing, installing, calibrating, and maintaining these sensors can be very expensive, thereby increasing the overall cost of AVs. This research explores the means to improve localization on vehicles belonging to the ADAS category in a platooning context, where an ADAS vehicle follows a lead \"Smart\" AV equipped with a highly accurate sensor suite. We propose and produce results by using a filtering framework to combine pose information derived from vision and odometry to improve the localization of the ADAS vehicle that follows the smart vehicle.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we apply a machine-learning approach to learn traveling solitary waves across various families of partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach integrates a novel interpretable neural network (NN) architecture, called Separable Gaussian Neural Networks (SGNN) into the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Unlike the traditional PINNs that treat spatial and temporal data as independent inputs, the present method leverages wave characteristics to transform data into the so-called co-traveling wave frame. This adaptation effectively addresses the issue of propagation failure in PINNs when applied to large computational domains. Here, the SGNN architecture demonstrates robust approximation capabilities for single-peakon, multi-peakon, and stationary solutions within the (1+1)-dimensional, $b$-family of PDEs. In addition, we expand our investigations, and explore not only peakon solutions in the $ab$-family but also compacton solutions in (2+1)-dimensional, Rosenau-Hyman family of PDEs. A comparative analysis with MLP reveals that SGNN achieves comparable accuracy with fewer than a tenth of the neurons, underscoring its efficiency and potential for broader application in solving complex nonlinear PDEs.

    "abstract": "Graph-based learning approaches, due to their ability to encode tissue/organ structure information, are increasingly favored for grading colorectal cancer histology images. Recent graph-based techniques involve dividing whole slide images (WSIs) into smaller or medium-sized patches, and then building graphs on each patch for direct use in training. This method, however, fails to capture the tissue structure information present in an entire WSI and relies on training from a significantly large dataset of image patches. In this paper, we propose a novel cell-to-patch graph convolutional network (C2P-GCN), which is a two-stage graph formation-based approach. In the first stage, it forms a patch-level graph based on the cell organization on each patch of a WSI. In the second stage, it forms an image-level graph based on a similarity measure between patches of a WSI considering each patch as a node of a graph. This graph representation is then fed into a multi-layer GCN-based classification network. Our approach, through its dual-phase graph construction, effectively gathers local structural details from individual patches and establishes a meaningful connection among all patches across a WSI. As C2P-GCN integrates the structural data of an entire WSI into a single graph, it allows our model to work with significantly fewer training data compared to the latest models for colorectal cancer. Experimental validation of C2P-GCN on two distinct colorectal cancer datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. ",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the optimality of the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy in both adversarial and stochastic $K$-armed bandits. Despite the widespread use of the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework with various choices of regularization, the FTPL framework, which relies on random perturbations, has not received much attention, despite its inherent simplicity. In adversarial bandits, there has been conjecture that FTPL could potentially achieve $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{KT})$ regrets if perturbations follow a distribution with a Fr\\'{e}chet-type tail. Recent work by Honda et al. (2023) showed that FTPL with Fr\\'{e}chet distribution with shape $\\alpha=2$ indeed attains this bound and, notably logarithmic regret in stochastic bandits, meaning the Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) capability of FTPL. However, this result only partly resolves the above conjecture because their analysis heavily relies on the specific form of the Fr\\'{e}chet distribution with this shape. In this paper, we establish a sufficient condition for perturbations to achieve $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{KT})$ regrets in the adversarial setting, which covers, e.g., Fr\\'{e}chet, Pareto, and Student-$t$ distributions. We also demonstrate the BOBW achievability of FTPL with certain Fr\\'{e}chet-type tail distributions. Our results contribute not only to resolving existing conjectures through the lens of extreme value theory but also potentially offer insights into the effect of the regularization functions in FTRL through the mapping from FTPL to FTRL.

    "abstract": "In general, diffusion model-based MRI reconstruction methods incrementally remove artificially added noise while imposing data consistency to reconstruct the underlying images. However, real-world MRI acquisitions already contain inherent noise due to thermal fluctuations. This phenomenon is particularly notable when using ultra-fast, high-resolution imaging sequences for advanced research, or using low-field systems favored by low- and middle-income countries. These common scenarios can lead to sub-optimal performance or complete failure of existing diffusion model-based reconstruction techniques. Specifically, as the artificially added noise is gradually removed, the inherent MRI noise becomes increasingly pronounced, making the actual noise level inconsistent with the predefined denoising schedule and consequently inaccurate image reconstruction. To tackle this problem, we propose a posterior sampling strategy with a novel NoIse Level Adaptive Data Consistency (Nila-DC) operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets and an in-house clinical dataset with field strength ranging from 0.3T to 3T, showing that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods, and is highly robust against various noise levels. The code will be released after review. ",

While accurate, such neural networks are computationally expensive. In this work, we explore the flipped approach, where we first compute antisymmetric quantities based on the electronic coordinates and then apply sign equivariant neural networks to preserve the antisymmetry. While this approach promises acceleration thanks to the lower-dimensional representation, we demonstrate that it reduces to a Jastrow factor, a commonly used permutation-invariant multiplicative factor in the wave function. Our empirical results support this further, finding little to no improvements over baselines. We conclude with neither theoretical nor empirical advantages of sign equivariant functions for representing electronic wave functions within the evaluation of this work. ",

Alzheimer's disease is a common brain disorder that causes memory loss and the shrinking of brain cells. Early detection is critical for providing proper treatment to patients. However, identifying Alzheimer's at an early stage using manual scanning of CT or MRI scans is challenging. Therefore, researchers have delved into the exploration of computer-aided systems, employing Machine Learning and Deep Learning methodologies, which entail the training of datasets to detect Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to present a hybrid model that combines a CNN model's feature extraction capabilities with an LSTM model's detection capabilities. This study has applied the transfer learning called VGG16 in the hybrid model to extract features from MRI images. The LSTM detects features between the convolution layer and the fully connected layer. The output layer of the fully connected layer uses the softmax function. The training of the hybrid model involved utilizing the ADNI dataset. The trial findings revealed that the model achieved a level of accuracy of 98.8%, a sensitivity rate of 100%, and a specificity rate of 76%. The proposed hybrid model outperforms its contemporary CNN counterparts, showcasing a superior performance. ",

The aim is to find, in a given connected graph $G$, a path $P$ minimizing its eccentricity, which is the maximal distance from $P$ to any vertex of the graph $G$. The path eccentricity of $G$ is the minimal eccentricity achievable over all paths in $G$. In this article we consider the path eccentricity of the class of the $k$-AT-free graphs. They are graphs in which any set of three vertices contains a pair for which every path between them uses at least one vertex of the closed neighborhood at distance $k$ of the third. We prove that they have path eccentricity bounded by $k$. Moreover, we answer a question of G\\'omez and Guti\\'errez asking if there is a relation between path eccentricity and the consecutive ones property. The latter is the property for a binary matrix to admit a permutation of the rows placing the 1's consecutively on the columns. It was already known that graphs whose adjacency matrices have the consecutive ones property have path eccentricity at most 1, and that the same remains true when the augmented adjacency matrices (with ones on the diagonal) has the consecutive ones property. We generalize these results as follow. We study graphs whose adjacency matrices can be made to satisfy the consecutive ones property after changing some values on the diagonal, and show that those graphs have path eccentricity at most 2, by showing that they are 2-AT-free.

    "abstract": "We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. In subsequent time steps, all particles that are located on a vertex inhabited by at least two particles jump independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle; we call this (random) time step the dispersion time. In this work we study the case where $G$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices and the number of particles is $M=n/2+\\alpha n^{1/2} + o(n^{1/2})$, $\\alpha\\in \\mathbb{R}$. This choice of $M$ corresponds to the critical window of the process, with respect to the dispersion time. We show that the dispersion time, if rescaled by $n^{-1/2}$, converges in $p$-th mean, as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$ and for any $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$, to a continuous and almost surely positive random variable $T_\\alpha$. We find that $T_\\alpha$ is the absorption time of a standard logistic branching process, thoroughly investigated by Lambert (2005), and we determine its expectation. In particular, in the middle of the critical window we show that $\\mathbb{E}[T_0] = \\pi^{3/2}/\\sqrt{7}$, and furthermore we formulate explicit asymptotics when $|\\alpha|$ gets large that quantify the transition into and out of the critical window. We also study the random variable counting the total number of jumps that are performed by the particles until the dispersion time is reached and prove that, if rescaled by $n\\ln n$, it converges to $2/7$ in probability.

The proposed method utilizes detailed anatomical segmentations of the heart as ground truth label sources. This initial dataset is combined with a second dataset made up of real 3D echocardiographic images to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize realistic 3D cardiovascular Ultrasound images paired with ground truth labels. To generate the synthetic 3D dataset, the trained GAN uses high resolution anatomical models from Computed Tomography (CT) as input. A qualitative analysis of the synthesized images showed that the main structures of the heart are well delineated and closely follow the labels obtained from the anatomical models. To assess the usability of these synthetic images for DL tasks, segmentation algorithms were trained to delineate the left ventricle, left atrium, and myocardium. A quantitative analysis of the 3D segmentations given by the models trained with the synthetic images indicated the potential use of this GAN approach to generate 3D synthetic data, use the data to train DL models for different clinical tasks, and therefore tackle the problem of scarcity of 3D labeled echocardiography datasets.

While the problem of recognizing balanceable graphs was conjectured to be NP-complete by Dailly, Hansberg, and Ventura in 2021, balanceable graphs admit an elegant combinatorial characterization: a graph is balanceable if and only there exist two vertex subsets, one containing half of all the graph's edges and another one such that the corresponding cut contains half of all the graph's edges. We consider a special case of this property, namely when one of the two sets is a vertex cover, and call the corresponding graphs simply balanceable. We prove a number of results on balanceable and simply balanceable regular graphs. First, we characterize simply balanceable regular graphs via a condition involving the independence number of the graph. Second, we address a question of Dailly, Hansberg, and Ventura from 2021 and show that every cubic graph is balanceable. Third, using Brooks' theorem, we show that every $4$-regular graph with order divisible by $4$ is balanceable. Finally, we show that it is NP-complete to determine if a $9$-regular graph is simply balanceable. ",

    "abstract": "Radio-interferometric (RI) imaging entails solving high-resolution high-dynamic range inverse problems from large data volumes. Recent image reconstruction techniques grounded in optimization theory have demonstrated remarkable capability for imaging precision, well beyond CLEAN's capability. These range from advanced proximal algorithms propelled by handcrafted regularization operators, such as the SARA family, to hybrid plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms propelled by learned regularization denoisers, such as AIRI. Optimization and PnP structures are however highly iterative, which hinders their ability to handle the extreme data sizes expected from future instruments. To address this scalability challenge, we introduce a novel deep learning approach, dubbed ``Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging'. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. It thus takes a hybrid structure between a PnP algorithm and a learned version of the matching pursuit algorithm that underpins CLEAN. We present a comprehensive study of our approach, featuring its multiple incarnations distinguished by their DNN architectures. We provide a detailed description of its training process, targeting a telescope-specific approach. R2D2's capability to deliver high precision is demonstrated in simulation, across a variety of image and observation settings using the Very Large Array (VLA). Its reconstruction speed is also demonstrated: with only few iterations required to clean data residuals at dynamic ranges up to 105, R2D2 opens the door to fast precision imaging.
