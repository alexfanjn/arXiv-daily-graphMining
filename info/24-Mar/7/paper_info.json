    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has produced impressive results in multimedia domains of audio, vision and speech. This paradigm is equally, if not more, relevant for the domain of biosignals, owing to the scarcity of labelled data in such scenarios. The ability to leverage large-scale unlabelled data to learn robust representations could help improve the performance of numerous inference tasks on biosignals. Given the inherent domain differences between multimedia modalities and biosignals, the established objectives for self-supervised learning may not translate well to this domain. Hence, there is an unmet need to adapt these methods to biosignal analysis. In this work we propose a self-supervised model for EEG, which provides robust performance and remarkable parameter efficiency by using state space-based deep learning architecture. We also propose a novel knowledge-guided pre-training objective that accounts for the idiosyncrasies of the EEG signal. The results indicate improved embedding representation learning and downstream performance compared to prior works on exemplary tasks. Also, the proposed objective significantly reduces the amount of pre-training data required to obtain performance equivalent to prior works. ",

    "title": "Exact Enforcement of Temporal Continuity in Sequential Physics-Informed  Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "The use of deep learning methods in scientific computing represents a potential paradigm shift in engineering problem solving. One of the most prominent developments is Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), in which neural networks are trained to satisfy partial differential equations (PDEs) and/or observed data. While this method shows promise, the standard version has been shown to struggle in accurately predicting the dynamic behavior of time-dependent problems. To address this challenge, methods have been proposed that decompose the time domain into multiple segments, employing a distinct neural network in each segment and directly incorporating continuity between them in the loss function of the minimization problem. In this work we introduce a method to exactly enforce continuity between successive time segments via a solution ansatz. This hard constrained sequential PINN (HCS-PINN) method is simple to implement and eliminates the need for any loss terms associated with temporal continuity. The method is tested for a number of benchmark problems involving both linear and non-linear PDEs. Examples include various first order time dependent problems in which traditional PINNs struggle, namely advection, Allen-Cahn, and Korteweg-de Vries equations. Furthermore, second and third order time-dependent problems are demonstrated via wave and Jerky dynamics examples, respectively. Notably, the Jerky dynamics problem is chaotic, making the problem especially sensitive to temporal accuracy. The numerical experiments conducted with the proposed method demonstrated superior convergence and accuracy over both traditional PINNs and the soft-constrained counterparts. ",

Wireless channel prediction is a long-standing problem in the wireless community and is a key technology for improving the coverage of wireless network deployments. Today, a wireless deployment is evaluated by a site survey which is a cumbersome process requiring an experienced engineer to perform extensive channel measurements. To reduce the cost of site surveys, we develop NeWRF, which is based on recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). NeWRF trains a neural network model with a sparse set of channel measurements, and predicts the wireless channel accurately at any location in the site. We introduce a series of techniques that integrate wireless propagation properties into the NeRF framework to account for the fundamental differences between the behavior of light and wireless signals. We conduct extensive evaluations of our framework and show that our approach can accurately predict channels at unvisited locations with significantly lower measurement density than prior state-of-the-art ",

The difficulty partially arises from two seemingly contradictory goals: learning a common model by aggregating the information from clients, and learning local personalized models that should be adapted to each local distribution. In this work, we propose Solution Simplex Clustered Federated Learning (SosicFL) for dissolving such contradiction. Based on the recent ideas of learning solution simplices, SosicFL assigns a subregion in a simplex to each client, and performs FL to learn a common solution simplex. This allows the client models to possess their characteristics within the degrees of freedom in the solution simplex, and at the same time achieves the goal of learning a global common model. Our experiments show that SosicFL improves the performance and accelerates the training process for global and personalized FL with minimal computational overhead. ",

The claims are either explicitly or implicitly expressed by the user. We detail (i) a method of claim identification -- the task of identifying if a post title contains a claim and (ii) an opinion mining-driven evaluation framework for stance detection using LLMs. We facilitate our exploration by releasing a novel test dataset, Long COVID-Stance, or LC-stance, which can be used to evaluate LLMs on the tasks of claim identification and stance detection in online health communities. Long Covid is an emerging post-COVID disorder with uncertain and complex treatment guidelines, thus making it a suitable use case for our task. LC-Stance contains long COVID treatment related discourse sourced from a Reddit community. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4 significantly outperforms prior works on zero-shot stance detection. We then perform thorough LLM model diagnostics, identifying the role of claim type (i.e. implicit vs explicit claims) and comment length as sources of model error. ",

In contrast to the standard privacy notion for these problems, which is analogous to node-privacy in graphs, our new definition gives a more fine-grained privacy guarantee, which is analogous to edge-privacy. We illustrate several scenarios of Set Cover and Max Cover where our privacy notion is desired one for the application. Our main result is an $\\epsilon$-edge differentially private algorithm for Max Cover which obtains an $(1-1/e-\\eta,\\tilde{O}(k/\\epsilon))$-approximation with high probability. Furthermore, we show that this result is nearly tight: we give a lower bound show that an additive error of $\\Omega(k/\\epsilon)$ is necessary under edge-differential privacy. Via group privacy properties, this implies a new algorithm for $\\epsilon$-node differentially private Max Cover which obtains an $(1-1/e-\\eta,\\tilde{O}(fk/\\epsilon))$-approximation, where $f$ is the maximum degree of an element in the set system. When $f\\ll k$, this improves over the best known algorithm for Max Cover under pure (node) differential privacy, which obtains an $(1-1/e,\\tilde{O}(k^2/\\epsilon))$-approximation. ",

Existing non-learning based solutions for vehicle control rely on rules and optimization primarily. These methods have been seen to present significant challenges. Recent advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning have shown promise and have received significant academic interest however the available learning based approaches show inadequate attention to other highway vehicles and often rely on inaccurate road traffic assumptions. In addition, the parallel-style case is rarely considered. A novel learning based model for acceleration and lane change decision making that explicitly considers the utility to both the ego vehicle and its surrounding vehicles which may be cooperative or uncooperative to produce behaviour that is socially acceptable is proposed. The novel reward function makes use of Social Value Orientation to weight the vehicle's level of social cooperation and is divided into ego vehicle and surrounding vehicle utility which are weighted according to the model's designated Social Value Orientation. A two-lane highway with an on-ramp divided into a taper-style and parallel-style section is considered. Simulation results indicated the importance of considering surrounding vehicles in reward function design and show that the proposed model matches or surpasses those in literature in terms of collisions while also introducing socially courteous behaviour avoiding near misses and anti-social behaviour through direct consideration of the effect of merging on surrounding vehicles.

However, this paper emphasizes that not all types of I/O can derive substantial benefits from TIO, particularly network I/O. Given the obligatory use of encryption protocols for network traffic in CVM's threat model, TIO's approach of I/O encryption over the PCIe bus becomes redundant. Furthermore, TIO solutions need to expand the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) to include TIO devices and are commercially unavailable. Motivated by these insights, the goal of this paper is to propose a software solution that helps CVMs immediately benefit from high-performance networks, while confining trust only to the on-chip CVM. We present FOLIO, a software solution crafted from a secure and efficient Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) extension compatible with the latest version of AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), a.k.a., Secure Nested Paging (SNP). Our design is informed by a thorough analysis of all possible factors that impact SNP VM's network performance. By extensively removing overhead sources, we arrive at a design that approaches the efficiency of an optimal TIO-based configuration. Evaluation shows that FOLIO has a performance dip less than 6% relative to the optimal TIO configuration, while only relying on off-the-shelf CPUs. ",

However, external interference on clients leads to significant performance degradation during dynamic (unlicensed) spectrum access (DSA). We introduce the notion of network tomography for DSA, whereby clients are transformed into spectrum sensors, whose joint access statistics are measured and used to account for interfering sources. Albeit promising, performing such tomography naively incurs an impractical overhead that scales exponentially with the multiplexing order of the strategies deployed -- which will only continue to grow with 5G/6G technologies. To this end, we propose a novel, scalable network tomography framework called NeTo-X that estimates joint client access statistics with just linear overhead, and forms a blue-print of the interference, thus enabling efficient DSA for future networks. NeTo-X's design incorporates intelligent algorithms that leverage multi-channel diversity and the spatial locality of interference impact on clients to accurately estimate the desired interference statistics from just pair-wise measurements of its clients. The merits of its framework are showcased in the context of resource management and jammer localization applications, where its performance significantly outperforms baseline approaches and closely approximates optimal performance at a scalable overhead.

However, the reliance on herbicide application not only poses a critical threat to the environment but also promotes the emergence of resistant weeds. Fortunately, recent advances in precision weed management enabled by ML and DL provide a sustainable alternative. Despite great progress, existing algorithms are mainly developed based on supervised learning approaches, which typically demand large-scale datasets with manual-labeled annotations, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. As such, label-efficient learning methods, especially semi-supervised learning, have gained increased attention in the broader domain of computer vision and have demonstrated promising performance. These methods aim to utilize a small number of labeled data samples along with a great number of unlabeled samples to develop high-performing models comparable to the supervised learning counterpart trained on a large amount of labeled data samples. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a semi-supervised learning framework for multi-class weed detection, employing two well-known object detection frameworks, namely FCOS and Faster-RCNN. Specifically, we evaluate a generalized student-teacher framework with an improved pseudo-label generation module to produce reliable pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. To enhance generalization, an ensemble student network is employed to facilitate the training process. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve approximately 76\\% and 96\\% detection accuracy as the supervised methods with only 10\\% of labeled data in CottenWeedDet3 and CottonWeedDet12, respectively.

In this paper, we aim to mitigate this data scarcity issue by learning AU representations from a large number of unlabelled facial videos in a contrastive learning paradigm. We formulate the self-supervised AU representation learning signals in two-fold: (1) AU representation should be frame-wisely discriminative within a short video clip; (2) Facial frames sampled from different identities but show analogous facial AUs should have consistent AU representations. As to achieve these goals, we propose to contrastively learn the AU representation within a video clip and devise a cross-identity reconstruction mechanism to learn the person-independent representations. Specially, we adopt a margin-based temporal contrastive learning paradigm to perceive the temporal AU coherence and evolution characteristics within a clip that consists of consecutive input facial frames. Moreover, the cross-identity reconstruction mechanism facilitates pushing the faces from different identities but show analogous AUs close in the latent embedding space. Experimental results on three public AU datasets demonstrate that the learned AU representation is discriminative for AU detection.

The design of sparse RSNNs with fewer neurons and synapses helps reduce the computational complexity of RSNNs. Traditionally, sparse SNNs are obtained by first training a dense and complex SNN for a target task, and, then, pruning neurons with low activity (activity-based pruning) while maintaining task performance. In contrast, this paper presents a task-agnostic methodology for designing sparse RSNNs by pruning a large randomly initialized model. We introduce a novel Lyapunov Noise Pruning (LNP) algorithm that uses graph sparsification methods and utilizes Lyapunov exponents to design a stable sparse RSNN from a randomly initialized RSNN. We show that the LNP can leverage diversity in neuronal timescales to design a sparse Heterogeneous RSNN (HRSNN). Further, we show that the same sparse HRSNN model can be trained for different tasks, such as image classification and temporal prediction. We experimentally show that, in spite of being task-agnostic, LNP increases computational efficiency (fewer neurons and synapses) and prediction performance of RSNNs compared to traditional activity-based pruning of trained dense models.

A fundamental challenge in this sphere is managing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples, significantly increasing the risks of model misclassification and uncertainty. Our work addresses this challenge by enhancing the detection and management of OOD samples in neural networks. We introduce OOD-R (Out-of-Distribution-Rectified), a meticulously curated collection of open-source datasets with enhanced noise reduction properties. In-Distribution (ID) noise in existing OOD datasets can lead to inaccurate evaluation of detection algorithms. Recognizing this, OOD-R incorporates noise filtering technologies to refine the datasets, ensuring a more accurate and reliable evaluation of OOD detection algorithms. This approach not only improves the overall quality of data but also aids in better distinguishing between OOD and ID samples, resulting in up to a 2.5\\% improvement in model accuracy and a minimum 3.2\\% reduction in false positives. Furthermore, we present ActFun, an innovative method that fine-tunes the model's response to diverse inputs, thereby improving the stability of feature extraction and minimizing specificity issues. ActFun addresses the common problem of model overconfidence in OOD detection by strategically reducing the influence of hidden units, which enhances the model's capability to estimate OOD uncertainty more accurately.

    "abstract": "Chinese landscape painting has a unique and artistic style, and its drawing technique is highly abstract in both the use of color and the realistic representation of objects. Previous methods focus on transferring from modern photos to ancient ink paintings. However, little attention has been paid to translating landscape paintings into modern photos. To solve such problems, in this paper, we (1) propose DLP-GAN (\\textbf{D}raw Modern Chinese \\textbf{L}andscape \\textbf{P}hotos with \\textbf{G}enerative \\textbf{A}dversarial \\textbf{N}etwork), an unsupervised cross-domain image translation framework with a novel asymmetric cycle mapping, and (2) introduce a generator based on a dense-fusion module to match different translation directions. Moreover, a dual-consistency loss is proposed to balance the realism and abstraction of model painting. In this way, our model can draw landscape photos and sketches in the modern sense. Finally, based on our collection of modern landscape and sketch datasets, we compare the images generated by our model with other benchmarks. Extensive experiments including user studies show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "In representation learning on graph-structured data, many popular graph neural networks (GNNs) fail to capture long-range dependencies, leading to performance degradation. Furthermore, this weakness is magnified when the concerned graph is characterized by heterophily (low homophily). To solve this issue, this paper proposes a novel graph learning framework called the graph convolutional network with self-attention (GCN-SA). The proposed scheme exhibits an exceptional generalization capability in node-level representation learning. The proposed GCN-SA contains two enhancements corresponding to edges and node features. For edges, we utilize a self-attention mechanism to design a stable and effective graph-structure-learning module that can capture the internal correlation between any pair of nodes. This graph-structure-learning module can identify reliable neighbors for each node from the entire graph. Regarding the node features, we modify the transformer block to make it more applicable to enable GCN to fuse valuable information from the entire graph. These two enhancements work in distinct ways to help our GCN-SA capture long-range dependencies, enabling it to perform representation learning on graphs with varying levels of homophily. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GCN-SA. Compared to other outstanding GNN counterparts, the proposed GCN-SA is competitive. ",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed great success in handling graph-related tasks with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their great academic success, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) remain the primary workhorse for practical industrial applications. One reason for such an academic-industry gap is the neighborhood-fetching latency incurred by data dependency in GNNs. To reduce their gaps, Graph Knowledge Distillation (GKD) is proposed, usually based on a standard teacher-student architecture, to distill knowledge from a large teacher GNN into a lightweight student GNN or MLP. However, we found in this paper that neither teachers nor GNNs are necessary for graph knowledge distillation. We propose a Teacher-Free Graph Self-Distillation (TGS) framework that does not require any teacher model or GNNs during both training and inference. More importantly, the proposed TGS framework is purely based on MLPs, where structural information is only implicitly used to guide dual knowledge self-distillation between the target node and its neighborhood. As a result, TGS enjoys the benefits of graph topology awareness in training but is free from data dependency in inference. Extensive experiments have shown that the performance of vanilla MLPs can be greatly improved with dual self-distillation, e.g., TGS improves over vanilla MLPs by 15.54% on average and outperforms state-of-the-art GKD algorithms on six real-world datasets. In terms of inference speed, TGS infers 75X-89X faster than existing GNNs and 16X-25X faster than classical inference acceleration methods. ",

    "abstract": "Direct reciprocity based on the repeated prisoner's dilemma has been intensively studied. Most theoretical investigations have concentrated on memory-$1$ strategies, a class of elementary strategies just reacting to the previous-round outcomes. Though the properties of \"All-or-None\" strategies ($AoN_K$) have been discovered, simulations just confirmed the good performance of $AoN_K$ of very short memory lengths. It remains unclear how $AoN_K$ strategies would fare when players have access to longer rounds of history information. We construct a theoretical model to investigate the performance of the class of $AoN_K$ strategies of varying memory length $K$. We rigorously derive the payoffs and show that $AoN_K$ strategies of intermediate memory length $K$ are most prevalent, while strategies of larger memory lengths are less competent. Larger memory lengths make it hard for $AoN_K$ strategies to coordinate, and thus inhibiting their mutual reciprocity. We then propose the adaptive coordination strategy combining tolerance and $AoN_K$' coordination rule. This strategy behaves like $AoN_K$ strategy when coordination is not sufficient, and tolerates opponents' occasional deviations by still cooperating when coordination is sufficient. We found that the adaptive coordination strategy wins over other classic memory-$1$ strategies in various typical competition environments, and stabilizes the population at high levels of cooperation, suggesting the effectiveness of high level adaptability in resolving social dilemmas. Our work may offer a theoretical framework for exploring complex strategies using history information, which are different from traditional memory-$n$ strategies. ",

Because most of the training data does not reflect such changes, the models present poor performance on the new out-of-distribution scenarios and, therefore, the impact of such events cannot be reliably anticipated ahead of time. We present and publicly release CounterfacTS, a tool to probe the robustness of deep learning models in time-series forecasting tasks via counterfactuals. CounterfacTS has a user-friendly interface that allows the user to visualize, compare and quantify time series data and their forecasts, for a number of datasets and deep learning models. Furthermore, the user can apply various transformations to the time series and explore the resulting changes in the forecasts in an interpretable manner. Through example cases, we illustrate how CounterfacTS can be used to i) identify the main features characterizing and differentiating sets of time series, ii) assess how the model performance depends on these characateristics, and iii) guide transformations of the original time series to create counterfactuals with desired properties for training and increasing the forecasting performance in new regions of the data distribution. We discuss the importance of visualizing and considering the location of the data in a projected feature space to transform time-series and create effective counterfactuals for training the models. Overall, CounterfacTS aids at creating counterfactuals to efficiently explore the impact of hypothetical scenarios not covered by the original data in time-series forecasting tasks. ",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of large language models, language-based forecasting has recently emerged as an innovative approach for predicting human mobility patterns. The core idea is to use prompts to transform the raw mobility data given as numerical values into natural language sentences so that the language models can be leveraged to generate the description for future observations. However, previous studies have only employed fixed and manually designed templates to transform numerical values into sentences. Since the forecasting performance of language models heavily relies on prompts, using fixed templates for prompting may limit the forecasting capability of language models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for prompt mining in language-based mobility forecasting, aiming to explore diverse prompt design strategies. Specifically, the framework includes a prompt generation stage based on the information entropy of prompts and a prompt refinement stage to integrate mechanisms such as the chain of thought. Experimental results on real-world large-scale data demonstrate the superiority of generated prompts from our prompt mining pipeline. Additionally, the comparison of different prompt variants shows that the proposed prompt refinement process is effective. Our study presents a promising direction for further advancing language-based mobility forecasting. ",

Traditional approaches to robot arms' slip perception use tactile or vision sensors. However, mobile robots still have to deal with noise in their sensor signals caused by the robot's movement in a changing environment. To solve this problem, we present an anomaly detection method that utilizes multisensory data based on a deep autoencoder model. The proposed framework integrates heterogeneous data streams collected from various robot sensors, including RGB and depth cameras, a microphone, and a force-torque sensor. The integrated data is used to train a deep autoencoder to construct latent representations of the multisensory data that indicate the normal status. Anomalies can then be identified by error scores measured by the difference between the trained encoder's latent values and the latent values of reconstructed input data. In order to evaluate the proposed framework, we conducted an experiment that mimics an object slip by a mobile service robot operating in a real-world environment with diverse household objects and different moving patterns. The experimental results verified that the proposed framework reliably detects anomalies in object slip situations despite various object types and robot behaviors, and visual and auditory noise in the environment.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a new method referred to as VAE4AS (Variational Autoencoder for Anomalous Sequences). VAE4AS integrates incremental learning with dual drift detection mechanisms, employing both a statistical test and a distance-based test. The anomaly detection is facilitated by a Variational Autoencoder. To gauge the effectiveness of VAE4AS, a comprehensive experimental study is conducted using real-world and synthetic datasets characterized by anomalous rates below 10\\% and recurrent drift. The results show that the proposed method surpasses both robust baselines and state-of-the-art techniques, providing compelling evidence for their efficacy in effectively addressing some of the challenges associated with anomalous sequence detection in non-stationary streaming data.

    "abstract": "Social recommendation systems face the problem of social influence bias, which can lead to an overemphasis on recommending items that friends have interacted with. Addressing this problem is crucial, and existing methods often rely on techniques such as weight adjustment or leveraging unbiased data to eliminate this bias. However, we argue that not all biases are detrimental, i.e., some items recommended by friends may align with the user's interests. Blindly eliminating such biases could undermine these positive effects, potentially diminishing recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Causal Disentanglement-based framework for Regulating Social influence Bias in social recommendation, named CDRSB, to improve recommendation performance. From the perspective of causal inference, we find that the user social network could be regarded as a confounder between the user and item embeddings (treatment) and ratings (outcome). Due to the presence of this social network confounder, two paths exist from user and item embeddings to ratings: a non-causal social influence path and a causal interest path. Building upon this insight, we propose a disentangled encoder that focuses on disentangling user and item embeddings into interest and social influence embeddings. Mutual information-based objectives are designed to enhance the distinctiveness of these disentangled embeddings, eliminating redundant information. Additionally, a regulatory decoder that employs a weight calculation module to dynamically learn the weights of social influence embeddings for effectively regulating social influence bias has been designed. Experimental results on four large-scale real-world datasets Ciao, Epinions, Dianping, and Douban book demonstrate the effectiveness of CDRSB compared to state-of-the-art baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML), addresses a multitude of complex issues in multiple disciplines, including social sciences, finance, and medical research. ML models require substantial computing power and are only as powerful as the data utilized. Due to high computational cost of ML methods, data scientists frequently use Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) to outsource computation to external servers. However, when working with private information, like financial data or health records, outsourcing the computation might result in privacy issues. Recent advances in Privacy-Preserving Techniques (PPTs) have enabled ML training and inference over protected data through the use of Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML). However, these techniques are still at a preliminary stage and their application in real-world situations is demanding. In order to comprehend discrepancy between theoretical research suggestions and actual applications, this work examines the past and present of PPML, focusing on Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multi-party Computation (SMPC) applied to ML. This work primarily focuses on the ML model's training phase, where maintaining user data privacy is of utmost importance. We provide a solid theoretical background that eases the understanding of current approaches and their limitations. In addition, we present a SoK of the most recent PPML frameworks for model training and provide a comprehensive comparison in terms of the unique properties and performances on standard benchmarks. Also, we reproduce the results for some of the papers and examine at what level existing works in the field provide support for open science. We believe our work serves as a valuable contribution by raising awareness about the current gap between theoretical advancements and real-world applications in PPML, specifically regarding open-source availability, reproducibility, and usability.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular in modeling graph-structured data due to their ability to learn node representations by aggregating local structure information. However, it is widely acknowledged that the test graph structure may differ from the training graph structure, resulting in a structure shift. In this paper, we experimentally find that the performance of GNNs drops significantly when the structure shift happens, suggesting that the learned models may be biased towards specific structure patterns. To address this challenge, we propose the Cluster Information Transfer (CIT) mechanism (Code available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/CITGNN), which can learn invariant representations for GNNs, thereby improving their generalization ability to various and unknown test graphs with structure shift. The CIT mechanism achieves this by combining different cluster information with the nodes while preserving their cluster-independent information. By generating nodes across different clusters, the mechanism significantly enhances the diversity of the nodes and helps GNNs learn the invariant representations. We provide a theoretical analysis of the CIT mechanism, showing that the impact of changing clusters during structure shift can be mitigated after transfer. Additionally, the proposed mechanism is a plug-in that can be easily used to improve existing GNNs. We comprehensively evaluate our proposed method on three typical structure shift scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing GNNs' performance. ",

The former is able to observe multi-view image inputs to extract semantic and geometry features from a scene. Guided by the resulting image geometry information, the latter performs both image and semantic rendering with improved performances.

While centralized implementation of on-board detection induces unaffordable complexity for a single satellite, this paper proposes to allocate the processing load among cooperative satellites for finest exploitation of distributed processing power. Observing the inherent disparities among users, we first excavate the closed-form trade-offs between achievable sum-rate and the processing load corresponding to the satellite-user matchings, which leads to a system sum-rate maximization problem under stringent payload constraints. To address the non-trivial integer matching, we develop a quadratic transformation to the original problem, and prove it an equivalent conversion. The problem is further simplified into a series of subproblems employing successive lower bound approximation which obtains polynomial-time complexity and converges within a few iterations. Numerical results show remarkably complexity reduction compared with centralized processing, as well as around 20\\% sum-rate gain compared with other allocation methods. ",

To capture these dependencies, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools, yet their effectiveness is restricted by the quality of graph construction from MTS data. Typically, existing approaches construct graphs solely from MTS signals, which may introduce bias due to a small training dataset and may not accurately represent underlying dependencies. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named K-Link, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode extensive general knowledge and thereby providing effective solutions to reduce the bias. Leveraging the knowledge embedded in LLMs, such as physical principles, we extract a \\textit{Knowledge-Link graph}, capturing vast semantic knowledge of sensors and the linkage of the sensor-level knowledge. To harness the potential of the knowledge-link graph in enhancing the graph derived from MTS data, we propose a graph alignment module, facilitating the transfer of semantic knowledge within the knowledge-link graph into the MTS-derived graph. By doing so, we can improve the graph quality, ensuring effective representation learning with GNNs for MTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for superior performance across various MTS-related downstream tasks. ",

Cross-shard transactions pose a critical challenge to the security and efficiency of sharding blockchains. Current solutions, however, either prioritize security with assumptions and substantial investments, or focus on reducing overhead and overlooking security considerations. In this paper, we present Kronos, a generic and efficient sharding blockchain consensus ensuring robust security. We introduce a buffer mechanism for atomic cross-shard transaction processing. Shard members collectively maintain a buffer to manage cross-shard inputs, ensuring that a transaction is committed only if all inputs are available, and no fund is transferred for invalid requests. While ensuring security, Kronos processes transactions with optimal intra-shard communication overhead. Additionally, we propose a reduction for transaction invalidity proof generation to simple and fast multicasting, leading to atomic rejection without executing full-fledged Byzantine fault tolerance protocol in optimistic scenarios. Moreover, Kronos adopts a newly designed batch mechanism, reducing inter-shard message complexity to $O((m$log$m/b)\\lambda)$. Kronos operates without dependence on any time or client honesty assumption, serving as a plug-in sharding blockchain consensus supporting applications in diverse network environments including asynchronous ones. We implement Kronos using two prominent BFT protocols: Speeding Dumbo and HotStuff. Extensive experiments demonstrate Kronos achieving a substantial throughput of 68.6ktx/sec with 1.7sec latency. Compared with state-of-the-art solutions, Kronos outperforms in all cases, achieving up to a 42x improvement in throughput and a 50% reduction in latency when cross-shard transactions dominate the workload.

Most methods implicitly assume a given graph to be accurate and complete. However, real data is inevitably noisy and sparse, which will lead to inferior results. Despite the remarkable success of recent graph representation learning methods, they inherently presume that the graph is homophilic, and largely overlook heterophily, where most connected nodes are from different classes. In this regard, we propose a novel robust graph structure learning method to achieve a high-quality graph from heterophilic data for downstream tasks. We first apply a high-pass filter to make each node more distinctive from its neighbors by encoding structure information into the node features. Then, we learn a robust graph with an adaptive norm characterizing different levels of noise. Afterwards, we propose a novel regularizer to further refine the graph structure.

Standard methods are usually based on measuring the closeness between points by means of the Euclidean distance, which does not account for curvature, cuts, cavities or other non-trivial geometrical or topological features of the domain. This may lead to spurious oscillations in the interpolant in proximity to these features. To overcome this issue, we propose a modification to rescaled localized radial basis function (RL-RBF) interpolation to account for the geometry of the interpolation domain, by yielding conformity and fidelity to geometrical and topological features. The proposed method, referred to as RL-RBF-G, relies on measuring the geodesic distance between data points. RL-RBF-G removes spurious oscillations appearing in the RL-RBF interpolant, resulting in increased accuracy in domains with complex geometries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-RBF-G interpolation through a convergence study in an idealized setting. Furthermore, we discuss the algorithmic aspects and the implementation of RL-RBF-G interpolation in a distributed-memory parallel framework, and present the results of a strong scalability test yielding nearly ideal results. Finally, we show the effectiveness of RL-RBF-G interpolation in multiphysics simulations by considering an application to a whole-heart cardiac electromecanics model. ",

In addition, almost all clustering methods focus on homophilic graphs and ignore heterophily. This significantly limits their applicability in practice, since real-world graphs exhibit a structural disparity and cannot simply be classified as homophily and heterophily. Thus, a principled way to handle practical graphs is urgently needed. To fill this gap, we provide a novel solution with theoretical support. Interestingly, we find that most homophilic and heterophilic edges can be correctly identified on the basis of neighbor information. Motivated by this finding, we construct two graphs that are highly homophilic and heterophilic, respectively. They are used to build low-pass and high-pass filters to capture holistic information. Important features are further enhanced by the squeeze-and-excitation block. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Consequently, we extend the globally diverse MMFlood dataset to multi-date by providing one year of Sentinel-1 observations around each flood event. To our surprise, we notice that the definition of flooded pixels in MMFlood is inconsistent when observing the entire image sequence. Hence, we re-frame the flood detection task as a temporal anomaly detection problem, where anomalous water bodies are segmented from a Sentinel-1 temporal sequence. From this definition, we provide a simple method inspired by the popular video change detector ViBe, results of which quantitatively align with the SAR image time series, providing a reasonable baseline for future works.

In the second scenario, under the mild assumption that a policy strictly satisfying the constraints exists and is known to the learner, we design an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied at every episode with high probability. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study CMDPs involving both adversarial losses and hard constraints. Indeed, previous works either focus on much weaker soft constraints--allowing for positive violation to cancel out negative ones--or are restricted to stochastic losses. Thus, our algorithms can deal with general non-stationary environments subject to requirements much stricter than those manageable with state-of-the-art algorithms. This enables their adoption in a much wider range of real-world applications, ranging from autonomous driving to online advertising and recommender systems. ",

Other methodologies involve the utilization of irregular aerogel as physical perturbations for infrared attacks, albeit at the expense of optimization expenses and perceptibility issues. In this study, we propose a novel infrared physical attack termed Adversarial Infrared Geometry (\\textbf{AdvIG}), which facilitates efficient black-box query attacks by modeling diverse geometric shapes (lines, triangles, ellipses) and optimizing their physical parameters using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness of AdvIG. In digital attack experiments, line, triangle, and ellipse patterns achieve attack success rates of 93.1\\%, 86.8\\%, and 100.0\\%, respectively, with average query times of 71.7, 113.1, and 2.57, respectively, thereby confirming the efficiency of AdvIG.

On average, the line, triangle, and ellipse achieve attack success rates of 61.1\\%, 61.2\\%, and 96.2\\%, respectively. Further experiments are conducted to comprehensively analyze AdvIG, including ablation experiments, transfer attack experiments, and adversarial defense mechanisms.

Unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) semantic segmentation aims to adapt the semantic segmentation model trained on the labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, the existing UDA semantic segmentation models tend to align pixels or features based on statistical information related to labels in source and target domain data, and make predictions accordingly, which leads to uncertainty and fragility of prediction results. In this paper, we propose a causal prototype-inspired contrast adaptation (CPCA) method to explore the invariant causal mechanisms between different HRSIs domains and their semantic labels. It firstly disentangles causal features and bias features from the source and target domain images through a causal feature disentanglement module. Then, a causal prototypical contrast module is used to learn domain invariant causal features. To further de-correlate causal and bias features, a causal intervention module is introduced to intervene on the bias features to generate counterfactual unbiased samples. By forcing the causal features to meet the principles of separability, invariance and intervention, CPCA can simulate the causal factors of source and target domains, and make decisions on the target domain based on the causal features, which can observe improved generalization ability. Extensive experiments under three cross-domain tasks indicate that CPCA is remarkably superior to the state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "libEnsemble is a Python-based toolkit for running dynamic ensembles, developed as part of the DOE Exascale Computing Project. The toolkit utilizes a unique generator--simulator--allocator paradigm, where generators produce input for simulators, simulators evaluate those inputs, and allocators decide whether and when a simulator or generator should be called. The generator steers the ensemble based on simulation results. libEnsemble communicates between a manager and workers. Flexibility is provided through multiple manager--worker communication substrates each of which has different benefits. These include Python's multiprocessing, mpi4py, and TCP. Multisite ensembles are supported using Balsam or Globus Compute. We overview the unique characteristics of libEnsemble as well as current and potential interoperability with other packages in the workflow ecosystem. We highlight libEnsemble's dynamic resource features: libEnsemble can detect system resources (nodes, cores, and GPUs) and assign these in a portable way. These features allow users to specify resources required for each simulation automatically on a range of systems, including Frontier, Aurora, and Perlmutter. Such ensembles can include multiple simulation types, some using GPUs and others using only CPUs, sharing nodes for maximum efficiency. We demonstrate libEnsemble's capabilities, scalability, and scientific impact via a Gaussian process surrogate training problem for the longitudinal density profile at the exit of a plasma accelerator stage using Wake-T and WarpX simulations. We also describe the benefits of libEnsemble's generator--simulator coupling, which easily exposes to the user the ability to cancel, and portably kill, running simulations. Such control can be directed from the generator or allocator based on models that are updated with intermediate simulation output. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) based recommender systems have become one of the mainstream trends due to the powerful learning ability from user behavior data. Understanding the user intents from behavior data is the key to recommender systems, which poses two basic requirements for GNN-based recommender systems. One is how to learn complex and diverse intents especially when the user behavior is usually inadequate in reality. The other is different behaviors have different intent distributions, so how to establish their relations for a more explainable recommender system. In this paper, we present the Intent-aware Recommendation via Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (IDCL), which simultaneously learns interpretable intents and behavior distributions over those intents. Specifically, we first model the user behavior data as a user-item-concept graph, and design a GNN based behavior disentangling module to learn the different intents. Then we propose the intent-wise contrastive learning to enhance the intent disentangling and meanwhile infer the behavior distributions. Finally, the coding rate reduction regularization is introduced to make the behaviors of different intents orthogonal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IDCL in terms of substantial improvement and the interpretability. ",

To reduce such domain gaps and thus to make 3DOD models more generalizable, we introduce a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method, called CMDA, which (i) leverages visual semantic cues from an image modality (i.e., camera images) as an effective semantic bridge to close the domain gap in the cross-modal Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Further, (ii) we also introduce a self-training-based learning strategy, wherein a model is adversarially trained to generate domain-invariant features, which disrupt the discrimination of whether a feature instance comes from a source or an unseen target domain. Overall, our CMDA framework guides the 3DOD model to generate highly informative and domain-adaptive features for novel data distributions. In our extensive experiments with large-scale benchmarks, such as nuScenes, Waymo, and KITTI, those mentioned above provide significant performance gains for UDA tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "The realm of algorithms with predictions has led to the development of several new algorithms that leverage (potentially erroneous) predictions to enhance their performance guarantees. The challenge is to devise algorithms that achieve optimal approximation guarantees as the prediction quality varies from perfect (consistency) to imperfect (robustness). This framework is particularly appealing in mechanism design contexts, where predictions might convey private information about the agents. In this paper, we design strategyproof mechanisms that leverage predictions to achieve improved approximation guarantees for several variants of the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) in the private graph model. In this model, first introduced by Dughmi & Ghosh (2010), the set of resources that an agent is compatible with is private information. For the Bipartite Matching Problem (BMP), we give a deterministic group-strategyproof (GSP) mechanism that is $(1 +1/\\gamma)$-consistent and $(1 + \\gamma)$-robust, where $\\gamma \\ge 1$ is some confidence parameter. We also prove that this is best possible. Remarkably, our mechanism draws inspiration from the renowned Gale-Shapley algorithm, incorporating predictions as a crucial element. Additionally, we give a randomized mechanism that is universally GSP and improves on the guarantees in expectation. The other GAP variants that we consider all make use of a unified greedy mechanism that adds edges to the assignment according to a specific order. Our universally GSP mechanism randomizes over the greedy mechanism, our mechanism for BMP and the predicted assignment, leading to $(1+3/\\gamma)$-consistency and $(3+\\gamma)$-robustness in expectation. All our mechanisms also provide more fine-grained approximation guarantees that interpolate between the consistency and the robustness, depending on some natural error measure of the prediction. ",

In this work, we address the problem of routing in such environments with tasks expressed in Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) - a rich robot task specification language that allows us to capture explicit time requirements. Our objective is to find a strategy that maximizes the temporal robustness of the robot's MITL task. As the first step towards a solution, we define a Mixed-integer linear programming approach to solving the task planning problem over a Varying Weighted Transition System, where navigation durations are deterministic but vary depending on the time of day. Then, we apply this planner to optimize for MITL temporal robustness in Markov Decision Processes, where the navigation durations between physical locations are uncertain, but the time-dependent distribution over possible delays is known. Finally, we develop a receding horizon planner for Markov Decision Processes that preserves guarantees over MITL temporal robustness. We show the scalability of our planning algorithms in simulations of robotic tasks. ",

Towards this end, we developed a novel network architecture that simultaneously learns to 1) segment objects from discrete images, 2) infer their 3D locations, and 3) perceive depth, all while using only information directly available to the brain as training data, namely: sequences of images and self-motion.

The mask layer can be removed during inference by leveraging the intrinsic characteristics of BNN with straightforward mathematical transformations to avoid the associated multiplication operations. The quantized RPReLU structure enables more efficient bit operations by constraining its slope to be integer powers of 2.

Most approaches in this area heavily rely on costly labeled datasets and notably lack in adapting their modeling and learning methods to the specific nuances of photographic image layouts. This shortfall makes the learning process for photographic image layouts suboptimal. In our research, we directly address these challenges. We innovate by defining basic layout primitives that encapsulate various levels of layout information and by mapping these, along with their interconnections, onto a heterogeneous graph structure. This graph is meticulously engineered to capture the intricate layout information within the pixel domain explicitly. Advancing further, we introduce novel pretext tasks coupled with customized loss functions, strategically designed for effective self-supervised learning of these layout graphs. Building on this foundation, we develop an autoencoder-based network architecture skilled in compressing these heterogeneous layout graphs into precise, dimensionally-reduced layout representations. Additionally, we introduce the LODB dataset, which features a broader range of layout categories and richer semantics, serving as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of layout representation learning methods. Our extensive experimentation on this dataset demonstrates the superior performance of our approach in the realm of photographic image layout representation learning. ",

These explanations are commonly used to guide users' actions, e.g., by describing how a user whose loan application was denied can be approved for a loan in the future. Existing approaches generate CEs by focusing on a single, fixed model, and do not provide any formal guarantees on the CEs' future validity. When models are updated periodically to account for data shift, if the generated CEs are not robust to the shifts, users' actions may no longer have the desired impacts on their predictions. This paper introduces VeriTraCER, an approach that jointly trains a classifier and an explainer to explicitly consider the robustness of the generated CEs to small model shifts. VeriTraCER optimizes over a carefully designed loss function that ensures the verifiable robustness of CEs to local model updates, thus providing deterministic guarantees to CE validity. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that VeriTraCER generates CEs that (1) are verifiably robust to small model updates and (2) display competitive robustness to state-of-the-art approaches in handling empirical model updates including random initialization, leave-one-out, and distribution shifts.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) are used as the SI algorithms. Furthermore, models developed through such metaheuristics may be combined using stacking ensembles. In the context of this paper, we focus on training and optimizing CNNs using the Swarm Intelligence (SI) components of OpenNAS. Two major types of SI algorithms, namely PSO and ACO, are compared to see which is more effective in generating higher model accuracies.

To address this critical need, we propose the PowerPoint Task Completion Robustness benchmark (PPTC-R) to measure LLMs' robustness to the user PPT task instruction and software version. Specifically, we construct adversarial user instructions by attacking user instructions at sentence, semantic, and multi-language levels. To assess the robustness of Language Models to software versions, we vary the number of provided APIs to simulate both the newest version and earlier version settings. Subsequently, we test 3 closed-source and 4 open-source LLMs using a benchmark that incorporates these robustness settings, aiming to evaluate how deviations impact LLMs' API calls for task completion. We find that GPT-4 exhibits the highest performance and strong robustness in our benchmark, particularly in the version update and the multilingual settings.

However, due to different imaging payloads, various appearances of ships, and complicated background interference from the bird's eye view, it is difficult to set up a unified paradigm for achieving multi-source ship detection. Therefore, in this article, considering that the large language models (LLMs) emerge the powerful generalization ability, a novel unified visual-language model called Popeye is proposed for multi-source ship detection from RS imagery. First, to bridge the interpretation gap between multi-source images for ship detection, a novel image-instruction-answer way is designed to integrate the various ship detection ways (e.g., horizontal bounding box (HBB), oriented bounding box (OBB)) into a unified labeling paradigm. Then, in view of this, a cross-modal image interpretation method is developed for the proposed Popeye to enhance interactive comprehension ability between visual and language content, which can be easily migrated into any multi-source ship detection task. Subsequently, owing to objective domain differences, a knowledge adaption mechanism is designed to adapt the pre-trained visual-language knowledge from the nature scene into the RS domain for multi-source ship detection. In addition, the segment anything model (SAM) is also seamlessly integrated into the proposed Popeye to achieve pixel-level ship segmentation without additional training costs. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on the newly constructed instruction dataset named MMShip, and the results indicate that the proposed Popeye outperforms current specialist, open-vocabulary, and other visual-language models for zero-shot multi-source ship detection.

    "abstract": "Treatment effect estimation (TEE) is the task of determining the impact of various treatments on patient outcomes. Current TEE methods fall short due to reliance on limited labeled data and challenges posed by sparse and high-dimensional observational patient data. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel pre-training and fine-tuning framework, KG-TREAT, which synergizes large-scale observational patient data with biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance TEE. Unlike previous approaches, KG-TREAT constructs dual-focus KGs and integrates a deep bi-level attention synergy method for in-depth information fusion, enabling distinct encoding of treatment-covariate and outcome-covariate relationships. KG-TREAT also incorporates two pre-training tasks to ensure a thorough grounding and contextualization of patient data and KGs. Evaluation on four downstream TEE tasks shows KG-TREAT's superiority over existing methods, with an average improvement of 7% in Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) and 9% in Influence Function-based Precision of Estimating Heterogeneous Effects (IF-PEHE). The effectiveness of our estimated treatment effects is further affirmed by alignment with established randomized clinical trial findings. ",

Our results demonstrate that a motivated adversary can forge triggers that are not only drastically more effective than current handcrafted ones but also exhibit inherent flexibility in shape, properties, and functionality. In this direction, we show that an attacker can design and generate Neural Execs capable of persisting through multi-stage preprocessing pipelines, such as in the case of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based applications. More critically, our findings show that attackers can produce triggers that deviate markedly in form and shape from any known attack, sidestepping existing blacklist-based detection and sanitation approaches.

Unfortunately, current self-training methods are susceptible to misclassified pseudo-labels resulting from erroneous predictions. Since certain classes are typically associated with less reliable predictions in UDA, reducing the impact of such pseudo-labels without skewing the training towards some classes is notoriously difficult. To this end, we propose an extensive cut-and-paste strategy (ECAP) to leverage reliable pseudo-labels through data augmentation. Specifically, ECAP maintains a memory bank of pseudo-labeled target samples throughout training and cut-and-pastes the most confident ones onto the current training batch. We implement ECAP on top of the recent method MIC and boost its performance on two synthetic-to-real domain adaptation benchmarks. Notably, MIC+ECAP reaches an unprecedented performance of 69.1 mIoU on the Synthia->Cityscapes benchmark. Our code is available at https://github.com/ErikBrorsson/ECAP. ",

Due to their deployments in many civilian and military applications, safe and reliable communication of these drones throughout the mission is critical. The Crazyflie ecosystem is one of the most popular Micro Aerial Drones and has the potential to be deployed worldwide. In this paper, we empirically investigate two interference attacks against the Crazy Real Time Protocol (CRTP) implemented within the Crazyflie drones. In particular, we explore the feasibility of experimenting two attack vectors that can disrupt an ongoing flight mission: the jamming attack, and the hijacking attack. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of such attacks in both autonomous and non-autonomous flight modes on a Crazyflie 2.1 drone. Finally, we suggest potential shielding strategies that guarantee a safe and secure flight mission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating jamming and hijacking attacks against Micro Aerial Drones, both in autonomous and non-autonomous modes. ",

We highlight the evolution of contention resolution, where new concerns -- such as security, quality of service, and energy efficiency -- are motivated by modern systems. These efforts have yielded insights into the limits of randomized and deterministic approaches, as well as the impact of different model assumptions such as global clock synchronization, knowledge of the number of processors, feedback from access attempts, and attacks on the availability of the shared resource.

This convergence phenomenon applies to a very wide class of GNNs, including state of the art models, with aggregates including mean and the attention-based mechanism of graph transformers.

Nonetheless, research on multilingual aspects of Code-LMs (i.e., LMs for code generation) such as cross-lingual transfer between different programming languages, language-specific data augmentation, and post-hoc LM adaptation, alongside exploitation of data sources other than the original textual content, has been much sparser than for their natural language counterparts. In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone. In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations - shared across programming languages - to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer. To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with respective intermediate representations. Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging in size from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages. Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across a wide variety of code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following.

Firstly, four types of features are extracted from the original electrical load dataset, including the historical time series, time index features, historical statistical features, and similarity features. Then, a hybrid LSTM-based electrical load forecasting model is designed, where an LSTM neural network block and a fully-connected neural network block are integrated that can model both temporal features (historical time series) and non-temporal features (the rest features). A gradient regularization-based offline training algorithm and an output layer parameter fine-tuning-based online model correction method are developed to enhance the model's capabilities to defend against disturbance and adapt to the latest load data distribution, thus improving the forecasting accuracy. At last, extensive experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed electrical load forecasting strategy with superior accuracy compared with commonly used forecasting models.

The dimensions are coupled through a normalization step, which is also the source of the nonlinearity, so that the state describes an agent's relative opinion of various options. This can capture, for example, an individual's relative trust in different media. In special cases including where biases are uniform across agents our model achieves consensus, but in general, behaviors are richer and capture multipolar opinion distributions. We examine general fixed points of the system, as well as special cases such as zero biases toward certain options or partitioned decision sets. Lastly, we demonstrate that our model exhibits polarization when biases are spatially correlated across the network, while, as empirical research suggests, a mixed community can mediate biases. ",

In this paper, we revisit this insight in light of recent multilingual MT models and large language models (LLMs) applied to machine translation. Somewhat surprisingly, we show through controlled experiments that these models are far more robust to many kinds of noise than previous models, even when they perform similarly on clean data. This is notable because, even though LLMs have more parameters and more complex training processes than past models, none of the open ones we consider use any techniques specifically designed to encourage robustness. Next, we show that similar trends hold for social media translation experiments -- LLMs are more robust to social media text. We include an analysis of the circumstances in which source correction techniques can be used to mitigate the effects of noise. Altogether, we show that robustness to many types of noise has increased. ",

To enable this real-to-sim-to-real pipeline, RialTo proposes an easy-to-use interface for quickly scanning and constructing digital twins of real-world environments. We also introduce a novel \"inverse distillation\" procedure for bringing real-world demonstrations into simulated environments for efficient fine-tuning, with minimal human intervention and engineering required. We evaluate RialTo across a variety of robotic manipulation problems in the real world, such as robustly stacking dishes on a rack, placing books on a shelf, and six other tasks.

    "abstract": "The right ventricular (RV) function deterioration strongly predicts clinical outcomes in numerous circumstances. To boost the clinical deployment of ensemble regression methods that quantify RV volumes using tabular data from the widely available two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), we propose to complement the volume predictions with uncertainty scores. To this end, we employ an instance-based method which uses the learned tree structure to identify the nearest training samples to a target instance and then uses a number of distribution types to more flexibly model the output. The probabilistic and point-prediction performances of the proposed framework are evaluated on a relatively small-scale dataset, comprising 100 end-diastolic and end-systolic RV volumes. The reference values for point performance were obtained from MRI. The results demonstrate that our flexible approach yields improved probabilistic and point performances over other state-of-the-art methods. The appropriateness of the proposed framework is showcased by providing exemplar cases. The estimated uncertainty embodies both aleatoric and epistemic types. This work aligns with trustworthy artificial intelligence since it can be used to enhance the decision-making process and reduce risks. The feature importance scores of our framework can be exploited to reduce the number of required 2DE views which could enhance the proposed pipeline's clinical application. ",

    "abstract": "Exoplanet discovery at long orbital periods requires reliably detecting individual transits without additional information about the system. Techniques like phase-folding of light curves and periodogram analysis of radial velocity data are more sensitive to planets with shorter orbital periods, leaving a dearth of planet discoveries at long periods. We present a novel technique using an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks incorporating the onboard spacecraft diagnostics of \\emph{Kepler} to classify transits within a light curve. We create a pipeline to recover the location of individual transits, and the period of the orbiting planet, which maintains $>80\\%$ transit recovery sensitivity out to an 800-day orbital period. Our neural network pipeline has the potential to discover additional planets in the \\emph{Kepler} dataset, and crucially, within the $\\eta$-Earth regime. We report our first candidate from this pipeline, KOI 1271.02. KOI 1271.01 is known to exhibit strong Transit Timing Variations (TTVs), and so we jointly model the TTVs and transits of both transiting planets to constrain the orbital configuration and planetary parameters and conclude with a series of potential parameters for KOI 1271.02, as there is not enough data currently to uniquely constrain the system. We conclude that KOI 1271.02 has a radius of 5.32 $\\pm$ 0.20 $R_{\\oplus}$ and a mass of $28.94^{0.23}_{-0.47}$ $M_{\\oplus}$. Future constraints on the nature of KOI 1271.02 require measuring additional TTVs of KOI 1271.01 or observing a second transit of KOI 1271.02. ",

    "abstract": "Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) have been extensively used in the control community. A well-known drawback is the absence of a systematic way to construct CLFs for general nonlinear systems, and the problem can become more complex with input or state constraints. Our preliminary work on constructing Control Lyapunov Value Functions (CLVFs) using Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis provides a method for finding a non-smooth CLF. In this paper, we extend our work on CLVFs to systems with bounded disturbance and define the Robust CLVF (R-CLVF). The R-CLVF naturally inherits all properties of the CLVF; i.e., it first identifies the \"smallest robust control invariant set (SRCIS)\" and stabilizes the system to it with a user-specified exponential rate. The region from which the exponential rate can be met is called the \"region of exponential stabilizability (ROES).\" We provide clearer definitions of the SRCIS and more rigorous proofs of several important theorems. Since the computation of the R-CLVF suffers from the \"curse of dimensionality,\" we also provide two techniques (warmstart and system decomposition) that solve it, along with necessary proofs. Three numerical examples are provided, validating our definition of SRCIS, illustrating the trade-off between a faster decay rate and a smaller ROES, and demonstrating the efficiency of computation using warmstart and decomposition.

We propose the application of \\textit{Quality-Diversity} algorithms to the field of crystal structure prediction. The objective of these algorithms is to identify a diverse set of high-performing solutions, which has been successful in a range of fields such as robotics, architecture and aeronautical engineering. As these methods rely on a high number of evaluations, we employ machine-learning surrogate models to compute the interatomic potential and material properties that are used to guide optimisation. Consequently, we also show the value of using neural networks to model crystal properties and enable the identification of novel composition--structure combinations. In this work, we specifically study the application of the MAP-Elites algorithm to predict polymorphs of TiO$_2$. We rediscover the known ground state, in addition to a set of other polymorphs with distinct properties. We validate our method for C, SiO$_2$ and SiC systems, where we show that the algorithm can uncover multiple local minima with distinct electronic and mechanical properties. ",

Although EEG-based BCI systems have been developed for paralysis individuals, ongoing studies explore systems for speech imagery and motor imagery (MI). This study introduces FingerNet, a specialized network for fine MI classification, departing from conventional gross MI studies. The proposed FingerNet could extract spatial and temporal features from EEG signals, improving classification accuracy within the same hand. The experimental results demonstrated that performance showed significantly higher accuracy in classifying five finger-tapping tasks, encompassing thumb, index, middle, ring, and little finger movements. FingerNet demonstrated dominant performance compared to the conventional baseline models, EEGNet and DeepConvNet. The average accuracy for FingerNet was 0.3049, whereas EEGNet and DeepConvNet exhibited lower accuracies of 0.2196 and 0.2533, respectively. Statistical validation also demonstrates the predominance of FingerNet over baseline networks. For biased predictions, particularly for thumb and index classes, we led to the implementation of weighted cross-entropy and also adapted the weighted cross-entropy, a method conventionally employed to mitigate class imbalance. The proposed FingerNet involves optimizing network structure, improving performance, and exploring applications beyond fine MI. Moreover, the weighted Cross Entropy approach employed to address such biased predictions appears to have broader applicability and relevance across various domains involving multi-class classification tasks. We believe that effective execution of motor imagery can be achieved not only for fine MI, but also for local muscle MI ",

The methodology integrates the use of technical indicators, a Performer neural network, and BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) to capture temporal dynamics and extract significant features from raw cryptocurrency data. The application of technical indicators, such facilitates the extraction of intricate patterns, momentum, volatility, and trends. The Performer neural network, employing Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features (FAVOR+), has demonstrated superior computational efficiency and scalability compared to the traditional Multi-head attention mechanism in Transformer models. Additionally, the integration of BiLSTM in the feedforward network enhances the model's capacity to capture temporal dynamics in the data, processing it in both forward and backward directions. This is particularly advantageous for time series data where past and future data points can influence the current state. The proposed method has been applied to the hourly and daily timeframes of the major cryptocurrencies and its performance has been benchmarked against other methods documented in the literature. The results underscore the potential of the proposed method to outperform existing models, marking a significant progression in the field of cryptocurrency price prediction. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of fully data-driven global numerical weather prediction models. These machine learning weather prediction models have their strength, notably accuracy and low computational requirements, but also their weakness: they struggle to represent fundamental dynamical balances, and they are far from being suitable for data assimilation experiments. Hybrid modelling emerges as a promising approach to address these limitations. Hybrid models integrate a physics-based core component with a statistical component, typically a neural network, to enhance prediction capabilities. In this article, we propose to develop a model error correction for the operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts using a neural network. The neural network is initially pre-trained offline using a large dataset of operational analyses and analysis increments. Subsequently, the trained network is integrated into the IFS within the Object-Oriented Prediction System (OOPS) so as to be used in data assimilation and forecast experiments. It is then further trained online using a recently developed variant of weak-constraint 4D-Var. The results show that the pre-trained neural network already provides a reliable model error correction, which translates into reduced forecast errors in many conditions and that the online training further improves the accuracy of the hybrid model in many conditions.

This study uses evolutionary game theory to analyze criminal networks' dynamics, resilience to interventions, and responses to external conditions. We find strong hysteresis effects, challenging traditional deterrence-focused strategies. Optimal thresholds for organization formation or dissolution are defined by these effects. Stricter punishment doesn't always deter organized crime linearly. Network structure, particularly link density and skill assortativity, significantly influences organization formation and stability. These insights advocate for adaptive policy-making and strategic law enforcement to effectively disrupt criminal networks. ",

Recently, classical QSPR and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a deep learning technique, have been successfully applied to predict the CMC of surfactants at room temperature. However, these models have not yet considered the temperature dependency of the CMC, which is highly relevant for practical applications. We herein develop a GNN model for temperature-dependent CMC prediction of surfactants. We collect about 1400 data points from public sources for all surfactant classes, i.e., ionic, nonionic, and zwitterionic, at multiple temperatures. We test the predictive quality of the model for following scenarios: i) when CMC data for surfactants are present in the training of the model in at least one different temperature, and ii) CMC data for surfactants are not present in the training, i.e., generalizing to unseen surfactants. In both test scenarios, our model exhibits a high predictive performance of R$^2 \\geq $ 0.94 on test data. We also find that the model performance varies by surfactant class. Finally, we evaluate the model for sugar-based surfactants with complex molecular structures, as these represent a more sustainable alternative to synthetic surfactants and are therefore of great interest for future applications in the personal and home care industries.

    "abstract": "The optimization of a black-box simulator over control parameters $\\mathbf{x}$ arises in a myriad of scientific applications. In such applications, the simulator often takes the form $f(\\mathbf{x},\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ are parameters that are uncertain in practice. Robust optimization aims to optimize the objective $\\mathbb{E}[f(\\mathbf{x},\\boldsymbol{\\Theta})]$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta} \\sim \\mathcal{P}$ is a random variable that models uncertainty on $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. For this, existing black-box methods typically employ a two-stage approach for selecting the next point $(\\mathbf{x},\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, where $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ are optimized separately via different acquisition functions. As such, these approaches do not employ a joint acquisition over $(\\mathbf{x},\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, and thus may fail to fully exploit control-to-noise interactions for effective robust optimization. To address this, we propose a new Bayesian optimization method called Targeted Variance Reduction (TVR). The TVR leverages a novel joint acquisition function over $(\\mathbf{x},\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, which targets variance reduction on the objective within the desired region of improvement. Under a Gaussian process surrogate on $f$, the TVR acquisition can be evaluated in closed form, and reveals an insightful exploration-exploitation-precision trade-off for robust black-box optimization. The TVR can further accommodate a broad class of non-Gaussian distributions on $\\mathcal{P}$ via a careful integration of normalizing flows. We demonstrate the improved performance of TVR over the state-of-the-art in a suite of numerical experiments and an application to the robust design of automobile brake discs under operational uncertainty.
