    "title": "Utilizing XAI technique to improve autoencoder based model for computer  network anomaly detection with shapley additive explanation(SHAP)",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods are being adopted rapidly, especially in computer network security, such as fraud detection, network anomaly detection, intrusion detection, and much more. However, the lack of transparency of ML and DL based models is a major obstacle to their implementation and criticized due to its black-box nature, even with such tremendous results. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a promising area that can improve the trustworthiness of these models by giving explanations and interpreting its output. If the internal working of the ML and DL based models is understandable, then it can further help to improve its performance. The objective of this paper is to show that how XAI can be used to interpret the results of the DL model, the autoencoder in this case. And, based on the interpretation, we improved its performance for computer network anomaly detection. The kernel SHAP method, which is based on the shapley values, is used as a novel feature selection technique. This method is used to identify only those features that are actually causing the anomalous behaviour of the set of attack/anomaly instances. Later, these feature sets are used to train and validate the autoencoder but on benign data only. Finally, the built SHAP_Model outperformed the other two models proposed based on the feature selection method. This whole experiment is conducted on the subset of the latest CICIDS2017 network dataset. The overall accuracy and AUC of SHAP_Model is 94% and 0.969, respectively. ",

    "title": "HampDTI: a heterogeneous graph automatic meta-path learning method for  drug-target interaction prediction",
    "abstract": "Motivation: Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a key step in drug repositioning. In recent years, the accumulation of a large number of genomics and pharmacology data has formed mass drug and target related heterogeneous networks (HNs), which provides new opportunities of developing HN-based computational models to accurately predict DTIs. The HN implies lots of useful information about DTIs but also contains irrelevant data, and how to make the best of heterogeneous networks remains a challenge. Results: In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous graph automatic meta-path learning based DTI prediction method (HampDTI). HampDTI automatically learns the important meta-paths between drugs and targets from the HN, and generates meta-path graphs. For each meta-path graph, the features learned from drug molecule graphs and target protein sequences serve as the node attributes, and then a node-type specific graph convolutional network (NSGCN) which efficiently considers node type information (drugs or targets) is designed to learn embeddings of drugs and targets. Finally, the embeddings from multiple meta-path graphs are combined to predict novel DTIs. The experiments on benchmark datasets show that our proposed HampDTI achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art DTI prediction methods. More importantly, HampDTI identifies the important meta-paths for DTI prediction, which could explain how drugs connect with targets in HNs. ",

    "title": "Improved YOLOv5 network for real-time multi-scale traffic sign detection",
    "abstract": "Traffic sign detection is a challenging task for the unmanned driving system, especially for the detection of multi-scale targets and the real-time problem of detection. In the traffic sign detection process, the scale of the targets changes greatly, which will have a certain impact on the detection accuracy. Feature pyramid is widely used to solve this problem but it might break the feature consistency across different scales of traffic signs. Moreover, in practical application, it is difficult for common methods to improve the detection accuracy of multi-scale traffic signs while ensuring real-time detection. In this paper, we propose an improved feature pyramid model, named AF-FPN, which utilizes the adaptive attention module (AAM) and feature enhancement module (FEM) to reduce the information loss in the process of feature map generation and enhance the representation ability of the feature pyramid. We replaced the original feature pyramid network in YOLOv5 with AF-FPN, which improves the detection performance for multi-scale targets of the YOLOv5 network under the premise of ensuring real-time detection. Furthermore, a new automatic learning data augmentation method is proposed to enrich the dataset and improve the robustness of the model to make it more suitable for practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results on the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method when compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "Dataset correlation inference attacks against machine learning models",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models are increasingly used by businesses and organizations around the world to automate tasks and decision-making. Trained on potentially sensitive datasets, machine learning models have been shown to leak information about individuals in the dataset as well as global dataset information. We here take research in dataset property inference attacks one step further by proposing a new attack against ML models: a dataset correlation inference attack, where an attacker's goal is to infer the correlation between input variables of a model. We first show that an attacker can exploit the spherical parametrization of correlation matrices, to make an informed guess. This means that using only the correlation between the input variables and the target variable, an attacker can infer the correlation between two input variables much better than a random guess baseline. We propose a second attack which exploits the access to a machine learning model using shadow modeling to refine the guess. Our attack uses Gaussian copula-based generative modeling to generate synthetic datasets with a wide variety of correlations in order to train a meta-model for the correlation inference task. We evaluate our attack against Logistic Regression and Multi-layer perceptron models and show it to outperform the model-less attack. Our results show that the accuracy of the second, machine learning-based attack decreases with the number of variables and converges towards the accuracy of the model-less attack. However, correlations between input variables which are highly correlated with the target variable are more vulnerable regardless of the number of variables. Our work bridges the gap between what can be considered a global leakage about the training dataset and individual-level leakages. When coupled with marginal leakage attacks,it might also constitute a first step towards dataset reconstruction. ",

    "abstract": "Neural autoregressive sequence models smear the probability among many possible sequences including degenerate ones, such as empty or repetitive sequences. In this work, we tackle one specific case where the model assigns a high probability to unreasonably short sequences. We define the oversmoothing rate to quantify this issue. After confirming the high degree of oversmoothing in neural machine translation, we propose to explicitly minimize the oversmoothing rate during training. We conduct a set of experiments to study the effect of the proposed regularization on both model distribution and decoding performance. We use a neural machine translation task as the testbed and consider three different datasets of varying size. Our experiments reveal three major findings. First, we can control the oversmoothing rate of the model by tuning the strength of the regularization. Second, by enhancing the oversmoothing loss contribution, the probability and the rank of <eos> token decrease heavily at positions where it is not supposed to be. Third, the proposed regularization impacts the outcome of beam search especially when a large beam is used. The degradation of translation quality (measured in BLEU) with a large beam significantly lessens with lower oversmoothing rate, but the degradation compared to smaller beam sizes remains to exist. From these observations, we conclude that the high degree of oversmoothing is the main reason behind the degenerate case of overly probable short sequences in a neural autoregressive model. ",

Photonic implementations of neural network architectures potentially offer fundamental advantages over their electronic counterparts in terms of speed, processing parallelism, scalability and energy efficiency. Scalable and high performance photonic neural networks (PNNs) have been demonstrated, yet they remain scarce. In this work, we study the performance of such a scalable, fully parallel and autonomous PNN based on a large area vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (LA-VCSEL). We show how the performance varies with different physical parameters, namely, injection wavelength, injection power, and bias current. Furthermore, we link these physical parameters to the general computational measures of consistency and dimensionality. We present a general method of gauging dimensionality in high dimensional nonlinear systems subject to noise, which could be applied to many systems in the context of neuromorphic computing.

    "abstract": "Large-scale cyber-physical systems require that control policies are distributed, that is, that they only rely on local real-time measurements and communication with neighboring agents. Optimal Distributed Control (ODC) problems are, however, highly intractable even in seemingly simple cases. Recent work has thus proposed training Neural Network (NN) distributed controllers. A main challenge of NN controllers is that they are not dependable during and after training, that is, the closed-loop system may be unstable, and the training may fail due to vanishing and exploding gradients. In this paper, we address these issues for networks of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems, whose modeling power ranges from energy systems to non-holonomic vehicles and chemical reactions. Specifically, we embrace the compositional properties of pH systems to characterize deep Hamiltonian control policies with built-in closed-loop stability guarantees, irrespective of the interconnection topology and the chosen NN parameters. Furthermore, our setup enables leveraging recent results on well-behaved neural ODEs to prevent the phenomenon of vanishing gradients by design. Numerical experiments corroborate the dependability of the proposed architecture, while matching the performance of general neural network policies. ",

This is due to a lack of understanding of how to control 3-D body bending to push against terrain features to generate and control propulsion. Biological studies suggested that generalist snakes use contact force sensing to adjust body bending in real time to do so. However, studying this sensory-modulated force control in snakes is challenging, due to a lack of basic knowledge of how their force sensing organs work. Here, we take a robophysics approach to make progress, starting by developing a snake robot capable of 3-D body bending with contact force sensing to enable systematic locomotion experiments and force measurements. Through two development and testing iterations, we created a 12-segment robot with 36 piezo-resistive sheet sensors distributed on all segments with compliant shells with a sampling frequency of 30 Hz. The robot measured contact forces while traversing a large obstacle using vertical bending with high repeatability, achieving the goal of providing a platform for systematic experiments. Finally, we explored model-based calibration considering the viscoelastic behavior of the piezo-resistive sensor, which will for useful for future studies. ",

    "abstract": "Hearing loss is a major health problem and psychological burden in humans. Mouse models offer a possibility to elucidate genes involved in the underlying developmental and pathophysiological mechanisms of hearing impairment. To this end, large-scale mouse phenotyping programs include auditory phenotyping of single-gene knockout mouse lines. Using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) procedure, the German Mouse Clinic and similar facilities worldwide have produced large, uniform data sets of averaged ABR raw data of mutant and wildtype mice. In the course of standard ABR analysis, hearing thresholds are assessed visually by trained staff from series of signal curves of increasing sound pressure level. This is time-consuming and prone to be biased by the reader as well as the graphical display quality and scale. In an attempt to reduce workload and improve quality and reproducibility, we developed and compared two methods for automated hearing threshold identification from averaged ABR raw data: a supervised approach involving two combined neural networks trained on human-generated labels and a self-supervised approach, which exploits the signal power spectrum and combines random forest sound level estimation with a piece-wise curve fitting algorithm for threshold finding. We show that both models work well, outperform human threshold detection, and are suitable for fast, reliable, and unbiased hearing threshold detection and quality control. In a high-throughput mouse phenotyping environment, both methods perform well as part of an automated end-to-end screening pipeline to detect candidate genes for hearing involvement. Code for both models as well as data used for this work are freely available. ",

For a successful reconstruction, diffraction patterns originating from a single hit must be isolated from a large number of acquired patterns. We propose to formulate this task as an image classification problem and solve it using convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Two CNN configurations are developed: one that maximises the F1-score and one that emphasises high recall. We also combine the CNNs with expectation maximization (EM) selection as well as size filtering. We observed that our CNN selections have lower contrast in power spectral density functions relative to the EM selection, used in our previous work. However, the reconstruction of our CNN-based selections gives similar results. Introducing CNNs into SPI experiments allows streamlining the reconstruction pipeline, enables researchers to classify patterns on the fly, and, as a consequence, enables them to tightly control the duration of their experiments. We think that bringing non-standard artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions in a well-described SPI analysis workflow may be beneficial for the future development of the SPI experiments. ",
