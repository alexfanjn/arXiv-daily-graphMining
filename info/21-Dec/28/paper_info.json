    "abstract": "The modern digital world is increasingly becoming multimodal. Although multimodal learning has recently revolutionized the state-of-the-art performance in multimodal tasks, relatively little is known about the robustness of multimodal learning in an adversarial setting. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive measurement of the adversarial robustness of multimodal learning by focusing on the fusion of input modalities in multimodal models, via a framework called MUROAN (MUltimodal RObustness ANalyzer). We first present a unified view of multimodal models in MUROAN and identify the fusion mechanism of multimodal models as a key vulnerability. We then introduce a new type of multimodal adversarial attacks called decoupling attack in MUROAN that aims to compromise multimodal models by decoupling their fused modalities. We leverage the decoupling attack of MUROAN to measure several state-of-the-art multimodal models and find that the multimodal fusion mechanism in all these models is vulnerable to decoupling attacks. We especially demonstrate that, in the worst case, the decoupling attack of MUROAN achieves an attack success rate of 100% by decoupling just 1.16% of the input space. Finally, we show that traditional adversarial training is insufficient to improve the robustness of multimodal models with respect to decoupling attacks. We hope our findings encourage researchers to pursue improving the robustness of multimodal learning. ",

    "abstract": "As the default protocol for exchanging routing reachability information on the Internet, the abnormal behavior in traffic of Border Gateway Protocols (BGP) is closely related to Internet anomaly events. The BGP anomalous detection model ensures stable routing services on the Internet through its real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities. Previous studies either focused on the feature selection problem or the memory characteristic in data, while ignoring the relationship between features and the precise time correlation in feature (whether it's long or short term dependence). In this paper, we propose a multi-view model for capturing anomalous behaviors from BGP update traffic, in which Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) method is used to reduce the noise in the original time-series data, and Graph Attention Network (GAT) is used to discover feature relationships and time correlations in feature, respectively. Our results outperform the state-of-the-art methods at the anomaly detection task, with the average F1 score up to 96.3% and 93.2% on the balanced and imbalanced datasets respectively. Meanwhile, our model can be extended to classify multiple anomalous and to detect unknown events. ",

    "abstract": "Classification of posts in social media such as Twitter is difficult due to the noisy and short nature of texts. Sequence classification models based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) are popular for classifying posts that are sequential in nature. RNNs assume the hidden representation dynamics to evolve in a discrete manner and do not consider the exact time of the posting. In this work, we propose to use recurrent neural ordinary differential equations (RNODE) for social media post classification which consider the time of posting and allow the computation of hidden representation to evolve in a time-sensitive continuous manner. In addition, we propose a novel model, Bi-directional RNODE (Bi-RNODE), which can consider the information flow in both the forward and backward directions of posting times to predict the post label. Our experiments demonstrate that RNODE and Bi-RNODE are effective for the problem of stance classification of rumours in social media. ",

A large portion of high-impact applications like social media, recommendation systems, E-commerce platforms, etc. can be represented by graph models. In this paper, we investigate the challenging yet practical problem, Graph Few-shot Class-incremental (Graph FCL) problem, where the graph model is tasked to classify both newly encountered classes and previously learned classes. Towards that purpose, we put forward a Graph Pseudo Incremental Learning paradigm by sampling tasks recurrently from the base classes, so as to produce an arbitrary number of training episodes for our model to practice the incremental learning skill. Furthermore, we design a Hierarchical-Attention-based Graph Meta-learning framework, HAG-Meta. We present a task-sensitive regularizer calculated from task-level attention and node class prototypes to mitigate overfitting onto either novel or base classes. To employ the topological knowledge, we add a node-level attention module to adjust the prototype representation. Our model not only achieves greater stability of old knowledge consolidation, but also acquires advantageous adaptability to new knowledge with very limited data samples. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, including Amazon-clothing, Reddit, and DBLP, show that our framework demonstrates remarkable advantages in comparison with the baseline and other related state-of-the-art methods.

The resulting models often give rise to confident incorrect predictions which may lead to devastating consequences. This problem is especially demanding in the context of dense prediction since input images may be partially anomalous.

We extend this approach with synthetic negative patches which simultaneously achieve high inlier likelihood and uniform discriminative prediction. We generate synthetic negatives with normalizing flows due to their outstanding distribution coverage and capability to generate samples at different resolutions. We also propose to detect anomalies according to a principled information-theoretic criterion which can be consistently applied through training and inference.

    "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (NNWs) are appealing functions to substitute high dimensional and non-linear history-dependent problems in computational mechanics since they offer the possibility to drastically reduce the computational time. This feature has recently been exploited in the context of multi-scale simulations, in which the NNWs serve as surrogate model of micro-scale finite element resolutions. Nevertheless, in the literature, mainly the macro-stress-macro-strain response of the meso-scale boundary value problem was considered and the micro-structure information could not be recovered in a so-called localization step. In this work, we develop Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as surrogates of the RVE response while being able to recover the evolution of the local micro-structure state variables for complex loading scenarios. The main difficulty is the high dimensionality of the RNNs output which consists in the internal state variable distribution in the micro-structure. We thus propose and compare several surrogate models based on a dimensionality reduction: i) direct RNN modeling with implicit NNW dimensionality reduction, ii) RNN with PCA dimensionality reduction, and iii) RNN with PCA dimensionality reduction and dimensionality break down, i.e. the use of several RNNs instead of a single one. Besides, we optimize the sequential training strategy of the latter surrogate for GPU usage in order to speed up the process. Finally, through RNN modeling of the principal components coefficients, the connection between the physical state variables and the hidden variables of the RNN is revealed, and exploited in order to select the hyper-parameters of the RNN-based surrogate models in their design stage.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) capture complex relations among entities of various kinds and have been used extensively to improve the effectiveness of various data mining tasks, such as in recommender systems. Many existing HIN-based recommendation algorithms utilize hand-crafted meta-paths to extract semantic information from the networks. These algorithms rely on extensive domain knowledge with which the best set of meta-paths can be selected. For applications where the HINs are highly complex with numerous node and link types, the approach of hand-crafting a meta-path set is too tedious and error-prone. To tackle this problem, we propose the Reinforcement learning-based Meta-path Selection (RMS) framework to select effective meta-paths and to incorporate them into existing meta-path-based recommenders. To identify high-quality meta-paths, RMS trains a reinforcement learning (RL) based policy network(agent), which gets rewards from the performance on the downstream recommendation tasks. We design a HIN-based recommendation model, HRec, that effectively uses the meta-path information. We further integrate HRec with RMS and derive our recommendation solution, RMS-HRec, that automatically utilizes the effective meta-paths. Experiments on real datasets show that our algorithm can significantly improve the performance of recommendation models by capturing important meta-paths automatically. ",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on developing a method to obtain an uncertain linear fractional transformation (LFT) system that adequately captures the dynamics of a nonlinear time-invariant system over some desired envelope. First, the nonlinear system is approximated as a polynomial nonlinear state-space (PNLSS) system, and a linear parameter-varying (LPV) representation of the PNLSS model is obtained. To reduce the potentially large number of scheduling parameters in the resulting LPV system, an approach based on the cascade feedforward neural network (CFNN) is proposed. We account for the approximation and reduction errors through the addition of a norm-bounded, causal, dynamic uncertainty in the LFT system. Falsification is used in a novel way to perform guided simulations for deriving a norm bound on the dynamic uncertainty and generating data for training the CFNN. Then, robustness analysis using integral quadratic constraint theory is carried out to choose an LFT representation that leads to a computationally tractable analysis problem and useful analysis results. Finally, the proposed approach is used to obtain an LFT representation for the nonlinear equations of motion of a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system. ",

    "abstract": "Advances in the state of the art for 3d human sensing are currently limited by the lack of visual datasets with 3d ground truth, including multiple people, in motion, operating in real-world environments, with complex illumination or occlusion, and potentially observed by a moving camera. Sophisticated scene understanding would require estimating human pose and shape as well as gestures, towards representations that ultimately combine useful metric and behavioral signals with free-viewpoint photo-realistic visualisation capabilities. To sustain progress, we build a large-scale photo-realistic dataset, Human-SPACE (HSPACE), of animated humans placed in complex synthetic indoor and outdoor environments. We combine a hundred diverse individuals of varying ages, gender, proportions, and ethnicity, with hundreds of motions and scenes, as well as parametric variations in body shape (for a total of 1,600 different humans), in order to generate an initial dataset of over 1 million frames. Human animations are obtained by fitting an expressive human body model, GHUM, to single scans of people, followed by novel re-targeting and positioning procedures that support the realistic animation of dressed humans, statistical variation of body proportions, and jointly consistent scene placement of multiple moving people. Assets are generated automatically, at scale, and are compatible with existing real time rendering and game engines. The dataset with evaluation server will be made available for research. Our large-scale analysis of the impact of synthetic data, in connection with real data and weak supervision, underlines the considerable potential for continuing quality improvements and limiting the sim-to-real gap, in this practical setting, in connection with increased model capacity.

    "abstract": "Graph walking based on reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great success in navigating an agent to automatically complete various reasoning tasks over an incomplete knowledge graph (KG) by exploring multi-hop relational paths. However, existing multi-hop reasoning approaches only work well on short reasoning paths and tend to miss the target entity with the increasing path length. This is undesirable for many reason-ing tasks in real-world scenarios, where short paths connecting the source and target entities are not available in incomplete KGs, and thus the reasoning performances drop drastically unless the agent is able to seek out more clues from longer paths. To address the above challenge, in this paper, we propose a dual-agent reinforcement learning framework, which trains two agents (GIANT and DWARF) to walk over a KG jointly and search for the answer collaboratively. Our approach tackles the reasoning challenge in long paths by assigning one of the agents (GIANT) searching on cluster-level paths quickly and providing stage-wise hints for another agent (DWARF). Finally, experimental results on several KG reasoning benchmarks show that our approach can search answers more accurately and efficiently, and outperforms existing RL-based methods for long path queries by a large margin.

In addition, Free-space optics (FSO) is applied as the backhauling solution to significantly increase the capacity of the backhaul link between an MBS and a DBS in a drone assisted mobile network. Most of the existing DBS placement solutions assume the FSO based backhaul link provides sufficient link capacity, which may not be true, especially when a DBS is placed far away from an MBS (e.g., > 10 km in disaster-struck areas) or in a bad weather condition. In this paper, we formulate a problem to jointly optimize bandwidth allocation and DBS placement by considering the FSO based backhaul link capacity constraint. A Backhaul awaRe bandwidth allOcAtion and DBS placement (BROAD) algorithm is designed to efficiently solve the problem, and the performance of the algorithm is demonstrated via extensive simulations.

Existing learning based methods highly depend on weak supervision signals, e.g. 2D and 3D joint location, due to the lack of in-the-wild paired 3D supervision. However, considering the 2D-to-3D ambiguities existed in these weak supervision labels, the network is easy to get stuck in local optima when trained with such labels. In this paper, we reduce the ambituity by optimizing multiple initializations. Specifically, we propose a three-stage framework named Multi-Initialization Optimization Network (MION). In the first stage, we strategically select different coarse 3D reconstruction candidates which are compatible with the 2D keypoints of input sample. Each coarse reconstruction can be regarded as an initialization leads to one optimization branch. In the second stage, we design a mesh refinement transformer (MRT) to respectively refine each coarse reconstruction result via a self-attention mechanism. Finally, a Consistency Estimation Network (CEN) is proposed to find the best result from mutiple candidates by evaluating if the visual evidence in RGB image matches a given 3D reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our Multi-Initialization Optimization Network outperforms existing 3D mesh based methods on multiple public benchmarks. ",

Excellent results are known in the secretary setting, where the columns are adversarially chosen, but presented in a uniformly random order. However, these existing algorithms are susceptible to adversarial attacks: they try to \"learn\" characteristics of a good solution, but tend to over-fit to the model, and hence a small number of adversarial corruptions can cause the algorithm to fail. In this paper, we give the first robust algorithms for Packing Integer Programs, specifically in the recently proposed Byzantine Secretary framework. Our techniques are based on a two-level use of online learning, to robustly learn an approximation to the optimal value, and then to use this robust estimate to pick a good solution. These techniques are general and we use them to design robust algorithms for PIPs in the prophet model as well, specifically in the Prophet-with-Augmentations framework.

EHR data, represented as a three-dimensional analogue of a matrix (tensor), is decomposed into two-dimensional factors that can be interpreted as computational phenotypes. Methods: We apply constrained tensor factorization to derive computational phenotypes and predict mortality in cohorts of patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer in the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse from 2000 to 2015. In our experiments, we examined using a supervised term in the factorization algorithm, filtering tensor co-occurrences by medical indication, and incorporating additional social determinants of health (SDOH) covariates in the factorization process. We evaluated the resulting computational phenotypes qualitatively and by assessing their ability to predict five-year mortality using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic. Results: Filtering by medical indication led to more concise and interpretable phenotypes. Mortality prediction performance (AUC) varied under the different experimental conditions and by cancer type (breast: 0.623 - 0.694, prostate: 0.603 - 0.750, colorectal: 0.523 - 0.641, and lung: 0.517 - 0.623). Generally, prediction performance improved with the use of a supervised term and the incorporation of SDOH covariates. Conclusion: Constrained tensor factorization, applied to sparse EHR data of patients with cancer, can discover computational phenotypes predictive of five-year mortality. The incorporation of SDOH variables into the factorization algorithm is an easy-to-implement and effective way to improve prediction performance. ",

As models continue to scale up in parameters, training data, and compute, understanding memorization in language models is both important from a learning-theoretical point of view, and is practically crucial in real world applications. An open question in previous studies of memorization in language models is how to filter out \"common\" memorization. In fact, most memorization criteria strongly correlate with the number of occurrences in the training set, capturing \"common\" memorization such as familiar phrases, public knowledge or templated texts. In this paper, we provide a principled perspective inspired by a taxonomy of human memory in Psychology. From this perspective, we formulate a notion of counterfactual memorization, which characterizes how a model's predictions change if a particular document is omitted during training. We identify and study counterfactually-memorized training examples in standard text datasets. We further estimate the influence of each training example on the validation set and on generated texts, and show that this can provide direct evidence of the source of memorization at test time. ",

We curated a publication dataset consisting of two conferences and two journals from 1995 to 2020 from two research domains. Experimental results show that our PUB-G and PUB-W embeddings are superior in comparison to other baseline embeddings by a margin of ~0.18-1.03 based on topic coherence. ",

    "abstract": "Scene Graph Generation (SGG) remains a challenging visual understanding task due to its complex compositional property. Most previous works adopt a bottom-up two-stage or a point-based one-stage approach, which often suffers from overhead time complexity or sub-optimal design assumption. In this work, we propose a novel SGG method to address the aforementioned issues, which formulates the task as a bipartite graph construction problem. To solve the problem, we develop a transformer-based end-to-end framework that first generates the entity and predicate proposal set, followed by inferring directed edges to form the relation triplets. In particular, we develop a new entity-aware predicate representation based on a structural predicate generator to leverage the compositional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a graph assembling module to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph based on our entity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results show that our design is able to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two challenging benchmarks, surpassing most of the existing approaches and enjoying higher efficiency in inference. We hope our model can serve as a strong baseline for the Transformer-based scene graph generation. ",

To mitigate the inherent computational difficulties of the obtained analytical formulations in some cases, we propose efficient numerical approximations based on the numerical inversion method, the Riemann sum, and the Beta distribution. Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy of the obtained analytical formulations and the corresponding approximations against Monte Carlo simulation results, and unveil insights on the delay performance with respect to several design parameters, such as the decoding threshold, the transmit power, and the deployment density of the base stations. The proposed methods can facilitate the analysis and optimization of cellular networks subject to reliability constraints on the network packet delay that are not restricted to the local (average) delay, e.g., in the context of delay sensitive applications.

Commodity devices cooperate in providing the unmodulated carrier that the battery-free nodes need to communicate while collecting energy from their environment to perform sensing, computation, and communication tasks. The optimal provision of the unmodulated carrier limits the size of the network because it is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Consequently, previous works either ignore carrier optimization altogether or resort to suboptimal heuristics, wasting valuable energy and spectral resources. We present DeepGANTT, a deep learning scheduler for battery-free devices interoperating with wireless commodity ones. DeepGANTT leverages graph neural networks to overcome variable input and output size challenges inherent to this problem. We train our deep learning scheduler with optimal schedules of relatively small size obtained from a constraint optimization solver. DeepGANTT not only outperforms a carefully crafted heuristic solution but also performs within ~3% of the optimal scheduler on trained problem sizes. Finally, DeepGANTT generalizes to problems more than four times larger than the maximum used for training, therefore breaking the scalability limitations of the optimal scheduler and paving the way for more efficient backscatter networks.

We seek to realize this potential via a proof-of-principle application to MRI brain sequence classification. Methods: We analyzed a training set of 20 patients, each with four sequences/weightings: T1, T1 post-contrast, T2, and T2-FLAIR. We trained the parameters of a relatively small convolutional neural network (CNN) as follows: First, we randomly mutated the CNN weights. We then measured the CNN training set accuracy, using the latter as the fitness evaluation metric. The fittest child CNNs were identified. We incorporated their mutations into the parent CNN. This selectively mutated parent became the next generation's parent CNN. We repeated this process for approximately 50,000 generations. Results: DNE achieved monotonic convergence to 100% training set accuracy. DNE also converged monotonically to 100% testing set accuracy. Conclusions: DNE can achieve perfect accuracy with small training sets and small CNNs. Particularly when combined with Deep Reinforcement Learning, DNE may provide a path forward in the quest to make radiology AI more human-like in its ability to learn. DNE may very well turn out to be a key component of the much-anticipated meta-learning regime of radiology AI algorithms that can adapt to new tasks and new image types, similar to human radiologists.

In machine learning (ML), DP has been employed to limit inference/disclosure of training examples. Prior work leveraged DP across the ML pipeline, albeit in isolation, often focusing on mechanisms such as gradient perturbation. In this paper, we present, DP-UTIL, a holistic utility analysis framework of DP across the ML pipeline with focus on input perturbation, objective perturbation, gradient perturbation, output perturbation, and prediction perturbation. Given an ML task on privacy-sensitive data, DP-UTIL enables a ML privacy practitioner perform holistic comparative analysis on the impact of DP in these five perturbation spots, measured in terms of model utility loss, privacy leakage, and the number of truly revealed training samples. We evaluate DP-UTIL over classification tasks on vision, medical, and financial datasets, using two representative learning algorithms (logistic regression and deep neural network) against membership inference attack as a case study attack. One of the highlights of our results is that prediction perturbation consistently achieves the lowest utility loss on all models across all datasets. In logistic regression models, objective perturbation results in lowest privacy leakage compared to other perturbation techniques. For deep neural networks, gradient perturbation results in lowest privacy leakage. Moreover, our results on true revealed records suggest that as privacy leakage increases a differentially private model reveals more number of member samples. Overall, our findings suggest that to make informed decisions as to which perturbation mechanism to use, a ML privacy practitioner needs to examine the dynamics between optimization techniques (convex vs. non-convex), perturbation mechanisms, number of classes, and privacy budget.

In this paper, we propose Neural Spectral Reconstruction (NeSR) to lift this limitation, by introducing a novel continuous spectral representation. To this end, we embrace the concept of implicit function and implement a parameterized embodiment with a neural network. Specifically, we first adopt a backbone network to extract spatial features of RGB inputs. Based on it, we devise Spectral Profile Interpolation (SPI) module and Neural Attention Mapping (NAM) module to enrich deep features, where the spatial-spectral correlation is involved for a better representation. Then, we view the number of sampled spectral bands as the coordinate of continuous implicit function, so as to learn the projection from deep features to spectral intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the distinct advantage of NeSR in reconstruction accuracy over baseline methods. Moreover, NeSR extends the flexibility of spectral reconstruction by enabling an arbitrary number of spectral bands as the target output. ",

In this paper, we investigate the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation of effective channel coefficients in cell-free massive MIMO systems with massive connectivity. To facilitate the theoretical analysis, only single measurement vector (SMV) based MMSE estimation is considered in this paper, i.e., the MMSE estimation is performed based on the received pilot signals at each AP separately. Inspired by the decoupling principle of replica symmetric postulated MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) non-zero components, we develop the corresponding decoupling principle for the SMV based MMSE estimation of sparse signal vectors with independent and non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) non-zero components, which plays a key role in the theoretical analysis of SMV based MMSE estimation of the effective channel coefficients in cell-free massive MIMO systems with massive connectivity. Subsequently, based on the obtained decoupling principle of MMSE estimation, likelihood ratio test and the optimal fusion rule, we perform user activity detection based on the received pilot signals at only one AP, or cooperation among the entire set of APs for centralized or distributed detection. Via theoretical analysis, we show that the error probabilities of both centralized and distributed detection tend to zero when the number of APs tends to infinity while the asymptotic ratio between the number of users and pilots is kept constant.

In this paper, we propose the Channel-wise Attention-based Depth Estimation Network (CADepth-Net) with two effective contributions: 1) The structure perception module employs the self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and aggregates discriminative features in channel dimensions, explicitly enhances the perception of scene structure, obtains the better scene understanding and rich feature representation. 2) The detail emphasis module re-calibrates channel-wise feature maps and selectively emphasizes the informative features, aiming to highlight crucial local details information and fuse different level features more efficiently, resulting in more precise and sharper depth prediction.

To address the challenge, numerous defense strategies, including reactive and proactive ones, have been proposed for robustness improvement. From the perspective of image feature space, some of them cannot reach satisfying results due to the shift of features. Besides, features learned by models are not directly related to classification results. Different from them, We consider defense method essentially from model inside and investigated the neuron behaviors before and after attacks. We observed that attacks mislead the model by dramatically changing the neurons that contribute most and least to the correct label. Motivated by it, we introduce the concept of neuron influence and further divide neurons into front, middle and tail part. Based on it, we propose neuron-level inverse perturbation(NIP), the first neuron-level reactive defense method against adversarial attacks. By strengthening front neurons and weakening those in the tail part, NIP can eliminate nearly all adversarial perturbations while still maintaining high benign accuracy. Besides, it can cope with different sizes of perturbations via adaptivity, especially larger ones. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three datasets and six models show that NIP outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines against eleven adversarial attacks. We further provide interpretable proofs via neuron activation and visualization for better understanding. ",

However, the backdoored pre-trained models can pose a significant trojan threat to the deployment of downstream DNNs. Existing DNN testing methods are mainly designed to find incorrect corner case behaviors in adversarial settings but fail to discover the backdoors crafted by strong trojan attacks. Observing the trojan network behaviors shows that they are not just reflected by a single compromised neuron as proposed by previous work but attributed to the critical neural paths in the activation intensity and frequency of multiple neurons. This work formulates the DNN backdoor testing and proposes the CatchBackdoor framework. Via differential fuzzing of critical neurons from a small number of benign examples, we identify the trojan paths and particularly the critical ones, and generate backdoor testing examples by simulating the critical neurons in the identified paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CatchBackdoor, with higher detection performance than existing methods. CatchBackdoor works better on detecting backdoors by stealthy blending and adaptive attacks, which existing methods fail to detect. Moreover, our experiments show that CatchBackdoor may reveal the potential backdoors of models in Model Zoo. ",

First, under the assumption of known system dynamics, we obtain the theoretically optimal performance bound by formulating the admission control problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and solving it through dynamic programming. Second, we apply reinforcement learning to practically tackle the problem when the arrival and departure rates are not known. As Q-learning maximizes the discounted rewards, we prove it is not an efficient solution due to its sensitivity to the discount factor. Then, we propose the average reward reinforcement learning approach (R-Learning) to find the policy that directly maximizes the average profit. Finally, we evaluate different solutions through extensive simulations and experimentally using the 5Growth platform. Results confirm that the proposed R-Learning solution always outperforms Q-Learning and the greedy policies. Furthermore, while there is at most 9% optimality gap in the ideal simulation environment, it competes with the MDP solution in the experimental assessment. ",

Here, we propose to leverage the invertible network to enhance low-light image in forward process and degrade the normal-light one inversely with unpaired learning. The generated and real images are then fed into discriminators for adversarial learning. In addition to the adversarial loss, we design various loss functions to ensure the stability of training and preserve more image details. Particularly, a reversibility loss is introduced to alleviate the over-exposure problem. Moreover, we present a progressive self-guided enhancement process for low-light images and achieve favorable performance against the SOTAs. ",

    "abstract": "Subgraph similarity search is a fundamental operator in graph analysis. In this framework, given a query graph and a graph database, the goal is to identify subgraphs of the database graphs that are structurally similar to the query. Subgraph edit distance (SED) is one of the most expressive measures for subgraph similarity. In this work, we study the problem of learning SED from a training set of graph pairs and their SED values. Towards that end, we design a novel siamese graph neural network called NEUROSED, which learns an embedding space with a rich structure reminiscent of SED. With the help of a specially crafted inductive bias, NEUROSED not only enables high accuracy but also ensures that the predicted SED, like true SED, satisfies triangle inequality. The design is generic enough to also model graph edit distance (GED), while ensuring that the predicted GED space is metric, like the true GED space. Extensive experiments on real graph datasets, for both SED and GED, establish that NEUROSED achieves approximately 2 times lower RMSE than the state of the art and is approximately 18 times faster than the fastest baseline. Further, owing to its pair-independent embeddings and theoretical properties, NEUROSED allows approximately 3 orders of magnitude faster retrieval of graphs and subgraphs. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been deployed in safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles and medical devices. Shortly after that, the vulnerability of DNNs were revealed by stealthy adversarial examples where crafted inputs -- by adding tiny perturbations to original inputs -- can lead a DNN to generate misclassification outputs. To improve the robustness of DNNs, some algorithmic-based countermeasures against adversarial examples have been introduced thereafter. In this paper, we propose a new type of stealthy attack on protected DNNs to circumvent the algorithmic defenses: via smart bit flipping in DNN weights, we can reserve the classification accuracy for clean inputs but misclassify crafted inputs even with algorithmic countermeasures. To fool protected DNNs in a stealthy way, we introduce a novel method to efficiently find their most vulnerable weights and flip those bits in hardware. Experimental results show that we can successfully apply our stealthy attack against state-of-the-art algorithmic-protected DNNs. ",

    "abstract": "As a highly complex and integrated cyber-physical system, modern power grids are exposed to cyberattacks. False data injection attacks (FDIAs), specifically, represent a major class of cyber threats to smart grids by targeting the measurement data's integrity. Although various solutions have been proposed to detect those cyberattacks, the vast majority of the works have ignored the inherent graph structure of the power grid measurements and validated their detectors only for small test systems with less than a few hundred buses. To better exploit the spatial correlations of smart grid measurements, this paper proposes a deep learning model for cyberattack detection in large-scale AC power grids using Chebyshev Graph Convolutional Networks (CGCN). By reducing the complexity of spectral graph filters and making them localized, CGCN provides a fast and efficient convolution operation to model the graph structural smart grid data. We numerically verify that the proposed CGCN based detector surpasses the state-of-the-art model by 7.86 in detection rate and 9.67 in false alarm rate for a large-scale power grid with 2848 buses. It is notable that the proposed approach detects cyberattacks under 4 milliseconds for a 2848-bus system, which makes it a good candidate for real-time detection of cyberattacks in large systems. ",

We study the shortest path edge interdiction problem for defending Active Directory style attack graphs. The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game between one defender and one attacker. The attack graph contains one destination node and multiple entry nodes. The attacker's entry node is chosen by nature. The defender chooses to block a set of edges limited by his budget. The attacker then picks the shortest unblocked attack path. The defender aims to maximize the expected shortest path length for the attacker, where the expectation is taken over entry nodes. We observe that practical Active Directory attack graphs have small maximum attack path lengths and are structurally close to trees. We first show that even if the maximum attack path length is a constant, the problem is still $W[1]$-hard with respect to the defender's budget. Having a small maximum attack path length and a small budget is not enough to design fixed-parameter algorithms. If we further assume that the number of entry nodes is small, then we derive a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm. We then propose two other fixed-parameter algorithms by exploiting the tree-like features. One is based on tree decomposition and requires a small tree width. The other assumes a small number of splitting nodes (nodes with multiple out-going edges). Finally, the last algorithm is converted into a graph convolutional neural network based heuristic, which scales to larger graphs with more splitting nodes. ",

Although deep learning with differential privacy is a defacto standard for publishing deep learning models with differential privacy guarantee, we show that differentially private algorithms with fixed privacy parameters are vulnerable against gradient leakage attacks. This paper investigates alternative approaches to gradient leakage resilient deep learning with differential privacy (DP). First, we analyze existing implementation of deep learning with differential privacy, which use fixed noise variance to injects constant noise to the gradients in all layers using fixed privacy parameters. Despite the DP guarantee provided, the method suffers from low accuracy and is vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks. Second, we present a gradient leakage resilient deep learning approach with differential privacy guarantee by using dynamic privacy parameters. Unlike fixed-parameter strategies that result in constant noise variance, different dynamic parameter strategies present alternative techniques to introduce adaptive noise variance and adaptive noise injection which are closely aligned to the trend of gradient updates during differentially private model training. Finally, we describe four complementary metrics to evaluate and compare alternative approaches. ",

However, it is unclear whether those methods which exploit such dependency information for semantic parsing can be combined to achieve further improvement and the relationship of those methods when they combine. In this paper, we examine three methods to incorporate such dependency information in a Transformer based semantic parser and empirically study their combinations. We first replace standard self-attention heads in the encoder with parent-scaled self-attention (PASCAL) heads, i.e., the ones that can attend to the dependency parent of each token. Then we concatenate syntax-aware word representations (SAWRs), i.e., the intermediate hidden representations of a neural dependency parser, with ordinary word embedding to enhance the encoder. Later, we insert the constituent attention (CA) module to the encoder, which adds an extra constraint to attention heads that can better capture the inherent dependency structure of input sentences. Transductive ensemble learning (TEL) is used for model aggregation, and an ablation study is conducted to show the contribution of each method. Our experiments show that CA is complementary to PASCAL or SAWRs, and PASCAL + CA provides state-of-the-art performance among neural approaches on ATIS, GEO, and JOBS. ",

While UDN offers a number of benefits, an upsurge of energy consumption in UDN due to the intensive deployment of small cells has now become a major bottleneck in achieving the primary goals viz., 100-fold increase in the throughput in 5G+ and 6G. In recent years, an approach to reduce the energy consumption of base stations (BSs) by selectively turning off the lightly-loaded BSs, referred to as the sleep mode technique, has been suggested. However, determining the appropriate active/sleep modes of BSs is a difficult task due to the huge computational overhead and inefficiency caused by the frequent BS mode conversion. An aim of this paper is to propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to achieve a reduction of energy consumption in UDN. Key ingredient of the proposed scheme is to use decision selection network to reduce the size of action space. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the energy consumption of UDN while ensuring the rate requirement of network. ",

Building a personal credit scoring machine learning model can effectively predict whether users will repay loans on the P2P platform.

There have been some studies on balanced sampling methods, but the effect of outlier detection methods and their combination with balanced sampling methods on the effectiveness of machine learning models has not been fully studied. In this paper, the influence of using different outlier detection methods and balanced sampling methods on commonly used machine learning models is investigated.

    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation aims to predict a user's next action based on previous actions in the current session. The major challenge is to capture authentic and complete user preferences in the entire session. Recent work utilizes graph structure to represent the entire session and adopts Graph Neural Network to encode session information. This modeling choice has been proved to be effective and achieved remarkable results. However, most of the existing studies only consider each item within the session independently and do not capture session semantics from a high-level perspective. Such limitation often leads to severe information loss and increases the difficulty of capturing long-range dependencies within a session. Intuitively, compared with individual items, a session snippet, i.e., a group of locally consecutive items, is able to provide supplemental user intents which are hardly captured by existing methods. In this work, we propose to learn multi-granularity consecutive user intent unit to improve the recommendation performance. Specifically, we creatively propose Multi-granularity Intent Heterogeneous Session Graph which captures the interactions between different granularity intent units and relieves the burden of long-dependency. Moreover, we propose the Intent Fusion Ranking module to compose the recommendation results from various granularity user intents. Compared with current methods that only leverage intents from individual items, IFR benefits from different granularity user intents to generate more accurate and comprehensive session representation, thus eventually boosting recommendation performance. We conduct extensive experiments on five session-based recommendation datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. ",

Ignoring situations where audit relevant distribution changes are not evident in the training data or become incrementally available over time. In contrast, in continuous auditing, deep-learning models are continually trained on a stream of recorded journal entries, e.g., of the last hour.

At the same time, genomic data has become valuable for reuse beyond their initial point of collection, but privacy concerns often hinder access. Over the past several years, Beacon services have emerged to broaden accessibility to such data. These services enable users to query for the presence of a particular minor allele in a private dataset, information that can help care providers determine if genomic variation is spurious or has some known clinical indication. However, various studies have shown that even this limited access model can leak if individuals are members in the underlying dataset. Several approaches for mitigating this vulnerability have been proposed, but they are limited in that they 1) typically rely on heuristics and 2) offer probabilistic privacy guarantees, but neglect utility. In this paper, we present a novel algorithmic framework to ensure privacy in a Beacon service setting with a minimal number of query response flips (e.g., changing a positive response to a negative). Specifically, we represent this problem as combinatorial optimization in both the batch setting (where queries arrive all at once), as well as the online setting (where queries arrive sequentially). The former setting has been the primary focus in prior literature, whereas real Beacons allow sequential queries, motivating the latter investigation. We present principled algorithms in this framework with both privacy and, in some cases, worst-case utility guarantees. Moreover, through an extensive experimental evaluation, we show that the proposed approaches significantly outperform the state of the art in terms of privacy and utility. ",

Inspired by the evidence that pure self-attention possesses a strong inductive bias that leads to the transformer losing the expressive power with respect to network depth, we propose a transformer architecture with a mitigatory self-attention mechanism by applying possible direct mapping connections in the transformer architecture to mitigate the rank collapse so as to counteract feature expression loss and enhance the model performance. We apply this proposal in object detection tasks and develop a model named Miti-DETR. Miti-DETR reserves the inputs of each single attention layer to the outputs of that layer so that the \"non-attention\" information has participated in any attention propagation. The formed residual self-attention network addresses two critical issues: (1) stop the self-attention networks from degenerating to rank-1 to the maximized degree; and (2) further diversify the path distribution of parameter update so that easier attention learning is expected. Miti-DETR significantly enhances the average detection precision and convergence speed towards existing DETR-based models on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, the proposed transformer with the residual self-attention network can be easily generalized or plugged in other related task models without specific customization. ",

    "title": "Efficient Diversity-Driven Ensemble for Deep Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "The ensemble of deep neural networks has been shown, both theoretically and empirically, to improve generalization accuracy on the unseen test set. However, the high training cost hinders its efficiency since we need a sufficient number of base models and each one in the ensemble has to be separately trained. Lots of methods are proposed to tackle this problem, and most of them are based on the feature that a pre-trained network can transfer its knowledge to the next base model and then accelerate the training process. However, these methods suffer a severe problem that all of them transfer knowledge without selection and thus lead to low diversity. As the effect of ensemble learning is more pronounced if ensemble members are accurate and diverse, we propose a method named Efficient Diversity-Driven Ensemble (EDDE) to address both the diversity and the efficiency of an ensemble. To accelerate the training process, we propose a novel knowledge transfer method which can selectively transfer the previous generic knowledge. To enhance diversity, we first propose a new diversity measure, then use it to define a diversity-driven loss function for optimization. At last, we adopt a Boosting-based framework to combine the above operations, such a method can also further improve diversity. We evaluate EDDE on Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Compared with other well-known ensemble methods, EDDE can get highest ensemble accuracy with the lowest training cost, which means it is efficient in the ensemble of neural networks. ",

    "abstract": "In the modern era of computing, machine learning tools have demonstrated their potential in vital sectors, such as healthcare and finance, to derive proper inferences. The sensitive and confidential nature of the data in such sectors raises genuine concerns for data privacy. This motivated the area of Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML), where privacy of data is guaranteed. In this thesis, we design an efficient platform, MPCLeague, for PPML in the Secure Outsourced Computation (SOC) setting using Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) techniques. MPC, the holy-grail problem of secure distributed computing, enables a set of n mutually distrusting parties to perform joint computation on their private inputs in a way that no coalition of t parties can learn more information than the output (privacy) or affect the true output of the computation (correctness). While MPC, in general, has been a subject of extensive research, the area of MPC with a small number of parties has drawn popularity of late mainly due to its application to real-time scenarios, efficiency and simplicity. This thesis focuses on designing efficient MPC frameworks for 2, 3 and 4 parties, with at most one corruption and supports ring structures. At the heart of this thesis are four frameworks - ASTRA, SWIFT, Tetrad, ABY2.0 - catered to different settings. The practicality of our framework is argued through improvements in the benchmarking of widely used ML algorithms -- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines. We propose two variants for each of our frameworks, with one variant aiming to minimise the execution time while the other focuses on the monetary cost. The concrete efficiency gains of our frameworks coupled with the stronger security guarantee of robustness make our platform an ideal choice for a real-time deployment of PPML techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Recent analysis on speech emotion recognition has made considerable advances with the use of MFCCs spectrogram features and the implementation of neural network approaches such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Capsule networks (CapsNet) have gained gratitude as alternatives to CNNs with their larger capacities for hierarchical representation. To address these issues, this research introduces a text-independent and speaker-independent SER novel architecture, where a dual-channel long short-term memory compressed-CapsNet (DC-LSTM COMP-CapsNet) algorithm is proposed based on the structural features of CapsNet. Our proposed novel classifier can ensure the energy efficiency of the model and adequate compression method in speech emotion recognition, which is not delivered through the original structure of a CapsNet. Moreover, the grid search approach is used to attain optimal solutions. Results witnessed an improved performance and reduction in the training and testing running time. The speech datasets used to evaluate our algorithm are: Arabic Emirati-accented corpus, English speech under simulated and actual stress corpus, English Ryerson audio-visual database of emotional speech and song corpus, and crowd-sourced emotional multimodal actors dataset. This work reveals that the optimum feature extraction method compared to other known methods is MFCCs delta-delta. Using the four datasets and the MFCCs delta-delta, DC-LSTM COMP-CapsNet surpasses all the state-of-the-art systems, classical classifiers, CNN, and the original CapsNet. Using the Arabic Emirati-accented corpus, our results demonstrate that the proposed work yields average emotion recognition accuracy of 89.3% compared to 84.7%, 82.2%, 69.8%, 69.2%, 53.8%, 42.6%, and 31.9% based on CapsNet, CNN, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron, k-nearest neighbor, radial basis function, and naive Bayes, respectively.

While server sharing among jobs improves resource utilization, interference among co-located DL jobs occurs due to resource contention. Interference-aware job placement has been studied, with white-box approaches based on explicit interference modeling and black-box schedulers with reinforcement learning. In today's clusters containing thousands of GPU servers, running a single scheduler to manage all arrival jobs in a timely and effective manner is challenging, due to the large workload scale. We adopt multiple schedulers in a large-scale cluster/data center, and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) scheduling framework to cooperatively learn fine-grained job placement policies, towards the objective of minimizing job completion time (JCT). To achieve topology-aware placements, our proposed framework uses hierarchical graph neural networks to encode the data center topology and server architecture. In view of a common lack of precise reward samples corresponding to different placements, a job interference model is further devised to predict interference levels in face of various co-locations, for training of the MARL schedulers. Testbed and trace-driven evaluations show that our scheduler framework outperforms representative scheduling schemes by more than 20% in terms of average JCT, and is adaptive to various machine learning cluster topologies.

To solve this important problem, we introduce FRuDA: an end-to-end framework for distributed adversarial uDA. Through a careful analysis of the uDA literature, we identify the design goals for a distributed uDA system and propose two novel algorithms to increase adaptation accuracy and training efficiency of adversarial uDA in distributed settings. Our evaluation of FRuDA with five image and speech datasets show that it can boost target domain accuracy by up to 50% and improve the training efficiency of adversarial uDA by at least 11 times. ",

We leverage on these results to analyse the interaction properties between voltages and bounded currents as well as between node voltages and to propose a two-layer optimal controller that keeps network voltages within a compact neighbourhood of the nominal operational voltage. We analyse the stability of the closed loop system in two ways: one considering the interconnection properties which yields a weaker ISS type property and a second that contemplates the network in closed loop with a distributed optimal controller. For the latter, we propose a novel distributed way of controlling a Laplacian network using neighbouring information which results in asymptotic stability. We demonstrate our results in a meshed topology network containing 6 power converters, each converter feeding an individual constant power load with values chaning arbitrarily within a pre-specified range.

Although it has some similarities to standard neural network models, as we show, there are some significant differences. Both nodes and edges in our network have weights and activation levels. They act as probabilistic transducers that use a set of relatively simple rules to determine how activation levels and weights are affected by input, generate output, and affect each other. We show that these simple rules enable a learning process that allows the network to represent increasingly complex knowledge, and simultaneously to act as a computing device that facilitates planning, decision-making, and the execution of behavior. By specifying the innate (genetic) components of the network, we show how evolution could endow the network with initial adaptive rules and goals that are then enriched through learning. We demonstrate how the developing structure of the network (which determines what the brain can do and how well) is critically affected by the co-evolved coordination between the mechanisms affecting the distribution of data input and those determining the learning parameters (used in the programs run by nodes and edges). Finally, we consider how the model accounts for various findings in the field of learning and decision making, how it can address some challenging problems in mind and behavior, such as those related to setting goals and self-control, and how it can help understand some cognitive disorders.

Existing methods focus on how to learn the node representation based on graph-based structure. High-dimensional sparse edge features are not fully exploited. Because balancing precision and computation efficiency is significant for recommendation systems in real world, multiple-level feature representation in large-scale sparse graph still lacks effective and efficient solution. In this paper, we propose a practical solution about graph neural networks called Attributed Graph Convolutional Networks(AGCN) to incorporate edge attributes when apply graph neural networks in large-scale sparse networks. We formulate the link prediction problem as a subgraph classification problem. We firstly propose an efficient two-level projection to decompose topological structures to node-edge pairs and project them into the same interaction feature space. Then we apply multi-layer GCN to combine the projected node-edge pairs to capture the topological structures. Finally, the pooling representation of two units is treated as the input of classifier to predict the probability. We conduct offline experiments on two industrial datasets and one public dataset and demonstrate that AGCN outperforms other excellent baselines. Moreover, we also deploy AGCN method to important scenarios on Xianyu and AliExpress. In online systems, AGCN achieves over 5% improvement on online metrics. ",

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) processes speech signals to detect and characterize expressed perceived emotions. Many SER application systems often acquire and transmit speech data collected at the client-side to remote cloud platforms for inference and decision making. However, speech data carry rich information not only about emotions conveyed in vocal expressions, but also other sensitive demographic traits such as gender, age and language background. Consequently, it is desirable for SER systems to have the ability to classify emotion constructs while preventing unintended/improper inferences of sensitive and demographic information. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that coordinates clients to train a model collaboratively without sharing their local data. This training approach appears secure and can improve privacy for SER. However, recent works have demonstrated that FL approaches are still vulnerable to various privacy attacks like reconstruction attacks and membership inference attacks. Although most of these have focused on computer vision applications, such information leakages exist in the SER systems trained using the FL technique. To assess the information leakage of SER systems trained using FL, we propose an attribute inference attack framework that infers sensitive attribute information of the clients from shared gradients or model parameters, corresponding to the FedSGD and the FedAvg training algorithms, respectively. As a use case, we empirically evaluate our approach for predicting the client's gender information using three SER benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, CREMA-D, and MSP-Improv. We show that the attribute inference attack is achievable for SER systems trained using FL. We further identify that most information leakage possibly comes from the first layer in the SER model. ",

Earthquake prediction is an essential aspect of any society's plans and can increase public preparedness and reduce damage to a great extent. Nevertheless, due to the stochastic character of earthquakes and the challenge of achieving an efficient and dependable model for earthquake prediction, efforts have been insufficient thus far, and new methods are required to solve this problem. Aware of these issues, this paper proposes a novel prediction method based on attention mechanism (AM), convolution neural network (CNN), and bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) models, which can predict the number and maximum magnitude of earthquakes in each area of mainland China-based on the earthquake catalog of the region. This model takes advantage of LSTM and CNN with an attention mechanism to better focus on effective earthquake characteristics and produce more accurate predictions. Firstly, the zero-order hold technique is applied as pre-processing on earthquake data, making the model's input data more proper. Secondly, to effectively use spatial information and reduce dimensions of input data, the CNN is used to capture the spatial dependencies between earthquake data. Thirdly, the Bi-LSTM layer is employed to capture the temporal dependencies. Fourthly, the AM layer is introduced to highlight its important features to achieve better prediction performance. The results show that the proposed method has better performance and generalize ability than other prediction methods. ",

    "abstract": "Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been used as a non-destructive tool for tree root inspection. Estimating root-related parameters from GPR radargrams greatly facilitates root health monitoring and imaging. However, the task of estimating root-related parameters is challenging as the root reflection is a complex function of multiple root parameters and root orientations. Existing methods can only estimate a single root parameter at a time without considering the influence of other parameters and root orientations, resulting in limited estimation accuracy under different root conditions. In addition, soil heterogeneity introduces clutter in GPR radargrams, making the data processing and interpretation even harder. To address these issues, a novel neural network architecture, called mask-guided multi-polarimetric integration neural network (MMI-Net), is proposed to automatically and simultaneously estimate multiple root-related parameters in heterogeneous soil environments. The MMI-Net includes two sub-networks: a MaskNet that predicts a mask to highlight the root reflection area to eliminate interfering environmental clutter, and a ParaNet that uses the predicted mask as guidance to integrate, extract, and emphasize informative features in multi-polarimetric radargrams for accurate estimation of five key root-related parameters. The parameters include the root depth, diameter, relative permittivity, horizontal and vertical orientation angles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MMI-Net achieves high estimation accuracy in these root-related parameters. This is the first work that takes the combined contributions of root parameters and spatial orientations into account and simultaneously estimates multiple root-related parameters.

    "abstract": "Causal inference is capable of estimating the treatment effect (i.e., the causal effect of treatment on the outcome) to benefit the decision making in various domains. One fundamental challenge in this research is that the treatment assignment bias in observational data. To increase the validity of observational studies on causal inference, representation based methods as the state-of-the-art have demonstrated the superior performance of treatment effect estimation. Most representation based methods assume all observed covariates are pre-treatment (i.e., not affected by the treatment), and learn a balanced representation from these observed covariates for estimating treatment effect. Unfortunately, this assumption is often too strict a requirement in practice, as some covariates are changed by doing an intervention on treatment (i.e., post-treatment). By contrast, the balanced representation learned from unchanged covariates thus biases the treatment effect estimation. ",

In order to make the propagation and aggregation mechanism of GCN suitable for both homophily and heterophily (or even their mixture), we introduce block modeling into the framework of GCN so that it can realize \"block-guided classified aggregation\", and automatically learn the corresponding aggregation rules for neighbors of different classes. By incorporating block modeling into the aggregation process, GCN is able to aggregate information from homophilic and heterophilic neighbors discriminately according to their homophily degree. We compared our algorithm with state-of-art methods which deal with the heterophily problem.

A typical anomaly detection system always faces the class-imbalance problem in the form of a vast difference in the sample sizes of different classes. They usually have class overlap problems. This study used a capsule network for the anomaly detection task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance where a capsule network is analyzed for the anomaly detection task in a high-dimensional non-image complex data setting. We also handle the related novelty and outlier detection problems. The architecture of the capsule network was suitably modified for a binary classification task. Capsule networks offer a good option for detecting anomalies due to the effect of viewpoint invariance captured in its predictions and viewpoint equivariance captured in internal capsule architecture. We used six-layered under-complete autoencoder architecture with second and third layers containing capsules. The capsules were trained using the dynamic routing algorithm. We created $10$-imbalanced datasets from the original MNIST dataset and compared the performance of the capsule network with $5$ baseline models. Our leading test set measures are F1-score for minority class and area under the ROC curve. We found that the capsule network outperformed every other baseline model on the anomaly detection task by using only ten epochs for training and without using any other data level and algorithm level approach. Thus, we conclude that capsule networks are excellent in modeling complex high-dimensional imbalanced datasets for the anomaly detection task. ",

Previous works always formulate face forgery detection as a classification problem based on cross-entropy loss, which emphasizes category-level differences rather than the essential discrepancies between real and fake faces, limiting model generalization in unseen domains. To address this issue, we propose a novel face forgery detection framework, named Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL), which specially constructs positive and negative paired data and performs designed contrastive learning at different granularities to learn generalized feature representation. Concretely, combined with the hard sample selection strategy, Inter-Instance Contrastive Learning (Inter-ICL) is first proposed to promote task-related discriminative features learning by especially constructing instance pairs. Moreover, to further explore the essential discrepancies, Intra-Instance Contrastive Learning (Intra-ICL) is introduced to focus on the local content inconsistencies prevalent in the forged faces by constructing local-region pairs inside instances. Extensive experiments and visualizations on several datasets demonstrate the generalization of our method against the state-of-the-art competitors. ",

Both the vision transformer network and the energy-based prior model are jointly trained via Markov chain Monte Carlo-based maximum likelihood estimation, in which the sampling from the intractable posterior and prior distributions of the latent variables are performed by Langevin dynamics. Further, with the generative vision transformer, we can easily obtain a pixel-wise uncertainty map from an image, which indicates the model confidence in predicting saliency from the image. Different from the existing generative models which define the prior distribution of the latent variables as a simple isotropic Gaussian distribution, our model uses an energy-based informative prior which can be more expressive to capture the latent space of the data. We apply the proposed framework to both RGB and RGB-D salient object detection tasks. Extensive experimental results show that our framework can achieve not only accurate saliency predictions but also meaningful uncertainty maps that are consistent with the human perception. ",

However, most of the existing theoretical support for AC algorithms focuses on the case of linear function approximations, or linearized neural networks, where the feature representation is fixed throughout training. Such a limitation fails to capture the key aspect of representation learning in neural AC, which is pivotal in practical problems. In this work, we take a mean-field perspective on the evolution and convergence of feature-based neural AC. Specifically, we consider a version of AC where the actor and critic are represented by overparameterized two-layer neural networks and are updated with two-timescale learning rates. The critic is updated by temporal-difference (TD) learning with a larger stepsize while the actor is updated via proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a smaller stepsize. In the continuous-time and infinite-width limiting regime, when the timescales are properly separated, we prove that neural AC finds the globally optimal policy at a sublinear rate. Additionally, we prove that the feature representation induced by the critic network is allowed to evolve within a neighborhood of the initial one. ",

However, the given adversarial events make the current deep learning model vulnerable to safety issues. In this work, we generate adversarial examples and then train the robust models for event-based data, for the first time. Our algorithm shifts the time of the original events and generates additional adversarial events. Additional adversarial events are generated in two stages. First, null events are added to the event-based data to generate additional adversarial events. The perturbation size can be controlled with the number of null events. Second, the location and time of additional adversarial events are set to mislead DNNs in a gradient-based attack. Our algorithm achieves an attack success rate of 97.95\\% on the N-Caltech101 dataset.

In such DNN-based systems, error resilience is a top priority since faults in DNN inference could lead to mispredictions and safety hazards. For latency-critical DNN inference on resource-constrained edge devices, it is nontrivial to apply conventional redundancy-based fault tolerance techniques. In this paper, we propose FitAct, a low-cost approach to enhance the error resilience of DNNs by deploying fine-grained post-trainable activation functions. The main idea is to precisely bound the activation value of each individual neuron via neuron-wise bounded activation functions so that it could prevent fault propagation in the network. To avoid complex DNN model re-training, we propose to decouple the accuracy training and resilience training and develop a lightweight post-training phase to learn these activation functions with precise bound values. Experimental results on widely used DNN models such as AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50 demonstrate that FitAct outperforms state-of-the-art studies such as Clip-Act and Ranger in enhancing the DNN error resilience for a wide range of fault rates while adding manageable runtime and memory space overheads.

We propose PRIME, a general data augmentation scheme that consists of simple families of max-entropy image transformations. We show that PRIME outperforms the prior art for corruption robustness, while its simplicity and plug-and-play nature enables it to be combined with other methods to further boost their robustness. Furthermore, we analyze PRIME to shed light on the importance of the mixing strategy on synthesizing corrupted images, and to reveal the robustness-accuracy trade-offs arising in the context of common corruptions. Finally, we show that the computational efficiency of our method allows it to be easily used in both on-line and off-line data augmentation schemes. ",

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of mobile devices and the Internet of Things, deep learning models are increasingly deployed on devices with limited computing resources and memory, and are exposed to the threat of adversarial noise. Learning deep models with both lightweight and robustness is necessary for these equipments. However, current deep learning solutions are difficult to learn a model that possesses these two properties without degrading one or the other. As is well known, the fully-connected layers contribute most of the parameters of convolutional neural networks. We perform a separable structural transformation of the fully-connected layer to reduce the parameters, where the large-scale weight matrix of the fully-connected layer is decoupled by the tensor product of several separable small-sized matrices. Note that data, such as images, no longer need to be flattened before being fed to the fully-connected layer, retaining the valuable spatial geometric information of the data. Moreover, in order to further enhance both lightweight and robustness, we propose a joint constraint of sparsity and differentiable condition number, which is imposed on these separable matrices. We evaluate the proposed approach on MLP, VGG-16 and Vision Transformer. The experimental results on datasets such as ImageNet, SVHN, CIFAR-100 and CIFAR10 show that we successfully reduce the amount of network parameters by 90%, while the robust accuracy loss is less than 1.5%, which is better than the SOTA methods based on the original fully-connected layer.

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely applied in various fields due to their significant power on processing graph-structured data. Typical GCN and its variants work under a homophily assumption (i.e., nodes with same class are prone to connect to each other), while ignoring the heterophily which exists in many real-world networks (i.e., nodes with different classes tend to form edges). Existing methods deal with heterophily by mainly aggregating higher-order neighborhoods or combing the immediate representations, which leads to noise and irrelevant information in the result. But these methods did not change the propagation mechanism which works under homophily assumption (that is a fundamental part of GCNs). This makes it difficult to distinguish the representation of nodes from different classes. To address this problem, in this paper we design a novel propagation mechanism, which can automatically change the propagation and aggregation process according to homophily or heterophily between node pairs. To adaptively learn the propagation process, we introduce two measurements of homophily degree between node pairs, which is learned based on topological and attribute information, respectively. Then we incorporate the learnable homophily degree into the graph convolution framework, which is trained in an end-to-end schema, enabling it to go beyond the assumption of homophily. More importantly, we theoretically prove that our model can constrain the similarity of representations between nodes according to their homophily degree. Experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that this new approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under heterophily or low homophily, and gains competitive performance under homophily.

    "abstract": "The generalized Biot-Brinkman equations describe the displacement, pressures and fluxes in an elastic medium permeated by multiple viscous fluid networks and can be used to study complex poromechanical interactions in geophysics, biophysics and other engineering sciences. These equations extend on the Biot and multiple-network poroelasticity equations on the one hand and Brinkman flow models on the other hand, and as such embody a range of singular perturbation problems in realistic parameter regimes. In this paper, we introduce, theoretically analyze and numerically investigate a class of three-field finite element formulations of the generalized Biot-Brinkman equations. By introducing appropriate norms, we demonstrate that the proposed finite element discretization, as well as an associated preconditioning strategy, is robust with respect to the relevant parameter regimes. The theoretical analysis is complemented by numerical examples. ",

    "abstract": "Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) aims to translate multiple languages with a single model and has been proved successful thanks to effective knowledge transfer among different languages with shared parameters. However, it is still an open question which parameters should be shared and which ones need to be task-specific. Currently, the common practice is to heuristically design or search language-specific modules, which is difficult to find the optimal configuration. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter differentiation based method that allows the model to determine which parameters should be language-specific during training. Inspired by cellular differentiation, each shared parameter in our method can dynamically differentiate into more specialized types. We further define the differentiation criterion as inter-task gradient similarity. Therefore, parameters with conflicting inter-task gradients are more likely to be language-specific. Extensive experiments on multilingual datasets have demonstrated that our method significantly outperforms various strong baselines with different parameter sharing configurations. Further analyses reveal that the parameter sharing configuration obtained by our method correlates well with the linguistic proximities. ",

    "abstract": "Controllability refers to a situation in which a Multi-agent System may be steered from one state to another using specified rules. As a result, there is belief in achieving a given condition by explicit advances. The level of dynamism in the topology and the level of determinism in the environment are two fundamental criteria that determine multi-agent system controllability. The topology of a powerful multi-agent system changes on a regular basis, altering the connections between agents and hence their cooperative effort. This survey focuses on the controllability of MAS in a switching network with a leader that follows the closest neighbour collaboration rule. The leader/pioneer is a single agent that functions as an output to control other agents/members. Because the results of activities are unknown under non-deterministic situations, agents must choose new activities after observing the aftereffects of their prior actions, which causes time delay and limits agent proactivity. Controllability is often achieved in a concentrated manner in the literature, where a certain leader educates supporters how to achieve a specific goal. Controllability has different applications which incorporates managing airplane, vehicle, and robots. ",

Accurate forecasting of electricity prices is very important and is also very challenging since electricity price is highly volatile due to various factors. This paper proposes an integrated long-term recurrent convolutional network (ILRCN) model to predict electricity prices considering the majority contributing attributes to the market price as input. The proposed ILRCN model combines the functionalities of convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm along with the proposed novel conditional error correction term. The combined ILRCN model can identify the linear and non-linear behavior within the input data. We have used ERCOT wholesale market price data along with load profile, temperature, and other factors for the Houston region to illustrate the proposed model. The performance of the proposed ILRCN electricity price forecasting model is verified using performance/evaluation metrics like mean absolute error and accuracy. Case studies reveal that the proposed ILRCN model is accurate and efficient in electricity price forecasting as compared to the support vector machine (SVM) model, fully-connected neural network model, LSTM model and the LRCN model without the conditional error correction stage.

    "abstract": "Thanks to the rapid advances in deep learning techniques and the wide availability of large-scale training sets, the performance of video saliency detection models has been improving steadily and significantly. However, deep learning-based visualaudio fixation prediction is still in its infancy. At present, only a few visual-audio sequences have been furnished, with real fixations being recorded in real visual-audio environments. Hence, it would be neither efficient nor necessary to recollect real fixations under the same visual-audio circumstances. To address this problem, this paper promotes a novel approach in a weakly supervised manner to alleviate the demand of large-scale training sets for visual-audio model training. By using only the video category tags, we propose the selective class activation mapping (SCAM) and its upgrade (SCAM+). In the spatial-temporal-audio circumstance, the former follows a coarse-to-fine strategy to select the most discriminative regions, and these regions are usually capable of exhibiting high consistency with the real human-eye fixations. The latter equips the SCAM with an additional multi-granularity perception mechanism, making the whole process more consistent with that of the real human visual system. Moreover, we distill knowledge from these regions to obtain complete new spatial-temporal-audio (STA) fixation prediction (FP) networks, enabling broad applications in cases where video tags are not available. Without resorting to any real human-eye fixation, the performances of these STA FP networks are comparable to those of fully supervised networks.

However, most of the graph-structured data in practice suffers from incompleteness, and thus link prediction becomes an important research problem. Though many models are proposed for link prediction, the following two problems are still less explored: (1) Most methods model each link independently without making use of the rich information from relevant links, and (2) existing models are mostly designed based on associative learning and do not take reasoning into consideration. With these concerns, in this paper, we propose Graph Collaborative Reasoning (GCR), which can use the neighbor link information for relational reasoning on graphs from logical reasoning perspectives. We provide a simple approach to translate a graph structure into logical expressions, so that the link prediction task can be converted into a neural logic reasoning problem. We apply logical constrained neural modules to build the network architecture according to the logical expression and use back propagation to efficiently learn the model parameters, which bridges differentiable learning and symbolic reasoning in a unified architecture. To show the effectiveness of our work, we conduct experiments on graph-related tasks such as link prediction and recommendation based on commonly used benchmark datasets, and our graph collaborative reasoning approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Most frames only suffer from slight jitters, while significant jitters occur in those frames with occlusion or poor image quality. Such complex poses often persist in videos, leading to consecutive frames with poor estimation results and large jitters. Existing pose smoothing solutions based on temporal convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, or low-pass filters cannot deal with such a long-term jitter problem without considering the significant and persistent errors within the jittering video segment. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel plug-and-play refinement network, namely SMOOTHNET, which can be attached to any existing pose estimators to improve its temporal smoothness and enhance its per-frame precision simultaneously. Especially, SMOOTHNET is a simple yet effective data-driven fully-connected network with large receptive fields, effectively mitigating the impact of long-term jitters with unreliable estimation results. We conduct extensive experiments on twelve backbone networks with seven datasets across 2D and 3D pose estimation, body recovery, and downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SMOOTHNET consistently outperforms existing solutions, especially on those clips with high errors and long-term jitters. ",

    "abstract": "Promotions are becoming more important and prevalent in e-commerce platforms to attract customers and boost sales. However, Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction methods in recommender systems are not able to handle such circumstances well since: 1) they can't generalize well to serving because the online data distribution is uncertain due to the potentially upcoming promotions; 2) without paying enough attention to scenario signals, they are incapable of learning different feature representation patterns which coexist in each scenario. In this work, we propose Scenario Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (SAME), a simple yet effective model that serves both promotion and normal scenarios. Technically, it follows the idea of Mixture-of-Experts by adopting multiple experts to learn feature representations, which are modulated by a Feature Gated Network (FGN) via an attention mechanism. To obtain high-quality representations, we design a Stacked Parallel Attention Unit (SPAU) to help each expert better handle user behavior sequence. To tackle the distribution uncertainty, a set of scenario signals are elaborately devised from a perspective of time series prediction and fed into the FGN, whose output is concatenated with feature representation from each expert to learn the attention. Accordingly, a mixture of the feature representations is obtained scenario-adaptively and used for the final CTR prediction. In this way, each expert can learn a discriminative representation pattern. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study for promotion-aware CTR prediction. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the superiority of SAME. Online A/B test also shows SAME achieves significant gains of 3.58% on CTR and 5.94% on IPV during promotion periods as well as 3.93% and 6.57% in normal days, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Different from large-scale platforms such as Taobao and Amazon, developing CVR models in small-scale recommendation scenarios is more challenging due to the severe Data Distribution Fluctuation (DDF) issue. DDF prevents existing CVR models from being effective since 1) several months of data are needed to train CVR models sufficiently in small scenarios, leading to considerable distribution discrepancy between training and online serving; and 2) e-commerce promotions have much more significant impacts on small scenarios, leading to distribution uncertainty of the upcoming time period. In this work, we propose a novel CVR method named MetaCVR from a perspective of meta learning to address the DDF issue. Firstly, a base CVR model which consists of a Feature Representation Network (FRN) and output layers is elaborately designed and trained sufficiently with samples across months. Then we treat time periods with different data distributions as different occasions and obtain positive and negative prototypes for each occasion using the corresponding samples and the pre-trained FRN. Subsequently, a Distance Metric Network (DMN) is devised to calculate the distance metrics between each sample and all prototypes to facilitate mitigating the distribution uncertainty. At last, we develop an Ensemble Prediction Network (EPN) which incorporates the output of FRN and DMN to make the final CVR prediction. In this stage, we freeze the FRN and train the DMN and EPN with samples from recent time period, therefore effectively easing the distribution discrepancy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of CVR prediction targeting the DDF issue in small-scale recommendation scenarios. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the superiority of our MetaCVR and online A/B test also shows our model achieves impressive gains of 11.92% on PCVR and 8.64% on GMV. ",

Second, we perform an empirical analysis of three different self-supervised objectives to assess their adaptability to ILI prediction. Our results show that predicting the next day's resting heart rate or time-in-bed during sleep provides better representations for ILI prediction.

It is challenging to detect these attacks in their early stages, as adversaries utilize common network services, use novel techniques, and can evade existing detection mechanisms. We propose PORTFILER (PORT-Level Network Traffic ProFILER), a new machine learning system applied to network traffic for detecting SPM attacks. PORTFILER extracts port-level features from the Zeek connection logs collected at a border of a monitored network, applies anomaly detection techniques to identify suspicious events, and ranks the alerts across ports for investigation by the Security Operations Center (SOC). We propose a novel ensemble methodology for aggregating individual models in PORTFILER that increases resilience against several evasion strategies compared to standard ML baselines. We extensively evaluate PORTFILER on traffic collected from two university networks, and show that it can detect SPM attacks with different patterns, such as WannaCry and Mirai, and performs well under evasion. Ranking across ports achieves precision over 0.94 with low false positive rates in the top ranked alerts. When deployed on the university networks, PORTFILER detected anomalous SPM-like activity on one of the campus networks, confirmed by the university SOC as malicious. PORTFILER also detected a Mirai attack recreated on the two university networks with higher precision and recall than deep-learning-based autoencoder methods. ",

This bottleneck is particularly prohibitive in highly specialized and regulated fields such as medicine and surgery, where video semantic segmentation could have important applications but data and expert annotations are scarce. In these settings, temporal clues and anatomical constraints could be leveraged during training to improve performance. Here, we present Temporally Constrained Neural Networks (TCNN), a semi-supervised framework used for video semantic segmentation of surgical videos. In this work, we show that autoencoder networks can be used to efficiently provide both spatial and temporal supervisory signals to train deep learning models. We test our method on a newly introduced video dataset of laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures, Endoscapes, and an adaptation of a public dataset of cataract surgeries, CaDIS. We demonstrate that lower-dimensional representations of predicted masks can be leveraged to provide a consistent improvement on both sparsely labeled datasets with no additional computational cost at inference time. Further, the TCNN framework is model-agnostic and can be used in conjunction with other model design choices with minimal additional complexity. ",

PES eliminates bias from these truncations by accumulating correction terms over the entire sequence of unrolls. PES allows for rapid parameter updates, has low memory usage, is unbiased, and has reasonable variance characteristics. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of PES compared to several other methods for gradient estimation on synthetic tasks, and show its applicability to training learned optimizers and tuning hyperparameters.

    "abstract": "Viscous shocks are a particular type of extreme events in nonlinear multiscale systems, and their representation requires small scales. Model reduction can thus play an important role in reducing the computational cost for an efficient prediction of shocks. Yet, reduced models typically aim to approximate large-scale dominating dynamics, which do not resolve the small scales by design. To resolve this representation barrier, we introduce a new qualitative characterization of the space-time locations of shocks, named as the ``shock trace'', via a space-time indicator function based on an empirical resolution-adaptive threshold. Different from the exact shocks, the shock traces can be captured within the representation capacity of the large scales, which facilitates the forecast of the timing and locations of the shocks utilizing reduced models. Within the context of a viscous stochastic Burgers equation, we show that a data-driven reduced model, in the form of nonlinear autoregression (NAR) time series models, can accurately predict the random shock traces, with relatively low rates of false predictions. The NAR model significantly outperforms the corresponding Galerkin truncated model in the scenario of either noiseless or noisy observations. The results illustrate the importance of the data-driven closure terms in the NAR model, which account for the effects of the unresolved small scale dynamics on the resolved ones due to nonlinear interactions.

    "abstract": "False data injection attacks (FDIAs) represent a major class of attacks that aim to break the integrity of measurements by injecting false data into the smart metering devices in power grids. To the best of authors' knowledge, no study has attempted to design a detector that automatically models the underlying graph topology and spatially correlated measurement data of the smart grids to better detect cyber attacks. The contributions of this paper to detect and mitigate FDIAs are twofold. First, we present a generic, localized, and stealth (unobservable) attack generation methodology and publicly accessible datasets for researchers to develop and test their algorithms. Second, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based, scalable and real-time detector of FDIAs that efficiently combines model-driven and data-driven approaches by incorporating the inherent physical connections of modern AC power grids and exploiting the spatial correlations of the measurement. It is experimentally verified by comparing the proposed GNN based detector with the currently available FDIA detectors in the literature that our algorithm outperforms the best available solutions by 3.14%, 4.25%, and 4.41% in F1 score for standard IEEE testbeds with 14, 118, and 300 buses, respectively.

Conventional reconstruction algorithms can be used if the X-ray data are adequately sampled and of high quality; however, concerns such as reducing dose to the patient, or geometric limitations on data acquisition, may result in low quality or incomplete data. Images reconstructed from these data using conventional methods are of poor quality, due to noise and other artifacts. The aim of this study is to train a single neural network to reconstruct high-quality CT images from noisy or incomplete CT scan data, including low-dose, sparse-view, and limited-angle scenarios. To accomplish this task, we train a generative adversarial network (GAN) as a signal prior, to be used in conjunction with the iterative simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) for CT data. The network includes a self-attention block to model long-range dependencies in the data. We compare our Self-Attention GAN for CT image reconstruction with several state-of-the-art approaches, including denoising cycle GAN, CIRCLE GAN, and a total variation superiorized algorithm. Our approach is shown to have comparable overall performance to CIRCLE GAN, while outperforming the other two approaches. ",

This work presents a supraventricular arrhythmia prediction model consisting of a few stages, including filtering of noise, a unique collection of ECG characteristics, and automated learning classifying model to classify distinct types, depending on their severity. We de-trend and de-noise a signal to reduce noise to better determine functionality before extractions are performed. After that, we present one R-peak detection method and Q-S detection method as a part of necessary feature extraction. Next parameters are computed that correspond to these features. Using these characteristics, we have developed a classification model based on machine learning that can successfully categorize different types of supraventricular tachycardia. Our findings suggest that decision-tree-based models are the most efficient machine learning models for supraventricular tachycardia arrhythmia. Among all the machine learning models, this model most efficiently lowers the crucial signal misclassification of supraventricular tachycardia.

In order to diagnose heart diseases and find care for a patient, an early, reliable diagnosis of different types of arrhythmia is necessary. By implementing our proposed method, this work deals with the problem of reducing the misclassification of the critical signal related to ventricular tachycardia very efficiently.

However, the GAN often tends to generate images with high frequency details being inconsistent with the real ones. Inspired by conventional detail enhancement algorithms, we propose a novel prior knowledge, the detail prior, to assist the GAN in alleviating this problem and restoring more realistic details. The proposed method, named DSRGAN, includes a well designed detail extraction algorithm to capture the most important high frequency information from images. Then, two discriminators are utilized for supervision on image-domain and detail-domain restorations, respectively. The DSRGAN merges the restored detail into the final output via a detail enhancement manner. The special design of DSRGAN takes advantages from both the model-based conventional algorithm and the data-driven deep learning network. Experimental results demonstrate that the DSRGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art SISR methods on perceptual metrics and achieves comparable results in terms of fidelity metrics simultaneously. Following the DSRGAN, it is feasible to incorporate other conventional image processing algorithms into a deep learning network to form a model-based deep SISR. ",

Thus, in contrast to the majority of existing methods, FRSD does not employ a gradient tracking technique, rather it uses a novel momentum term. Under the assumption that each node-specific function is smooth and strongly convex, we show that FRSD admits constant step-size and momentum parameters such that the iterate sequence converges linearly to the optimal consensus solution. In the numerical tests, we compare FRSD with other state-of-the-art methods, which use row-stochastic and/or column-stochastic weights. ",

Existing neural hybrid video coding approaches rely on optical flow or Gaussian-scale flow for prediction, which cannot support fine-grained adaptation to diverse motion content. Towards more content-adaptive prediction, we propose a novel cross-scale prediction module that achieves more effective motion compensation. Specifically, on the one hand, we produce a reference feature pyramid as prediction sources, then transmit cross-scale flows that leverage the feature scale to control the precision of prediction. On the other hand, we introduce the mechanism of weighted prediction into the scenario of prediction with a single reference frame, where cross-scale weight maps are transmitted to synthesize a fine prediction result. In addition to the cross-scale prediction module, we further propose a multi-stage quantization strategy, which improves the rate-distortion performance with no extra computational penalty during inference. We show the encouraging performance of our efficient neural video codec (ENVC) on several common benchmark datasets and analyze in detail the effectiveness of every important component. ",

    "abstract": "We derive general, yet simple, sharp bounds on the size of the omitted variable bias for a broad class of causal parameters that can be identified as linear functionals of the conditional expectation function of the outcome. Such functionals encompass many of the traditional targets of investigation in causal inference studies, such as, for example, (weighted) average of potential outcomes, average treatment effects (including subgroup effects, such as the effect on the treated), (weighted) average derivatives, and policy effects from shifts in covariate distribution -- all for general, nonparametric causal models. Our construction relies on the Riesz-Frechet representation of the target functional. Specifically, we show how the bound on the bias depends only on the additional variation that the latent variables create both in the outcome and in the Riesz representer for the parameter of interest. Moreover, in many important cases (e.g, average treatment effects in partially linear models, or in nonseparable models with a binary treatment) the bound is shown to depend on two easily interpretable quantities: the nonparametric partial $R^2$ (Pearson's \"correlation ratio\") of the unobserved variables with the treatment and with the outcome. Therefore, simple plausibility judgments on the maximum explanatory power of omitted variables (in explaining treatment and outcome variation) are sufficient to place overall bounds on the size of the bias. Finally, leveraging debiased machine learning, we provide flexible and efficient statistical inference methods to estimate the components of the bounds that are identifiable from the observed distribution.

Cancer survival rate of lung cancer is only 19%. There are various methods for the diagnosis of lung cancer, such as X-ray, CT scan, PET-CT scan, bronchoscopy and biopsy. However, to know the subtype of lung cancer based on the tissue type H and E staining is widely used, where the staining is done on the tissue aspirated from a biopsy. Studies have reported that the type of histology is associated with prognosis and treatment in lung cancer. Therefore, early and accurate detection of lung cancer histology is an urgent need and as its treatment is dependent on the type of histology, molecular profile and stage of the disease, it is most essential to analyse the histopathology images of lung cancer. Hence, to speed up the vital process of diagnosis of lung cancer and reduce the burden on pathologists, Deep learning techniques are used. These techniques have shown improved efficacy in the analysis of histopathology slides of cancer. Several studies reported the importance of convolution neural networks (CNN) in the classification of histopathological pictures of various cancer types such as brain, skin, breast, lung, colorectal cancer. In this study tri-category classification of lung cancer images (normal, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) are carried out by using ResNet 50, VGG-19, Inception_ResNet_V2 and DenseNet for the feature extraction and triplet loss to guide the CNN such that it increases inter-cluster distance and reduces intra-cluster distance.
