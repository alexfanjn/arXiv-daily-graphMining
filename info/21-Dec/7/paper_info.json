A simple siamese network with different backbones is used in order to maximize the similarity of two augmented transformed images from the same source image. In this way, the backbone is able to learn visual information without supervision. Finally, the method is evaluated on three image recognition datasets. ",

    "abstract": "The design of robust supply and distribution systems is one of the fundamental challenges at the interface of network science and logistics. Given the multitude of performance criteria, real-world constraints, and external influences acting upon such a system, even formulating an appropriate research question to address this topic is non-trivial. Here we present an abstraction of a supply and distribution system leading to a minimal model, which only retains stylized facts of the systemic function and, in this way, allows us to investigate the generic properties of robust supply networks. On this level of abstraction, a supply and distribution system is the strategic use of transportation to eliminate mismatches between production patterns (i.e., the amounts of goods produced at each production site of a company) and demand patterns (i.e., the amount of goods consumed at each location). When creating networks based on this paradigm and furthermore requiring the robustness of the system with respect to the loss of transportation routes (edge of the network) we see that robust networks are built from specific sets of subgraphs, while vulnerable networks display a markedly different subgraph composition. Our findings confirm a long-standing hypothesis in the field of network science, namely, that network motifs -- statistically over-represented small subgraphs -- are informative about the robust functioning of a network. Also, our findings offer a blueprint for enhancing the robustness of real-world supply and distribution systems. ",

    "abstract": "Embedding real-world networks presents challenges because it is not clear how to identify their latent geometries. Embedding some disassortative networks, such as scale-free networks, to the Euclidean space has been shown to incur distortions. Embedding scale-free networks to hyperbolic spaces offer an exciting alternative but incurs distortions when embedding assortative networks with latent geometries not hyperbolic. We propose an inductive model that leverages both the expressiveness of GCNs and trivial bundle to learn inductive node representations for networks with or without node features. A trivial bundle is a simple case of fiber bundles,a space that is globally a product space of its base space and fiber. The coordinates of base space and those of fiber can be used to express the assortative and disassortative factors in generating edges. Therefore, the model has the ability to learn embeddings that can express those factors. In practice, it reduces errors for link prediction and node classification when compared to the Euclidean and hyperbolic GCNs. ",

    "abstract": "The stability and ability of an ecosystem to withstand climate change is directly linked to its biodiversity. Dead trees are a key indicator of overall forest health, housing one-third of forest ecosystem biodiversity, and constitute 8%of the global carbon stocks. They are decomposed by several natural factors, e.g. climate, insects and fungi. Accurate detection and modeling of dead wood mass is paramount to understanding forest ecology, the carbon cycle and decomposers. We present a novel method to construct precise shape contours of dead trees from aerial photographs by combining established convolutional neural networks with a novel active contour model in an energy minimization framework. Our approach yields superior performance accuracy over state-of-the-art in terms of precision, recall, and intersection over union of detected dead trees. This improved performance is essential to meet emerging challenges caused by climate change (and other man-made perturbations to the systems), particularly to monitor and estimate carbon stock decay rates, monitor forest health and biodiversity, and the overall effects of dead wood on and from climate change.

    "abstract": "Grasping objects intelligently is a challenging task even for humans and we spend a considerable amount of time during our childhood to learn how to grasp objects correctly. In the case of robots, we can not afford to spend that much time on making it to learn how to grasp objects effectively. Therefore, in the present research we propose an efficient learning architecture based on VQVAE so that robots can be taught with sufficient data corresponding to correct grasping. However, getting sufficient labelled data is extremely difficult in the robot grasping domain. To help solve this problem, a semi-supervised learning based model which has much more generalization capability even with limited labelled data set, has been investigated. Its performance shows 6\\% improvement when compared with existing state-of-the-art models including our earlier model. During experimentation, It has been observed that our proposed model, RGGCNN2, performs significantly better, both in grasping isolated objects as well as objects in a cluttered environment, compared to the existing approaches which do not use unlabelled data for generating grasping rectangles. To the best of our knowledge, developing an intelligent robot grasping model (based on semi-supervised learning) trained through representation learning and exploiting the high-quality learning ability of GGCNN2 architecture with the limited number of labelled dataset together with the learned latent embeddings, can be used as a de-facto training method which has been established and also validated in this paper through rigorous hardware experimentations using Baxter (Anukul) research robot.

We show a complete set of results on the novelties of this complex complementing those of D. A. Di Pietro and J.

We use our new complex on the Stokes system and validate the expected convergence rates with various numerical tests. ",

    "abstract": "Recent works suggest that striking a balance between maximizing idea stimulation and minimizing idea redundancy can elevate creativity in self-organizing social networks. We explore whether dispersing the visibility of idea generators can help achieve such a trade-off. We employ popularity signals (follower counts) of participants as an external source of variation in network structures, which we control across four randomized study conditions. We observe that popularity signals influence inspiration-seeking ties, partly by biasing people's perception of their peers' creativity. Networks that partially disperse the ideators' visibility using this external signal show reduced idea-redundancy and elevated creativity. However, extreme dispersal leads to inferior creativity by narrowing the range of idea stimulation. Our work holds future-of-work implications for elevating creativity. ",

However, the sequence between two $k$-colorings that arises from the proof may be exponential in the number of vertices. An intriguing open question is whether it can be turned polynomial. We prove this to be possible under the stronger assumption that the graph has treewidth at most $k-1$. Namely, any two $k$-colorings are equivalent up to $O(kn^2)$ Kempe changes. We investigate other restrictions (list coloring, bounded maximum average degree, degree bounds). As a main result, we derive that given an $n$-vertex graph with maximum degree $\\Delta$, the $\\Delta$-colorings are all equivalent up to $O(n^2)$ Kempe changes, unless $\\Delta = 3$ and some connected component is a 3-prism.

While recent work demonstrated that neural networks with random weights produce compelling audio effects, control of these effects is limited and unintuitive. To address this, we introduce a method for the steerable discovery of neural audio effects. This method enables the design of effects using example recordings provided by the user. We demonstrate how this method produces an effect similar to the target effect, along with interesting inaccuracies, while also providing perceptually relevant controls. ",

Online FDRC rules allow to control the properties of a sequence of statistical tests. In the context of anomaly detection, the null hypothesis is that an observation is normal and the alternative is that it is anomalous. FDRC rules allow users to target a lower bound on precision in unsupervised settings. The methods proposed in this article overcome short-comings of previous FDRC rules in the context of anomaly detection, in particular ensuring that power remains high even when the alternative is exceedingly rare (typical in anomaly detection) and the test statistics are serially dependent (typical in time series). We show the soundness of these rules in both theory and experiments. ",
