    "title": "MIST-net: Multi-domain Integrative Swin Transformer network for  Sparse-View CT Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "The deep learning-based tomographic image reconstruction have been attracting much attention among these years. The sparse-view data reconstruction is one of typical underdetermined inverse problems, how to reconstruct high-quality CT images from dozens of projections is still a challenge in practice. To address this challenge, in this article we proposed a Multi-domain Integrative Swin Transformer network (MIST-net). First, the proposed MIST-net incorporated lavish domain features from data, residual-data, image, and residual-image using flexible network architectures. Here, the residual-data and residual-image domains network components can be considered as the data consistency module to eliminate interpolation errors in both residual data and image domains, and then further retain image details. Second, to detect the image features and further protect image edge, the trainable Sobel Filter was incorporated into the network to improve the encode-decode ability. Third, with the classical Swin transformer, we further designed the high-quality reconstruction transformer (i.e., Recformer) to improve the reconstruction performance. The Recformer inherited the power of Swin transformer to capture the global and local features of the reconstructed image. The experiments on the numerical datasets with 48 views demonstrated our proposed MIST-net provided higher reconstructed image quality with small feature recovery and edge protection than other competitors including the advanced unrolled networks. The quantitative results show that our MIST-net also obtained the best performance. The trained network was transferred to the real cardiac CT dataset with 48 views, the reconstruction results further validated the advantages of our MIST-net and further demonstrated the good robustness of our MIST in clinical applications.

    "abstract": "We describe Countersynth, a conditional generative model of diffeomorphic deformations that induce label-driven, biologically plausible changes in volumetric brain images. The model is intended to synthesise counterfactual training data augmentations for downstream discriminative modelling tasks where fidelity is limited by data imbalance, distributional instability, confounding, or underspecification, and exhibits inequitable performance across distinct subpopulations. Focusing on demographic attributes, we evaluate the quality of synthesized counterfactuals with voxel-based morphometry, classification and regression of the conditioning attributes, and the Fr\\'{e}chet inception distance. Examining downstream discriminative performance in the context of engineered demographic imbalance and confounding, we use UK Biobank magnetic resonance imaging data to benchmark CounterSynth augmentation against current solutions to these problems. We achieve state-of-the-art improvements, both in overall fidelity and equity. The source code for CounterSynth is available online. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning-based data-driven modeling can be computationally efficient solutions of time-dependent subsurface geophysical systems. In this work, our previous approach of conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) developed for steady-state problems with heterogeneous materials is extended to time-dependent problems by adopting the concept of continuous cGAN (CcGAN). The CcGAN that can condition continuous variables in the cGAN framework is developed to incorporate the time domain through either element-wise addition or conditional batch normalization. As a demonstration case, the transient response of the coupled poroelastic process is studied in two different permeability fields: Zinn \\& Harvey transformation and a bimodal transformation. The proposed CcGAN uses heterogeneous permeability fields as input parameters while pressure and displacement fields over time are model output. Our results show that the model provides sufficient accuracy with computational speed-up. This robust framework will enable us to perform real-time reservoir management and robust uncertainty quantification in realistic problems. ",

    "abstract": "As social interactions are increasingly taking place in the digital environment, online friendship and its effects on various life outcomes from health to happiness attract growing research attention. In most studies, online ties are treated as representing a single type of relationship. However, our online friendship networks are not homogeneous and could include close connections, e.g. a partner, as well as people we have never met in person. In this paper, we investigate the potentially differential effects of online friendship ties on mental health. Using data from a Russian panel study (N = 4,400), we find that - consistently with previous research - the number of online friends correlates with depression symptoms. However, this is true only for networks that do not exceed Dunbar's number in size (N <= 150) and only for core but not peripheral nodes of a friendship network. The findings suggest that online friendship could encode different types of social relationships that should be treated separately while investigating the association between online social integration and life outcomes, in particular well-being or mental health.

    "abstract": "Due to the diffusion of IoT, modern software systems are often thought to control and coordinate smart devices in order to manage assets and resources, and to guarantee efficient behaviours. For this class of systems, which interact extensively with humans and with their environment, it is thus crucial to guarantee their correct behaviour in order to avoid unexpected and possibly dangerous situations. In this paper we will present a framework that allows us to measure the robustness of systems. This is the ability of a program to tolerate changes in the environmental conditions and preserving the original behaviour. In the proposed framework, the interaction of a program with its environment is represented as a sequence of random variables describing how both evolve in time. For this reason, the considered measures will be defined among probability distributions of observed data. The proposed framework will be then used to define the notions of adaptability and reliability. The former indicates the ability of a program to absorb perturbation on environmental conditions after a given amount of time. The latter expresses the ability of a program to maintain its intended behaviour (up-to some reasonable tolerance) despite the presence of perturbations in the environment. Moreover, an algorithm, based on statistical inference, it proposed to evaluate the proposed metric and the aforementioned properties. Throughout the paper, two case studies are used to the describe and evaluate the proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "The Electric Vehicle (EV) Industry has seen extraordinary growth in the last few years. This is primarily due to an ever increasing awareness of the detrimental environmental effects of fossil fuel powered vehicles and availability of inexpensive Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In order to safely deploy these LIBs in Electric Vehicles, certain battery states need to be constantly monitored to ensure safe and healthy operation. The use of Machine Learning to estimate battery states such as State-of-Charge and State-of-Health have become an extremely active area of research. However, limited availability of open-source diverse datasets has stifled the growth of this field, and is a problem largely ignored in literature. In this work, we propose a novel method of time-series battery data augmentation using deep neural networks. We introduce and analyze the method of using two neural networks working together to alternatively produce synthetic charging and discharging battery profiles. One model produces battery charging profiles, and another produces battery discharging profiles. The proposed approach is evaluated using few public battery datasets to illustrate its effectiveness, and our results show the efficacy of this approach to solve the challenges of limited battery data. We also test this approach on dynamic Electric Vehicle drive cycles as well. ",

Technologies such as infotainment systems and companion mobile applications collect a variety of personal data from drivers to enhance the user experience. This paper investigates the extent to which car drivers understand the implications for their privacy, including that car manufacturers must treat that data in compliance with the relevant regulations. It does so by distilling out drivers' concerns on privacy and relating them to their perceptions of trust on car cyber-security. A questionnaire is designed for such purposes to collect answers from a set of 1101 participants, so that the results are statistically relevant. In short, privacy concerns are modest, perhaps because there still is insufficient general awareness on the personal data that are involved, both for in-vehicle treatment and for transmission over the Internet. Trust perceptions on cyber-security are modest too (lower than those on car safety), a surprising contradiction to our research hypothesis that privacy concerns and trust perceptions on car cyber-security are opponent. We interpret this as a clear demand for information and awareness-building campaigns for car drivers, as well as for technical cyber-security and privacy measures that are truly considerate of the human factor.

This result is obtained by constructing a class of critical embeddings which map any critical point of a narrower NN to a critical point of the target NN with the same output function. By discovering a wide class of general compatible critical embeddings, we provide a gross estimate of the dimension of critical submanifolds embedded from critical points of narrower NNs. We further prove an irreversiblility property of any critical embedding that the number of negative/zero/positive eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of a critical point may increase but never decrease as an NN becomes wider through the embedding. Using a special realization of general compatible critical embedding, we prove a stringent necessary condition for being a \"truly-bad\" critical point that never becomes a strict-saddle point through any critical embedding. This result implies the commonplace of strict-saddle points in wide NNs, which may be an important reason underlying the easy optimization of wide NNs widely observed in practice. ",

    "abstract": "We developed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to rapidly and directly infer the planet mass from radio dust continuum images. Substructures induced by young planets in protoplanetary disks can be used to infer the potential young planets' properties. Hydrodynamical simulations have been used to study the relationships between the planet's properties and these disk features. However, these attempts either fine-tuned numerical simulations to fit one protoplanetary disk at a time, which was time-consuming, or azimuthally averaged simulation results to derive some linear relationships between the gap width/depth and the planet mass, which lost information on asymmetric features in disks. To cope with these disadvantages, we developed Planet Gap neural Networks (PGNets) to infer the planet mass from 2D images. We first fit the gridded data in Zhang et al. (2018) as a classification problem. Then, we quadrupled the data set by running additional simulations with near-randomly sampled parameters, and derived the planet mass and disk viscosity together as a regression problem. The classification approach can reach an accuracy of 92\\%, whereas the regression approach can reach 1$\\sigma$ as 0.16 dex for planet mass and 0.23 dex for disk viscosity. We can reproduce the degeneracy scaling $\\alpha$ $\\propto$ $M_p^3$ found in the linear fitting method, which means that the CNN method can even be used to find degeneracy relationship. The gradient-weighted class activation mapping effectively confirms that PGNets use proper disk features to constrain the planet mass. We provide programs for PGNets and the traditional fitting method from Zhang et al. (2018), and discuss each method's advantages and disadvantages. ",

    "abstract": "Logistic regression is a widely used statistical model to describe the relationship between a binary response variable and predictor variables in data sets. It is often used in machine learning to identify important predictor variables. This task, variable selection, typically amounts to fitting a logistic regression model regularized by a convex combination of $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_{2}^{2}$ penalties. Since modern big data sets can contain hundreds of thousands to billions of predictor variables, variable selection methods depend on efficient and robust optimization algorithms to perform well. State-of-the-art algorithms for variable selection, however, were not traditionally designed to handle big data sets; they either scale poorly in size or are prone to produce unreliable numerical results. It therefore remains challenging to perform variable selection on big data sets without access to adequate and costly computational resources. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear primal-dual algorithm that addresses these shortcomings. Specifically, we propose an iterative algorithm that provably computes a solution to a logistic regression problem regularized by an elastic net penalty in $O(T(m,n)\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ operations, where $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$ denotes the tolerance and $T(m,n)$ denotes the number of arithmetic operations required to perform matrix-vector multiplication on a data set with $m$ samples each comprising $n$ features. This result improves on the known complexity bound of $O(\\min(m^2n,mn^2)\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ for first-order optimization methods such as the classic primal-dual hybrid gradient or forward-backward splitting methods.

Doing so would allow fast high-quality imaging of anatomy and pathology. Data Consistency (DC) is crucial for generalization in multi-modal data and robustness in detecting pathology. This work proposes the Cascades of Independently Recurrent Inference Machines (CIRIM) to assess DC through unrolled optimization, implicitly by gradient descent and explicitly by a designed term. We perform extensive comparison of the CIRIM to other unrolled optimization methods, being the End-to-End Variational Network (E2EVN) and the RIM, and to the UNet and Compressed Sensing (CS). Evaluation is done in two stages. Firstly, learning on multiple trained MRI modalities is assessed, i.e., brain data with ${T_1}$-weighting and FLAIR contrast, and ${T_2}$-weighted knee data. Secondly, robustness is tested on reconstructing pathology through white matter lesions in 3D FLAIR MRI data of relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Results show that the CIRIM performs best when implicitly enforcing DC, while the E2EVN requires explicitly formulated DC. The CIRIM shows the highest lesion contrast resolution in reconstructing the clinical MS data.

    "abstract": "Parameter identification for marine ecosystem models is important for the assessment and validation of marine ecosystem models against observational data. The surrogate-based optimization (SBO) is a computationally efficient method to optimize complex models. SBO replaces the computationally expensive (high-fidelity) model by a surrogate constructed from a less accurate but computationally cheaper (low-fidelity) model in combination with an appropriate correction approach, which improves the accuracy of the low-fidelity model. To construct a computationally cheap low-fidelity model, we tested three different approaches to compute an approximation of the annual periodic solution (i.e., a steady annual cycle) of a marine ecosystem model: firstly, a reduced number of spin-up iterations (several decades instead of millennia), secondly, an artificial neural network (ANN) approximating the steady annual cycle and, finally, a combination of both approaches. Except for the low-fidelity model using only the ANN, the SBO yielded a solution close to the target and reduced the computational effort significantly. If an ANN approximating appropriately a marine ecosystem model is available, the SBO using this ANN as low-fidelity model presents a promising and computational efficient method for the validation.
