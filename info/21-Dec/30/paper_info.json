    "abstract": "Global food insecurity is expected to worsen in the coming decades with the accelerated rate of climate change and the rapidly increasing population. In this vein, it is important to remove inefficiencies at every level of food production. The recent advances in deep learning can help reduce such inefficiencies, yet their application has not yet become mainstream throughout the industry, inducing economic costs at a massive scale. To this point, modern techniques such as CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) have been applied to RPQD (Raw Produce Quality Detection) tasks. On the other hand, Transformer's successful debut in the vision among other modalities led us to expect a better performance with these Transformer-based models in RPQD. In this work, we exclusively investigate the recent state-of-the-art Swin (Shifted Windows) Transformer which computes self-attention in both intra- and inter-window fashion. We compare Swin Transformer against CNN models on four RPQD image datasets, each containing different kinds of raw produce: fruits and vegetables, fish, pork, and beef. We observe that Swin Transformer not only achieves better or competitive performance but also is data- and compute-efficient, making it ideal for actual deployment in real-world setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale empirical study on RPQD task, which we hope will gain more attention in future works. ",

    "abstract": "Personal Social Ontology (PSO), it is proposed, is how an individual perceives the ontological properties of terms. For example, an absolute fatalist would arguably use terms that remove any form of agency from a person. Such fatalism has the impact of ontologically defining acts such as winning, victory and success, for example, in a manner that is contrary to how a non-fatalist would ontologically define them. While both a fatalist and non-fatalist would agree on the dictionary definition of these terms, they would differ on what and how they can be caused. This difference between the two individuals, it is argued, can be induced from the co-occurrence of terms used by each individual. That such co-occurrence carries an implied social ontology, one that is specific to that person. The use of principal social perceptions -as evidenced by the social psychology and social neuroscience literature, is put forward as a viable method to feature engineer such texts. With the natural language characterisation of these features, they are then usable in machine learning pipelines. ",

    "abstract": "In principle, sparse neural networks should be significantly more efficient than traditional dense networks. Neurons in the brain exhibit two types of sparsity; they are sparsely interconnected and sparsely active. These two types of sparsity, called weight sparsity and activation sparsity, when combined, offer the potential to reduce the computational cost of neural networks by two orders of magnitude. Despite this potential, today's neural networks deliver only modest performance benefits using just weight sparsity, because traditional computing hardware cannot efficiently process sparse networks. In this article we introduce Complementary Sparsity, a novel technique that significantly improves the performance of dual sparse networks on existing hardware. We demonstrate that we can achieve high performance running weight-sparse networks, and we can multiply those speedups by incorporating activation sparsity. Using Complementary Sparsity, we show up to 100X improvement in throughput and energy efficiency performing inference on FPGAs. We analyze scalability and resource tradeoffs for a variety of kernels typical of commercial convolutional networks such as ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2. Our results with Complementary Sparsity suggest that weight plus activation sparsity can be a potent combination for efficiently scaling future AI models. ",

    "abstract": "Social media content routinely incorporates multi-modal design to covey information and shape meanings, and sway interpretations toward desirable implications, but the choices and outcomes of using both texts and visual images have not been sufficiently studied. This work proposes a computational approach to analyze the outcome of persuasive information in multi-modal content, focusing on two aspects, popularity and reliability, in COVID-19-related news articles shared on Twitter. The two aspects are intertwined in the spread of misinformation: for example, an unreliable article that aims to misinform has to attain some popularity. This work has several contributions. First, we propose a multi-modal (image and text) approach to effectively identify popularity and reliability of information sources simultaneously. Second, we identify textual and visual elements that are predictive to information popularity and reliability. Third, by modeling cross-modal relations and similarity, we are able to uncover how unreliable articles construct multi-modal meaning in a distorted, biased fashion. Our work demonstrates how to use multi-modal analysis for understanding influential content and has implications to social media literacy and engagement. ",

Recent advancements in FL use predefined architecture-based learning for all the clients. However, given that clients' data are invisible to the server and data distributions are non-identical across clients, a predefined architecture discovered in a centralized setting may not be an optimal solution for all the clients in FL. Motivated by this challenge, in this work, we introduce SPIDER, an algorithmic framework that aims to Search Personalized neural architecture for federated learning. SPIDER is designed based on two unique features: (1) alternately optimizing one architecture-homogeneous global model (Supernet) in a generic FL manner and one architecture-heterogeneous local model that is connected to the global model by weight sharing-based regularization (2) achieving architecture-heterogeneous local model by a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method that can select optimal subnet progressively using operation-level perturbation on the accuracy value as the criterion. Experimental results demonstrate that SPIDER outperforms other state-of-the-art personalization methods, and the searched personalized architectures are more inference efficient. ",

We introduce a decentralized data governance framework based on blockchain technology and proxy re-encryption to let data owners control and track their data through privacy-enhancing and consent management mechanisms. Besides, our framework allows the data consumers to understand data lineage through a blockchain-based provenance mechanism. We have used Digital e-prescription as the use case since it has multiple stakeholders and sensitive data while enabling the medical fraternity to manage patients' prescription data, involving patients as data owners, doctors and pharmacists as data consumers.

However, its effect on graph neural networks is less than satisfactory since the graph topology and node attributes are likely to change in a dynamic way and in this case a static teacher model is insufficient in guiding student training. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by simultaneously training a group of graph neural networks in an online distillation fashion, where the group knowledge plays a role as a dynamic virtual teacher and the structure changes in graph neural networks are effectively captured. To improve the distillation performance, two types of knowledge are transferred among the students to enhance each other: local knowledge reflecting information in the graph topology and node attributes, and global knowledge reflecting the prediction over classes. We transfer the global knowledge with KL-divergence as the vanilla knowledge distillation does, while exploiting the complicated structure of the local knowledge with an efficient adversarial cyclic learning framework. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of our proposed online adversarial distillation approach. ",

    "abstract": "Solar energy is now the cheapest form of electricity in history. Unfortunately, significantly increasing the grid's fraction of solar energy remains challenging due to its variability, which makes balancing electricity's supply and demand more difficult. While thermal generators' ramp rate -- the maximum rate that they can change their output -- is finite, solar's ramp rate is essentially infinite. Thus, accurate near-term solar forecasting, or nowcasting, is important to provide advance warning to adjust thermal generator output in response to solar variations to ensure a balanced supply and demand. To address the problem, this paper develops a general model for solar nowcasting from abundant and readily available multispectral satellite data using self-supervised learning. Specifically, we develop deep auto-regressive models using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) that are globally trained across multiple locations to predict raw future observations of the spatio-temporal data collected by the recently launched GOES-R series of satellites. Our model estimates a location's future solar irradiance based on satellite observations, which we feed to a regression model trained on smaller site-specific solar data to provide near-term solar photovoltaic (PV) forecasts that account for site-specific characteristics. We evaluate our approach for different coverage areas and forecast horizons across 25 solar sites and show that our approach yields errors close to that of a model using ground-truth observations. ",

The key challenge lies in finding effective ways to exploit the spatio-temporal context of past frames to help learn discriminative target representation of current frame. In this paper, we propose a novel Siamese network with a specifically designed interactive transformer, called SITVOS, to enable effective context propagation from historical to current frames. Technically, we use the transformer encoder and decoder to handle the past frames and current frame separately, i.e., the encoder encodes robust spatio-temporal context of target object from the past frames, while the decoder takes the feature embedding of current frame as the query to retrieve the target from the encoder output. To further enhance the target representation, a feature interaction module (FIM) is devised to promote the information flow between the encoder and decoder. Moreover, we employ the Siamese architecture to extract backbone features of both past and current frames, which enables feature reuse and is more efficient than existing methods. Experimental results on three challenging benchmarks validate the superiority of SITVOS over state-of-the-art methods. ",

This observation motivates us to improve the attention of adversarial images by considering their clean counterparts. To accomplish this, we introduce Associative Adversarial Learning (AAL) into adversarial learning to guide a selective attack. We formulate the intrinsic relationship between attention and attack (perturbation) as a coupling optimization problem to improve their interaction. This leads to an attention backtracking algorithm that can effectively enhance the attention's adversarial robustness. Our method is generic and can be used to address a variety of tasks by simply choosing different kernels for the associative attention that select other regions for a specific attack. Experimental results show that the selective attack improves the model's performance. We show that our method improves the recognition accuracy of adversarial training on ImageNet by 8.32% compared with the baseline. It also increases object detection mAP on PascalVOC by 2.02% and recognition accuracy of few-shot learning on miniImageNet by 1.63%. ",

However, existing privacy regulations and policies only provide high-level principles which are difficult for software engineers to design and implement privacy-aware systems.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an analytical voltage estimation method for the power packet dispatching network. A unit power packet consists of signals and DC pulsed voltage waveform. In the network, power packets are transmitted among power packet routers (routers) by time-division multiplexing. Routers have capacitors as the storage of power during the power transmission. The power flows depending on the voltage gradient among the storage. The power flow in the network has been studied with numerical approaches. However, the existing studies have considered transmission losses but ignored transient responses. Considering transient responses, the power transmission analysis generally requires circuit simulation and takes considerable time. This paper focuses on a one-to-one connection between routers and underdamped conditions. They allow the estimation of storage voltages considering the transient responses without circuit simulation. First, theoretical analysis and experimental verification are performed on the conditions. Then, an analytical voltage estimation method is proposed by expanding the analysis of the one-to-one connection to the network. Comparison with circuit simulation reveals that the estimation method is accurate enough to analyze power transmission in the network. ",

    "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a fundamental step for many tasks. In this paper, we propose a neural network named DetarNet to decouple the translation $t$ and rotation $R$, so as to overcome the performance degradation due to their mutual interference in point cloud registration. First, a Siamese Network based Progressive and Coherent Feature Drift (PCFD) module is proposed to align the source and target points in high-dimensional feature space, and accurately recover translation from the alignment process. Then we propose a Consensus Encoding Unit (CEU) to construct more distinguishable features for a set of putative correspondences. After that, a Spatial and Channel Attention (SCA) block is adopted to build a classification network for finding good correspondences. Finally, the rotation is obtained by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In this way, the proposed network decouples the estimation of translation and rotation, resulting in better performance for both of them. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DetarNet improves registration performance on both indoor and outdoor scenes.

The results show that DP-SGD performs better than the PATE framework in financial trading data. The tradeoff between privacy and accuracy is low in DP-SGD.

This operation can effortlessly invalidate the ownership proof and escape copyright regulations. To enhance the robustness of white-box DNN watermarking schemes, this paper presents a procedure that aligns neurons into the same order as when the watermark is embedded, so the watermark can be correctly recognized.

In parallel, the ability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to learn across a range of tasks and domains, combining and re-using learned representations where required, is a clear goal of artificial intelligence. This capacity, widely described as continual learning, has become a prolific subfield of research in machine learning. Despite the numerous successes of deep learning in recent years, across domains ranging from image recognition to machine translation, such continual task learning has proved challenging. Neural networks trained on multiple tasks in sequence with stochastic gradient descent often suffer from representational interference, whereby the learned weights for a given task effectively overwrite those of previous tasks in a process termed catastrophic forgetting. This represents a major impediment to the development of more generalised artificial learning systems, capable of accumulating knowledge over time and task space, in a manner analogous to humans.

This class of matrices make possible to perform signal recovery with lower storage costs and faster decoding algorithms. In particular, random matrices formed by i.i.d Bernoulli $p$ random variables are of practical relevance in the context of nonnegative sparse recovery. In this work, we investigate the robust nullspace property of sparse Bernoulli $p$ matrices. Previous results in the literature establish that such matrices can accurately recover $n$-dimensional $s$-sparse vectors with $m=O\\left (\\frac{s}{c(p)}\\log\\frac{en}{s}\\right )$ measurements, where $c(p) \\le p$ is a constant that only depends on the parameter $p$. These results suggest that, when $p$ vanishes, the sparse Bernoulli matrix requires considerably more measurements than the minimal necessary achieved by the standard isotropic subgaussian designs. We show that this is not true. Our main result characterizes, for a wide range of levels sparsity $s$, the smallest $p$ such that it is possible to perform sparse recovery with the minimal number of measurements.

Additionally, several related variables restricting the SP of the STDT are discussed, and specific schemes are presented to enhance the SP.

In this paper, we examine the trends in how Android apps have changed over time with respect to privacy and look at it from two perspectives: (1) how privacy behavior in apps have changed as they are updated over time, (2) how these changes can be accounted for when comparing third-party libraries and the app's own internals. To study this, we examine the adoption of HTTPS, whether apps scan the device for other installed apps, the use of permissions for privacy-sensitive data, and the use of unique identifiers. We find that privacy-related behavior has improved with time as apps continue to receive updates, and that the third-party libraries used by apps are responsible for more issues with privacy. However, we observe that in the current state of Android apps, there has not been enough of an improvement in terms of privacy and many issues still need to be addressed. ",

This paper investigates the grant-free NC-IM combined with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based massive IoT access. Specifically, each device is assigned a unique non-orthogonal signature sequence codebook. Each active device transmits one of its signature sequences in the given time-frequency resources, by modulating the information in the index of the transmitted signature sequence. For small-scale MIMO equipped at the UAV-based aerial base station (BS), by jointly exploiting the space-time-frequency domain device activity, we propose a computationally efficient space-time-frequency joint activity and blind information detection (JABID) algorithm with significantly improved detection performance. Furthermore, for large-scale MIMO equipped at the aerial BS, by leveraging the sparsity of the virtual angular-domain channels, we propose an angular-domain based JABID algorithm for improving the system performance with reduced access latency. In addition, for the case of high mobility IoT devices and/or UAVs, we introduce a time-frequency spread transmission (TFST) strategy for the proposed JABID algorithms to combat doubly-selective fading channels. Finally, extensive simulation results are illustrated to verify the superiority of our proposed algorithms and the TFST strategy over known state-of-the-art algorithms. ",

First, we propose a new loss function that explicitly captures the goal of targeted attacks, in particular, by using the logits of all classes instead of just a subset, as is common. We show that Auto-PGD with this loss function finds more adversarial examples than it does with other commonly used loss functions. Second, we propose a new attack method that uses a further developed version of our loss function capturing both the misclassification objective and the $L_{\\infty}$ distance limit $\\epsilon$. This new attack method is relatively 1.5--4.2% more successful on the CIFAR10 dataset and relatively 8.2--14.9% more successful on the ImageNet dataset, than the next best state-of-the-art attack.

As a representative work, the adaptive focus method (AdaFocus) has achieved a favorable trade-off between accuracy and inference speed by dynamically identifying and attending to the informative regions in each video frame. However, AdaFocus requires a complicated three-stage training pipeline (involving reinforcement learning), leading to slow convergence and is unfriendly to practitioners. This work reformulates the training of AdaFocus as a simple one-stage algorithm by introducing a differentiable interpolation-based patch selection operation, enabling efficient end-to-end optimization. We further present an improved training scheme to address the issues introduced by the one-stage formulation, including the lack of supervision, input diversity and training stability. Moreover, a conditional-exit technique is proposed to perform temporal adaptive computation on top of AdaFocus without additional training. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets (i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&V2, and Jester) demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the original AdaFocus and other competitive baselines, while being considerably more simple and efficient to train.

In this paper, we propose a novel Label-wise clustering algorithm that guarantees the trainability among geographically dispersed heterogeneous local clients, by selecting only the local models trained with a dataset that approximates into uniformly distributed class labels, which is likely to obtain faster minimization of the loss and increment the accuracy among the FL network. Through conducting experiments on the suggested six common non-IID scenarios, we empirically show that the vanilla FL aggregation model is incapable of gaining robust convergence generating biased pre-trained local models and drifting the local weights to mislead the trainability in the worst case. Moreover, we quantitatively estimate the expected performance of the local models before training, which offers a global server to select the optimal clients, saving additional computational costs. Ultimately, in order to gain resolution of the non-convergence in such non-IID situations, we design clustering algorithms based on local input class labels, accommodating the diversity and assorting clients that could lead the overall system to attain the swift convergence as global training continues. Our paper shows that proposed Label-wise clustering demonstrates prompt and robust convergence compared to other FL algorithms when local training datasets are non-IID or coexist with IID through multiple experiments.

Hence, this paper proposes a novel session-based recommendation system empowered by hypergraph attention networks. Three unique properties of the proposed approach are: (i) it constructs a hypergraph for each session to model the item correlations defined by various contextual windows in the session simultaneously, to uncover item meanings; (ii) it is equipped with hypergraph attention layers to generate item embeddings by flexibly aggregating the contextual information from correlated items in the session; and (iii) it aggregates the dynamic item representations for each session to infer the general purpose and current need, which is decoded to infer the next interesting item in the session.

Given the increased adoption of supervised deep learning methods for processing and analysis of cosmological survey data, the assessment of data perturbation effects and the development of methods that increase model robustness are increasingly important. In the context of morphological classification of galaxies, we study the effects of perturbations in imaging data. In particular, we examine the consequences of using neural networks when training on baseline data and testing on perturbed data. We consider perturbations associated with two primary sources: 1) increased observational noise as represented by higher levels of Poisson noise and 2) data processing noise incurred by steps such as image compression or telescope errors as represented by one-pixel adversarial attacks. We also test the efficacy of domain adaptation techniques in mitigating the perturbation-driven errors. We use classification accuracy, latent space visualizations, and latent space distance to assess model robustness. Without domain adaptation, we find that processing pixel-level errors easily flip the classification into an incorrect class and that higher observational noise makes the model trained on low-noise data unable to classify galaxy morphologies. On the other hand, we show that training with domain adaptation improves model robustness and mitigates the effects of these perturbations, improving the classification accuracy by 23% on data with higher observational noise. Domain adaptation also increases by a factor of ~2.3 the latent space distance between the baseline and the incorrectly classified one-pixel perturbed image, making the model more robust to inadvertent perturbations.

    "abstract": "Increasingly stringent throughput and latency requirements in datacenter networks demand fast and accurate congestion control. We observe that the reaction time and accuracy of existing datacenter congestion control schemes are inherently limited. They either rely only on explicit feedback about the network state (e.g., queue lengths in DCTCP) or only on variations of state (e.g., RTT gradient in TIMELY). To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel congestion control algorithm, PowerTCP, which achieves much more fine-grained congestion control by adapting to the bandwidth-window product (henceforth called power). PowerTCP leverages in-band network telemetry to react to changes in the network instantaneously without loss of throughput and while keeping queues short. Due to its fast reaction time, our algorithm is particularly well-suited for dynamic network environments and bursty traffic patterns. We show analytically and empirically that PowerTCP can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in both traditional datacenter topologies and emerging reconfigurable datacenters where frequent bandwidth changes make congestion control challenging. In traditional datacenter networks, PowerTCP reduces tail flow completion times of short flows by 80% compared to DCQCN and TIMELY, and by 33% compared to HPCC even at 60% network load. In reconfigurable datacenters, PowerTCP achieves 85% circuit utilization without incurring additional latency and cuts tail latency by at least 2x compared to existing approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Cognition in midlife is an important predictor of age-related mental decline and statistical models that predict cognitive performance can be useful for predicting decline. However, existing models struggle to capture complex relationships between physical, sociodemographic, psychological and mental health factors that effect cognition. Using data from an observational, cohort study, Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), we modeled a large number of variables to predict executive function and episodic memory measures. We used cross-sectional and longitudinal outcomes with varying sparsity, or amount of missing data. Deep neural network (DNN) models consistently ranked highest in all of the cognitive performance prediction tasks, as assessed with root mean squared error (RMSE) on out-of-sample data. RMSE differences between DNN and other model types were statistically significant (T(8) = -3.70; p < 0.05). The interaction effect between model type and sparsity was significant (F(9)=59.20; p < 0.01), indicating the success of DNNs can partly be attributed to their robustness and ability to model hierarchical relationships between health-related factors. Our findings underscore the potential of neural networks to model clinical datasets and allow better understanding of factors that lead to cognitive decline. ",

However, the transferability has not been understood from the perspective of to which class target model's predictions were misled (i.e., class-aware transferability). In this paper, we differentiate the cases in which a target model predicts the same wrong class as the source model (\"same mistake\") or a different wrong class (\"different mistake\") to analyze and provide an explanation of the mechanism. First, our analysis shows (1) that same mistakes correlate with \"non-targeted transferability\" and (2) that different mistakes occur between similar models regardless of the perturbation size. Second, we present evidence that the difference in same and different mistakes can be explained by non-robust features, predictive but human-uninterpretable patterns: different mistakes occur when non-robust features in AEs are used differently by models. Non-robust features can thus provide consistent explanations for the class-aware transferability of AEs. ",

Several models have been developed to detect fake reviews using machine learning approaches. Many of these models have some limitations resulting in low accuracy in distinguishing between fake and genuine reviews. These models focused only on linguistic features to detect fake reviews and failed to capture the semantic meaning of the reviews. To deal with this, this paper proposes a new ensemble model that employs transformer architecture to discover the hidden patterns in a sequence of fake reviews and detect them precisely. The proposed approach combines three transformer models to improve the robustness of fake and genuine behaviour profiling and modelling to detect fake reviews. The experimental results using semi-real benchmark datasets showed the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art models. ",

    "abstract": "Millions of patients suffer from rare diseases around the world. However, the samples of rare diseases are much smaller than those of common diseases. In addition, due to the sensitivity of medical data, hospitals are usually reluctant to share patient information for data fusion citing privacy concerns. These challenges make it difficult for traditional AI models to extract rare disease features for the purpose of disease prediction. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing a novel approach for rare disease prediction based on federated meta-learning. To improve the prediction accuracy of rare diseases, we design an attention-based meta-learning (ATML) approach which dynamically adjusts the attention to different tasks according to the measured training effect of base learners. Additionally, a dynamic-weight based fusion strategy is proposed to further improve the accuracy of federated learning, which dynamically selects clients based on the accuracy of each local model. Experiments show that with as few as five shots, our approach out-performs the original federated meta-learning algorithm in accuracy and speed. Compared with each hospital's local model, the proposed model's average prediction accuracy increased by 13.28%. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent developments in 3D Face Reconstruction from occluded and noisy face images, the performance is still unsatisfactory. One of the main challenges is to handle moderate to heavy occlusions in the face images. In addition, the noise in the face images inhibits the correct capture of facial attributes, thus needing to be reliably addressed. Moreover, most existing methods rely on additional dependencies, posing numerous constraints over the training procedure. Therefore, we propose a Self-Supervised RObustifying GUidancE (ROGUE) framework to obtain robustness against occlusions and noise in the face images. The proposed network contains 1) the Guidance Pipeline to obtain the 3D face coefficients for the clean faces, and 2) the Robustification Pipeline to acquire the consistency between the estimated coefficients for occluded or noisy images and the clean counterpart. The proposed image- and feature-level loss functions aid the ROGUE learning process without posing additional dependencies. On the three variations of the test dataset of CelebA: rational occlusions, delusional occlusions, and noisy face images, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art method by large margins (e.g., for the shape-based 3D vertex errors, a reduction from 0.146 to 0.048 for rational occlusions, from 0.292 to 0.061 for delusional occlusions and from 0.269 to 0.053 for the noise in the face images), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In spite of its societal relevance, there has not been much statistical work on this problem, and we aim to provide an exposition that will hopefully stimulate interest in the research community.

However, the interference management and resource allocation between sensing and communication have not been fully studied. In this paper, we consider the design of perceptive mobile networks (PMNs) by adding sensing capability to current cellular networks. To avoid the full-duplex operation and reduce interference, we propose the PMN with distributed target monitoring terminals (TMTs) where passive TMTs are deployed over wireless networks to locate the sensing target (ST). We then jointly optimize the transmit and receive beamformers towards the communication user terminals (UEs) and the ST by alternating-optimization (AO) and prove its convergence. To reduce computation complexity and obtain physical insights, we further investigate the use of linear transceivers, including zero forcing and beam synthesis (B-syn), and show that B-syn can achieve comparable sensing performance as AO especially when the communication requirement is high. Some interesting physical insights are also revealed. For example, instead of forming a dedicated sensing signal, it is more efficient to jointly design the communication signals for different UEs such that they ``collaboratively leak\" energy to the ST. Furthermore, the amount of energy leakage from one UE to the ST depends on their relative locations. ",

Motivated by this observation, we introduce a novel training procedure that adaptively spawns additional discriminators to remember previous modes of generation.

We present a simple yet effective technique for augmenting existing time series models so that they explicitly account for anomalies in the training data. By augmenting the training data with a latent anomaly indicator variable whose distribution is inferred while training the underlying model using Monte Carlo EM, our method simultaneously infers anomalous points while improving model performance on nominal data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by combining it with a simple feed-forward forecasting model. We investigate how anomalies in the train set affect the training of forecasting models, which are commonly used for time series anomaly detection, and show that our method improves the training of the model.

Despite of the recent success of GNNs, the graph convolution in most GNNs have two limitations. Since the graph convolution is performed in a small local neighborhood on the input graph, it is inherently incapable to capture long-range dependencies between distance nodes. In addition, when a node has neighbors that belong to different classes, i.e., heterophily, the aggregated messages from them often negatively affect representation learning. To address the two common problems of graph convolution, in this paper, we propose Deformable Graph Convolutional Networks (Deformable GCNs) that adaptively perform convolution in multiple latent spaces and capture short/long-range dependencies between nodes. Separated from node representations (features), our framework simultaneously learns the node positional embeddings (coordinates) to determine the relations between nodes in an end-to-end fashion. Depending on node position, the convolution kernels are deformed by deformation vectors and apply different transformations to its neighbor nodes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Deformable GCNs flexibly handles the heterophily and achieve the best performance in node classification tasks on six heterophilic graph datasets. ",

Compared with the traditional machine learning framework that collects user data for centralized storage, which brings huge communication burden and concerns about data privacy, this approach can not only save the network bandwidth but also protect the data privacy. Despite the promising prospect, byzantine attack, an intractable threat in conventional distributed network, is discovered to be rather efficacious against FL as well. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of the state-of-the-art strategies for defending against byzantine attacks in FL. We first provide a taxonomy for the existing defense solutions according to the techniques they used, followed by an across-the-board comparison and discussion. Then we propose a new byzantine attack method called weight attack to defeat those defense schemes, and conduct experiments to demonstrate its threat. The results show that existing defense solutions, although abundant, are still far from fully protecting FL. Finally, we indicate possible countermeasures for weight attack, and highlight several challenges and future research directions for mitigating byzantine attacks in FL. ",

Recent adaptive training methods promote the output of infrequent words by emphasizing their weights in the overall training objectives. Despite the improved recall of low-frequency words, their prediction precision is unexpectedly hindered by the adaptive objectives. Inspired by the observation that low-frequency words form a more compact embedding space, we tackle this challenge from a representation learning perspective. Specifically, we propose a frequency-aware token-level contrastive learning method, in which the hidden state of each decoding step is pushed away from the counterparts of other target words, in a soft contrastive way based on the corresponding word frequencies. We conduct experiments on widely used NIST Chinese-English and WMT14 English-German translation tasks. Empirical results show that our proposed methods can not only significantly improve the translation quality but also enhance lexical diversity and optimize word representation space. Further investigation reveals that, comparing with related adaptive training strategies, the superiority of our method on low-frequency word prediction lies in the robustness of token-level recall across different frequencies without sacrificing precision.

In principle, these two types of new knowledge should be assessed at two very different levels of citations, but we demonstrate that a simpler assessment can be performed based on the total number of papers (P) and the ratio of the number of papers in the global top 10% of most cited papers divided to the total number of papers (Ptop 10%/P). P represents the quantity, whereas the Ptop 10%/P ratio represents the efficiency. In ideal countries, P and the Ptop 10%/P ratio are linked to the gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP the per capita, respectively. Only countries with high Ptop 10%/P ratios participate actively in the creation of fundamental new knowledge and have Noble laureates. In real countries, the link between economic and scientific wealth can be modified by the technological activity and the research policy. We discuss how technological activity may decrease the Ptop 10%/P ratio while only slightly affecting the capacity to create fundamental new knowledge; in such countries, many papers may report incremental innovations that do not drive the advancement of knowledge. Japan is the clearest example of this, although there are many less extreme examples. Independently of technological activity, research policy has a strong influence on the Ptop 10%/P ratio, which may be higher or lower than expected from the GDP per capita depending on the success of the research policy.

We then establish closure properties which we combine with known and new bounds on the number of parameters necessary to approximate locally Lipschitz continuous functions, maximum functions, and product functions by DNNs. The main result of this article demonstrates that DNNs have sufficient expressiveness to approximate certain sequences of functions which can be constructed by means of a finite number of compositions using locally Lipschitz continuous functions, maxima, and products without the curse of dimensionality.

    "abstract": "Inferring the source of a diffusion in a large network of agents is a difficult but feasible task, if a few agents act as sensors revealing the time at which they got hit by the diffusion. A main limitation of current source detection algorithms is that they assume full knowledge of the contact network, which is rarely the case, especially for epidemics, where the source is called patient zero. Inspired by recent contact tracing algorithms, we propose a new framework, which we call Source Detection via Contact Tracing Framework (SDCTF). In the SDCTF, the source detection task starts at the time of the first hospitalization, and initially we have no knowledge about the contact network other than the identity of the first hospitalized agent. We may then explore the network by contact queries, and obtain symptom onset times by test queries in an adaptive way. We also assume that some of the agents may be asymptomatic, and therefore cannot reveal their symptom onset time. Our goal is to find patient zero with as few contact and test queries as possible. We propose two local search algorithms for the SDCTF: the LS algorithm is more data-efficient, but can fail to find the true source if many asymptomatic agents are present, whereas the LS+ algorithm is more robust to asymptomatic agents. By simulations we show that both LS and LS+ outperform state of the art adaptive and non-adaptive source detection algorithms adapted to the SDCTF, even though these baseline algorithms have full access to the contact network. Extending the theory of random exponential trees, we analytically approximate the probability of success of the LS/ LS+ algorithms, and we show that our analytic results match the simulations. Finally, we benchmark our algorithms on the Data-driven COVID-19 Simulator developed by Lorch et al., which is the first time source detection algorithms are tested on such a complex dataset. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown superior performance on diverse real-world applications. To improve the model capacity, besides designing aggregation operations, GNN topology design is also very important. In general, there are two mainstream GNN topology design manners. The first one is to stack aggregation operations to obtain the higher-level features but easily got performance drop as the network goes deeper. Secondly, the multiple aggregation operations are utilized in each layer which provides adequate and independent feature extraction stage on local neighbors while are costly to obtain the higher-level information. To enjoy the benefits while alleviating the corresponding deficiencies of these two manners, we learn to design the topology of GNNs in a novel feature fusion perspective which is dubbed F$^2$GNN. To be specific, we provide a feature fusion perspective in designing GNN topology and propose a novel framework to unify the existing topology designs with feature selection and fusion strategies. Then we develop a neural architecture search method on top of the unified framework which contains a set of selection and fusion operations in the search space and an improved differentiable search algorithm. The performance gains on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of F$^2$GNN. We further conduct experiments to show that F$^2$GNN can improve the model capacity while alleviating the deficiencies of existing GNN topology design manners, especially alleviating the over-smoothing problem, by utilizing different levels of features adaptively.

Optimum positioning of UAVs, serving as base stations, can be done through extensive field measurements or ray tracing simulations when the 3D model of the region of interest is available. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to optimize UAV base station altitude for a region. The approach is based on deep learning; specifically, a 2D satellite image of the target region is input to a deep neural network to predict path loss distributions for different UAV altitudes. The predicted path distributions are used to calculate the coverage in the region; and the optimum altitude, maximizing the coverage, is determined. The neural network is designed and trained to produce multiple path loss distributions in a single inference; thus, it is not necessary to train a separate network for each altitude. ",

We conduct an exploratory study to investigate the properties of commit-relevant mutants, i.e., the test elements of commit-aware mutation testing, by offering a general definition and an experimental approach to identify them. We thus, aim at investigating the prevalence, location, comparative advantages of commit-aware mutation testing over time (i.e., the program evolution) and the predictive power of several commit-related features to understand the essential properties for its best-effort application case. Our approach utilizes the impact of mutants and the effects of one mutant on another in capturing and analyzing the implicit interactions between the changed and unchanged code parts. The study analyses millions of mutants (over 10 million), 288 commits, five (5) different open-source software projects involving over 68,213 CPU days of computation and sets a ground truth where we perform our analysis. Our analysis shows that commit-relevant mutants are located mainly outside of program commit change (81%), while an effective selection of commit-relevant mutants can reduce the number of mutants by up to 93%. In addition, we demonstrate that commit relevant mutation testing is significantly more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis of the predictive power of mutants and commit-related features in predicting commit-relevant mutants found that most proxy features do not reliably predict commit-relevant mutants. This empirical study highlights the properties of commit-relevant mutants and demonstrates the importance of identifying and selecting commit-relevant mutants when testing evolving software systems.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there have been unprecedented technological advances in sensor technology, and sensors have become more affordable than ever. Thus, sensor-driven data collection is increasingly becoming an attractive and practical option for researchers around the globe. Such data is typically extracted in the form of time series data, which can be investigated with data mining techniques to summarize behaviors of a range of subjects including humans and animals. While enabling cheap and mass collection of data, continuous sensor data recording results in datasets which are big in size and volume, which are challenging to process and analyze with traditional techniques in a timely manner. Such collected sensor data is typically extracted in the form of time series data. There are two main approaches in the literature, namely, shape-based classification and feature-based classification. Shape-based classification determines the best class according to a distance measure. Feature-based classification, on the other hand, measures properties of the time series and finds the best class according to the set of features defined for the time series. In this dissertation, we demonstrate that neither of the two techniques will dominate for some problems, but that some combination of both might be the best. In other words, on a single problem, it might be possible that one of the techniques is better for one subset of the behaviors, and the other technique is better for another subset of behaviors. We introduce a hybrid algorithm to classify behaviors, using both shape and feature measures, in weakly labeled time series data collected from sensors to quantify specific behaviors performed by the subject. We demonstrate that our algorithm can robustly classify real, noisy, and complex datasets, based on a combination of shape and features, and tested our proposed algorithm on real-world datasets. ",

Broadcast algorithms that we concentrate on are deterministic and distributed. We demonstrate that some broadcast algorithms designed for ad-hoc channels have bounded latency for wider ranges of injection rates when executed on channels with a fixed number of stations against adversaries that can activate at most one station per round. Individual injection rates are shown to impact latency, as compared to the model of general leaky bucket adversaries.

Within this framework, the attack performance is studied for the attack construction with the sample covariance matrix. This results in an analysis of the amount of data required to learn the covariance matrix of the state variables used on the attack construction.

The recent advance of deep generative models provides a possible answer, which inspires us to automate urban planning from an adversarial learning perspective. However, three major challenges arise: 1) how to define a quantitative land-use configuration? 2) how to automate configuration planning? 3) how to evaluate the quality of a generated configuration?

    "abstract": "An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network can serve as an aerial relay to periodically receive packets from macro base stations (BSs). Severe packet loss may happen especially when UAVs have bad wireless connections to a BS. In this paper, a data exchange scheme is proposed utilizing unsupervised learning to enable efficient lost packet retrieval through reliable wireless transmissions between UAVs instead of through retransmissions of macro BSs with a longer delay and higher overhead. With the proposed scheme, all UAVs are assigned to multiple clusters and a UAV can only request its lost packets to UAVs in the same cluster. By this way, UAVs in different clusters could carry out their lost packets retrieval processes simultaneously to expedite data exchange. The agglomerative hierarchical clustering, a type of unsupervised learning, is used to conduct clustering, guaranteeing that UAVs clustered together could supply and supplement each other's lost packets. To further enhance data exchange efficiency, a data exchange mechanism is designed, where the priority of UAVs performing data exchange is determined by the number of their lost packets or the number of requested packets that they can provide. The introduced data exchange mechanism can make each request-reply process maximally beneficial to other UAVs' lost packet retrieval in the same cluster. A new random backoff procedure based on the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is designed to support the data exchange mechanism. Finally, simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed data exchange scheme. ",

Motivated by the recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we address multi-agent DRL-based joint dynamic channel access and power control in a wireless interference network. We first propose a multi-agent DRL algorithm with centralized training (DRL-CT) to tackle the joint resource allocation problem. In this case, the training is performed at the central unit (CU) and after training, the users make autonomous decisions on their transmission strategies with only local information. We demonstrate that with limited information exchange and faster convergence, DRL-CT algorithm can achieve 90% of the performance achieved by the combination of weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm for power control and exhaustive search for dynamic channel access. In the second part of this paper, we consider distributed multi-agent DRL scenario in which each user conducts its own training and makes its decisions individually, acting as a DRL agent. Finally, as a compromise between centralized and fully distributed scenarios, we consider federated DRL (FDRL) to approach the performance of DRL-CT with the use of a central unit in training while limiting the information exchange and preserving privacy of the users in the wireless system.

Thereafter, the model can be used to inductively predict links between test documents (new nodes whose graphical features are not available to the model) and statutes (existing nodes).

Assigning color to an image is a highly ill-posed problem because of its innate nature of possessing very high degrees of freedom; given an image, there is often no single color-combination that is correct. Besides colorization, another problem in reconstruction of images is Single Image Super Resolution, which aims at transforming low resolution images to a higher resolution. This research aims to provide an automated approach for the problem by focusing on a very specific domain of images, namely astronomical images, and process them using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We explore the usage of various models in two different color spaces, RGB and L*a*b. We use transferred learning owing to a small data set, using pre-trained ResNet-18 as a backbone, i.e. encoder for the U-net and fine-tune it further. The model produces visually appealing images which hallucinate high resolution, colorized data in these results which does not exist in the original image. We present our results by evaluating the GANs quantitatively using distance metrics such as L1 distance and L2 distance in each of the color spaces across all channels to provide a comparative analysis. We use Frechet inception distance (FID) to compare the distribution of the generated images with the distribution of the real image to assess the model's performance. ",

    "abstract": "Digital images contain a lot of redundancies, therefore, compressions are applied to reduce the image size without the loss of reasonable image quality. The same become more prominent in the case of videos that contains image sequences and higher compression ratios are achieved in low throughput networks. Assessment of the quality of images in such scenarios becomes of particular interest. Subjective evaluation in most of the scenarios becomes infeasible so objective evaluation is preferred. Among the three objective quality measures, full-reference and reduced-reference methods require an original image in some form to calculate the quality score which is not feasible in scenarios such as broadcasting or IP video. Therefore, a non-reference quality metric is proposed to assess the quality of digital images which calculates luminance and multiscale gradient statistics along with mean subtracted contrast normalized products as features to train a Feedforward Neural Network with Scaled Conjugate Gradient. The trained network has provided good regression and R2 measures and further testing on LIVE Image Quality Assessment database release-2 has shown promising results. Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman's correlation are calculated between predicted and actual quality scores and their results are comparable to the state-of-the-art systems. Moreover, the proposed metric is computationally faster than its counterparts and can be used for the quality assessment of image sequences. ",

    "abstract": "For supervised classification problems, this paper considers estimating the query's label probability through local regression using observed covariates. Well-known nonparametric kernel smoother and $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) estimator, which take label average over a ball around the query, are consistent but asymptotically biased particularly for a large radius of the ball. To eradicate such bias, local polynomial regression (LPoR) and multiscale $k$-NN (MS-$k$-NN) learn the bias term by local regression around the query and extrapolate it to the query itself. However, their theoretical optimality has been shown for the limit of the infinite number of training samples. For correcting the asymptotic bias with fewer observations, this paper proposes a local radial regression (LRR) and its logistic regression variant called local radial logistic regression (LRLR), by combining the advantages of LPoR and MS-$k$-NN. The idea is simple: we fit the local regression to observed labels by taking the radial distance as the explanatory variable and then extrapolate the estimated label probability to zero distance. Our numerical experiments, including real-world datasets of daily stock indices, demonstrate that LRLR outperforms LPoR and MS-$k$-NN. ",

    "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a kind of malignant tumor. Accurate and automatic segmentation of organs at risk (OAR) of computed tomography (CT) images is clinically significant. In recent years, deep learning models represented by U-Net have been widely applied in medical image segmentation tasks, which can help doctors with reduction of workload and get accurate results more quickly. In OAR segmentation of NPC, the sizes of OAR are variable, especially, some of them are small. Traditional deep neural networks underperform during segmentation due to the lack use of global and multi-size information. This paper proposes a new SE-Connection Pyramid Network (SECP-Net). SECP-Net extracts global and multi-size information flow with se connection (SEC) modules and a pyramid structure of network for improving the segmentation performance, especially that of small organs. SECP-Net also designs an auto-context cascaded network to further improve the segmentation performance. Comparative experiments are conducted between SECP-Net and other recently methods on a dataset with CT images of head and neck. Five-fold cross validation is used to evaluate the performance based on two metrics, i.e., Dice and Jaccard similarity. Experimental results show that SECP-Net can achieve SOTA performance in this challenging task. ",

Moreover, a lower bound of parameters is given as a necessary condition for exact recovery of GPM. The new bound breaches the information-theoretic threshold for pure community detection under the stochastic block model (SBM), thus demonstrating the superiority of our simultaneous optimization algorithm over the trivial two-stage method which performs the two tasks in succession. We also conduct numerical experiments on GPM and SDP to evidence and complement our theoretical analysis. ",

    "abstract": "Decision-makers often face the \"many bandits\" problem, where one must simultaneously learn across related but heterogeneous contextual bandit instances. For instance, a large retailer may wish to dynamically learn product demand across many stores to solve pricing or inventory problems, making it desirable to learn jointly for stores serving similar customers; alternatively, a hospital network may wish to dynamically learn patient risk across many providers to allocate personalized interventions, making it desirable to learn jointly for hospitals serving similar patient populations. We study the setting where the unknown parameter in each bandit instance can be decomposed into a global parameter plus a sparse instance-specific term. Then, we propose a novel two-stage estimator that exploits this structure in a sample-efficient way by using a combination of robust statistics (to learn across similar instances) and LASSO regression (to debias the results). We embed this estimator within a bandit algorithm, and prove that it improves asymptotic regret bounds in the context dimension $d$; this improvement is exponential for data-poor instances. We further demonstrate how our results depend on the underlying network structure of bandit instances. ",

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems are highly vulnerable to a variety of adversarial attacks on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Training-free model-agnostic defenses have recently gained popularity due to their speed, ease of deployment, and ability to work across many DNNs. To this end, a new technique has emerged for mitigating attacks on image classification DNNs, namely, preprocessing adversarial images using super resolution -- upscaling low-quality inputs into high-resolution images. This defense requires running both image classifiers and super resolution models on constrained autonomous systems. However, super resolution incurs a heavy computational cost. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the following question: Does the robustness of image classifiers suffer if we use tiny super resolution models? To answer this, we first review a recent work called Super-Efficient Super Resolution (SESR) that achieves similar or better image quality than prior art while requiring 2x to 330x fewer Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. We demonstrate that despite being orders of magnitude smaller than existing models, SESR achieves the same level of robustness as significantly larger networks. Finally, we estimate end-to-end performance of super resolution-based defenses on a commercial Arm Ethos-U55 micro-NPU. Our findings show that SESR achieves nearly 3x higher FPS than a baseline while achieving similar robustness. ",

Second, it provides a general and interpretable representation of the distribution over individual states; and this is important for addressing the classical question of whether and how heterogeneity matters in macroeconomics.

The best results in terms of mean average percentage error (MAPE) are obtained with gradient boosting over sorted features, while linear models demonstrate worse prediction quality. Neural networks perform similarly to gradient boosting, but they are more resource- and time-consuming because of hyperparameter tuning and frequent retraining. We investigate the practical applicability of the proposed algorithms in a wide range of scenarios generated by the Quadriga simulator.

This paper proposed a transfer learning enhanced the physics-informed neural network (PINN) model to study the VIV (2D). The physics-informed neural network, when used in conjunction with the transfer learning method, enhances learning efficiency and keeps predictability in the target task by common characteristics knowledge from the source model without requiring a huge quantity of datasets. The datasets obtained from VIV experiment are divided evenly two parts (source domain and target domain), to evaluate the performance of the model. The results show that the proposed method match closely with the results available in the literature using conventional PINN algorithms even though the quantity of datasets acquired in training model gradually becomes smaller. The application of the model can break the limitation of monitoring equipment and methods in the practical projects, and promote the in-depth study of VIV. ",

    "abstract": "Spectral super-resolution (SSR) refers to the hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery from an RGB counterpart. Due to the one-to-many nature of the SSR problem, a single RGB image can be reprojected to many HSIs. The key to tackle this illposed problem is to plug into multi-source prior information such as the natural RGB spatial context-prior, deep feature-prior or inherent HSI statistical-prior, etc., so as to improve the confidence and fidelity of reconstructed spectra. However, most current approaches only consider the general and limited priors in their designing the customized convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which leads to the inability to effectively alleviate the degree of ill-posedness. To address the problematic issues, we propose a novel holistic prior-embedded relation network (HPRN) for SSR. Basically, the core framework is delicately assembled by several multi-residual relation blocks (MRBs) that fully facilitate the transmission and utilization of the low-frequency content prior of RGB signals. Innovatively, the semantic prior of RGB input is introduced to identify category attributes and a semantic-driven spatial relation module (SSRM) is put forward to perform the feature aggregation among the clustered similar characteristics using a semantic-embedded relation matrix. Additionally, we develop a transformer-based channel relation module (TCRM), which breaks the habit of employing scalars as the descriptors of channel-wise relations in the previous deep feature-prior and replaces them with certain vectors, together with Transformerstyle feature interactions, supporting the representations to be more discriminative. In order to maintain the mathematical correlation and spectral consistency between hyperspectral bands, the second-order prior constraints (SOPC) are incorporated into the loss function to guide the HSI reconstruction process.
