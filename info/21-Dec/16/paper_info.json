    "abstract": "Nonlinear parametric systems have been widely used in modeling nonlinear dynamics in science and engineering. Bifurcation analysis of these nonlinear systems on the parameter space are usually used to study the solution structure such as the number of solutions and the stability. In this paper, we develop a new machine learning approach to compute the bifurcations via so-called equation-driven neural networks (EDNNs). The EDNNs consist of a two-step optimization: the first step is to approximate the solution function of the parameter by training empirical solution data; the second step is to compute bifurcations by using the approximated neural network obtained in the first step. Both theoretical convergence analysis and numerical implementation on several examples have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. ",

    "title": "Investigating myocardial infarction and its effects in patients with  urgent medical problems using advanced data mining tools",
    "abstract": "In medical science, it is very important to gather multiple data on different diseases and one of the most important objectives of the data is to investigate the diseases. Myocardial infarction is a serious risk factor in mortality and in previous studies, the main emphasis has been on people with heart disease and measuring the likelihood of myocardial infarction in them through demographic features, echocardiography, and electrocardiogram. In contrast, the purpose of the present study is to utilize data analysis algorithms and compare their accuracy in patients with a heart attack in order to identify the heart muscle strength during myocardial infarction by taking into account emergency operations and consequently predict myocardial infarction. For this purpose, 105 medical records of myocardial infarction patients with fourteen features including age, the time of emergency operation, Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) test, heart rate, blood sugar, and vein are gathered and investigated through classification techniques of data analysis including random decision forests, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor, and ordinal logistic regression. Finally, the model of random decision forests with an accuracy of 76% is selected as the best model in terms of the mean evaluation indicator. Also, seven features of the creatine Phosphokinase test, urea, white and red blood cell count, blood sugar, time, and hemoglobin are identified as the most effective features of the ejection fraction variable.

    "abstract": "Representation is the way in which human beings re-present the reality of what is happening, both externally and internally. Thus, visual representation as a means of communication uses elements to build a narrative, just as spoken and written language do. We propose using computer analysis to perform a quantitative analysis of the elements used in the visual creations that have been produced in reference to the epidemic, using the images compiled in The Covid Art Museum's Instagram account to analyze the different elements used to represent subjective experiences with regard to a global event. This process has been carried out with techniques based on machine learning to detect objects in the images so that the algorithm can be capable of learning and detecting the objects contained in each study image. This research reveals that the elements that are repeated in images to create narratives and the relations of association that are established in the sample, concluding that, despite the subjectivity that all creation entails, there are certain parameters of shared and reduced decisions when it comes to selecting objects to be included in visual representations ",

First, we want to reach domain robustness, i.e., good quality of both domains from the training data, and domains unseen in the training data. Second, we want our systems to be adaptive, i.e., making it possible to finetune systems with just hundreds of in-domain parallel sentences. In this paper, we introduce a novel combination of two previous approaches, word adaptive modelling, which addresses domain robustness, and meta-learning, which addresses domain adaptability, and we present empirical results showing that our new combination improves both of these properties.

    "title": "Domain-informed neural networks for interaction localization within  astroparticle experiments",
    "abstract": "This work proposes a domain-informed neural network architecture for experimental particle physics, using particle interaction localization with the time-projection chamber (TPC) technology for dark matter research as an example application. A key feature of the signals generated within the TPC is that they allow localization of particle interactions through a process called reconstruction. While multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have emerged as a leading contender for reconstruction in TPCs, such a black-box approach does not reflect prior knowledge of the underlying scientific processes. This paper looks anew at neural network-based interaction localization and encodes prior detector knowledge, in terms of both signal characteristics and detector geometry, into the feature encoding and the output layers of a multilayer neural network. The resulting Domain-informed Neural Network (DiNN limits the receptive fields of the neurons in the initial feature encoding layers in order to account for the spatially localized nature of the signals produced within the TPC. This aspect of the DiNN, which has similarities with the emerging area of graph neural networks in that the neurons in the initial layers only connect to a handful of neurons in their succeeding layer, significantly reduces the number of parameters in the network in comparison to an MLP. In addition, in order to account for the detector geometry, the output layers of the network are modified using two geometric transformations to ensure the DiNN produces localizations within the interior of the detector. The end result is a neural network architecture that has 60% fewer parameters than an MLP, but that still achieves similar localization performance and provides a path to future architectural developments with improved performance because of their ability to encode additional domain knowledge into the architecture.

    "title": "Building separable approximations for quantum states via neural networks",
    "abstract": "Finding the closest separable state to a given target state is a notoriously difficult task, even more difficult than deciding whether a state is entangled or separable. To tackle this task, we parametrize separable states with a neural network and train it to minimize the distance to a given target state, with respect to a differentiable distance, such as the trace distance or Hilbert-Schmidt distance. By examining the output of the algorithm, we can deduce whether the target state is entangled or not, and construct an approximation for its closest separable state. We benchmark the method on a variety of well-known classes of bipartite states and find excellent agreement, even up to local dimension of $d=10$. Moreover, we show our method to be efficient in the multipartite case, considering different notions of separability. Examining three and four-party GHZ and W states we recover known bounds and obtain novel ones, for instance for triseparability. Finally, we show how to use the neural network's results to gain analytic insight. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of the liver is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of disease. Automated segmentation is an important application of computer-aided detection and diagnosis of liver disease. In recent years, automated processing of medical images has gained breakthroughs. However, the low contrast of abdominal scan CT images and the complexity of liver morphology make accurate automatic segmentation challenging. In this paper, we propose RA V-Net, which is an improved medical image automatic segmentation model based on U-Net. It has the following three main innovations. CofRes Module (Composite Original Feature Residual Module) is proposed. With more complex convolution layers and skip connections to make it obtain a higher level of image feature extraction capability and prevent gradient disappearance or explosion. AR Module (Attention Recovery Module) is proposed to reduce the computational effort of the model. In addition, the spatial features between the data pixels of the encoding and decoding modules are sensed by adjusting the channels and LSTM convolution. Finally, the image features are effectively retained. CA Module (Channel Attention Module) is introduced, which used to extract relevant channels with dependencies and strengthen them by matrix dot product, while weakening irrelevant channels without dependencies. The purpose of channel attention is achieved. The attention mechanism provided by LSTM convolution and CA Module are strong guarantees for the performance of the neural network. The accuracy of U-Net network: 0.9862, precision: 0.9118, DSC: 0.8547, JSC: 0.82. The evaluation metrics of RA V-Net, accuracy: 0.9968, precision: 0.9597, DSC: 0.9654, JSC: 0.9414. The most representative metric for the segmentation effect is DSC, which improves 0.1107 over U-Net, and JSC improves 0.1214. ",
