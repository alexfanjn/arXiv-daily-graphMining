    "title": "KartalOl: Transfer learning using deep neural network for iris  segmentation and localization: New dataset for iris segmentation",
    "abstract": "Iris segmentation and localization in unconstrained environments is challenging due to long distances, illumination variations, limited user cooperation, and moving subjects. To address this problem, we present a U-Net with a pre-trained MobileNetV2 deep neural network method. We employ the pre-trained weights given with MobileNetV2 for the ImageNet dataset and fine-tune it on the iris recognition and localization domain. Further, we have introduced a new dataset, called KartalOl, to better evaluate detectors in iris recognition scenarios. To provide domain adaptation, we fine-tune the MobileNetV2 model on the provided data for NIR-ISL 2021 from the CASIA-Iris-Asia, CASIA-Iris-M1, and CASIA-Iris-Africa and our dataset. We also augment the data by performing left-right flips, rotation, zoom, and brightness. We chose the binarization threshold for the binary masks by iterating over the images in the provided dataset. The proposed method is tested and trained in CASIA-Iris-Asia, CASIA-Iris-M1, CASIA-Iris-Africa, along the KartalOl dataset. The experimental results highlight that our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods on mobile-based benchmarks. The codes and evaluation results are publicly available at https://github.com/Jalilnkh/KartalOl-NIR-ISL2021031301. ",

    "abstract": "Ear recognition system has been widely studied whereas there are just a few ear presentation attack detection methods for ear recognition systems, consequently, there is no publicly available ear presentation attack detection (PAD) database. In this paper, we propose a PAD method using a pre-trained deep neural network and release a new dataset called Warsaw University of Technology Ear Dataset for Presentation Attack Detection (WUT-Ear V1.0). There is no ear database that is captured using mobile devices. Hence, we have captured more than 8500 genuine ear images from 134 subjects and more than 8500 fake ear images using. We made replay-attack and photo print attacks with 3 different mobile devices. Our approach achieves 99.83% and 0.08% for the half total error rate (HTER) and attack presentation classification error rate (APCER), respectively, on the replay-attack database. The captured data is analyzed and visualized statistically to find out its importance and make it a benchmark for further research. The experiments have been found out a secure PAD method for ear recognition system, publicly available ear image, and ear PAD dataset.

    "abstract": "Federated machine learning is a versatile and flexible tool to utilize distributed data from different sources, especially when communication technology develops rapidly and an unprecedented amount of data could be collected on mobile devices nowadays. Federated learning method exploits not only the data but the computational power of all devices in the network to achieve more efficient model training. Nevertheless, while most traditional federated learning methods work well for homogeneous data and tasks, adapting the method to a different heterogeneous data and task distribution is challenging. This limitation has constrained the applications of federated learning in real-world contexts, especially in healthcare settings. Inspired by the fundamental idea of meta-learning, in this study we propose a new algorithm, which is an integration of federated learning and meta-learning, to tackle this issue. In addition, owing to the advantage of transfer learning for model generalization, we further improve our algorithm by introducing partial parameter sharing. We name this method partial meta-federated learning (PMFL). Finally, we apply the algorithms to two medical datasets. We show that our algorithm could obtain the fastest training speed and achieve the best performance when dealing with heterogeneous medical datasets. ",

Here, we present a CNN using a decision tree and ensemble structure to fully characterise drones in flight. Our system determines the drone type, orientation (in terms of pitch, roll, and yaw), and performs segmentation to classify different body parts (engines, body, and camera). We also provide a computer model for the rapid generation of large quantities of accurately labelled photo-realistic training data and demonstrate that this data is of sufficient fidelity to allow the system to accurately characterise real drones in flight. Our network will provide a valuable tool in the image processing chain where it may build upon existing drone detection technologies to provide complete drone characterisation over wide areas. ",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are dynamical systems that compute with their dynamics. One example is the Hopfield model, forming an associative memory which stores patterns as global attractors of the network dynamics. From studies of dynamical networks it is well known that localized attractors also exist. Yet, they have not been used in computing paradigms. Here we show that interacting localized attractors in threshold networks can result in universal computation. We develop a rewiring algorithm that builds universal Boolean gates in a biologically inspired two-dimensional threshold network with randomly placed and connected nodes using collision-based computing. We aim at demonstrating the computational capabilities and the ability to control local limit cycle attractors in such networks by creating simple Boolean gates by means of these local activations. The gates use glider guns, i.e., localized activity that periodically generates \"gliders\" of activity that propagate through space. Several such gliders are made to collide, and the result of their interaction is used as the output of a Boolean gate. We show that these gates can be used to build a universal computer. ",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work is to detect and automatically generate high-level explanations of anomalous events in video. Understanding the cause of an anomalous event is crucial as the required response is dependant on its nature and severity. Recent works typically use object or action classifier to detect and provide labels for anomalous events. However, this constrains detection systems to a finite set of known classes and prevents generalisation to unknown objects or behaviours. Here we show how to robustly detect anomalies without the use of object or action classifiers yet still recover the high level reason behind the event. We make the following contributions: (1) a method using saliency maps to decouple the explanation of anomalous events from object and action classifiers, (2) show how to improve the quality of saliency maps using a novel neural architecture for learning discrete representations of video by predicting future frames and (3) beat the state-of-the-art anomaly explanation methods by 60\\% on a subset of the public benchmark X-MAN dataset.

    "abstract": "The neuroevolution is one of the methodologies that can be used for learning optimal architecture during the training. It uses evolutionary algorithms to generate topology of artificial neural networks (ANN) and its parameters. In this work, a modified neuroevolution technique is presented which incorporates multi-level optimization. The presented approach adapts evolution strategies for evolving ensemble model based on bagging technique, using genetic operators for optimizing single anomaly detection models, reducing the training dataset to speedup the search process and performs non gradient fine tuning. The multivariate anomaly detection as an unsupervised learning task is the case study on which presented approach is tested. Single model optimization is based on mutation, crossover operators and focuses on finding optimal window sizes, the number of layers, layer depths, hyperparameters etc. to boost the anomaly detection scores of new and already known models. The proposed framework and its protocol shows that it is possible to find architecture in a reasonable time which can boost all well known multivariate anomaly detection deep learning architectures. The work concentrates on improvements to multi-level neuroevolution approach for anomaly detection. The main modifications are in the methods of mixing groups and single models evolution, non gradient fine tuning and voting mechanism. The presented framework can be used as an efficient learning network architecture method for any different unsupervised task where autoencoder architectures can be used. The tests were run on SWAT and WADI datasets and presented approach evolved architectures that achieve best scores among other deep learning models. ",

    "abstract": "Many multiagent dynamics, including various collective dynamics occurring on networks, can be modeled as a stochastic process in which the agents in the system change their state over time in interaction with each other. The Gillespie algorithms are popular algorithms that exactly simulate such stochastic multiagent dynamics when each state change is driven by a discrete event, the dynamics is defined in continuous time, and the stochastic law of event occurrence is governed by independent Poisson processes. In the first main part of this volume, we provide a tutorial on the Gillespie algorithms focusing on simulation of social multiagent dynamics occurring in populations and networks. We do not assume advanced knowledge of mathematics (or computer science or physics). We clarify why one should use the continuous-time models and the Gillespie algorithms in many cases, instead of easier-to-understand discrete-time models. In the remainder of this volume, we review recent extensions of the Gillespie algorithms aiming to add more reality to the model (i.e., non-Poissonian cases) or to speed up the simulations. ",
