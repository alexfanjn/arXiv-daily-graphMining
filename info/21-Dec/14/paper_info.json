    "abstract": "Multi-view stereo (MVS) is a crucial task for precise 3D reconstruction. Most recent studies tried to improve the performance of matching cost volume in MVS by designing aggregated 3D cost volumes and their regularization. This paper focuses on learning a robust feature extraction network to enhance the performance of matching costs without heavy computation in the other steps. In particular, we present a dynamic scale feature extraction network, namely, CDSFNet. It is composed of multiple novel convolution layers, each of which can select a proper patch scale for each pixel guided by the normal curvature of the image surface. As a result, CDFSNet can estimate the optimal patch scales to learn discriminative features for accurate matching computation between reference and source images. By combining the robust extracted features with an appropriate cost formulation strategy, our resulting MVS architecture can estimate depth maps more precisely. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on complex outdoor scenes. It significantly improves the completeness of reconstructed models. As a result, the method can process higher resolution inputs within faster run-time and lower memory than other MVS methods.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can now achieve human-level performance on challenging object recognition tasks. CNNs are also the leading quantitative models in terms of predicting neural and behavioral responses in visual recognition tasks. However, there is a widely accepted critique of CNN models: unlike newborn animals, which learn rapidly and efficiently, CNNs are thought to be \"data hungry,\" requiring massive amounts of training data to develop accurate models for object recognition. This critique challenges the promise of using CNNs as models of visual development. Here, we directly examined whether CNNs are more data hungry than newborn animals by performing parallel controlled-rearing experiments on newborn chicks and CNNs. We raised newborn chicks in strictly controlled visual environments, then simulated the training data available in that environment by constructing a virtual animal chamber in a video game engine. We recorded the visual images acquired by an agent moving through the virtual chamber and used those images to train CNNs. When CNNs received similar visual training data as chicks, the CNNs successfully solved the same challenging view-invariant object recognition tasks as the chicks. Thus, the CNNs were not more data hungry than animals: both CNNs and chicks successfully developed robust object models from training data of a single object. ",

    "abstract": "CMOS sensors employ row-wise acquisition mechanism while imaging a scene, which can result in undesired motion artifacts known as rolling shutter (RS) distortions in the captured image. Existing single image RS rectification methods attempt to account for these distortions by either using algorithms tailored for specific class of scenes which warrants information of intrinsic camera parameters or a learning-based framework with known ground truth motion parameters. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network for the challenging task of single image RS rectification. Our network consists of a motion block, a trajectory module, a row block, an RS rectification module and an RS regeneration module (which is used only during training). The motion block predicts camera pose for every row of the input RS distorted image while the trajectory module fits estimated motion parameters to a third-order polynomial. The row block predicts the camera motion that must be associated with every pixel in the target i.e, RS rectified image. Finally, the RS rectification module uses motion trajectory and the output of row block to warp the input RS image to arrive at a distortionfree image. For faster convergence during training, we additionally use an RS regeneration module which compares the input RS image with the ground truth image distorted by estimated motion parameters. The end-to-end formulation in our model does not constrain the estimated motion to ground-truth motion parameters, thereby successfully rectifying the RS images with complex real-life camera motion. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets reveal that our network outperforms prior art both qualitatively and quantitatively. ",

Reasoning based on existing facts paves a way to discover missing facts. In this paper, we study the problem of learning logic rules for reasoning on knowledge graphs for completing missing factual triplets. Learning logic rules equips a model with strong interpretability as well as the ability to generalize to similar tasks. We propose a model called MPLR that improves the existing models to fully use training data and multi-target scenarios are considered. In addition, considering the deficiency in evaluating the performance of models and the quality of mined rules, we further propose two novel indicators to help with the problem. Experimental results empirically demonstrate that our MPLR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. The results also prove the effectiveness of the indicators. ",

    "abstract": "During viral infection, intrahost mutation and recombination can lead to significant evolution, resulting in a population of viruses that harbor multiple haplotypes. The task of reconstructing these haplotypes from short-read sequencing data is called viral quasispecies assembly, and it can be categorized as a multiassembly problem. We consider the de novo version of the problem, where no reference is available. We present ViQUF, a de novo viral quasispecies assembler that addresses haplotype assembly and quantification. ViQUF obtains a first draft of the assembly graph from a de Bruijn graph. Then, solving a min-cost flow over a flow network built for each pair of adjacent vertices based on their paired-end information creates an approximate paired assembly graph with suggested frequency values as edge labels, which is the first frequency estimation. Then, original haplotypes are obtained through a greedy path reconstruction guided by a min-cost flow solution in the approximate paired assembly graph. ViQUF outputs the contigs with their frequency estimations. Results on real and simulated data show that ViQUF is at least four times faster using at most half of the memory than previous methods, while maintaining, and in some cases outperforming, the high quality of assembly and frequency estimation of overlap graph-based methodologies, which are known to be more accurate but slower than the de Bruijn graph-based approaches.

    "abstract": "The Internet generates large volumes of data at a high rate, in particular, posts on social networks. Although social network data has numerous semantic adulterations, and is not intended to be a source of geo-spatial information, in the text of posts we find pieces of important information about how people relate to their environment, which can be used to identify interesting aspects of how human beings interact with portions of land based on their activities. This research proposes a methodology for the identification of land uses using Natural Language Processing (NLP) from the contents of the popular social network Twitter. It will be approached by identifying keywords with linguistic patterns from the text, and the geographical coordinates associated with the publication. Context-specific innovations are introduced to deal with data across South America and, in particular, in the city of Arequipa, Peru. The objective is to identify the five main land uses: residential, commercial, institutional-governmental, industrial-offices and unbuilt land. Within the framework of urban planning and sustainable urban management, the methodology contributes to the optimization of the identification techniques applied for the updating of land use cadastres, since the results achieved an accuracy of about 90%, which motivates its application in the real context. In addition, it would allow the identification of land use categories at a more detailed level, in situations such as a complex/mixed distribution building based on the amount of data collected. Finally, the methodology makes land use information available in a more up-to-date fashion and, above all, avoids the high economic cost of the non-automatic production of land use maps for cities, mostly in developing countries.

    "abstract": "In this paper, an unsupervised and cognitively driven weighted-entropy method for embedding semantic categories in hyperbolic geometry is proposed. The model is driven by two fields of research in cognitive linguistics: the first is the statistical learning theory of language acquisition and the proposal of using high-dimensional networks to represent semantic knowledge in cognition, and the second is the domain-specific informativeness approach to semantic communication. Weighted conditional entropy of word co-occurrence is proposed as the embedding metric, and the two weighting parameters are collocation diversity and conditional probability ranking in the corresponding statistical distribution. The Boltzmann distribution is then used on the weighted-entropy metric and embedded into a hyperbolic Poincare disk model. Testing has been mainly performed in the domains of basic color and kinship words, which belong to the classes that domain-specificity focused research in cognitive semantics has most intensively investigated. Results show that this new approach can successfully model and map the semantic relationships of popularity and similarity for most of the basic color and kinship words in English and have potential to be generalized to other semantic domains and different languages. Generally, this paper contributes to both computational cognitive semantics and the research on network and geometry-driven language embedding in computational linguistics and NLP. ",

The local stability and the bifurcation of these games are systematically analyzed using the symbolic approach proposed by the author. The novelty of the present work is twofold. On one hand, the results of this paper are analytical, which are different from the existing results in the literature based on observations through numerical simulations. In particular, we rigorously prove the existence of double routes to chaos through the period-doubling bifurcation and through the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. On the other hand, for the special case of the involved firms having identical marginal costs, we acquire the necessary and sufficient conditions of the local stability for both models. By further analyzing these conditions, it seems that that the presence of the local monopolistic approximation (LMA) mechanism might have a stabilizing effect for heterogeneous triopoly games with the isoelastic demand.

    "abstract": "Data driven generative machine learning models have recently emerged as one of the most promising approaches for new materials discovery. While the generator models can generate millions of candidates, it is critical to train fast and accurate machine learning models to filter out stable, synthesizable materials with desired properties. However, such efforts to build supervised regression or classification screening models have been severely hindered by the lack of unstable or unsynthesizable samples, which usually are not collected and deposited in materials databases such as ICSD and Materials Project (MP). At the same time, there are a significant amount of unlabelled data available in these databases. Here we propose a semi-supervised deep neural network (TSDNN) model for high-performance formation energy and synthesizability prediction, which is achieved via its unique teacher-student dual network architecture and its effective exploitation of the large amount of unlabeled data. For formation energy based stability screening, our semi-supervised classifier achieves an absolute 10.3\\% accuracy improvement compared to the baseline CGCNN regression model. For synthesizability prediction, our model significantly increases the baseline PU learning's true positive rate from 87.9\\% to 97.9\\% using 1/49 model parameters. To further prove the effectiveness of our models, we combined our TSDNN-energy and TSDNN-synthesizability models with our CubicGAN generator to discover novel stable cubic structures. Out of 1000 recommended candidate samples by our models, 512 of them have negative formation energies as validated by our DFT formation energy calculations. Our experimental results show that our semi-supervised deep neural networks can significantly improve the screening accuracy in large-scale generative materials design. ",

We represent the spectra by neural networks and set chi-square as loss function to optimize the parameters with backward automatic differentiation unsupervisedly. In the training process, there is no explicit physical prior embedding into neural networks except the positive-definite form. The reconstruction accuracy is assessed through Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence and mean square error(MSE) at multiple noise levels. It should be noted that the automatic differential framework and the freedom of introducing regularization are inherent advantages of the present approach and may lead to improvements of solving inverse problem in the future.

Factored PCA (FPCA) is a probabilistic extension of PCA for matrix data, which can substantially reduce the number of parameters in PCA while yield satisfactory performance. However, FPCA is based on the Gaussian assumption and thereby susceptible to outliers. Although the multivariate $t$ distribution as a robust modeling tool for vector data has a very long history, its application to matrix data is very limited. The main reason is that the dimension of the vectorized matrix data is often very high and the higher the dimension, the lower the breakdown point that measures the robustness. To solve the robustness problem suffered by FPCA and make it applicable to matrix data, in this paper we propose a robust extension of FPCA (RFPCA), which is built upon a $t$-type distribution called matrix-variate $t$ distribution. Like the multivariate $t$ distribution, the matrix-variate $t$ distribution can adaptively down-weight outliers and yield robust estimates. We develop a fast EM-type algorithm for parameter estimation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets reveal that RFPCA is compared favorably with several related methods and RFPCA is a simple but powerful tool for matrix-valued outlier detection. ",
