We explore some of the most popular transformer models such as BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet. We also study different data augmentation techniques to increase the training dataset. During the development phase, our best results were obtained by using RoBERTa and data augmentation for tasks B and C. However, the use of synthetic data does not improve the results for task C. We participated in the three subtasks. Our approach still has much room for improvement, especially in the two fine-grained classifications.

    "abstract": "A task of vital clinical importance, within Diabetes management, is the prevention of hypo/hyperglycemic events. Increasingly adopted Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices offer detailed, non-intrusive and real time insights into a patient's blood glucose concentrations. Leveraging advanced Machine Learning (ML) Models as methods of prediction of future glucose levels, gives rise to substantial quality of life improvements, as well as providing a vital tool for monitoring diabetes. A regression based prediction approach is implemented recursively, with a series of Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Hidden Markov Model, Long-Short Term Memory Network. By exploiting a patient's past 11 hours of blood glucose (BG) concentration measurements, a prediction of the 60 minutes is made. Results will be assessed using performance metrics including: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), normalised energy of the second-order differences (ESOD) and F1 score. Research of past and current approaches, as well as available dataset, led to the establishment of an optimal training methodology for the CITY dataset, which may be leveraged by future model development. Performance was aligned with similar state-of-art ML models, with LSTM having RMSE of 28.55, however no significant advantage was observed over classical Auto-regressive AR models. Compelling insights into LSTM prediction behaviour could increase public and legislative trust and understanding, progressing the certification of ML models in Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS). ",

We rely on the behavioral characteristics of the power grid in the presence of interconnected EVCS while combining cyber and physical layer features to implement deep learning algorithms for the effective detection of oscillatory load attacks at the EVCS. We evaluate the proposed detection approach by building a real-time test bed to synthesize benign and malicious data, which was generated by analyzing real-life EV charging data collected during recent years. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented approach with the Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory model producing optimal classification accuracy (99.4\\%). Moreover, our analysis results shed light on the impact of such detection mechanisms towards building resiliency into different levels of the EV charging ecosystem while allowing power grid operators to localize attacks and take further mitigation measures. Specifically, we managed to decentralize the detection mechanism of oscillatory load attacks and create an effective alternative for operator-centric mechanisms to mitigate multi-operator and MitM oscillatory load attacks against the power grid. Finally, we leverage the created test bed to evaluate a distributed mitigation technique, which can be deployed on public/private charging stations to average out the impact of oscillatory load attacks while allowing the power system to recover smoothly within 1 second with minimal overhead.

Prior literature has three limitations: (1) Failing to capture long-delayed patterns in system anomalies; (2) Ignoring dynamic changes in sensor connections; (3) The curse of high-dimensional data samples. These limit the detection performance and usefulness of existing works. To address them, we propose a new approach called deep graph stream support vector data description (SVDD) for anomaly detection. Specifically, we first use a transformer to preserve both short and long temporal patterns of monitoring data in temporal embeddings. Then we cluster these embeddings according to sensor type and utilize them to estimate the change in connectivity between various sensors to construct a new weighted graph. The temporal embeddings are mapped to the new graph as node attributes to form weighted attributed graph. We input the graph into a variational graph auto-encoder model to learn final spatio-temporal representation. Finally, we learn a hypersphere that encompasses normal embeddings and predict the system status by calculating the distances between the hypersphere and data samples. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our model, which improves F1-score by 35.87%, AUC by 19.32%, while being 32 times faster than the best baseline at training and inference. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to effectively map NNs onto heterogeneous MPSoCs in a manner that enables them to leverage the underlying processing concurrency. Specifically, our approach identifies an optimal partitioning scheme of the NN along its `width' dimension, which facilitates deployment of concurrent NN blocks onto different hardware computing units. Additionally, our approach contributes a novel scheme to deploy partitioned NNs onto the MPSoC as dynamic multi-exit networks for additional performance gains. Our experiments on a standard MPSoC platform have yielded dynamic mapping configurations that are 2.1x more energy-efficient than the GPU-only mapping while incurring 1.7x less latency than DLA-only mapping.

The PPP is a generalization of a probabilistic occupancy grid to the continuous volume and is fundamental to the volumetric ray-tracing model underlying radiance fields. Building upon this PPP model, we present a chance-constrained trajectory optimization method for safe robot navigation in NeRFs. Our method relies on a voxel representation called the Probabilistic Unsafe Robot Region (PURR) that spatially fuses the chance constraint with the NeRF model to facilitate fast trajectory optimization. We then combine a graph-based search with a spline-based trajectory optimization to yield robot trajectories through the NeRF that are guaranteed to satisfy a user-specific collision probability. We validate our chance constrained planning method through simulations, showing superior performance compared with two other methods for trajectory planning in NeRF environment models. ",

    "abstract": "Compared to physical health, population mental health measurement in the U.S. is very coarse-grained. Currently, in the largest population surveys, such as those carried out by the Centers for Disease Control or Gallup, mental health is only broadly captured through \"mentally unhealthy days\" or \"sadness\", and limited to relatively infrequent state or metropolitan estimates. Through the large scale analysis of social media data, robust estimation of population mental health is feasible at much higher resolutions, up to weekly estimates for counties. In the present work, we validate a pipeline that uses a sample of 1.2 billion Tweets from 2 million geo-located users to estimate mental health changes for the two leading mental health conditions, depression and anxiety. We find moderate to large associations between the language-based mental health assessments and survey scores from Gallup for multiple levels of granularity, down to the county-week (fixed effects $\\beta = .25$ to $1.58$; $p<.001$). Language-based assessment allows for the cost-effective and scalable monitoring of population mental health at weekly time scales. Such spatially fine-grained time series are well suited to monitor effects of societal events and policies as well as enable quasi-experimental study designs in population health and other disciplines. Beyond mental health in the U.S., this method generalizes to a broad set of psychological outcomes and allows for community measurement in under-resourced settings where no traditional survey measures - but social media data - are available.

It is well known that Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) is considered computationally efficient in solving image and audio processing, speech recognition, and time-series forecasting. This paper proposed VAE-Deep-Wavelet Neural Network (VAE-Deep-WNN), where Encoder and Decoder employ WNN networks. Further, we proposed chaotic variants of both VAE with Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and Deep-WNN and named them C-VAE-MLP and C-VAE-Deep-WNN, respectively. Here, we employed a Logistic map to generate random noise in the latent space. In this paper, we performed VAE-based adversary sample generation and applied it to various problems related to finance and cybersecurity domain-related problems such as loan default, credit card fraud, and churn modelling, etc., We performed both Evasion and Data-Poison attacks on Logistic Regression (LR) and Decision Tree (DT) models.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained remarkable success in recent years. However, their performance highly relies on the architecture hyperparameters, and finding proper hyperparameters for a deep CNN is a challenging optimization problem owing to its high-dimensional and computationally expensive characteristics. Given these difficulties, this study proposes a surrogate-assisted highly cooperative hyperparameter optimization (SHCHO) algorithm for chain-styled CNNs. To narrow the large search space, SHCHO first decomposes the whole CNN into several overlapping sub-CNNs in accordance with the overlapping hyperparameter interaction structure and then cooperatively optimizes these hyperparameter subsets. Two cooperation mechanisms are designed during this process. One coordinates all the sub-CNNs to reproduce the information flow in the whole CNN and achieve macro cooperation among them, and the other tackles the overlapping components by simultaneously considering the involved two sub-CNNs and facilitates micro cooperation between them. As a result, a proper hyperparameter configuration can be effectively located for the whole CNN. Besides, SHCHO also employs the well-performing surrogate technique to assist in the hyperparameter optimization of each sub-CNN, thereby greatly reducing the expensive computational cost. Extensive experimental results on two widely-used image classification datasets indicate that SHCHO can significantly improve the performance of CNNs. ",

Due to the lack of paired samples, most existing methods fail to generate semantically recognizable reconstruction and are difficult to generalize to novel classes. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a task-agnostic brain decoding model by unifying the visual stimulus classification and reconstruction tasks in a semantic space. We denote it as BrainCLIP, which leverages CLIP's cross-modal generalization ability to bridge the modality gap between brain activities, images, and texts. Specifically, BrainCLIP is a VAE-based architecture that transforms fMRI patterns into the CLIP embedding space by combining visual and textual supervision. Note that previous works rarely use multi-modal supervision for visual stimulus decoding. Our experiments demonstrate that textual supervision can significantly boost the performance of decoding models compared to the condition where only image supervision exists. BrainCLIP can be applied to multiple scenarios like fMRI-to-image generation, fMRI-image-matching, and fMRI-text-matching. Compared with BraVL, a recently proposed multi-modal method for fMRI-based brain decoding, BrainCLIP achieves significantly better performance on the novel class classification task. BrainCLIP also establishes a new state-of-the-art for fMRI-based natural image reconstruction in terms of high-level image features. ",

Existing work on fair graph learning simply assumes that attributes of all nodes are available for model training and then makes fair predictions. In practice, however, the attributes of some nodes might not be accessible due to missing data or privacy concerns, which makes fair graph learning even more challenging. In this paper, we propose FairAC, a fair attribute completion method, to complement missing information and learn fair node embeddings for graphs with missing attributes. FairAC adopts an attention mechanism to deal with the attribute missing problem and meanwhile, it mitigates two types of unfairness, i.e., feature unfairness from attributes and topological unfairness due to attribute completion. FairAC can work on various types of homogeneous graphs and generate fair embeddings for them and thus can be applied to most downstream tasks to improve their fairness performance. To our best knowledge, FairAC is the first method that jointly addresses the graph attribution completion and graph unfairness problems. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method achieves better fairness performance with less sacrifice in accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods of fair graph learning.

This challenge is especially prominent in the few-shot learning scenario, where the data in the target domain is generally much scarcer and of lowered quality. A natural and widely-used strategy to mitigate such challenges is to perform data augmentation on the training data to better capture the data invariance and increase the sample size. However, current text data augmentation methods either can not ensure the correct labeling of the generated data (lacking faithfulness) or can not ensure sufficient diversity in the generated data (lacking completeness), or both. Inspired by the recent success of large language models, especially the development of ChatGPT, which demonstrated improved language comprehension abilities, in this work, we propose a text data augmentation approach based on ChatGPT (named ChatAug). ChatGPT is trained on data with unparalleled linguistic richness and employs a reinforcement training process with large-scale human feedback, which endows the model with affinity to the naturalness of human language. Our text data augmentation approach ChatAug rephrases each sentence in the training samples into multiple conceptually similar but semantically different samples. The augmented samples can then be used in downstream model training. Experiment results on few-shot learning text classification tasks show the superior performance of the proposed ChatAug approach over state-of-the-art text data augmentation methods in terms of testing accuracy and distribution of the augmented samples.

Given a source s and a destination t, we aim to test s-t connectivity by identifying either a path (consisting of only on edges) or a cut (consisting of only off edges). We are limited to B queries, after which we stop regardless of whether graph connectivity is established. We aim to design a query policy that minimizes the expected number of queries. If we remove the query limit B (i.e., by setting B to the total number of edges), then our problem becomes a special case of (monotone) Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation (SBFE). There are two existing exact algorithms that are prohibitively expensive. They have best known upper bounds of O(3^m) and O(2^{2^k}) respectively, where m is the number of edges and k is the number of paths/cuts. These algorithms do not scale well in practice. We propose a significantly more scalable exact algorithm. Our exact algorithm works by iteratively improving the performance lower bound until the lower bound becomes achievable. Even when our exact algorithm does not scale, it can be used as an anytime algorithm for calculating lower bound. We experiment on a wide range of practical graphs. We observe that even for large graphs (i.e., tens of thousands of edges), it mostly takes only a few queries to reach conclusion, which is the practical motivation behind the query limit B. B is also an algorithm parameter that controls scalability. For small B, our exact algorithm scales well. For large B, our exact algorithm can be converted to a heuristic (i.e., always pretend that there are only 5 queries left). Our heuristic outperforms all existing heuristics ported from SBFE and related literature. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks offer a promising approach to supervised learning over graph data. Graph data, especially when it is privacy-sensitive or too large to train on centrally, is often stored partitioned across disparate processing units (clients) which want to minimize the communication costs during collaborative training. The fully-distributed setup takes such partitioning to its extreme, wherein features of only a single node and its adjacent edges are kept locally with one client processor. Existing GNNs are not architected for training in such setups and incur prohibitive costs therein. We propose RETEXO, a novel transformation of existing GNNs that improves the communication efficiency during training in the fully-distributed setup. We experimentally confirm that RETEXO offers up to 6 orders of magnitude better communication efficiency even when training shallow GNNs, with a minimal trade-off in accuracy for supervised node classification tasks.

The injected model output correct prediction on benign samples yet behave abnormally on poisoned samples included trigger pattern. Most existing trigger of poisoned sample are visible and can be easily found by human visual inspection, and the trigger injection process will cause the feature loss of natural sample and trigger. To solve the above problems and inspire by spatial attention mechanism, we introduce a novel backdoor attack named SATBA, which is invisible and can minimize the loss of trigger to improve attack success rate and model accuracy. It extracts data features and generate trigger pattern related to clean data through spatial attention, poisons clean image by using a U-type models to plant a trigger into the original data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack against three popular image classification DNNs on three standard datasets. Besides, we conduct extensive experiments about image similarity to show that our proposed attack can provide practical stealthiness which is critical to resist to backdoor defense. ",

Although it is valid in detecting the theft of consumers, the privacy of all consumers is at risk unless the detection center is assumed to be trusted. In fact, it is impractical. Moreover, existing schemes may result in some security problems, such as the collusion attack due to the presence of a trusted third party, and malicious data tampering caused by the system operator (SO) being attacked. Aiming at the problems above, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving electricity theft detection scheme without a third party. Specifically, the proposed scheme uses an improved functional encryption scheme to enable electricity theft detection and load monitoring while preserving consumers' privacy; distributed storage of consumers' data with blockchain to resolve security problems such as data tampering, etc. Meanwhile, we build a long short-term memory network (LSTM) model to perform higher accuracy for electricity theft detection. The proposed scheme is evaluated in a real environment, and the results show that it is more accurate in electricity theft detection within acceptable communication and computational overhead. Our system analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme can resist various security attacks and preserve consumers' privacy. ",

Motivated by the causal relationship among the entities on a knowledge graph, we explore this defect through a counterfactual question: \"would the relation still exist if the neighborhood of entities became different from observation?\". With a carefully designed instantiation of a causal model on the knowledge graph, we generate the counterfactual relations to answer the question by regarding the representations of entity pair given relation as context, structural information of relation-aware neighborhood as treatment, and validity of the composed triplet as the outcome. Furthermore, we incorporate the created counterfactual relations with the GNN-based framework on KGs to augment their learning of entity pair representations from both the observed and counterfactual relations. Experiments on benchmarks show that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on the task of KGC, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

Aerial images own so much variability in scale, object appearance, and complex background. The task of semantic segmentation when capturing the underlying features in a global and local context for the UAV images becomes challenging. In this work, we proposed a UAV Segmentation Network (UAVSNet) for precise semantic segmentation of urban aerial scenes. It is a transformer-based encoder-decoder framework that uses multi-scale feature representations. The UAVSNet exploits the advantage of a self-attention-based transformer framework and convolution mechanisms in capturing the global and local context details. This helps the network precisely capture the inherent feature of the aerial images and generate overall semantically rich feature representation. The proposed Overlap Token Embedding (OTE) module generates multi-scale features. A decoder network is proposed, which further processes these features using a multi-scale feature fusion policy to enhance the feature representation ability of the network. We show the effectiveness of the proposed network on UAVid and Urban drone datasets by achieving mIoU of 64.35% and 74.64%, respectively. ",

To address such issues, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge-infused Contrastive Learning (KnowCL) model for urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction. Specifically, we firstly introduce knowledge graph (KG) to effectively model the urban knowledge in spatiality, mobility, etc., and then build neural network based encoders to learn representations of an urban image in associated semantic and visual spaces, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modality based contrastive learning framework with a novel image-KG contrastive loss, which maximizes the mutual information between semantic and visual representations for knowledge infusion. Extensive experiments of applying the learnt visual representations for socioeconomic prediction on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KnowCL with over 30\\% improvements on $R^2$ compared with baselines. Especially, our proposed KnowCL model can apply to both satellite and street imagery with both effectiveness and transferability achieved, which provides insights into urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction.

Based on this, our study proves that compared to standard deep neural networks (DNNs), it is less likely for BNNs to encode complex concepts. Experiments verify our theoretical proofs. Note that the tendency to encode less complex concepts does not necessarily imply weak representation power, considering that complex concepts exhibit low generalization power and high adversarial vulnerability.

Despite their success, these methods still ignore the disturbance of sentences with non-relevant topics and only conduct cross-interaction between tokens by attention module. To address this issue, we propose a topic-arc recognition objective and topic-selective graph network. First, the topic-arc recognition objective is used to model training, which endows the capability to discriminate topics for the model. Moreover, the topic-selective graph network can conduct topic-guided cross-interaction on sentences based on the results of topic-arc recognition.

    "abstract": "Datacenter networks are becoming increasingly flexible with the incorporation of new networking technologies, such as optical circuit switches. These technologies allow for programmable network topologies that can be reconfigured to better serve network traffic, thus enabling a trade-off between the benefits (i.e., shorter routes) and costs of reconfigurations (i.e., overhead). Self-Adjusting Networks (SANs) aim at addressing this trade-off by exploiting patterns in network traffic, both when it is revealed piecewise (online dynamic topologies) or known in advance (offline static topologies). In this paper, we take the first steps toward Self-Adjusting k-ary tree networks. These are more powerful generalizations of existing binary search tree networks (like SplayNets), which have been at the core of SAN designs. k-ary search tree networks are a natural generalization offering nodes of higher degrees, reduced route lengths for a fixed number of nodes, and local routing in spite of reconfigurations. We first compute an offline (optimal) static network for arbitrary traffic patterns in $O(n^3 \\cdot k)$ time via dynamic programming, and also improve the bound to $O(n^2 \\cdot k)$ for the special case of uniformly distributed traffic. Then, we present a centroid-based topology of the network that can be used both in the offline static and the online setting. In the offline uniform-workload case, we construct this quasi-optimal network in linear time $O(n)$ and, finally, we present online self-adjusting k-ary search tree versions of SplayNet. We evaluate experimentally our new structure for $k=2$ (allowing for a comparison with existing SplayNets) on real and synthetic network traces. Our results show that this approach works better than SplayNet in most of the real network traces and in average to low locality synthetic traces, and is only little inferior to SplayNet in all remaining traces.

In the encoding process, most existing QE methods first parse the logical query into an executable computational direct-acyclic graph (DAG), then use neural networks to parameterize the operators, and finally, recursively execute these neuralized operators. However, the parameterization-and-execution paradigm may be potentially over-complicated, as it can be structurally simplified by a single neural network encoder. Meanwhile, sequence encoders, like LSTM and Transformer, proved to be effective for encoding semantic graphs in related tasks. Motivated by this, we propose sequential query encoding (SQE) as an alternative to encode queries for CQA. Instead of parameterizing and executing the computational graph, SQE first uses a search-based algorithm to linearize the computational graph to a sequence of tokens and then uses a sequence encoder to compute its vector representation. Then this vector representation is used as a query embedding to retrieve answers from the embedding space according to similarity scores. Despite its simplicity, SQE demonstrates state-of-the-art neural query encoding performance on FB15k, FB15k-237, and NELL on an extended benchmark including twenty-nine types of in-distribution queries. Further experiment shows that SQE also demonstrates comparable knowledge inference capability on out-of-distribution queries, whose query types are not observed during the training process. ",

Unlike the popular $k$-means, graph-based clustering methods do not assume that each cluster has a single mean. However, these methods need a graph where vertices in the same cluster are connected by edges of large weights. To achieve this goal, many studies have proposed graph reduction methods with parameters. Unfortunately, these parameters have to be tuned for every dataset. We introduce a graph reduction method that does not require any parameters. First, the distances from every point $p$ to its neighbors are filtered using an adaptive threshold to only keep neighbors with similar surrounding density. Second, the similarities with close neighbors are computed and only high similarities are kept. The edges that survive these two filtering steps form the constructed graph that was passed to spectral clustering and SpectralNet. The experiments showed that our method provides a stable alternative, where other methods performance fluctuated according to the setting of their parameters. ",

Points were scored when accurate detections and their locations were communicated back to the scoring server. A total of 8 teams competed in the finals held at the Mega Cavern in Louisville, KY, USA. This article describes the systems deployed by Team CSIRO Data61 that tied for the top score and won second place at the event. ",

    "abstract": "APT traffic detection is an important task in network security domain, which is of great significance in the field of enterprise security. Most APT traffic uses encrypted communication protocol as data transmission medium, which greatly increases the difficulty of detection. This paper analyzes the existing problems of current APT encrypted traffic detection methods based on machine learning, and proposes an APT encrypted traffic detection method based on two parties and multi-session. This method only needs to extract a small amount of features, such as session sequence, session time interval, upstream and downstream data size, and convert them into images. Then convolutional neural network method can be used to realize image recognition. Thus, network traffic identification can be realized too. In the preliminary test of five experiments, this method achieves good experimental results, which verifies the effectiveness of the method. ",

Very recently, an unexpected phenomenon, the ``double descent'', has caught the attention of the deep learning community. As the model's size grows, the performance gets first worse, and then goes back to improving. It raises serious questions about the optimal model's size to maintain high generalization: the model needs to be sufficiently over-parametrized, but adding too many parameters wastes training resources. Is it possible to find, in an efficient way, the best trade-off? Our work shows that the double descent phenomenon is potentially avoidable with proper conditioning of the learning problem, but a final answer is yet to be found. We empirically observe that there is hope to dodge the double descent in complex scenarios with proper regularization, as a simple $\\ell_2$ regularization is already positively contributing to such a perspective.

To mitigate this issue, we propose disentangling dynamic states from time-invariant variables in a completely data-driven way, enabling robust neural ODE models that can generalize across different settings. We show that such variables can control the latent differential function and/or parameterize the mapping from latent variables to observations. By explicitly modeling the time-invariant variables, our framework enables the use of recent advances in representation learning. We demonstrate this by introducing a straightforward self-supervised objective that enhances the learning of these variables. The experiments on low-dimensional oscillating systems and video sequences reveal that our disentangled model achieves improved long-term predictions, when the training data involve sequence-specific factors of variation such as different rotational speeds, calligraphic styles, and friction constants.

Pixel-wise semantic segmentation-based approaches and graph-based approaches are two prevailing schemes. However, prior works show the imperfections that semantic segmentation-based approaches yield road graphs with low connectivity, while graph-based methods with iterative exploring paradigms and smaller receptive fields focus more on local information and are also time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for multi-task satellite imagery road extraction, Patch-wise Road Keypoints Detection (PaRK-Detect). Building on top of D-LinkNet architecture and adopting the structure of keypoint detection, our framework predicts the position of patch-wise road keypoints and the adjacent relationships between them to construct road graphs in a single pass. Meanwhile, the multi-task framework also performs pixel-wise semantic segmentation and generates road segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach against the existing state-of-the-art methods on DeepGlobe, Massachusetts Roads, and RoadTracer datasets and achieve competitive or better results. We also demonstrate a considerable outperformance in terms of inference speed. ",

While offering valuable features, these DNS variants are operated by a handful of providers, reinforcing a trend towards centralization that has raised concerns about privacy, competition, resilience and Web QoE. The goal of this work is to let users take advantage of third-party DNS services, without sacrificing privacy or performance. We follow Wheeler's advice, adding another level of indirection with an end-system DNS resolver, Onoma, that improves privacy, avoiding DNS-based user-reidentification by inserting and sharding requests across resolvers, and improves performance by running resolution races among resolvers and reinstating the client-resolver proximity assumption content delivery networks rely on. As our evaluation shows, while there may not be an ideal service for all clients in all places, Onoma dynamically finds the best service for any given location. ",

However, painting directly on 3D faces and capturing real-world makeup are costly, and extracting makeup from 2D images often struggles with shading effects and occlusions. This paper presents the first method for extracting makeup for 3D facial models from a single makeup portrait. Our method consists of the following three steps. First, we exploit the strong prior of 3D morphable models via regression-based inverse rendering to extract coarse materials such as geometry and diffuse/specular albedos that are represented in the UV space. Second, we refine the coarse materials, which may have missing pixels due to occlusions. We apply inpainting and optimization. Finally, we extract the bare skin, makeup, and an alpha matte from the diffuse albedo. Our method offers various applications for not only 3D facial models but also 2D portrait images. The extracted makeup is well-aligned in the UV space, from which we build a large-scale makeup dataset and a parametric makeup model for 3D faces. Our disentangled materials also yield robust makeup transfer and illumination-aware makeup interpolation/removal without a reference image. ",

A reliable Deepfake detection approach must be agnostic to generation types, which can present diverse quality and appearance. Limited generalizability across different generation schemes will restrict the wide-scale deployment of detectors if they fail to handle unseen attacks in an open set scenario. We propose a new approach, Multi-Channel Xception Attention Pairwise Interaction (MCX-API), that exploits the power of pairwise learning and complementary information from different color space representations in a fine-grained manner. We first validate our idea on a publicly available dataset in a intra-class setting (closed set) with four different Deepfake schemes. Further, we report all the results using balanced-open-set-classification (BOSC) accuracy in an inter-class setting (open-set) using three public datasets. Our experiments indicate that our proposed method can generalize better than the state-of-the-art Deepfakes detectors. We obtain 98.48% BOSC accuracy on the FF++ dataset and 90.87% BOSC accuracy on the CelebDF dataset suggesting a promising direction for generalization of DeepFake detection.

These nodes are called Structural Hole Spanners (SHS). Numerous solutions are proposed to discover SHSs; however, most of the solutions are only applicable to static networks. Since real-world networks are dynamic networks; consequently, in this study, we aim to discover SHSs in dynamic networks. Discovering SHSs is an NP-hard problem, due to which, instead of discovering exact k SHSs, we adopt a greedy approach to discover Top-k SHSs. We first propose an efficient Tracking-SHS algorithm for updating SHSs in dynamic networks. Our algorithm reuses the information obtained during the initial runs of the static algorithm and avoids the recomputations for the nodes unaffected by the updates. Besides, motivated from the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on various graph mining problems, we also design a Graph Neural Network-based model, GNN-SHS, to discover SHSs in dynamic networks, aiming to reduce the computational cost while achieving high accuracy. We provide a theoretical analysis of the Tracking-SHS algorithm, and our theoretical results prove that for a particular type of graphs, such as Preferential Attachment graphs [1], Tracking-SHS algorithm achieves 1.6 times of speedup compared with the static algorithm. We perform extensive experiments, and our results demonstrate that the Tracking-SHS algorithm attains a minimum of 3.24 times speedup over the static algorithm. Also, the proposed second model GNN-SHS is on an average 671.6 times faster than the Tracking-SHS algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "The performance of point cloud 3D object detection hinges on effectively representing raw points, grid-based voxels or pillars. Recent two-stage 3D detectors typically take the point-voxel-based R-CNN paradigm, i.e., the first stage resorts to the 3D voxel-based backbone for 3D proposal generation on bird-eye-view (BEV) representation and the second stage refines them via the intermediate point representation. Their primary mechanisms involve the utilization of intermediary keypoints to restore the substantial 3D structure context from the converted BEV representation. The skilled point-voxel feature interaction, however, makes the entire detection pipeline more complex and compute-intensive. In this paper, we take a different viewpoint -- the pillar-based BEV representation owns sufficient capacity to preserve the 3D structure. In light of the latest advances in BEV-based perception, we devise a conceptually simple yet effective two-stage 3D detection architecture, named Pillar R-CNN. On top of densified BEV feature maps, Pillar R-CNN can easily introduce the feature pyramid architecture to generate 3D proposals at various scales and take the simple 2D R-CNN style detect head for box refinement. Our Pillar R-CNN performs favorably against state-of-the-art 3D detectors on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset but at a small extra cost. It should be highlighted that further exploration into BEV perception for applications involving autonomous driving is now possible thanks to the effective and elegant Pillar R-CNN architecture. ",

Modern machine learning techniques can be leveraged to provide rapid and accurate detection of these imperfections. We, therefore, propose a transfer learning approach, namely TransferD2, to correctly identify defects on a dataset of source objects and extend its application to new unseen target objects. We present a data enhancement technique to generate a large dataset from the small source dataset for building a classifier. We then integrate three different pre-trained models (Xception, ResNet101V2, and InceptionResNetV2) into the classifier network and compare their performance on source and target data. We use the classifier to detect the presence of imperfections on the unseen target data using pseudo-bounding boxes. Our results show that ResNet101V2 performs best on the source data with an accuracy of 95.72%. Xception performs best on the target data with an accuracy of 91.00% and also provides a more accurate prediction of the defects on the target images. Throughout the experiment, the results also indicate that the choice of a pre-trained model is not dependent on the depth of the network. Our proposed approach can be applied in defect detection applications where insufficient data is available for training a model and can be extended to identify imperfections in new unseen data. ",

At present, Deep neural network training strongly depends on data augmentation to improve the model's generalization capability and avoid over-fitting. However, existing data augmentation operations, such as rotation, gamma correction, etc., are designed based on the original data, which does not substantially increase the data diversity. In this paper, we propose a learning model based on the convolutional Auto-Encoder and a hybrid loss strategy to generate new data for early KOA (KL-0 vs KL-2) diagnosis. Four hidden layers are designed among the encoder and decoder, which represent the key and unrelated features of each input, respectively. Then, two key feature vectors are exchanged to obtain the generated images. To do this, a hybrid loss function is derived using different loss functions with optimized weights to supervise the reconstruction and key-exchange learning. Experimental results show that the generated data are valid as they can significantly improve the model's classification performance. ",

Therefore, this paper proposes a better approach of using heterogeneous wireless networks consisting of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Mobile Cellular Networks (MCNs) for IoT/M2M smart building systems. One of the most significant outcomes of this research is to provide accurate readings to the server, and very low latency, through which users can easily control and monitor remotely the proposed system that consists of several innovative services, namely smart parking, garden irrigation automation, intrusion alarm, smart door, fire and gas detection, smart lighting, smart medication reminder, and indoor air quality monitoring. All these services are designed and implemented to control and monitor from afar the building via our free mobile application named Raniso which is a local server that allows remote control of the building. This IoT/M2M smart building system is customizable to meet the needs of users, improving safety and quality of life while reducing energy consumption. Additionally, it helps prevent the loss of resources and human lives by detecting and managing risks. ",

    "abstract": "Forward and inverse kinematics models are fundamental to robot arms, serving as the basis for the robot arm's operational tasks. However, in model learning of robot arms, especially in the presence of redundant degrees of freedom, inverse model learning is more challenging than forward model learning due to the non-convex problem caused by multiple solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework for autonomous learning of the robot arm inverse model based on embodied self-supervised learning (EMSSL) with sampling and training coordination. We investigate batch inference and parallel computation strategies for data sampling in order to accelerate model learning and propose two approaches for fast adaptation of the robot arm model. A series of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method we proposed. The related code will be available soon. ",

    "abstract": "Cognitive and psychological studies on morality have proposed underlying linguistic and semantic factors. However, laboratory experiments in the philosophical literature often lack the nuances and complexity of real life. This paper examines how well the findings of these cognitive studies generalize to a corpus of over 30,000 narratives of tense social situations submitted to a popular social media forum. These narratives describe interpersonal moral situations or misgivings; other users judge from the post whether the author (protagonist) or the opposing side (antagonist) is morally culpable. Whereas previous work focuses on predicting the polarity of normative behaviors, we extend and apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the effects of descriptions of the people involved in these posts. We conduct extensive experiments to investigate the effect sizes of features to understand how they affect the assignment of blame on social media. Our findings show that aggregating psychology theories enables understanding real-life moral situations. Moreover, our results suggest that there exist biases in blame assignment on social media, such as males are more likely to receive blame no matter whether they are protagonists or antagonists. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in scientific machine learning have shed light on the modeling of pattern-forming systems. However, simulations of real patterns still incur significant computational costs, which could be alleviated by leveraging large image datasets. Physics-informed machine learning and operator learning are two new emerging and promising concepts for this application. Here, we propose \"Phase-Field DeepONet\", a physics-informed operator neural network framework that predicts the dynamic responses of systems governed by gradient flows of free-energy functionals. Examples used to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the method include the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations, as special cases of reactive phase-field models for nonequilibrium thermodynamics of chemical mixtures. This is achieved by incorporating the minimizing movement scheme into the framework, which optimizes and controls how the total free energy of a system evolves, instead of solving the governing equations directly. The trained operator neural networks can work as explicit time-steppers that take the current state as the input and output the next state. This could potentially facilitate fast real-time predictions of pattern-forming dynamical systems, such as phase-separating Li-ion batteries, emulsions, colloidal displays, or biological patterns. ",

The recent technological advancements in electro-optical engineering have aided in obtaining laser returns at a higher pulse repetition frequency (PRF), which considerably increased the density of the 3D point cloud. Conventional techniques with lower PRF had a single pulse-in-air (SPIA) zone, large enough to avoid a mismatch among pulse pairs at the receiver. New multiple pulses-in-air (MPIA) technology guarantees various windows of operational ranges for a single flight line and no blind zones. The disadvantage of the technology is the projection of atmospheric returns closer to the same pulse-in-air zone of adjacent terrain points likely to intersect with objects of interest. These noise properties compromise the perceived quality of the scene and encourage the development of new noise-filtering neural networks, as existing filters are significantly ineffective. We propose a novel dual-attention noise-filtering neural network called Noise Seeking Attention Network (NSANet) that uses physical priors and local spatial attention to filter noise. Our research is motivated by two psychology theories of feature integration and attention engagement to prove the role of attention in computer vision at the encoding and decoding phase. The presented results of NSANet show the inclination towards attention engagement theory and a performance boost compared to the state-of-the-art noise-filtering deep convolutional neural networks.

Borrowed from the neural representation field community (NeRF), we investigate the robustness of calculating the derivatives of such hash encoded neural networks with respect to the input coordinates, which is often needed by the PINN loss terms. We propose to replace the automatic differentiation with finite-difference calculations of the derivatives to address the discontinuous nature of such derivatives. We also share the appropriate ranges for the hash encoding hyperparameters to obtain robust derivatives. We test the proposed method on three problems, including Burgers equation, Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equation. The proposed method admits about a 10-fold improvement in efficiency over the vanilla PINN implementation. ",

    "abstract": "Graph unlearning, which involves deleting graph elements such as nodes, node labels, and relationships from a trained graph neural network (GNN) model, is crucial for real-world applications where data elements may become irrelevant, inaccurate, or privacy-sensitive. However, existing methods for graph unlearning either deteriorate model weights shared across all nodes or fail to effectively delete edges due to their strong dependence on local graph neighborhoods. To address these limitations, we introduce GNNDelete, a novel model-agnostic layer-wise operator that optimizes two critical properties, namely, Deleted Edge Consistency and Neighborhood Influence, for graph unlearning. Deleted Edge Consistency ensures that the influence of deleted elements is removed from both model weights and neighboring representations, while Neighborhood Influence guarantees that the remaining model knowledge is preserved after deletion. GNNDelete updates representations to delete nodes and edges from the model while retaining the rest of the learned knowledge. We conduct experiments on seven real-world graphs, showing that GNNDelete outperforms existing approaches by up to 38.8% (AUC) on edge, node, and node feature deletion tasks, and 32.2% on distinguishing deleted edges from non-deleted ones. Additionally, GNNDelete is efficient, taking 12.3x less time and 9.3x less space than retraining GNN from scratch on WordNet18. ",

Efficient prediction methods are especially crucial when testing large sets of candidate trajectories. We present a prediction method that has the same accuracy as existing methods, but up to an order of magnitude faster. This is achieved by rewriting the conflict prediction problem in terms of the first-passage time distribution using a dimension-reduction transform. First-passage time distributions are analytically derived for a subset of Gaussian processes describing vehicle motion. The proposed method is applicable to 2-D stochastic processes where the mean can be approximated by line segments, and the conflict boundary can be approximated by piece-wise straight lines. The proposed method was tested in simulation and compared to two probability flow methods, as well as a recent instantaneous conflict probability method.

However, it is also well-recognized that DNNs sometimes make unexpected, incorrect, but overconfident predictions. This can cause serious consequences in high-stake applications, such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and disaster response. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) aims to estimate the confidence of DNN predictions beyond prediction accuracy. In recent years, many UQ methods have been developed for DNNs. It is of great practical value to systematically categorize these UQ methods and compare their advantages and disadvantages. However, existing surveys mostly focus on categorizing UQ methodologies from a neural network architecture perspective or a Bayesian perspective and ignore the source of uncertainty that each methodology can incorporate, making it difficult to select an appropriate UQ method in practice. To fill the gap, this paper presents a systematic taxonomy of UQ methods for DNNs based on the types of uncertainty sources (data uncertainty versus model uncertainty). We summarize the advantages and disadvantages of methods in each category. We show how our taxonomy of UQ methodologies can potentially help guide the choice of UQ method in different machine learning problems (e.g., active learning, robustness, and reinforcement learning). We also identify current research gaps and propose several future research directions. ",

As a result, researchers began to notice the importance of using RGB or other sensors to analyze human action by extracting skeleton information.

However, a well-trained DL model always demands high-quality and sufficient data, which is hard to obtain without costing high expenses and human labor. In this paper, we introduce a novel data augmentation method for skeleton-based action recognition tasks, which can effectively generate high-quality and diverse sequential actions. In order to obtain natural and realistic action sequences, we propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) that can generate a series of synthetic action sequences, and their generation process is precisely guided by a spatial-temporal transformer (ST-Trans). Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) motion generation approaches on different naturality and diversity metrics.

In this paper, we design and implement P4L: a privacy preserving peer-to-peer learning system for users to participate in an asynchronous, collaborative learning scheme without requiring any sort of infrastructure or relying on differential privacy. Our design uses strong cryptographic primitives to preserve both the confidentiality and utility of the shared gradients, a set of peer-to-peer mechanisms for fault tolerance and user churn, proximity and cross device communications. Extensive simulations under different network settings and ML scenarios for three real-life datasets show that P4L provides competitive performance to baselines, while it is resilient to different poisoning attacks. We implement P4L and experimental results show that the performance overhead and power consumption is minimal (less than 3mAh of discharge). ",

However, real-world time-series data often include missing values, and the existing approaches require imputing missing values before clustering, which may cause extensive computations and noise and result in invalid interpretations. To address these challenges, we present a Self-supervised Learning-based Approach to Clustering multivariate Time-series data with missing values (SLAC-Time). SLAC-Time is a Transformer-based clustering method that uses time-series forecasting as a proxy task for leveraging unlabeled data and learning more robust time-series representations. This method jointly learns the neural network parameters and the cluster assignments of the learned representations. It iteratively clusters the learned representations with the K-means method and then utilizes the subsequent cluster assignments as pseudo-labels to update the model parameters. To evaluate our proposed approach, we applied it to clustering and phenotyping Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients in the TRACK-TBI dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that SLAC-Time outperforms the baseline K-means clustering algorithm in terms of silhouette coefficient, Calinski Harabasz index, Dunn index, and Davies Bouldin index. We identified three TBI phenotypes that are distinct from one another in terms of clinically significant variables as well as clinical outcomes, including the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) score, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay, and mortality rate. The experiments show that the TBI phenotypes identified by SLAC-Time can be potentially used for developing targeted clinical trials and therapeutic strategies. ",

First, substantial performance degradation is observed when the coming directions of two sounds are close. Second, the result highly relies on the precise estimation of the speaker's direction. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes 3D features and an associated 3D neural beamformer for multi-channel speech separation. Previous works in this area are extended in two important directions. First, the traditional 1D directional beam patterns are generalized to 3D. This enables the model to extract speech from any target region in the 3D space. Thus, speakers with similar directions but different elevations or distances become separable. Second, to handle the speaker location uncertainty, previously proposed spatial feature is extended to a new 3D region feature. The proposed 3D region feature and 3D neural beamformer are evaluated under an in-car scenario. Experimental results demonstrated that the combination of 3D feature and 3D beamformer can achieve comparable performance to the separation model with ground truth speaker location as input. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a new technique for computational language representation called elementwise embedding, in which a material (semantic unit) is abstracted into a horizontal concatenation of lower-dimensional element (character) embeddings. While elements are always characters, materials are arbitrary levels of semantic units so it generalizes to any type of tokenization. To focus only on the important letters, the $n^{th}$ spellings of each semantic unit are aligned in $n^{th}$ attention heads, then concatenated back into original forms creating unique embedding representations; they are jointly projected thereby determining own contextual importance. Technically, this framework is achieved by passing a sequence of materials, each consists of $v$ elements, to a transformer having $h=v$ attention heads. As a pure embedding technique, elementwise embedding replaces the $w$-dimensional embedding table of a transformer model with $256$ $c$-dimensional elements (each corresponding to one of UTF-8 bytes) where $c=w/v$. Using this novel approach, we show that the standard transformer architecture can be reused for all levels of language representations and be able to process much longer sequences at the same time-complexity without \"any\" architectural modification and additional overhead. BERT trained with elementwise embedding outperforms its subword equivalence (original implementation) in multilabel patent document classification exhibiting superior robustness to domain-specificity and data imbalance, despite using $0.005\\%$ of embedding parameters. Experiments demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method by successfully transferring these enhancements to differently architected transformers CANINE and ALBERT. ",

Often, operators are interested in understanding the impact of a controller's actions on performance in the future, which feature-based solutions cannot capture. In this paper, we present CrystalBox, a framework that explains a controller's behavior in terms of the future impact on key network performance metrics. CrystalBox employs a novel learning-based approach to generate succinct and expressive explanations. We use reward components of the DRL network controller, which are key performance metrics meaningful to operators, as the basis for explanations. CrystalBox is generalizable and can work across both discrete and continuous control environments without any changes to the controller or the DRL workflow. Using adaptive bitrate streaming and congestion control, we demonstrate CrytalBox's ability to generate high-fidelity future-based explanations.

We propose an innovative contextual attack method against aerial detection in real scenarios, which achieves powerful attack performance and transfers well between various aerial object detectors without smearing or blocking the interested objects to hide. Based on the findings that the targets' contextual information plays an important role in aerial detection by observing the detectors' attention maps, we propose to make full use of the contextual area of the interested targets to elaborate contextual perturbations for the uncovered attacks in real scenarios. Extensive proportionally scaled experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed contextual attack method, which demonstrates the proposed method's superiority in both attack efficacy and physical practicality.

    "title": "CBA: Contextual Background Attack against Optical Aerial Detection in  the Physical World",
    "abstract": "Patch-based physical attacks have increasingly aroused concerns. However, most existing methods focus on obscuring targets captured on the ground, and some of these methods are simply extended to deceive aerial detectors. They smear the targeted objects in the physical world with the elaborated adversarial patches, which can only slightly sway the aerial detectors' prediction and with weak attack transferability. To address the above issues, we propose to perform Contextual Background Attack (CBA), a novel physical attack framework against aerial detection, which can achieve strong attack efficacy and transferability in the physical world even without smudging the interested objects at all. Specifically, the targets of interest, i.e. the aircraft in aerial images, are adopted to mask adversarial patches. The pixels outside the mask area are optimized to make the generated adversarial patches closely cover the critical contextual background area for detection, which contributes to gifting adversarial patches with more robust and transferable attack potency in the real world. To further strengthen the attack performance, the adversarial patches are forced to be outside targets during training, by which the detected objects of interest, both on and outside patches, benefit the accumulation of attack efficacy. Consequently, the sophisticatedly designed patches are gifted with solid fooling efficacy against objects both on and outside the adversarial patches simultaneously. Extensive proportionally scaled experiments are performed in physical scenarios, demonstrating the superiority and potential of the proposed framework for physical attacks. We expect that the proposed physical attack method will serve as a benchmark for assessing the adversarial robustness of diverse aerial detectors and defense methods. ",

    "abstract": "Bit-flip attacks (BFAs) have attracted substantial attention recently, in which an adversary could tamper with a small number of model parameter bits to break the integrity of DNNs. To mitigate such threats, a batch of defense methods are proposed, focusing on the untargeted scenarios. Unfortunately, they either require extra trustworthy applications or make models more vulnerable to targeted BFAs. Countermeasures against targeted BFAs, stealthier and more purposeful by nature, are far from well established. In this work, we propose Aegis, a novel defense method to mitigate targeted BFAs. The core observation is that existing targeted attacks focus on flipping critical bits in certain important layers. Thus, we design a dynamic-exit mechanism to attach extra internal classifiers (ICs) to hidden layers. This mechanism enables input samples to early-exit from different layers, which effectively upsets the adversary's attack plans. Moreover, the dynamic-exit mechanism randomly selects ICs for predictions during each inference to significantly increase the attack cost for the adaptive attacks where all defense mechanisms are transparent to the adversary. We further propose a robustness training strategy to adapt ICs to the attack scenarios by simulating BFAs during the IC training phase, to increase model robustness. Extensive evaluations over four well-known datasets and two popular DNN structures reveal that Aegis could effectively mitigate different state-of-the-art targeted attacks, reducing attack success rate by 5-10$\\times$, significantly outperforming existing defense methods.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown high potential for a variety of real-world, challenging applications, but one of the major obstacles in GNN research is the lack of large-scale flexible datasets. Most existing public datasets for GNNs are relatively small, which limits the ability of GNNs to generalize to unseen data. The few existing large-scale graph datasets provide very limited labeled data. This makes it difficult to determine if the GNN model's low accuracy for unseen data is inherently due to insufficient training data or if the model failed to generalize. Additionally, datasets used to train GNNs need to offer flexibility to enable a thorough study of the impact of various factors while training GNN models. In this work, we introduce the Illinois Graph Benchmark (IGB), a research dataset tool that the developers can use to train, scrutinize and systematically evaluate GNN models with high fidelity. IGB includes both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs of enormous sizes, with more than 40% of their nodes labeled. Compared to the largest graph datasets publicly available, the IGB provides over 162X more labeled data for deep learning practitioners and developers to create and evaluate models with higher accuracy. The IGB dataset is designed to be flexible, enabling the study of various GNN architectures, embedding generation techniques, and analyzing system performance issues. IGB is open-sourced, supports DGL and PyG frameworks, and comes with releases of the raw text that we believe foster emerging language models and GNN research projects. An early public version of IGB is available at https://github.com/IllinoisGraphBenchmark/IGB-Datasets. ",

In a dialog based attack, by having enough of a potential victim's personal data to be convincing, a social engineer impersonates the victim in order to manipulate the attack's target into revealing sufficient information for accessing the victim's accounts etc. We utilise the developing understanding of human information processing in the Information Sciences to characterise the vulnerability of the target to manipulation and to propose a form of countermeasure. Our focus is on the possibility of the social engineer being able to build the victim's profile by, in part, inferring personal attribute values from statistical information available either informally, from general knowledge, or, more formally, from some public database. We use an orthogonalised log linear analysis of data in the form of a contingence table to develop a measure of how susceptible particular subtables are to probabilistic inference as the basis for our proposed countermeasure. This is based on the observation that inference relies on a high degree of non-uniformity and exploits the orthogonality of the analysis to define the measure in terms of subspace projections. ",

However, in many applications, only a subset of all input permutations is of interest. For heterogeneous graph data, one can focus on permutations that preserve node types. We fully characterize linear layers invariant to such permutations. We verify experimentally that implementing these layers in graph neural network architectures allows learning important node interactions more effectively than existing techniques. We show that the dimension of space of these layers is given by a generalization of Bell numbers, extending the work (Maron et al., 2019). We further narrow the invariant network design space by addressing a question about the sizes of tensor layers necessary for function approximation on graph data. Our findings suggest that function approximation on a graph with $n$ nodes can be done with tensors of sizes $\\leq n$, which is tighter than the best-known bound $\\leq n(n-1)/2$. For $d \\times d$ image data with translation symmetry, our methods give a tight upper bound $2d - 1$ (instead of $d^{4}$) on sizes of invariant tensor generators via a surprising connection to Davenport constants.

    "abstract": "Attending to the speech stream of interest in multi-talker environments can be a challenging task, particularly for listeners with hearing impairment. Research suggests that neural responses assessed with electroencephalography (EEG) are modulated by listener`s auditory attention, revealing selective neural tracking (NT) of the attended speech. NT methods mostly rely on hand-engineered acoustic and linguistic speech features to predict the neural response. Only recently, deep neural network (DNN) models without specific linguistic information have been used to extract speech features for NT, demonstrating that speech features in hierarchical DNN layers can predict neural responses throughout the auditory pathway. In this study, we go one step further to investigate the suitability of similar DNN models for speech to predict neural responses to competing speech observed in EEG. We recorded EEG data using a 64-channel acquisition system from 17 listeners with normal hearing instructed to attend to one of two competing talkers. Our data revealed that EEG responses are significantly better predicted by DNN-extracted speech features than by hand-engineered acoustic features. Furthermore, analysis of hierarchical DNN layers showed that early layers yielded the highest predictions. Moreover, we found a significant increase in auditory attention classification accuracies with the use of DNN-extracted speech features over the use of hand-engineered acoustic features. These findings open a new avenue for development of new NT measures to evaluate and further advance hearing technology. ",

    "abstract": "Humans can accurately determine whether the object in hand has slipped or not by visual and tactile perception. However, it is still a challenge for robots to detect in-hand object slip through visuo-tactile fusion. To address this issue, a novel visuo-tactile fusion deep neural network is proposed to detect slip, which is a time-dependent continuous action. By using the multi-scale temporal convolution network (MS-TCN) to extract the temporal features of visual and tactile data, the slip can be detected effectively. In this paper, a 7-dregree-of-freedom (7-DoF) robot manipulator equipped with a camera and a tactile sensor is used for data collection on 50 daily objects with different shapes, materials, sizes, and weights. Therefore, a dataset is built, where the grasping data of 40 objects and 10 objects are used for network training and testing, respectively. The detection accuracy is 96.96% based on the proposed model. Also, the proposed model is compared with a visuo-tactile fusion deep neural network (DNN) based on long short-term memory network (LSTM) on the collected dataset and a public dataset using the GelSight tactile sensor. The results demonstrate that the proposed model performs better on both dataset. The proposed model can help robots grasp daily objects reliably. In addition, it can be used in grasping force control, grasping policy generation and dexterous manipulation. ",

At the same time, it is known that current DNNs can be fooled by adversarial attacks, which raises safety concerns if those attacks can be applied under realistic conditions. In this work we apply different black-box attack methods to generate perturbations that are applied in the physical environment and can be used to fool systems under different environmental conditions. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to combine a general framework for physical attacks with different black-box attack methods and study the impact of the different methods on the success rate of the attack under the same setting. We show that reliable physical adversarial attacks can be performed with different methods and that it is also possible to reduce the perceptibility of the resulting perturbations. The findings highlight the need for viable defenses of a DNN even in the black-box case, but at the same time form the basis for securing a DNN with methods like adversarial training which utilizes adversarial attacks to augment the original training data.

    "abstract": "Outdoor 3D object detection has played an essential role in the environment perception of autonomous driving. In complicated traffic situations, precise object recognition provides indispensable information for prediction and planning in the dynamic system, improving self-driving safety and reliability. However, with the vehicle's veering, the constant rotation of the surrounding scenario makes a challenge for the perception systems. Yet most existing methods have not focused on alleviating the detection accuracy impairment brought by the vehicle's rotation, especially in outdoor 3D detection. In this paper, we propose DuEqNet, which first introduces the concept of equivariance into 3D object detection network by leveraging a hierarchical embedded framework. The dual-equivariance of our model can extract the equivariant features at both local and global levels, respectively. For the local feature, we utilize the graph-based strategy to guarantee the equivariance of the feature in point cloud pillars. In terms of the global feature, the group equivariant convolution layers are adopted to aggregate the local feature to achieve the global equivariance. In the experiment part, we evaluate our approach with different baselines in 3D object detection tasks and obtain State-Of-The-Art performance. According to the results, our model presents higher accuracy on orientation and better prediction efficiency. Moreover, our dual-equivariance strategy exhibits the satisfied plug-and-play ability on various popular object detection frameworks to improve their performance. ",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving (AD) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) increasingly utilize deep neural networks (DNNs) for improved perception or planning. Nevertheless, DNNs are quite brittle when the data distribution during inference deviates from the data distribution during training. This represents a challenge when deploying in partly unknown environments like in the case of ADAS. At the same time, the standard confidence of DNNs remains high even if the classification reliability decreases. This is problematic since following motion control algorithms consider the apparently confident prediction as reliable even though it might be considerably wrong. To reduce this problem real-time capable confidence estimation is required that better aligns with the actual reliability of the DNN classification. Additionally, the need exists for black-box confidence estimation to enable the homogeneous inclusion of externally developed components to an entire system. In this work we explore this use case and introduce the neighborhood confidence (NHC) which estimates the confidence of an arbitrary DNN for classification. The metric can be used for black-box systems since only the top-1 class output is required and does not need access to the gradients, the training dataset or a hold-out validation dataset. Evaluation on different data distributions, including small in-domain distribution shifts, out-of-domain data or adversarial attacks, shows that the NHC performs better or on par with a comparable method for online white-box confidence estimation in low data regimes which is required for real-time capable AD/ADAS.

This limits their adoption to only identifying connections among the input variables. On the other hand, the Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) assumes an underlying base graph between variables and learns a distribution over them. PGM design choices are carefully made such that the inference & sampling algorithms are efficient. This brings in certain restrictions and often simplifying assumptions. In this work, we propose Neural Graph Revealers (NGRs), that are an attempt to efficiently merge the sparse graph recovery methods with PGMs into a single flow. The problem setting consists of an input data X with D features and M samples and the task is to recover a sparse graph showing connection between the features. NGRs view the neural networks as a `white box' or more specifically as a multitask learning framework. We introduce `Graph-constrained path norm' that NGRs leverage to learn a graphical model that captures complex non-linear functional dependencies between the features in the form of an undirected sparse graph. Furthermore, NGRs can handle multimodal inputs like images, text, categorical data, embeddings etc. which is not straightforward to incorporate in the existing methods.

A unique quality of this task is a causal loop between the robots' dynamic network topology and their decision-making. For example, the network's mean node degree influences time to convergence while the currently agreed-on mean value influences the swarm's aggregation location, hence, also the network structure as well as the precision error.

Our attacks refute the pre-image resistance, anonymity, and privacy guarantees claimed for these systems. In the case of FLoC, we show how to deanonymize users using Sybil attacks and to reconstruct 10% or more of the browsing history for 30% of its users using Generative Adversarial Networks. We achieve this only analyzing the hashes used by FLoC. For MinHash, we precisely identify the movement of a subset of individuals and, on average, we can limit users' movement to just 10% of the possible geographic area, again using just the hashes.

Content in these systems is often co-owned by multiple users with different privacy expectations, leading to possible multiuser privacy conflicts. In order to resolve these conflicts, various agreement mechanisms have been designed and agents that could participate in such mechanisms have been proposed. However, research shows that users hesitate to use software tools for managing their privacy. To remedy this, we argue that users should be supported by trustworthy agents that adhere to the following criteria: (i) concealment of privacy preferences, such that only necessary information is shared with others, (ii) equity of treatment, such that different kinds of users are supported equally, (iii) collaboration of users, such that a group of users can support each other in agreement and (iv) explainability of actions, such that users know why certain information about them was shared to reach a decision. Accordingly, this paper proposes PACCART, an open-source agent that satisfies these criteria. Our experiments over simulations and user study indicate that PACCART increases user trust significantly.

Fine-grained video-text communication is done by additional cross-modal interaction modules. 3) It is optimized by the joint fully- and self-supervised contrastive objectives between the correct and incorrect answers, as well as the relevant and irrelevant questions respectively. With superior video encoding and QA solution, we show that CoVGT can achieve much better performances than previous arts on video reasoning tasks. Its performances even surpass those models that are pretrained with millions of external data. We further show that CoVGT can also benefit from cross-modal pretraining, yet with orders of magnitude smaller data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CoVGT, and additionally reveal its potential for more data-efficient pretraining. We hope our success can advance VideoQA beyond coarse recognition/description towards fine-grained relation reasoning of video contents.

    "abstract": "Effective integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial segments is one of the key research avenues in the design of current and future wireless communication networks. To this aim, modern communication-satellite constellations intend to attain sufficiently high throughput in terms of bit rate per unit area on the ground by rather aggressive patterns of spatial frequency reuse. This goal calls for on-board narrow-beam antennas, whose size turns out to be in many cases incompatible with the size/mass and accommodation constraints of the hosting satellite. This paper investigates the attainable performance of large distributed arrays of antennas implemented as the ensemble of a few to many simpler sub-antennas of smaller sizes, carried by one (small) satellite each. The sub-antennas can in their turn be implemented like (regular) 2D arrays of simple radiating elements, realizing an overall (distributed) antenna architecture that we call \"Formation of Arrays\" (FoA). The satellites that implement this radiating architecture need to be relatively close to each other and constitute a formation of flying objects, to be coordinated and controlled as a whole. In this paper, we develop a theoretical analysis of an FoA antenna, and we show how to take advantage of this new technology to improve network throughput in a multi-beam S-band mobile communication network with low-earth or geostationary orbiting satellites directly providing 5G-like communication services to hand-held user terminals.

However, generating feasible dexterous grasps by optimizing these metrics is slow, often taking minutes. To address this issue, this paper presents FRoGGeR: a method that quickly generates robust precision grasps using the min-weight metric, a novel, almost-everywhere differentiable approximation of the classical epsilon grasp metric. The min-weight metric is simple and interpretable, provides a reasonable measure of grasp robustness, and admits numerically efficient gradients for smooth optimization. We leverage these properties to rapidly synthesize collision-free robust grasps - typically in less than a second. FRoGGeR can refine the candidate grasps generated by other methods (heuristic, data-driven, etc.) and is compatible with many object representations (SDFs, meshes, etc.). We study FRoGGeR's performance on over 40 objects drawn from the YCB dataset, outperforming a competitive baseline in computation time, feasibility rate of grasp synthesis, and picking success in simulation. We conclude that FRoGGeR is fast: it has a median synthesis time of 0.834s over hundreds of experiments. ",

Despite their effectiveness, we empirically observe that training a single GNN model for diverse molecules with distinct structural patterns limits its prediction performance. In this paper, motivated by this observation, we propose \\proposed to leverage topology-specific prediction models (referred to as experts), each of which is responsible for each molecular group sharing similar topological semantics. That is, each expert learns topology-specific discriminative features while being trained with its corresponding topological group. To tackle the key challenge of grouping molecules by their topological patterns, we introduce a clustering-based gating module that assigns an input molecule into one of the clusters and further optimizes the gating module with two different types of self-supervision: topological semantics induced by GNNs and molecular scaffolds, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\proposed has boosted the performance for molecular property prediction and also achieved better generalization for new molecules with unseen scaffolds than baselines.

Motivated by these limitations, in this paper, we propose masked patches selection and adaptive masking strategy based self-supervised medical image segmentation method, named MPS-AMS. We leverage the masked patches selection strategy to choose masked patches with lesions to obtain more lesion representation information, and the adaptive masking strategy is utilized to help learn more mutual information and improve performance further. Extensive experiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets (BUSI, Hecktor, and Brats2018) show that our proposed method greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised baselines.

To address this issue, we propose a novel solution called Hulk, which utilizes a modified graph neural network to optimize distributed computing systems. Hulk not only optimizes data communication efficiency between different countries or even different regions within the same city, but also provides optimal distributed deployment of models in parallel. For example, it can place certain layers on a machine in a specific region or pass specific parameters of a model to a machine in a particular location.

This paper focuses on automatically detecting stereotypical behaviours with computer vision techniques. Off-the-shelf methods tackle this task by supervised classification and activity recognition techniques. However, the unbounded types of stereotypical behaviours and the difficulty in collecting video recordings of ASD patients largely limit the feasibility of the existing supervised detection methods. As a result, we tackle these challenges from a new perspective, i.e. unsupervised video anomaly detection for stereotypical behaviours detection. The models can be trained among unlabeled videos containing only normal behaviours and unknown types of abnormal behaviours can be detected during inference. Correspondingly, we propose a Dual Stream deep model for Stereotypical Behaviours Detection, DS-SBD, based on the temporal trajectory of human poses and the repetition patterns of human actions. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method and suggest that it serves as a potential benchmark for future research. ",

Several website fingerprinting attacks based on machine learning and deep learning tend to use the most typical features to achieve a satisfactory performance of attacking rate. However, these attacks suffer from several practical implementation factors, such as a skillfully pre-processing step or a clean dataset. To defend against such attacks, random packet defense (RPD) with a high cost of excessive network overhead is usually applied. In this work, we first propose a practical filter-assisted attack against RPD, which can filter out the injected noises using the statistical characteristics of TCP/IP traffic. Then, we propose a list-assisted defensive mechanism to defend the proposed attack method. To achieve a configurable trade-off between the defense and the network overhead, we further improve the list-based defense by a traffic splitting mechanism, which can combat the mentioned attacks as well as save a considerable amount of network overhead. In the experiments, we collect real-life traffic patterns using three mainstream browsers, i.e., Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox, and extensive results conducted on the closed and open-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of defense accuracy and network efficiency.

    "abstract": "Personality is considered one of the most influential research topics in psychology, as it predicts many consequential outcomes such as mental and physical health and explains human behaviour. With the widespread use of social networks as a means of communication, it is becoming increasingly important to develop models that can automatically and accurately read the essence of individuals based solely on their writing. In particular, the convergence of social and computer sciences has led researchers to develop automatic approaches for extracting and studying \"hidden\" information in textual data on the internet. The nature of this thesis project is highly experimental, and the motivation behind this work is to present detailed analyses on the topic, as currently there are no significant investigations of this kind. The objective is to identify an adequate semantic space that allows for defining the personality of the object to which a certain text refers. The starting point is a dictionary of adjectives that psychological literature defines as markers of the five major personality traits, or Big Five. In this work, we started with the implementation of fully-connected neural networks as a basis for understanding how simple deep learning models can provide information on hidden personality characteristics. Finally, we use a class of distributional algorithms invented in 2013 by Tomas Mikolov, which consists of using a convolutional neural network that learns the contexts of words in an unsupervised way. In this way, we construct an embedding that contains the semantic information on the text, obtaining a kind of \"geometry of meaning\" in which concepts are translated into linear relationships. With this last experiment, we hypothesize that an individual writing style is largely coupled with their personality traits. ",

In such a scenario, a vision system with a fixed, possibly too low, sampling rate could lead to the loss of informative points, slowing down prediction convergence and reducing the accuracy. In this paper, we propose to exploit the low latency, motion-driven sampling, and data compression properties of event cameras to overcome these issues. As a use-case, we use a Panda robotic arm to intercept a ball bouncing on a table. To predict the interception point, we adopt a Stateful LSTM network, a specific LSTM variant without fixed input length, which perfectly suits the event-driven paradigm and the problem at hand, where the length of the trajectory is not defined. We train the network in simulation to speed up the dataset acquisition and then fine-tune the models on real trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate how using a dense spatial sampling (i.e. event cameras) significantly increases the number of intercepted trajectories as compared to a fixed temporal sampling (i.e. frame-based cameras).

We prove an analogous result for randomized learners: we show that the optimal expected mistake bound in learning a class $\\mathcal{H}$ equals its randomized Littlestone dimension, which is the largest $d$ for which there exists a tree shattered by $\\mathcal{H}$ whose average depth is $2d$. We further study optimal mistake bounds in the agnostic case, as a function of the number of mistakes made by the best function in $\\mathcal{H}$, denoted by $k$. We show that the optimal randomized mistake bound for learning a class with Littlestone dimension $d$ is $k + \\Theta (\\sqrt{k d} + d )$. This also implies an optimal deterministic mistake bound of $2k + O (\\sqrt{k d} + d )$, thus resolving an open question which was studied by Auer and Long ['99]. As an application of our theory, we revisit the classical problem of prediction using expert advice: about 30 years ago Cesa-Bianchi, Freund, Haussler, Helmbold, Schapire and Warmuth studied prediction using expert advice, provided that the best among the $n$ experts makes at most $k$ mistakes, and asked what are the optimal mistake bounds. Cesa-Bianchi, Freund, Helmbold, and Warmuth ['93, '96] provided a nearly optimal bound for deterministic learners, and left the randomized case as an open problem. We resolve this question by providing an optimal learning rule in the randomized case, and showing that its expected mistake bound equals half of the deterministic bound, up to negligible additive terms. This improves upon previous works by Cesa-Bianchi, Freund, Haussler, Helmbold, Schapire and Warmuth ['93, '97], by Abernethy, Langford, and Warmuth ['06], and by Br\\^anzei and Peres ['19], which handled the regimes $k \\ll \\log n$ or $k \\gg \\log n$.

Prior work has primarily focused on attacks that modify standard MDP primitives, such as rewards or transitions. In this paper, we study targeted poisoning attacks in a two-agent setting where an attacker implicitly poisons the effective environment of one of the agents by modifying the policy of its peer. We develop an optimization framework for designing optimal attacks, where the cost of the attack measures how much the solution deviates from the assumed default policy of the peer agent. We further study the computational properties of this optimization framework. Focusing on a tabular setting, we show that in contrast to poisoning attacks based on MDP primitives (transitions and (unbounded) rewards), which are always feasible, it is NP-hard to determine the feasibility of implicit poisoning attacks. We provide characterization results that establish sufficient conditions for the feasibility of the attack problem, as well as an upper and a lower bound on the optimal cost of the attack. We propose two algorithmic approaches for finding an optimal adversarial policy: a model-based approach with tabular policies and a model-free approach with parametric/neural policies. We showcase the efficacy of the proposed algorithms through experiments. ",

The consistency between what the mini-app does about the data in the program code and what it declares in its privacy policy description is important. But no work has systematically investigated the privacy problem of the mini-app before. In this paper, to our best knowledge, we are the first to conduct the compliance detection of data practice and policy description in mini-apps.

Among them, only 318 meet the consistency requirements, 2,680 are inconsistent, and the proportion of inconsistencies is as high as 89.4%. The inconsistency in the mini-app is very serious.

In node-level problems of graph learning, distributional shifts can be especially complex since the samples are interdependent. To evaluate the performance of graph models, it is important to test them on diverse and meaningful distributional shifts. However, most graph benchmarks that consider distributional shifts for node-level problems focus mainly on node features, while data in graph problems is primarily defined by its structural properties. In this work, we propose a general approach for inducing diverse distributional shifts based on graph structure. We use this approach to create data splits according to several structural node properties: popularity, locality, and density. In our experiments, we thoroughly evaluate the proposed distributional shifts and show that they are quite challenging for existing graph models. We hope that the proposed approach will be helpful for the further development of reliable graph machine learning. ",

To the best of our knowledge, most of the state-of-the-art works in this field have focused on using tree-like structures and linguistic modeling.

    "abstract": "In human-robot collaboration, the objectives of the human are often unknown to the robot. Moreover, even assuming a known objective, the human behavior is also uncertain. In order to plan a robust robot behavior, a key preliminary question is then: How to derive realistic human behaviors given a known objective? A major issue is that such a human behavior should itself account for the robot behavior, otherwise collaboration cannot happen. In this paper, we rely on Markov decision models, representing the uncertainty over the human objective as a probability distribution over a finite set of objective functions (inducing a distribution over human behaviors). Based on this, we propose two contributions: 1) an approach to automatically generate an uncertain human behavior (a policy) for each given objective function while accounting for possible robot behaviors; and 2) a robot planning algorithm that is robust to the above-mentioned uncertainties and relies on solving a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) obtained by reasoning on a distribution over human behaviors. A co-working scenario allows conducting experiments and presenting qualitative and quantitative results to evaluate our approach. ",

Instead, we propose a novel mapping of features from the image domain to the 3D rotation manifold. Our method then leverages $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ equivariant layers, which are more sample efficient, and outputs a distribution over rotations that can be sampled at arbitrary resolution.

Existing methods typically rely on one-stage trajectory prediction models, which condition future trajectories on observed trajectories combined with fused scene information. However, they often struggle with complex scene constraints, such as those encountered at intersections. To this end, we present a novel method, called LAformer. It uses a temporally dense lane-aware estimation module to select only the top highly potential lane segments in an HD map, which effectively and continuously aligns motion dynamics with scene information, reducing the representation requirements for the subsequent attention-based decoder by filtering out irrelevant lane segments. Additionally, unlike one-stage prediction models, LAformer utilizes predictions from the first stage as anchor trajectories and adds a second-stage motion refinement module to further explore temporal consistency across the complete time horizon. Extensive experiments on Argoverse 1 and nuScenes demonstrate that LAformer achieves excellent performance for multimodal trajectory prediction. ",

    "abstract": "As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with pure binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on three model variants: 45M, 125M and 260M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is 4x larger than any functional backprop-trained SNN to date. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity to linear with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 5x less energy consumption when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

Although multi-view 3D reconstruction also faces multiple images as input, it cannot immediately inherit their success due to completely ambiguous associations between unordered views. There is not usable prior relationship, which is similar to the temporally-coherence property in a video. To solve this problem, we propose a novel transformer network for Unordered Multiple Images (UMIFormer). It exploits transformer blocks for decoupled intra-view encoding and designed blocks for token rectification that mine the correlation between similar tokens from different views to achieve decoupled inter-view encoding. Afterward, all tokens acquired from various branches are compressed into a fixed-size compact representation while preserving rich information for reconstruction by leveraging the similarities between tokens. We empirically demonstrate on ShapeNet and confirm that our decoupled learning method is adaptable for unordered multiple images. Meanwhile, the experiments also verify our model outperforms existing SOTA methods by a large margin. ",

    "abstract": "Performance degradation due to source domain mismatch is a longstanding challenge in deep learning-based medical image analysis, particularly for chest X-rays. Several methods have been proposed to address this domain shift, such as utilizing adversarial learning or multi-domain mixups to extract domain-invariant high-level features. However, these methods do not explicitly account for or regularize the content and style attributes of the extracted domain-invariant features. Recent studies have demonstrated that CNN models exhibit a strong bias toward styles (i.e., textures) rather than content, in stark contrast to the human-vision system. Explainable representations are paramount for a robust and generalizable understanding of medical images. Thus, the learned high-level semantic features need to be both content-specific, i.e., pathology-specific and domain-agnostic, as well as style invariant. Inspired by this, we propose a novel framework that improves cross-domain performances by focusing more on content while reducing style bias. We employ a style randomization module at both image and feature levels to create stylized perturbation features while preserving the content using an end-to-end framework. We extract the global features from the backbone model for the same chest X-ray with and without style randomized. We apply content consistency regularization between them to tweak the framework's sensitivity toward content markers for accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on unseen domain test datasets demonstrate that our proposed pipeline is more robust in the presence of domain shifts and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, existing open-vocabulary object detectors only align region embeddings individually with the corresponding features extracted from the VLMs. Such a design leaves the compositional structure of semantic concepts in a scene under-exploited, although the structure may be implicitly learned by the VLMs. In this work, we propose to align the embedding of bag of regions beyond individual regions. The proposed method groups contextually interrelated regions as a bag. The embeddings of regions in a bag are treated as embeddings of words in a sentence, and they are sent to the text encoder of a VLM to obtain the bag-of-regions embedding, which is learned to be aligned to the corresponding features extracted by a frozen VLM.

We investigate conditions under which the existence of equilibria is guaranteed and study the computational complexity of finding such a stable outcome.

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of knowledge graphs (KG) in various automated AI systems and applications, it is very important to ensure that information retrieval algorithms leveraging them are free from societal biases. Previous works have depicted biases that persist in KGs, as well as employed several metrics for measuring the biases. However, such studies lack the systematic exploration of the sensitivity of the bias measurements, through varying sources of data, or the embedding algorithms used. To address this research gap, in this work, we present a holistic analysis of bias measurement on the knowledge graph. First, we attempt to reveal data biases that surface in Wikidata for thirteen different demographics selected from seven continents. Next, we attempt to unfold the variance in the detection of biases by two different knowledge graph embedding algorithms - TransE and ComplEx. We conduct our extensive experiments on a large number of occupations sampled from the thirteen demographics with respect to the sensitive attribute, i.e., gender. Our results show that the inherent data bias that persists in KG can be altered by specific algorithm bias as incorporated by KG embedding learning algorithms. Further, we show that the choice of the state-of-the-art KG embedding algorithm has a strong impact on the ranking of biased occupations irrespective of gender. We observe that the similarity of the biased occupations across demographics is minimal which reflects the socio-cultural differences around the globe. We believe that this full-scale audit of the bias measurement pipeline will raise awareness among the community while deriving insights related to design choices of data and algorithms both and refrain from the popular dogma of ``one-size-fits-all''.

We approach the design of neural functionals through the lens of symmetry, in particular by focusing on the permutation symmetries that arise in the weights of deep feedforward networks because hidden layer neurons have no inherent order. We introduce a framework for building permutation equivariant neural functionals, whose architectures encode these symmetries as an inductive bias. The key building blocks of this framework are NF-Layers (neural functional layers) that we constrain to be permutation equivariant through an appropriate parameter sharing scheme. In our experiments, we find that permutation equivariant neural functionals are effective on a diverse set of tasks that require processing the weights of MLPs and CNNs, such as predicting classifier generalization, producing \"winning ticket\" sparsity masks for initializations, and editing the weights of implicit neural representations (INRs).

Integrating multi-omics data has been proven to be effective for building more precise classification models. Current multi-omics integrative models mainly use early fusion by concatenation or late fusion based on deep neural networks. Due to the nature of biological systems, graphs are a better representation of bio-medical data. Although few graph neural network (GNN) based multi-omics integrative methods have been proposed, they suffer from three common disadvantages. One is most of them use only one type of connection, either inter-omics or intra-omic connection; second, they only consider one kind of GNN layer, either graph convolution network (GCN) or graph attention network (GAT); and third, most of these methods lack testing on a more complex cancer classification task. We propose a novel end-to-end multi-omics GNN framework for accurate and robust cancer subtype classification. The proposed model utilizes multi-omics data in the form of heterogeneous multi-layer graphs that combines both inter-omics and intra-omic connections from established biological knowledge. The proposed model incorporates learned graph features and global genome features for accurate classification. We test the proposed model on TCGA Pan-cancer dataset and TCGA breast cancer dataset for molecular subtype and cancer subtype classification, respectively. The proposed model outperforms four current state-of-the-art baseline models in multiple evaluation metrics. The comparative analysis of GAT-based models and GCN-based models reveals that GAT-based models are preferred for smaller graphs with less information and GCN-based models are preferred for larger graphs with extra information.

Our proposed method is able to cope with additive noise and baseline wander, and does not require handcrafted features by a domain expert. Most importantly, this work opens the floor for innovation in wearable devices (e.g., smart watches, wrist bands etc.) to do accurate, real-time and early MI detection using a single-lead (lead II) ECG.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose an adversarial attack-based data augmentation method to improve the deep-learning-based segmentation algorithm for the delineation of Organs-At-Risk (OAR) in abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) to facilitate radiation therapy. We introduce Adversarial Feature Attack for Medical Image (AFA-MI) augmentation, which forces the segmentation network to learn out-of-distribution statistics and improve generalization and robustness to noises. AFA-MI augmentation consists of three steps: 1) generate adversarial noises by Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) on the intermediate features of the segmentation network's encoder; 2) inject the generated adversarial noises into the network, intentionally compromising performance; 3) optimize the network with both clean and adversarial features. Experiments are conducted segmenting the heart, left and right kidney, liver, left and right lung, spinal cord, and stomach. We first evaluate the AFA-MI augmentation using nnUnet and TT-Vnet on the test data from a public abdominal dataset and an institutional dataset. In addition, we validate how AFA-MI affects the networks' robustness to the noisy data by evaluating the networks with added Gaussian noises of varying magnitudes to the institutional dataset. Network performance is quantitatively evaluated using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for volume-based accuracy. Also, Hausdorff Distance (HD) is applied for surface-based accuracy. On the public dataset, nnUnet with AFA-MI achieves DSC = 0.85 and HD = 6.16 millimeters (mm); and TT-Vnet achieves DSC = 0.86 and HD = 5.62 mm. AFA-MI augmentation further improves all contour accuracies up to 0.217 DSC score when tested on images with Gaussian noises. AFA-MI augmentation is therefore demonstrated to improve segmentation performance and robustness in CT multi-organ segmentation. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we tackle the problem of robust computed tomography (CT) reconstruction issue under a cross-domain scenario, i.e., the training CT data as the source domain and the testing CT data as the target domain are collected from different anatomical regions. Due to the mismatches of the scan region and corresponding scan protocols, there is usually a difference of noise distributions between source and target domains (a.k.a. noise distribution shifts), resulting in a catastrophic deterioration of the reconstruction performance on target domain. To render a robust cross-domain CT reconstruction performance, instead of using deterministic models (e.g., convolutional neural network), a Bayesian-endowed probabilistic framework is introduced into robust cross-domain CT reconstruction task due to its impressive robustness. Under this probabilistic framework, we propose to alleviate the noise distribution shifts between source and target domains via implicit noise modeling schemes in the latent space and image space, respectively. Specifically, a novel Bayesian noise uncertainty alignment (BNUA) method is proposed to conduct implicit noise distribution modeling and alignment in the latent space. Moreover, an adversarial learning manner is imposed to reduce the discrepancy of noise distribution between two domains in the image space via a novel residual distribution alignment (RDA). Extensive experiments on the head and abdomen scans show that our proposed method can achieve a better performance of robust cross-domain CT reconstruction than existing approaches in terms of both quantitative and qualitative results.

For a fixed monotone graph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy this property with high probability in as few rounds as possible. In this paper, we introduce a natural generalization of this game in which $k$ random vertices $u_1, \\ldots, u_k$ are presented to the player in each round.

Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given uncertainty set. However, existing work often resorts to some coarse relaxation of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value. It can be shown that our estimator contains the recently proposed sharp estimator by Dorn and Guo (2022) as a special case, and our method enables a novel extension of the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence. To construct our estimator, we leverage the kernel method to obtain a tractable approximation to the conditional moment constraints, which traditional non-sharp estimators failed to take into account. In the theoretical analysis, we provide a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no specification error that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we provide consistency guarantees of policy evaluation and learning. In the experiments with synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

Although current classifiers achieve high performance using chest X-ray images alone, our interviews with radiologists indicate that clinical data is highly informative and essential for interpreting images and making proper diagnoses. In this work, we propose a novel architecture consisting of two fusion methods that enable the model to simultaneously process patients' clinical data (structured data) and chest X-rays (image data). Since these data modalities are in different dimensional spaces, we propose a spatial arrangement strategy, termed spatialization, to facilitate the multimodal learning process in a Mask R-CNN model. We performed an extensive experimental evaluation comprising three datasets with different modalities: MIMIC CXR (chest X-ray images), MIMIC IV-ED (patients' clinical data), and REFLACX (annotations of disease locations in chest X-rays). Results show that incorporating patients' clinical data in a DL model together with the proposed fusion methods improves the performance of disease localization in chest X-rays by 12\\% in terms of Average Precision compared to a standard Mask R-CNN using only chest X-rays. Further ablation studies also emphasize the importance of multimodal DL architectures and the incorporation of patients' clinical data in disease localisation. The architecture proposed in this work is publicly available to promote the scientific reproducibility of our study (https://github.com/ChihchengHsieh/multimodal-abnormalities-detection). ",

We also prove that the so-called unlearning rule coincides with the training-with-noise algorithm when noise is maximal and data are fixed points of the network dynamics.

To answer the increased need for PET imaging with DIP, it is indispensable to improve the performance of the underlying DIP itself. Here, we propose a self-supervised pre-training model to improve the DIP-based PET image denoising performance. Our proposed pre-training model acquires transferable and generalizable visual representations from only unlabeled PET images by restoring various degraded PET images in a self-supervised approach. We evaluated the proposed method using clinical brain PET data with various radioactive tracers ($^{18}$F-florbetapir, $^{11}$C-Pittsburgh compound-B, $^{18}$F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, and $^{15}$O-CO$_{2}$) acquired from different PET scanners. The proposed method using the self-supervised pre-training model achieved robust and state-of-the-art denoising performance while retaining spatial details and quantification accuracy compared to other unsupervised methods and pre-training model. These results highlight the potential that the proposed method is particularly effective against rare diseases and probes and helps reduce the scan time or the radiotracer dose without affecting the patients.

Typically, deep learning networks are trained by randomly selecting samples in each mini-batch. By contrast, curriculum learning is a training strategy that aims to boost classifier performance by starting with examples that are easier to classify. Here we define a curriculum to progressively increase the difficulty of the training data corresponding to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) staging system for PD (total N=1,012; 653 PD patients, 359 controls; age range: 20.0-84.9 years).

Hence, successful entanglement swapping is error-prone. The occurrence of quantum state errors can be mitigated using purification and error correction, which can be repeated in the former case and concatenated in the latter case. Repeated purification merges low-fidelity qubits into higher-quality ones, while concatenated error correction builds upon the redundancy of quantum information. In this article, we study in-depth and compare the two options: repeated purification and concatenated error correction. We consider using repeated purification and concatenated error correction to mitigate the presence of faults that occur during the establishment of Bell pairs between remote network nodes. We compare their performance versus the number of repetitions or concatenations, to reach a certain level of fidelity in quantum networks. We study their resource requirements, namely, their work memory complexity (e.g., number of stored qubits) and operational complexity (e.g., number of operations). Our analysis demonstrates that concatenated error correction, versus repeated purification, requires fewer iterations and has lower operational complexity than repeated purification to reach high fidelity at the expense of increased memory requirements.

In this paper we study a complementary mechanism for the formation of polarization in networks with community structure based on higher-order interactions, i.e., simultaneous interactions between multiple agents. We present an extension of the planted partition model for uniform hypergraphs as a simple model of community structure and consider the hypergraph SIS model on a hypergraph with two communities where the binary ideology can spread via links (pairwise interactions) and triangles (three-way interactions). We approximate this contagion process with a mean-field model and find that for strong enough community structure, the two communities can hold very different average opinions. We determine the regimes of structural and infectious parameters for which polarization can exist and find that the existence of polarization is much more sensitive to the triangle community structure than to the link community structure. We show that the existence and type of polarization is extremely sensitive to differences in size between the two communities. ",

Mobile phone data has also revealed persistent individual differences within this pattern. However, the generality and the driving mechanisms of this tie strength heterogeneity remain unclear. Here, we study tie strengths in egocentric networks across multiple datasets containing records of interactions between millions of people over time periods ranging from months to years. Our findings reveal a remarkable universality in the distribution of tie strengths and their individual-level variation across different modes of communication, even in channels that may not reflect offline social relationships. With the help of an analytically tractable model of egocentric network evolution, we show that the observed universality can be attributed to the competition between cumulative advantage and random choice, two general mechanisms of tie reinforcement whose balance determines the amount of heterogeneity in tie strengths. Our results provide new insights into the driving mechanisms of tie strength heterogeneity in social networks and have implications for the understanding of social network structure and individual behavior.

    "abstract": "We propose causal isotonic calibration, a novel nonparametric method for calibrating predictors of heterogeneous treatment effects. In addition, we introduce a novel data-efficient variant of calibration that avoids the need for hold-out calibration sets, which we refer to as cross-calibration. Causal isotonic cross-calibration takes cross-fitted predictors and outputs a single calibrated predictor obtained using all available data. We establish under weak conditions that causal isotonic calibration and cross-calibration both achieve fast doubly-robust calibration rates so long as either the propensity score or outcome regression is estimated well in an appropriate sense. The proposed causal isotonic calibrator can be wrapped around any black-box learning algorithm to provide strong distribution-free calibration guarantees while preserving predictive performance. ",
