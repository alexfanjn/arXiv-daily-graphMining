    "abstract": "The goal of inverse rendering is to decompose geometry, lights, and materials given pose multi-view images. To achieve this goal, we propose neural direct and joint inverse rendering, NDJIR. Different from prior works which relies on some approximations of the rendering equation, NDJIR directly addresses the integrals in the rendering equation and jointly decomposes geometry: signed distance function, lights: environment and implicit lights, materials: base color, roughness, specular reflectance using the powerful and flexible volume rendering framework, voxel grid feature, and Bayesian prior. Our method directly uses the physically-based rendering, so we can seamlessly export an extracted mesh with materials to DCC tools and show material conversion examples. We perform intensive experiments to show that our proposed method can decompose semantically well for real object in photogrammetric setting and what factors contribute towards accurate inverse rendering.

    "abstract": "Cache side-channel attacks and speculative execution attacks that leak information through cache states are stealthy and dangerous attacks on hardware that must be mitigated. Unfortunately, defenses proposed for cache side-channel attacks do not mitigate all cache-based speculative execution attacks and vice versa. Since both classes of attacks must be addressed, we propose comprehensive cache architectures to do this. We show a framework to analyze the security of a secure cache. We identify same-domain speculative execution attacks, and show they evade cache side-channel defenses. We present new hardware security mechanisms that address target attacks and reduce performance overhead. We design two Speculative and Timing Attack Resilient (STAR) caches that defeat both cache side-channel attacks and cache-based speculative execution attacks. These comprehensive defenses have low performance overhead of 6.6% and 8.8%. ",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle under the promise that the input graph has a minimum degree of at least $n/2$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices in the graph. The classical theorem of Dirac states that such graphs (a.k.a. Dirac graphs) are Hamiltonian, i.e., contain a Hamiltonian cycle. Moreover, finding a Hamiltonian cycle in Dirac graphs can be done in polynomial time in the classical centralized model. This paper presents a randomized distributed CONGEST algorithm that finds w.h.p. a Hamiltonian cycle (as well as maximum matching) within $O(\\log n)$ rounds under the promise that the input graph is a Dirac graph. This upper bound is in contrast to general graphs in which both the decision and search variants of Hamiltonicity require $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^2)$ rounds, as shown by Bachrach et al. [PODC'19]. In addition, we consider two generalizations of Dirac graphs: Ore graphs and Rahman-Kaykobad graphs [IPL'05]. In Ore graphs, the sum of the degrees of every pair of non-adjacent vertices is at least $n$, and in Rahman-Kaykobad graphs, the sum of the degrees of every pair of non-adjacent vertices plus their distance is at least $n+1$. We show how our algorithm for Dirac graphs can be adapted to work for these more general families of graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models achieve excellent performance in numerous machine learning tasks. Yet, they suffer from security-related issues such as adversarial examples and poisoning (backdoor) attacks. A deep learning model may be poisoned by training with backdoored data or by modifying inner network parameters. Then, a backdoored model performs as expected when receiving a clean input, but it misclassifies when receiving a backdoored input stamped with a pre-designed pattern called \"trigger\". Unfortunately, it is difficult to distinguish between clean and backdoored models without prior knowledge of the trigger. This paper proposes a backdoor detection method by utilizing a special type of adversarial attack, universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), and its similarities with a backdoor trigger. We observe an intuitive phenomenon: UAPs generated from backdoored models need fewer perturbations to mislead the model than UAPs from clean models. UAPs of backdoored models tend to exploit the shortcut from all classes to the target class, built by the backdoor trigger. We propose a novel method called Universal Soldier for Backdoor detection (USB) and reverse engineering potential backdoor triggers via UAPs. Experiments on 345 models trained on several datasets show that USB effectively detects the injected backdoor and provides comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods. ",

However, the isotropic noise assumption is very restrictive: (a) when adding noise to existing learning algorithms to preserve privacy and maintain the best possible accuracy one should take into account the relative magnitude of the outputs and their correlations; (b) popular algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (and their continuous time limits) appear to possess anisotropic covariance properties. To study the privacy risks for the anisotropic noise case, one requires general results on the relative entropy between the laws of two Stochastic Differential Equations with different drifts and diffusion coefficients. Our main contribution is to establish such a bound using stability estimates for solutions to the Fokker-Planck equations via functional inequalities. With additional assumptions, the relative entropy bound implies an $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy bound. We discuss the practical implications of our bound related to privacy risk in different contexts.Finally, the benefits of anisotropic noise are illustrated using numerical results on optimising a quadratic loss or calibrating a neural network.

    "abstract": "Many real-world systems can be described by mathematical formulas that are human-comprehensible, easy to analyze and can be helpful in explaining the system's behaviour. Symbolic regression is a method that generates nonlinear models from data in the form of analytic expressions. Historically, symbolic regression has been predominantly realized using genetic programming, a method that iteratively evolves a population of candidate solutions that are sampled by genetic operators crossover and mutation. This gradient-free evolutionary approach suffers from several deficiencies: it does not scale well with the number of variables and samples in the training data, models tend to grow in size and complexity without an adequate accuracy gain, and it is hard to fine-tune the inner model coefficients using just genetic operators. Recently, neural networks have been applied to learn the whole analytic formula, i.e., its structure as well as the coefficients, by means of gradient-based optimization algorithms. We propose a novel neural network-based symbolic regression method that constructs physically plausible models based on limited training data and prior knowledge about the system. The method employs an adaptive weighting scheme to effectively deal with multiple loss function terms and an epoch-wise learning process to reduce the chance of getting stuck in poor local optima. Furthermore, we propose a parameter-free method for choosing the model with the best interpolation and extrapolation performance out of all models generated through the whole learning process. We experimentally evaluate the approach on the TurtleBot 2 mobile robot, the magnetic manipulation system, the equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel, and the anti-lock braking system. The results clearly show the potential of the method to find sparse and accurate models that comply with the prior knowledge provided. ",

    "abstract": "Entity alignment (EA) is a fundamental data integration task that identifies equivalent entities between different knowledge graphs (KGs). Temporal Knowledge graphs (TKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by introducing timestamps, which have received increasing attention. State-of-the-art time-aware EA studies have suggested that the temporal information of TKGs facilitates the performance of EA. However, existing studies have not thoroughly exploited the advantages of temporal information in TKGs. Also, they perform EA by pre-aligning entity pairs, which can be labor-intensive and thus inefficient. In this paper, we present DualMatch which effectively fuses the relational and temporal information for EA. DualMatch transfers EA on TKGs into a weighted graph matching problem. More specifically, DualMatch is equipped with an unsupervised method, which achieves EA without necessitating seed alignment. DualMatch has two steps: (i) encoding temporal and relational information into embeddings separately using a novel label-free encoder, Dual-Encoder; and (ii) fusing both information and transforming it into alignment using a novel graph-matching-based decoder, GM-Decoder. DualMatch is able to perform EA on TKGs with or without supervision, due to its capability of effectively capturing temporal information. Extensive experiments on three real-world TKG datasets offer the insight that DualMatch outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of H@1 by 2.4% - 10.7% and MRR by 1.7% - 7.6%, respectively.

This requires algorithms for real-time, automated spacecraft feature recognition to pinpoint the locations of collision hazards (e.g. solar panels or antennas) and safe docking features (e.g. satellite bodies or thrusters) so safe, effective flightpaths can be planned. Prior work in this area reveals the performance of computer vision models are highly dependent on the training dataset and its coverage of scenarios visually similar to the real scenarios that occur in deployment. Hence, the algorithm may have degraded performance under certain lighting conditions even when the rendezvous maneuver conditions of the chaser to the target spacecraft are the same. This work delves into how humans perform these tasks through a survey of how aerospace engineering students experienced with spacecraft shapes and components recognize features of the three spacecraft: Landsat, Envisat, Anik, and the orbiter Mir. The survey reveals that the most common patterns in the human detection process were to consider the shape and texture of the features: antennas, solar panels, thrusters, and satellite bodies. This work introduces a novel algorithm SpaceYOLO, which fuses a state-of-the-art object detector YOLOv5 with a separate neural network based on these human-inspired decision processes exploiting shape and texture. Performance in autonomous spacecraft detection of SpaceYOLO is compared to ordinary YOLOv5 in hardware-in-the-loop experiments under different lighting and chaser maneuver conditions at the ORION Laboratory at Florida Tech.

However, most existing approaches focus on the restrictive setting where the distribution of the online tasks remains fixed with known task boundaries. In this work, we relax these assumptions and propose a novel algorithm for task-agnostic online meta-learning in non-stationary environments. More specifically, we first propose two simple but effective detection mechanisms of task switches and distribution shift based on empirical observations, which serve as a key building block for more elegant online model updates in our algorithm: the task switch detection mechanism allows reusing of the best model available for the current task at hand, and the distribution shift detection mechanism differentiates the meta model update in order to preserve the knowledge for in-distribution tasks and quickly learn the new knowledge for out-of-distribution tasks. In particular, our online meta model updates are based only on the current data, which eliminates the need of storing previous data as required in most existing methods. We further show that a sublinear task-averaged regret can be achieved for our algorithm under mild conditions. Empirical studies on three different benchmarks clearly demonstrate the significant advantage of our algorithm over related baseline approaches. ",

Since the Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) Challenge dataset does not contain practical disturbance, we collect a transmitted DNS (t-DNS) dataset using Zoom Meetings over T-Mobile network. We select two baseline models: Demucs and FullSubNet. The Demucs is an end-to-end model that takes time-domain inputs and outputs time-domain denoised speech, and the FullSubNet takes time-frequency-domain inputs and outputs the energy ratio of the target speech in the inputs. The goal of this project is to enhance the speech transmitted over the cellular networks using deep learning models. ",

    "abstract": "The process of generating data such as images is controlled by independent and unknown factors of variation. The retrieval of these variables has been studied extensively in the disentanglement, causal representation learning, and independent component analysis fields. Recently, approaches merging these domains together have shown great success. Instead of directly representing the factors of variation, the problem of disentanglement can be seen as finding the interventions on one image that yield a change to a single factor. Following this assumption, we introduce a new method for disentanglement inspired by causal dynamics that combines causality theory with vector-quantized variational autoencoders. Our model considers the quantized vectors as causal variables and links them in a causal graph. It performs causal interventions on the graph and generates atomic transitions affecting a unique factor of variation in the image. We also introduce a new task of action retrieval that consists of finding the action responsible for the transition between two images. We test our method on standard synthetic and real-world disentanglement datasets. We show that it can effectively disentangle the factors of variation and perform precise interventions on high-level semantic attributes of an image without affecting its quality, even with imbalanced data distributions.

    "abstract": "By generating prediction intervals (PIs) to quantify the uncertainty of each prediction in deep learning regression, the risk of wrong predictions can be effectively controlled. High-quality PIs need to be as narrow as possible, whilst covering a preset proportion of real labels. At present, many approaches to improve the quality of PIs can effectively reduce the width of PIs, but they do not ensure that enough real labels are captured. Inductive Conformal Predictor (ICP) is an algorithm that can generate effective PIs which is theoretically guaranteed to cover a preset proportion of data. However, typically ICP is not directly optimized to yield minimal PI width. However, in this study, we use Directly Optimized Inductive Conformal Regression (DOICR) that takes only the average width of PIs as the loss function and increases the quality of PIs through an optimized scheme under the validity condition that sufficient real labels are captured in the PIs. Benchmark experiments show that DOICR outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for regression problems using underlying Deep Neural Network structures for both tabular and image data. ",

    "abstract": "Graphs consisting of vocal nodes (\"the vocal minority\") and silent nodes (\"the silent majority\"), namely VS-Graph, are ubiquitous in the real world. The vocal nodes tend to have abundant features and labels. In contrast, silent nodes only have incomplete features and rare labels, e.g., the description and political tendency of politicians (vocal) are abundant while not for ordinary people (silent) on the twitter's social network. Predicting the silent majority remains a crucial yet challenging problem. However, most existing message-passing based GNNs assume that all nodes belong to the same domain, without considering the missing features and distribution-shift between domains, leading to poor ability to deal with VS-Graph. To combat the above challenges, we propose Knowledge Transferable Graph Neural Network (KT-GNN), which models distribution shifts during message passing and representation learning by transferring knowledge from vocal nodes to silent nodes. Specifically, we design the domain-adapted \"feature completion and message passing mechanism\" for node representation learning while preserving domain difference. And a knowledge transferable classifier based on KL-divergence is followed. Comprehensive experiments on real-world scenarios (i.e., company financial risk assessment and political elections) demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

The controller's decision to accelerate or decelerate is computed using the target speed of the vehicle and the difference between the vehicle's distance to the lead vehicle and the safe distance from that vehicle. Spoofing the vehicle speed communicated through the Controller Area Network (CAN) of the vehicle impacts negatively the capability of the ACC (Proportional-Integral-Derivative variant) to prevent crashes with the lead vehicle. The paper reports about extending the ACC with a real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of detecting speed spoofing attacks with reasonable response time and detection rate, and simulating the proposed extension using the CARLA simulation platform. The results of the simulation are: (1) spoofing the vehicle speed can foil the ACC to falsely accelerate, causing accidents, and (2) extending ACC with ML-based IDS to trigger the brakes when an accident is imminent may mitigate the problem. The findings suggest exploring the capabilities of ML-based IDS to support the resilience mechanisms in mitigating cyber-attacks on vehicles. ",

In particular, we observe that the reflective intensity of the same surface in photos shot in different wavelengths could be transformed using a linear model. Besides, we show the variable linear factor across the different surfaces is the main culprit which initiates the modality discrepancy. We integrate such a reflection observation into an image-level data augmentation by proposing the linear transformation generator (LTG). Moreover, at the feature level, we introduce a cross-center loss to explore a more compact intra-class distribution and modality-aware spatial attention to take advantage of textured regions more efficiently.

    "abstract": "Despite its outstanding performance in various graph tasks, vanilla Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) usually fails in link prediction tasks, as it only uses representations of two individual target nodes and ignores the pairwise relation between them. To capture the pairwise relations, some models add manual features to the input graph and use the output of MPNN to produce pairwise representations. In contrast, others directly use manual features as pairwise representations. Though this simplification avoids applying a GNN to each link individually and thus improves scalability, these models still have much room for performance improvement due to the hand-crafted and unlearnable pairwise features. To upgrade performance while maintaining scalability, we propose Neural Common Neighbor (NCN), which uses learnable pairwise representations. To further boost NCN, we study the unobserved link problem. The incompleteness of the graph is ubiquitous and leads to distribution shifts between the training and test set, loss of common neighbor information, and performance degradation of models. Therefore, we propose two intervention methods: common neighbor completion and target link removal. Combining the two methods with NCN, we propose Neural Common Neighbor with Completion (NCNC). NCN and NCNC outperform recent strong baselines by large margins. NCNC achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Reasoning over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) aims to predict future facts based on given history. One of the key challenges for prediction is to learn the evolution of facts. Most existing works focus on exploring evolutionary information in history to obtain effective temporal embeddings for entities and relations, but they ignore the variation in evolution patterns of facts, which makes them struggle to adapt to future data with different evolution patterns. Moreover, new entities continue to emerge along with the evolution of facts over time. Since existing models highly rely on historical information to learn embeddings for entities, they perform poorly on such entities with little historical information. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Temporal Meta-learning framework for TKG reasoning, MetaTKG for brevity. Specifically, our method regards TKG prediction as many temporal meta-tasks, and utilizes the designed Temporal Meta-learner to learn evolutionary meta-knowledge from these meta-tasks. The proposed method aims to guide the backbones to learn to adapt quickly to future data and deal with entities with little historical information by the learned meta-knowledge. Specially, in temporal meta-learner, we design a Gating Integration module to adaptively establish temporal correlations between meta-tasks. Extensive experiments on four widely-used datasets and three backbones demonstrate that our method can greatly improve the performance. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel self-training selection framework with two selectors to select the high-quality samples from data augmentation. Specifically, we firstly use an entropy-based strategy and the model prediction to select augmented samples. Considering some samples with high quality at the above step may be wrongly filtered, we propose to recall them from two perspectives of word overlap and semantic similarity.

Under this viewing, we perform an in-depth analysis for them through visual simulations and real tracking examples, and find that the failure cases in some challenging situations can be regarded as the issue of missing decisive samples in offline training. Since the samples in the initial (first) frame contain rich sequence-specific information, we can regard them as the decisive samples to represent the whole sequence. To quickly adapt the base model to new scenes, a compact latent network is presented via fully using these decisive samples. Specifically, we present a statistics-based compact latent feature for fast adjustment by efficiently extracting the sequence-specific information. Furthermore, a new diverse sample mining strategy is designed for training to further improve the discrimination ability of the proposed compact latent network. Finally, a conditional updating strategy is proposed to efficiently update the basic models to handle scene variation during the tracking phase. To evaluate the generalization ability and effectiveness and of our method, we apply it to adjust three classical Siamese-based trackers, namely SiamRPN++, SiamFC, and SiamBAN. Extensive experimental results on six recent datasets demonstrate that all three adjusted trackers obtain the superior performance in terms of the accuracy, while having high running speed. ",

In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models to adversarial attacks and propose a new attack algorithm called TransFool. To fool NMT models, TransFool builds on a multi-term optimization problem and a gradient projection step. By integrating the embedding representation of a language model, we generate fluent adversarial examples in the source language that maintain a high level of semantic similarity with the clean samples. Experimental results demonstrate that, for different translation tasks and NMT architectures, our white-box attack can severely degrade the translation quality while the semantic similarity between the original and the adversarial sentences stays high. Moreover, we show that TransFool is transferable to unknown target models. Finally, based on automatic and human evaluations, TransFool leads to improvement in terms of success rate, semantic similarity, and fluency compared to the existing attacks both in white-box and black-box settings. Thus, TransFool permits us to better characterize the vulnerability of NMT models and outlines the necessity to design strong defense mechanisms and more robust NMT systems for real-life applications.

    "abstract": "Transient Execution Attacks (TEAs) have gradually become a major security threat to modern high-performance processors. They exploit the vulnerability of speculative execution to illegally access private data, and transmit them through timing-based covert channels. While new vulnerabilities are discovered continuously, the covert channels can be categorised to two types: 1) Persistent Type, in which covert channels are based on the layout changes of buffering, e.g. through caches or TLBs; 2) Volatile Type, in which covert channels are based on the contention of sharing resources, e.g. through execution units or issuing ports. The defenses against the persistent-type covert channels have been well addressed, while those for the volatile-type are still rather inadequate. Existing mitigation schemes for the volatile type such as Speculative Compression and Time-Division-Multiplexing will introduce significant overhead due to the need to stall the pipeline or to disallow resource sharing. In this paper, we look into such attacks and defenses with a new perspective, and propose a scheduling-based mitigation scheme, called SPECWANDS. It consists of three priority-based scheduling policies to prevent an attacker from transmitting the secret in different contention situations. SPECWANDS not only can defend against both inter-thread and intra-thread based attacks, but also can keep most of the performance benefit from speculative execution and resource-sharing. We evaluate its runtime overhead on SPEC 2006/2017 benchmarks. The experimental results show that SPECWANDS has a significant performance advantage (3%-5%) over the other two representative schemes.

However, there is a severe performance drop compared with {real-valued} networks, due to its intrinsic frequent weight oscillation during training. In this paper, we introduce a Resilient Binary Neural Network (ReBNN) to mitigate the frequent oscillation for better BNNs' training. We identify that the weight oscillation mainly stems from the non-parametric scaling factor. To address this issue, we propose to parameterize the scaling factor and introduce a weighted reconstruction loss to build an adaptive training objective. %To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to solve BNNs based on a dynamically re-weighted loss function. For the first time, we show that the weight oscillation is controlled by the balanced parameter attached to the reconstruction loss, which provides a theoretical foundation to parameterize it in back propagation. Based on this, we learn our ReBNN by {calculating} the {balanced} parameter {based on} its maximum magnitude, which can effectively mitigate the weight oscillation with a resilient training process. Extensive experiments are conducted upon various network models, such as ResNet and Faster-RCNN for computer vision, as well as BERT for natural language processing. The results demonstrate the overwhelming performance of our ReBNN over prior arts. For example, our ReBNN achieves 66.9\\% Top-1 accuracy with ResNet-18 backbone on the ImageNet dataset, surpassing existing state-of-the-arts by a significant margin.

However, the biomedical network information based methods usually suffer from cold start problem, while structure based methods often give limited performance due to the structure/interaction assumption and data quality. To address these issues, we propose a pseudo-siamese Graph Neural Network method, namely MTINet+, which learns both biomedical network topological and molecule structural/chemical information as representations to predict potential interaction of given molecule and target pair. In MTINet+, 1-hop subgraphs of given molecule and target pair are extracted from known interaction of biomedical network as topological information, meanwhile the molecule structural and chemical attributes are processed as molecule information. MTINet+ learns these two types of information as embedding features for predicting the pair link. In the experiments of different molecule-target interaction tasks, MTINet+ significantly outperforms over the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, in our designed network sparsity experiments , MTINet+ shows strong robustness against different sparse biomedical networks. ",

    "abstract": "3D hand pose estimation has made significant progress in recent years. However, the improvement is highly dependent on the emergence of large-scale annotated datasets. To alleviate the label-hungry limitation, we propose a multi-view collaborative self-supervised learning framework, HaMuCo, that estimates hand pose only with pseudo labels for training. We use a two-stage strategy to tackle the noisy label challenge and the multi-view ``groupthink'' problem. In the first stage, we estimate the 3D hand poses for each view independently. In the second stage, we employ a cross-view interaction network to capture the cross-view correlated features and use multi-view consistency loss to achieve collaborative learning among views. To further enhance the collaboration between single-view and multi-view, we fuse the results of all views to supervise the single-view network. To summarize, we introduce collaborative learning in two folds, the cross-view level and the multi- to single-view level. Extensive experiments show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on multi-view self-supervised hand pose estimation. Moreover, ablation studies verify the effectiveness of each component. Results on multiple datasets further demonstrate the generalization ability of our network. ",

We aim to minimize the cumulative objective value while guaranteeing that the long-term average second-stage decision belongs to a set. We propose a general algorithmic framework that derives online algorithms for the online two-stage problem from adversarial learning algorithms. Also, the regret bound of our algorithm cam be reduced to the regret bound of embedded adversarial learning algorithms. Based on our framework, we obtain new results under various settings. When the model parameter at each period is drawn from identical distributions, we derive state-of-art regret bound that improves previous bounds under special cases. Our algorithm is also robust to adversarial corruptions of model parameter realizations. When the model parameters are drawn from unknown non-stationary distributions and we are given prior estimates of the distributions, we develop a new algorithm from our framework with a regret $O(W_T+\\sqrt{T})$, where $W_T$ measures the total inaccuracy of the prior estimates.

We collect six different recipe datasets, publicly available, in different formats, and some including data in different languages. Bringing all of these datasets to the needed format for applying a machine learning (ML) pipeline for nutrient prediction [1], [2], includes data normalization using dictionary-based named entity recognition (NER), rule-based NER, as well as conversions using external domain-specific resources. From the list of ingredients, domain-specific embeddings are created using the same embedding space for all recipes - one ingredient dataset is generated. The result from this normalization process is two corpora - one with predefined ingredient embeddings and one with predefined recipe embeddings. On all six recipe datasets, the ML pipeline is evaluated. The results from this use case also confirm that the embeddings merged using the domain heuristic yield better results than the baselines. ",

To strengthen SSO security, organizations, such as IETF and W3C, maintain advisories to address known threats. One could assume that these security best practices are widely deployed on websites. We show that this assumption is a fallacy. We present SSO-MONITOR, an open-source fully-automatic large-scale SSO landscape, security, and privacy analysis tool. In contrast to all previous work, SSO-MONITOR uses a highly extensible, fully automated workflow with novel visual-based SSO detection techniques, enhanced security and privacy analyses, and continuously updated monitoring results. It receives a list of domains as input to discover the login pages, recognize the supported Identity Providers (IdPs), and execute the SSO. It further reveals the current security level of SSO in the wild compared to the security best practices on paper. With SSO-MONITOR, we automatically identified 1,632 websites with 3,020 Apple, Facebook, or Google logins within the Tranco 10k. Our continuous monitoring also revealed how quickly these numbers change over time. SSO-MONITOR can automatically login to each SSO website. It records the logins by tracing HTTP and in-browser communication to detect widespread security and privacy issues automatically. We introduce a novel deep-level inspection of HTTP parameters that we call SMARTPARMS. Using SMARTPARMS for security analyses, we uncovered URL parameters in 5 Client Application (Client) secret leakages and 337 cases with weak CSRF protection. We additionally identified 447 cases with no CSRF protection, 342 insecure SSO flows and 9 cases with nested URL parameters, leading to an open redirect in one case. SSO-MONITOR reveals privacy leakages that deanonymize users in 200 cases. ",

Thanks to a mean-field analysis we demonstrate that the resulting Fokker-Planck system permits to reproduce bimodal distributions of opinions as observed in polarization dynamics. The model is then applied to sentiment analysis data from social media platforms in Italy, in order to analyze the evolution of opinions about Covid-19 vaccination. We show through numerical simulations that the model is capable to describe correctly the formation of the bimodal opinion structure observed in the vaccine-hesitant dataset, which is witness of the known polarization effects that happen within closed online communities.

    "abstract": "Purpose: In curriculum learning, the idea is to train on easier samples first and gradually increase the difficulty, while in self-paced learning, a pacing function defines the speed to adapt the training progress. While both methods heavily rely on the ability to score the difficulty of data samples, an optimal scoring function is still under exploration. Methodology: Distillation is a knowledge transfer approach where a teacher network guides a student network by feeding a sequence of random samples. We argue that guiding student networks with an efficient curriculum strategy can improve model generalization and robustness. For this purpose, we design an uncertainty-based paced curriculum learning in self distillation for medical image segmentation. We fuse the prediction uncertainty and annotation boundary uncertainty to develop a novel paced-curriculum distillation (PCD). We utilize the teacher model to obtain prediction uncertainty and spatially varying label smoothing with Gaussian kernel to generate segmentation boundary uncertainty from the annotation. We also investigate the robustness of our method by applying various types and severity of image perturbation and corruption. Results: The proposed technique is validated on two medical datasets of breast ultrasound image segmentation and robotassisted surgical scene segmentation and achieved significantly better performance in terms of segmentation and robustness. Conclusion: P-CD improves the performance and obtains better generalization and robustness over the dataset shift. While curriculum learning requires extensive tuning of hyper-parameters for pacing function, the level of performance improvement suppresses this limitation. ",

    "abstract": "Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has been a prevailing framework for self-supervised visual representation learning. Within the pretraining-finetuning paradigm, the MIM framework trains an encoder by reconstructing masked image patches with the help of a decoder which would be abandoned when the encoder is used for finetuning. Despite its state-of-the-art performance on clean images, MIM models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting its real-world application, and few studies have focused on this issue. In this paper, we have discovered that noisy image modeling (NIM), a variant of MIM that uses denoising as the pre-text task, provides not only good pretrained visual features, but also effective adversarial defense for downstream models. To achieve a better accuracy-robustness trade-off, we further propose to sample the hyperparameter that controls the reconstruction difficulty from random distributions instead of setting it globally, and fine-tune downstream networks with denoised images. Experimental results demonstrate that our pre-trained denoising autoencoders are effective against different white-box, gray-box, and black-box attacks without being trained with adversarial images, while not harming the clean accuracy of fine-tuned models.

Especially when their rewards compete with each other like zero-sum games, the dynamics often do not converge to their optimum, i.e., Nash equilibrium. To tackle such complexity, many studies have understood various learning algorithms as dynamical systems and discovered qualitative insights among the algorithms. However, such studies have yet to handle multi-memory games (where agents can memorize actions they played in the past and choose their actions based on their memories), even though memorization plays a pivotal role in artificial intelligence and interpersonal relationship. This study extends two major learning algorithms in games, i.e., replicator dynamics and gradient ascent, into multi-memory games. Then, we prove their dynamics are identical. Furthermore, theoretically and experimentally, we clarify that the learning dynamics diverge from the Nash equilibrium in multi-memory zero-sum games and reach heteroclinic cycles (sojourn longer around the boundary of the strategy space), providing a fundamental advance in learning in games.

While recent methods study prediction confidence, this work reports prediction dispersity is another informative cue. Confidence reflects whether the individual prediction is certain; dispersity indicates how the overall predictions are distributed across all categories. Our key insight is that a well-performing model should give predictions with high confidence and high dispersity. That is, we need to consider both properties so as to make more accurate estimates. To this end, we use the nuclear norm that has been shown to be effective in characterizing both properties. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of nuclear norm for various models (e.g., ViT and ConvNeXt), different datasets (e.g., ImageNet and CUB-200), and diverse types of distribution shifts (e.g., style shift and reproduction shift). We show that the nuclear norm is more accurate and robust in accuracy estimation than existing methods. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of other measurements (e.g., mutual information maximization) for characterizing dispersity and confidence. Lastly, we investigate the limitation of the nuclear norm, study its improved variant under severe class imbalance, and discuss potential directions. ",

    "abstract": "This study presents a high-accuracy, efficient, and physically induced method for 3D point cloud registration, which is the core of many important 3D vision problems. In contrast to existing physics-based methods that merely consider spatial point information and ignore surface geometry, we explore geometry aware rigid-body dynamics to regulate the particle (point) motion, which results in more precise and robust registration. Our proposed method consists of four major modules. First, we leverage the graph signal processing (GSP) framework to define a new signature, (i.e., point response intensity for each point), by which we succeed in describing the local surface variation, resampling keypoints, and distinguishing different particles. Then, to address the shortcomings of current physics-based approaches that are sensitive to outliers, we accommodate the defined point response intensity to median absolute deviation (MAD) in robust statistics and adopt the X84 principle for adaptive outlier depression, ensuring a robust and stable registration. Subsequently, we propose a novel geometric invariant under rigid transformations to incorporate higher-order features of point clouds, which is further embedded for force modeling to guide the correspondence between pairwise scans credibly. Finally, we introduce an adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) method to search for the global optimum and substantially accelerate the registration process. We perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method on various datasets captured from range scanners to LiDAR. Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms representative state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and is more suitable for registering large-scale point clouds. Furthermore, it is considerably faster and more robust than most competitors. ",

    "abstract": "With the increase of pages and buttons in real-world applications, industrial-scale recommender systems face multi-domain and multi-task challenges. On the one hand, users and items in multiple domains suffer inconsistent distributions. On the other hand, multiple tasks have distinctive sparsity and interdependence. Personalization modeling is the core of recommender systems. Accurate personalization estimation helps to capture the degree of user preference for items in different situations, especially in the case of multiple domains and multiple tasks. In multi-task and multi-domain recommendation, how to introduce personalized priors into the model in the right place and in the right way is crucial. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play Parameter and Embedding Personalized Network (PEPNet) for multi-task recommendation in the multi-domain setting. PEPNet takes features with strong bias as input and dynamically acts on the bottom-layer embeddings or the top-layer DNN hidden units in the model through the gate mechanism. By mapping significant priors to scaling weights ranging from 0 to 2, PEPNet introduces both parameter personalization and embedding personalization. Embedding Personalized Network (EPNet) selects and aligns embeddings with different semantics under multiple domains. Parameter Personalized Network (PPNet) influences DNN parameters to balance interdependent targets in multiple tasks. To further adapt to the characteristics of the model, we have made corresponding engineering optimizations on the Embedding and DNN parameter update strategies. We have deployed the model in Kuaishou and Kuaishou Express apps, serving over 300 million daily users. Both online and offline experiments have demonstrated substantial improvements in multiple metrics. In particular, we have seen a more than 1\\% online increase in three major domains. ",

    "abstract": "De novo molecular generation is an essential task for science discovery. Recently, fragment-based deep generative models have attracted much research attention due to their flexibility in generating novel molecules based on existing molecule fragments. However, the motif vocabulary, i.e., the collection of frequent fragments, is usually built upon heuristic rules, which brings difficulties to capturing common substructures from large amounts of molecules. In this work, we propose a new method, MiCaM, to generate molecules based on mined connection-aware motifs. Specifically, it leverages a data-driven algorithm to automatically discover motifs from a molecule library by iteratively merging subgraphs based on their frequency. The obtained motif vocabulary consists of not only molecular motifs (i.e., the frequent fragments), but also their connection information, indicating how the motifs are connected with each other. Based on the mined connection-aware motifs, MiCaM builds a connection-aware generator, which simultaneously picks up motifs and determines how they are connected. We test our method on distribution-learning benchmarks (i.e., generating novel molecules to resemble the distribution of a given training set) and goal-directed benchmarks (i.e., generating molecules with target properties), and achieve significant improvements over previous fragment-based baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can effectively mine domain-specific motifs for different tasks. ",

Therefore, it is very necessary to effectively control carbon dioxide emissions by accurately predicting and analyzing the change trend timely, so as to provide a reference for carbon dioxide emissions mitigation measures. This paper is aiming to select a suitable model to predict the near-real-time daily emissions based on univariate daily time-series data from January 1st, 2020 to September 30st, 2022 of all sectors (Power, Industry, Ground Transport, Residential, Domestic Aviation, International Aviation) in China. We proposed six prediction models, which including three statistical models: Grey prediction (GM(1,1)), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors (SARIMAX); three machine learning models: artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and long short term memory (LSTM). To evaluate the performance of these models, five criteria: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Coefficient of Determination () are imported and discussed in detail. In the results, three machine learning models perform better than that three statistical models, in which LSTM model performs the best on five criteria values for daily emissions prediction with the 3.5179e-04 MSE value, 0.0187 RMSE value, 0.0140 MAE value, 14.8291% MAPE value and 0.9844 value.

To overcome the issue of scarcity of training data for this COVID-19 pandemic, we have developed a novel data augmentation technique to generate useful data for training. More importantly, the generated data can also be used for model validation. As such, it has a two-fold advantage: 1) more actual observations can be used for training, and 2) the model can be validated on data which has distribution closer to the expected situation.

Predicting scenario evaluation metrics, VectorNet partially achieves lower errors than regression models that separately process the three scenarios' data. However, for comprehensive generalization, sufficient variance in the training data must be ensured. Thus, contrary to existing methods, our proposed method can merge diverse scenarios' data and exploit spatial and temporal nuances in the vectorized scenario description. As a result, data from specified test scenarios and real-world scenarios can be compared and combined for (predictive) analyses and scenario selection. ",

The addressed inspection planning problem is formulated as a single-depot multiple-vehicle scenario, where the inspection vehicles are constrained by the battery budget limiting their inspection time. The inspection vehicle is assumed to be an autonomous multi-copter with a wide range of possible flight speeds influencing battery consumption. The inspection plan is represented by multiple routes for vehicles providing full coverage over inspection target power lines. On an inspection vehicle mission interruption, which might happen at any time during the execution of the inspection plan, the inspection is re-planned using the remaining vehicles and their remaining battery budgets. Robustness is introduced by choosing a suitable cost function for the initial plan that maximizes the time window for successful re-planning. It enables the remaining vehicles to successfully finish all the inspection targets using their respective remaining battery budgets. A combinatorial metaheuristic algorithm with various cost functions is used for planning and fast re-planning during the inspection. ",

Here we introduce four types of neuronal dynamics to post-process the sequential patterns generated from the spiking transformer to get the complex dynamic neuron improved spiking transformer neural network (DyTr-SNN). We found that the DyTr-SNN could handle the non-toy automatic speech recognition task well, representing a lower phoneme error rate, lower computational cost, and higher robustness. These results indicate that the further cooperation of SNNs and neural dynamics at the neuron and network scales might have much in store for the future, especially on the ASR tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art causal models for link prediction assume an underlying set of inherent node factors -- an innate characteristic defined at the node's birth -- that governs the causal evolution of links in the graph. In some causal tasks, however, link formation is path-dependent, i.e., the outcome of link interventions depends on existing links. For instance, in the customer-product graph of an online retailer, the effect of an 85-inch TV ad (treatment) likely depends on whether the costumer already has an 85-inch TV. Unfortunately, existing causal methods are impractical in these scenarios. The cascading functional dependencies between links (due to path dependence) are either unidentifiable or require an impractical number of control variables. In order to remedy this shortcoming, this work develops the first causal model capable of dealing with path dependencies in link prediction. It introduces the concept of causal lifting, an invariance in causal models that, when satisfied, allows the identification of causal link prediction queries using limited interventional data. On the estimation side, we show how structural pairwise embeddings -- a type of symmetry-based joint representation of node pairs in a graph -- exhibit lower bias and correctly represent the causal structure of the task, as opposed to existing node embedding methods, e.g., GNNs and matrix factorization. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings on four datasets under three different scenarios for causal link prediction tasks: knowledge base completion, covariance matrix estimation and consumer-product recommendations.

Reinforcement learning is a promising technique to address this challenge but existing methods often use local optimizations to scale to large network deployments. We propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize mobile network configurations globally. By using a value decomposition approach, our algorithm can be trained from a global reward function instead of relying on an ad-hoc decomposition of the network performance across the different cells. The algorithm uses a graph neural network architecture which generalizes to different network topologies and learns coordination behaviors. We empirically demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on an antenna tilt tuning problem and a joint tilt and power control problem in a simulated environment. ",

In particular, anomaly detection in temporal graphs is crucial for many real world applications such as intrusion identification in network systems, detection of ecosystem disturbances and detection of epidemic outbreaks. In this paper, we focus on change point detection in dynamic graphs and address three main challenges associated with this problem: i). how to compare graph snapshots across time, ii). how to capture temporal dependencies, and iii). how to combine different views of a temporal graph. To solve the above challenges, we first propose Laplacian Anomaly Detection (LAD) which uses the spectrum of graph Laplacian as the low dimensional embedding of the graph structure at each snapshot. LAD explicitly models short term and long term dependencies by applying two sliding windows. Next, we propose MultiLAD, a simple and effective generalization of LAD to multi-view graphs. MultiLAD provides the first change point detection method for multi-view dynamic graphs. It aggregates the singular values of the normalized graph Laplacian from different views through the scalar power mean operation. Through extensive synthetic experiments, we show that i). LAD and MultiLAD are accurate and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and their multi-view extensions by a large margin, ii). MultiLAD's advantage over contenders significantly increases when additional views are available, and iii). MultiLAD is highly robust to noise from individual views. In five real world dynamic graphs, we demonstrate that LAD and MultiLAD identify significant events as top anomalies such as the implementation of government COVID-19 interventions which impacted the population mobility in multi-view traffic networks.

Moreover, the framework allows for the creation of powerful new signal representations, such as the Coefficient-Basis Factorization (CoBaFa) which we propose in this paper. As evidenced by our experiments, CoBaFa leads to improvements over previous fast reconstruction methods in terms of the three critical goals in neural signal representation: approximation quality, compactness and efficiency. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our representation achieves better image approximation quality on 2D image regression tasks, higher geometric quality when reconstructing 3D signed distance fields and higher compactness for radiance field reconstruction tasks compared to previous fast reconstruction methods. Besides, our CoBaFa representation enables generalization by sharing the basis across signals during training, enabling generalization tasks such as image regression with sparse observations and few-shot radiance field reconstruction.

The burden of continuously delivering improved communication performance to support next-generation applications and services, combined with the increasing heterogeneity of systems and network technologies, has promoted the design of Congestion Control (CC) algorithms that perform well under specific environments. The challenge of designing a generic CC algorithm that can adapt to a broad range of scenarios is still an open research question. To tackle this challenge, we propose to apply a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach. Our solution, MARLIN, uses the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm to maximize both entropy and return and models the learning process as an infinite-horizon task. We trained MARLIN on a real network with varying background traffic patterns to overcome the sim-to-real mismatch that researchers have encountered when applying RL to CC. We evaluated our solution on the task of file transfer and compared it to TCP Cubic. While further research is required, results have shown that MARLIN can achieve comparable results to TCP with little hyperparameter tuning, in a task significantly different from its training setting. Therefore, we believe that our work represents a promising first step toward building CC algorithms based on the maximum entropy RL framework. ",

The proposed architecture consists of separate weight and noise planes, in which PCM cells are configured and operated to represent the nominal values of weights and to generate the required noise for sampling, respectively. Using experimentally observed PCM noise characteristics, for the exemplary Breast Cancer Dataset classification problem, we obtain hardware accuracy and expected calibration error matching that of an 8-bit fixed-point (FxP8) implementation, with projected savings of over 9$\\times$ in terms of core area transistor count.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised depth estimation draws a lot of attention recently as it can promote the 3D sensing capabilities of self-driving vehicles. However, it intrinsically relies upon the photometric consistency assumption, which hardly holds during nighttime. Although various supervised nighttime image enhancement methods have been proposed, their generalization performance in challenging driving scenarios is not satisfactory. To this end, we propose the first method that jointly learns a nighttime image enhancer and a depth estimator, without using ground truth for either task. Our method tightly entangles two self-supervised tasks using a newly proposed uncertain pixel masking strategy. This strategy originates from the observation that nighttime images not only suffer from underexposed regions but also from overexposed regions. By fitting a bridge-shaped curve to the illumination map distribution, both regions are suppressed and two tasks are bridged naturally. We benchmark the method on two established datasets: nuScenes and RobotCar and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both of them. Detailed ablations also reveal the mechanism of our proposal. Last but not least, to mitigate the problem of sparse ground truth of existing datasets, we provide a new photo-realistically enhanced nighttime dataset based upon CARLA. It brings meaningful new challenges to the community. Codes, data, and models are available at https://github.com/ucaszyp/STEPS. ",

    "abstract": "We study a deep linear network endowed with a structure. It takes the form of a matrix $X$ obtained by multiplying $K$ matrices (called factors and corresponding to the action of the layers). The action of each layer (i.e. a factor) is obtained by applying a fixed linear operator to a vector of parameters satisfying a constraint. The number of layers is not limited. Assuming that $X$ is given and factors have been estimated, the error between the product of the estimated factors and $X$ (i.e. the reconstruction error) is either the statistical or the empirical risk. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the network topology under which a stability property holds. The stability property requires that the error on the parameters defining the factors (i.e. the stability of the recovered parameters) scales linearly with the reconstruction error (i.e. the risk). Therefore, under these conditions on the network topology, any successful learning task leads to stably defined features and therefore interpretable layers/network.In order to do so, we first evaluate how the Segre embedding and its inverse distort distances. Then, we show that any deep structured linear network can be cast as a generic multilinear problem (that uses the Segre embedding). This is the {\\em tensorial lifting}. Using the tensorial lifting, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the identifiability of the factors (up to a scale rearrangement). We finally provide the necessary and sufficient condition called \\NSPlong~(because of the analogy with the usual Null Space Property in the compressed sensing framework) which guarantees that the stability property holds. We illustrate the theory with a practical example where the deep structured linear network is a convolutional linear network. As expected, the conditions are rather strong but not empty. A simple test on the network topology can be implemented to test if the condition holds. ",

    "abstract": "In many areas of science and engineering, computer simulations are widely used as proxies for physical experiments, which can be infeasible or unethical. Such simulations can often be computationally expensive, and an emulator can be trained to efficiently predict the desired response surface. A widely-used emulator is the Gaussian process (GP), which provides a flexible framework for efficient prediction and uncertainty quantification. Standard GPs, however, do not capture structured sparsity on the underlying response surface, which is present in many applications, particularly in the physical sciences. We thus propose a new hierarchical shrinkage GP (HierGP), which incorporates such structure via cumulative shrinkage priors within a GP framework. We show that the HierGP implicitly embeds the well-known principles of effect sparsity, heredity and hierarchy for analysis of experiments, which allows our model to identify structured sparse features from the response surface with limited data. We propose efficient posterior sampling algorithms for model training and prediction, and prove desirable consistency properties for the HierGP. Finally, we demonstrate the improved performance of HierGP over existing models, in a suite of numerical experiments and an application to dynamical system recovery. ",

We present results which display little to no degradation in prediction accuracy, while reducing the online optimization cost by orders of magnitude. We consider NACA airfoils as a test case for our proposed approach, as their shape can be easily defined by the four-digit parametrization. We successfully optimize the constrained NACA four-digit problem with respect to maximizing the lift-to-drag ratio and validate all results by comparing them to a high-order CFD solver. We find that DeepONets have low generalization error, making them ideal for generating solutions of unseen shapes. Specifically, pressure, density, and velocity fields are accurately inferred at a fraction of a second, hence enabling the use of general objective functions beyond the maximization of the lift-to-drag ratio considered in the current work.

We instead harness temporal correlation across frames through simultaneous analysis of long image sequences, specified as a spatio-temporal image tensor. We define new ridge detection algorithms to non-parametrically estimate explicit trajectories of atomic-level object locations as a continuous function of time. Our approach is specially tailored to handle temporal analysis of objects that seemingly stochastically disappear and subsequently reappear throughout a sequence.

    "abstract": "Sparse linear models are a gold standard tool for interpretable machine learning, a field of emerging importance as predictive models permeate decision-making in many domains. Unfortunately, sparse linear models are far less flexible as functions of their input features than black-box models like deep neural networks. With this capability gap in mind, we study a not-uncommon situation where the input features dichotomize into two groups: explanatory features, which we wish to explain the model's predictions, and contextual features, which we wish to determine the model's explanations. This dichotomy leads us to propose the contextual lasso, a new statistical estimator that fits a sparse linear model whose sparsity pattern and coefficients can vary with the contextual features. The fitting process involves learning a nonparametric map, realized via a deep neural network, from contextual feature vector to sparse coefficient vector. To attain sparse coefficients, we train the network with a novel lasso regularizer in the form of a projection layer that maps the network's output onto the space of $\\ell_1$-constrained linear models. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data suggest that the learned models, which remain highly transparent, can be sparser than the regular lasso without sacrificing the predictive power of a standard deep neural network.

At the same time, embedding trained machine learning models directly into the optimization problems has become an effective and state-of-the-art approach for surrogate optimization, whose performance can be improved by physics-informed training. In this study, it is proposed to upgrade piece-wise linear neural network models with physics informed knowledge for optimization problems with neural network models embedded. In addition to using widely accepted and naturally piece-wise linear rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions, this study also suggests piece-wise linear approximations for the hyperbolic tangent activation function to widen the domain. Optimization of three case studies, a blending process, an industrial distillation column and a crude oil column are investigated. For all cases, physics-informed trained neural network based optimal results are closer to global optimality.

    "abstract": "Robust Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are getting more attention for learning a robust policy which is less sensitive to environment changes. There are an increasing number of works analyzing sample-efficiency of robust MDPs. However, most works study robust MDPs in a model-based regime, where the transition probability needs to be estimated and requires $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{S}|^2|\\mathcal{A}|)$ storage in memory. A common way to solve robust MDPs is to formulate them as a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem. However, solving a DRO problem is non-trivial, so prior works typically assume a strong oracle to obtain the optimal solution of the DRO problem easily. To remove the need for an oracle, we first transform the original robust MDPs into an alternative form, as the alternative form allows us to use stochastic gradient methods to solve the robust MDPs. Moreover, we prove the alternative form still preserves the role of robustness. With this new formulation, we devise a sample-efficient algorithm to solve the robust MDPs in a model-free regime, from which we benefit lower memory space $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{S}||\\mathcal{A}|)$ without using the oracle. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and show the efficiency to solve the alternative form of robust MDPs. ",

    "abstract": "By a $z$-coloring of a graph $G$ we mean any proper vertex coloring consisting of the color classes $C_1, \\ldots, C_k$ such that $(i)$ for any two colors $i$ and $j$ with $1 \\leq i < j \\leq k$, any vertex of color $j$ is adjacent to a vertex of color $i$, $(ii)$ there exists a set $\\{u_1, \\ldots, u_k\\}$ of vertices of $G$ such that $u_j \\in C_j$ for any $j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$ and $u_k$ is adjacent to $u_j$ for each $1 \\leq j \\leq k$ with $j \\not=k$, and $(iii)$ for each $i$ and $j$ with $i \\not= j$, the vertex $u_j$ has a neighbor in $C_i$. Denote by $z(G)$ the maximum number of colors used in any $z$-coloring of $G$. Denote the Grundy and {\\rm b}-chromatic number of $G$ by $\\Gamma(G)$ and ${\\rm b}(G)$, respectively. The $z$-coloring is an improvement over both the Grundy and b-coloring of graphs. We prove that $z(G)$ is much better than $\\min\\{\\Gamma(G), {\\rm b}(G)\\}$ for infinitely many graphs $G$ by obtaining an infinite sequence $\\{G_n\\}_{n=3}^{\\infty}$ of graphs such that $z(G_n)=n$ but $\\Gamma(G_n)={\\rm b}(G_n)=2n-1$ for each $n\\geq 3$. We show that acyclic graphs are $z$-monotonic and $z$-continuous. Then it is proved that to decide whether $z(G)=\\Delta(G)+1$ is $NP$-complete even for bipartite graphs $G$. We finally prove that to recognize graphs $G$ satisfying $z(G)=\\chi(G)$ is $coNP$-complete, improving a previous result for the Grundy number. ",
