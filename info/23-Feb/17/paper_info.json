    "abstract": "Deep learning-based grasp prediction models have become an industry standard for robotic bin-picking systems. To maximize pick success, production environments are often equipped with several end-effector tools that can be swapped on-the-fly, based on the target object. Tool-change, however, takes time. Choosing the order of grasps to perform, and corresponding tool-change actions, can improve system throughput; this is the topic of our work. The main challenge in planning tool change is uncertainty - we typically cannot see objects in the bin that are currently occluded. Inspired by queuing and admission control problems, we model the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the goal is to maximize expected throughput, and we pursue an approximate solution based on model predictive control, where at each time step we plan based only on the currently visible objects. Special to our method is the idea of void zones, which are geometrical boundaries in which an unknown object will be present, and therefore cannot be accounted for during planning. Our planning problem can be solved using integer linear programming (ILP). However, we find that an approximate solution based on sparse tree search yields near optimal performance at a fraction of the time. Another question that we explore is how to measure the performance of tool-change planning: we find that throughput alone can fail to capture delicate and smooth behavior, and propose a principled alternative. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithms on both synthetic and real world bin picking tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is one of the most prevalent tools in deep learning, underpinning many recent advances, including those from classification, generative models, and representation learning. The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Consider the task of recognizing different animals. Current augmentations fail to produce diversity in task-relevant high-level semantic attributes like the species of the animal. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on image classification tasks in a few-shot setting, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains. ",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning of discrete representations from continuous ones in neural networks (NNs) is the cornerstone of several applications today. Vector Quantisation (VQ) has become a popular method to achieve such representations, in particular in the context of generative models such as Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). For example, the exponential moving average-based VQ (EMA-VQ) algorithm is often used. Here we study an alternative VQ algorithm based on the learning rule of Kohonen Self-Organising Maps (KSOMs; 1982) of which EMA-VQ is a special case. In fact, KSOM is a classic VQ algorithm which is known to offer two potential benefits over the latter: empirically, KSOM is known to perform faster VQ, and discrete representations learned by KSOM form a topological structure on the grid whose nodes are the discrete symbols, resulting in an artificial version of the topographic map in the brain. We revisit these properties by using KSOM in VQ-VAEs for image processing. In particular, our experiments show that, while the speed-up compared to well-configured EMA-VQ is only observable at the beginning of training, KSOM is generally much more robust than EMA-VQ, e.g., w.r.t. the choice of initialisation schemes.

While prior work has shown how social networks respond to shocks, these studies usually treat all ties equally, despite differences in the support provided by different social relationships. Here, we conduct a computational analysis on Twitter that examines how responses to online shocks differ by the relationship type of a user dyad. We introduce a new dataset of over 13K instances of individuals' self-reporting shock events on Twitter and construct networks of relationship-labeled dyadic interactions around these events. By examining behaviors across 110K replies to shocked users in a pseudo-causal analysis, we demonstrate relationship-specific patterns in response levels and topic shifts. We also show that while well-established social dimensions of closeness such as tie strength and structural embeddedness contribute to shock responsiveness, the degree of impact is highly dependent on relationship and shock types. Our findings indicate that social relationships contain highly distinctive characteristics in network interactions and that relationship-specific behaviors in online shock responses are unique from those of offline settings.

In this paper, we propose a series of modifications to existing language models to jointly represent and generate text and math: representing mathematical expressions as sequences of node tokens in their operator tree format, using math symbol and tree position embeddings to preserve the semantic and structural properties of mathematical expressions, and using a constrained decoding method to generate mathematically valid expressions. We ground our modifications in GPT-2, resulting in a model MathGPT, and demonstrate that it outperforms baselines on mathematical expression generation tasks. ",

One important aspect of the problem, that can significantly impact quality, is the distribution skew among tasks. Certain tasks may have much fewer data samples than others, making them more susceptible to the noise added for privacy. It is natural to ask whether algorithms can adapt to this skew to improve the overall utility. We give a systematic analysis of the problem, by studying how to optimally allocate a user's privacy budget among tasks. We propose a generic algorithm, based on an adaptive reweighting of the empirical loss, and show that when there is task distribution skew, this gives a quantifiable improvement of excess empirical risk. Experimental studies on recommendation problems that exhibit a long tail of small tasks, demonstrate that our methods significantly improve utility, achieving the state of the art on two standard benchmarks.

While prior works and existing DDoS attacks have largely focused on individual nodes transmitting packets at a high volume, we investigate more sophisticated futuristic attacks that use large numbers of IoT devices and camouflage their attack by having each node transmit at a volume typical of benign traffic. We introduce new correlation-aware architectures that take into account the correlation of traffic across IoT nodes, and we also compare the effectiveness of centralized and distributed detection models. We extensively analyze the proposed architectures by evaluating five different neural network models trained on a dataset derived from a 4060-node real-world IoT system. We observe that long short-term memory (LSTM) and a transformer-based model, in conjunction with the architectures that use correlation information of the IoT nodes, provide higher performance (in terms of F1 score and binary accuracy) than the other models and architectures, especially when the attacker camouflages itself by following benign traffic distribution on each transmitting node. For instance, by using the LSTM model, the distributed correlation-aware architecture gives 81% F1 score for the attacker that camouflages their attack with benign traffic as compared to 35% for the architecture that does not use correlation information. We also investigate the performance of heuristics for selecting a subset of nodes to share their data for correlation-aware architectures to meet resource constraints. ",

    "abstract": "Detection and identification of nonlinearity is a task of high importance for structural dynamics. Detecting nonlinearity in a structure, which has been designed to operate in its linear region, might indicate the existence of damage. Therefore, it is important, even for safety reasons, to detect when a structure exhibits nonlinear behaviour. In the current work, a method to detect nonlinearity is proposed, based on the distribution of the gradients of a data-driven model, which is fitted on data acquired from the structure of interest. The data-driven model herein is a neural network. The selection of such a type of model was done in order to not allow the user to decide how linear or nonlinear the model shall be, but to let the training algorithm of the neural network shape the level of nonlinearity according to the training data. The neural network is trained to predict the accelerations of the structure for a time-instant using as inputs accelerations of previous time-instants, i.e. one-step-ahead predictions. Afterwards, the gradients of the output of the neural network with respect to its inputs are calculated. Given that the structure is linear, the distribution of the aforementioned gradients should be quite peaked, while in the case of a structure with nonlinearities, the distribution of the gradients shall be more spread and, potentially, multimodal. To test the above assumption, data from an experimental structure are considered. The structure is tested under different scenarios, some of which are linear and some nonlinear. The statistics of the distributions of the gradients for the different scenarios can be used to identify cases where nonlinearity is present. Moreover, via the proposed method one is able to quantify the nonlinearity by observing higher values of standard deviation of the distribution of the gradients for \"more nonlinear\" scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "We aim to secure a large-scale device-to-device (D2D) network against adversaries. The D2D network underlays a downlink cellular network to reuse the cellular spectrum and is enabled for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). In the D2D network, the transmitters communicate with the receivers, and the receivers extract information and energy from their received radio-frequency (RF) signals. In the meantime, the adversaries aim to detect the D2D transmission. The D2D network applies power control and leverages the cellular signal to achieve covert communication (i.e., hide the presence of transmissions) so as to defend against the adversaries. We model the interaction between the D2D network and adversaries by using a two-stage Stackelberg game. Therein, the adversaries are the followers minimizing their detection errors at the lower stage and the D2D network is the leader maximizing its network utility constrained by the communication covertness and power outage at the upper stage. Both power splitting (PS)-based and time switch (TS)-based SWIPT schemes are explored. We characterize the spatial configuration of the large-scale D2D network, adversaries, and cellular network by stochastic geometry. We analyze the adversary's detection error minimization problem and adopt the Rosenbrock method to solve it, where the obtained solution is the best response from the lower stage. Taking into account the best response from the lower stage, we develop a bi-level algorithm to solve the D2D network's constrained network utility maximization problem and obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium.

In particular, to better capture the sharpness of the solution, we propose adaptive sampling methods (ASMs) based on the residual and the gradient of the solution. We first present a residual only based ASM algorithm denoted by ASM I. In this approach, we first train the neural network by using a small number of residual points and divide the computational domain into a certain number of sub-domains, we then add new residual points in the sub-domain which has the largest mean absolute value of the residual, and those points which have largest absolute values of the residual in this sub-domain will be added as new residual points. We further develop a second type of ASM algorithm (denoted by ASM II) based on both the residual and the gradient of the solution due to the fact that only the residual may be not able to efficiently capture the sharpness of the solution. The procedure of ASM II is almost the same as that of ASM I except that in ASM II, we add new residual points which not only have large residual but also large gradient. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the present methods, we employ both ASM I and ASM II to solve a number of PDEs, including Burger equation, compressible Euler equation, Poisson equation over an L-shape domain as well as high-dimensional Poisson equation. It has been shown from the numerical results that the sharp solutions can be well approximated by using either ASM I or ASM II algorithm, and both methods deliver much more accurate solution than original PINNs with the same number of residual points. Moreover, the ASM II algorithm has better performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency and stability compared with the ASM I algorithm. ",

To reduce labeling requirement, the \"pre-train, fine-tune\" and \"pre-train, prompt\" paradigms have become increasingly common. In particular, prompting is a popular alternative to fine-tuning in natural language processing, which is designed to narrow the gap between pre-training and downstream objectives in a task-specific manner. However, existing study of prompting on graphs is still limited, lacking a universal treatment to appeal to different downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose GraphPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework on graphs. GraphPrompt not only unifies pre-training and downstream tasks into a common task template, but also employs a learnable prompt to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant knowledge from the pre-train model in a task-specific manner.

Nevertheless, recent studies have illustrated that FL still suffers from information leakage as adversaries try to recover the training data by analyzing shared parameters from local clients. To deal with this issue, differential privacy (DP) is adopted to add noise to the gradients of local models before aggregation. It, however, results in the poor performance of gradient-based interpretability methods, since some weights capturing the salient region in feature map will be perturbed. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive differential privacy (ADP) mechanism that selectively adds noisy perturbations to the gradients of client models in FL. We also theoretically analyze the impact of gradient perturbation on the model interpretability. Finally, extensive experiments on both IID and Non-IID data demonstrate that the proposed ADP can achieve a good trade-off between privacy and interpretability in FL. ",

Typically, to train CNN-based cell detection models, every positive instance in the training images needs to be annotated, and instances that are not labeled as positive are considered negative samples. However, manual cell annotation is complicated due to the large number and diversity of cells, and it can be difficult to ensure the annotation of every positive instance. In many cases, only incomplete annotations are available, where some of the positive instances are annotated and the others are not, and the classification loss term for negative samples in typical network training becomes incorrect. In this work, to address this problem of incomplete annotations, we propose to reformulate the training of the detection network as a positive-unlabeled learning problem. Since the instances in unannotated regions can be either positive or negative, they have unknown labels. Using the samples with unknown labels and the positively labeled samples, we first derive an approximation of the classification loss term corresponding to negative samples for binary cell detection, and based on this approximation we further extend the proposed framework to multi-class cell detection. For evaluation, experiments were performed on four publicly available datasets. The experimental results show that our method improves the performance of cell detection in histopathology images given incomplete annotations for network training. ",

However, little research attention is paid to the potential and practice of immunization on graphs. In this paper, we propose and formulate graph adversarial immunization, i.e., vaccinating part of graph structure to improve certifiable robustness of graph against any admissible adversarial attack. We first propose edge-level immunization to vaccinate node pairs. Despite the primary success, such edge-level immunization cannot defend against emerging node injection attacks, since it only immunizes existing node pairs. To this end, we further propose node-level immunization. To circumvent computationally expensive combinatorial optimization when solving adversarial immunization, we design AdvImmune-Edge and AdvImmune-Node algorithms to effectively obtain the immune node pairs or nodes. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdvImmune methods. In particular, AdvImmune-Node remarkably improves the ratio of robust nodes by 79%, 294%, and 100%, after immunizing only 5% nodes. Furthermore, AdvImmune methods show excellent defensive performance against various attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art defenses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to improve certifiable robustness from graph data perspective without losing performance on clean graphs, providing new insights into graph adversarial learning.

Unlike previous multi-modal transformers that directly connecting all patches from two modalities, we explore the cross-modal complementarity hierarchically to respect the modality gap and spatial discrepancy in unaligned regions. Specifically, we propose to use intra-modal self-attention to explore complementary global contexts, and measure spatial-aligned inter-modal attention locally to capture cross-modal correlations. In addition, we present a Feature Pyramid module for Transformer (FPT) to boost informative cross-scale integration as well as a consistency-complementarity module to disentangle the multi-modal integration path and improve the fusion adaptivity. Comprehensive experiments on a large variety of public datasets verify the efficacy of our designs and the consistent improvement over state-of-the-art models. ",

    "abstract": "While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved excellent performances in various computer vision tasks, they often misclassify with malicious samples, a.k.a. adversarial examples. Adversarial training is a popular and straightforward technique to defend against the threat of adversarial examples. Unfortunately, CNNs must sacrifice the accuracy of standard samples to improve robustness against adversarial examples when adversarial training is used. In this work, we propose Masking and Mixing Adversarial Training (M2AT) to mitigate the trade-off between accuracy and robustness. We focus on creating diverse adversarial examples during training. Specifically, our approach consists of two processes: 1) masking a perturbation with a binary mask and 2) mixing two partially perturbed images. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves better robustness against several adversarial attacks than previous methods. ",

While the PC algorithm can identify this class under strong faithfulness assumptions, it can be computationally prohibitive. Fortunately, only the local graph structure around the treatment is required to identify the set of possible ATE values, a fact exploited by local discovery algorithms to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Local Discovery using Eager Collider Checks (LDECC), a new local causal discovery algorithm that leverages unshielded colliders to orient the treatment's parents differently from existing methods. We show that there exist graphs where LDECC exponentially outperforms existing local discovery algorithms and vice versa. Moreover, we show that LDECC and existing algorithms rely on different faithfulness assumptions, leveraging this insight to weaken the assumptions for identifying the set of possible ATE values. ",

FBA allows the model to attend to all the positions in the batch and learns the relationships between positions explicitly and NCG identifies the useful information from the distant context. We conduct comprehensive experiments and analyses on three benchmark datasets for English-German translation, and validate the effectiveness of two variants of DocFlat. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms strong baselines with statistical significance on BLEU, COMET and accuracy on the contrastive test set.

As it focuses on visual information to model the speech, its performance is inherently sensitive to personal lip appearances and movements, and this makes the VSR models show degraded performance when they are applied to unseen speakers. In this paper, to remedy the performance degradation of the VSR model on unseen speakers, we propose prompt tuning methods of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for speaker-adaptive VSR. Specifically, motivated by recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we finetune prompts on adaptation data of target speakers instead of modifying the pre-trained model parameters. Different from the previous prompt tuning methods mainly limited to Transformer variant architecture, we explore different types of prompts, the addition, the padding, and the concatenation form prompts that can be applied to the VSR model which is composed of CNN and Transformer in general. With the proposed prompt tuning, we show that the performance of the pre-trained VSR model on unseen speakers can be largely improved by using a small amount of adaptation data (e.g., less than 5 minutes), even if the pre-trained model is already developed with large speaker variations. Moreover, by analyzing the performance and parameters of different types of prompts, we investigate when the prompt tuning is preferred over the finetuning methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both word- and sentence-level VSR databases, LRW-ID and GRID. ",

Recent Machine Learning (ML) models trained on low-resolution spatio-temporal signals have shown new promises in capturing important dynamics in high-resolution signals, under the condition that the models can effectively recover the missing details. However, this study shows that significant information is often lost in the low-resolution down-sampled features. To address such issues, we propose a new approach, namely Temporal Stencil Modeling (TSM), which combines the strengths of advanced time-series sequence modeling (with the HiPPO features) and state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers (with learnable stencil modeling). TSM aims to recover the lost information from the PDE trajectories and can be regarded as a temporal generalization of classic finite volume methods such as WENO. Our experimental results show that TSM achieves the new state-of-the-art simulation accuracy for 2-D incompressible Navier-Stokes turbulent flows: it significantly outperforms the previously reported best results by 19.9% in terms of the highly-correlated duration time and reduces the inference latency into 80%.

The Bulow-Klemberer theorem proposes that expanding the number of participants is a more effective approach to increase revenue than modifying the auction format. However, agents lack the motivation to invite others because doing so intensifies competition among them. On the other hand, misreporting social networks is also a common problem that can reduce revenue. Examples of misreporting include Sybil attacks (an agent pretending to be multiple bidders) and coalition groups (multiple agents pretending to be an agent). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel mechanism called the Truthful Referral Diffusion Mechanism (TRDM). TRDM incentivizes agents to report their social networks truthfully, and some of them are rewarded by the seller for improving revenue. In spite of the fact that some agents overbid in TRDM, the revenue is fixed, and it is higher than the revenue of any mechanism without referrals. TRDM is budget-balanced (non-negative revenue) and generates an efficient outcome (maximized social welfare), making it attractive for both the seller and the buyers as it improves revenue and reward.

Recently, an expressive and efficient architecture, Fourier neural operator (FNO) has been developed by directly parameterising the integral kernel in the Fourier domain, and achieved significant success in different parametric partial differential equations. However, the Fourier transform of FNO requires the regular domain with uniform grids, which means FNO is inherently inapplicable to complex geometric domains widely existing in real applications. The eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator can also provide the frequency basis in Euclidean space, and can even be extended to Riemannian manifolds. Therefore, this research proposes a Laplace Neural Operator (LNO) in which the kernel integral can be parameterised in the space of the Laplacian spectrum of the geometric domain. LNO breaks the grid limitation of FNO and can be applied to any complex geometries while maintaining the discretisation-invariant property. The proposed method is demonstrated on the Darcy flow problem with a complex 2d domain, and a composite part deformation prediction problem with a complex 3d geometry.

In this paper, we first analyze the limitation of relationship-based criteria with examples, and then introduce a new data-independent criterion, Weighted Hybrid Criterion (WHC), to tackle the problems of both norm-based and relationship-based criteria. By taking the magnitude of each filter and the linear dependence between filters into consideration, WHC can robustly recognize the most redundant filters, which can be safely pruned without introducing severe performance degradation to networks. Extensive pruning experiments in a simple one-shot manner demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed WHC. In particular, WHC can prune ResNet-50 on ImageNet with more than 42% of floating point operations reduced without any performance loss in top-5 accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Current AI regulations require discarding sensitive features (e.g., gender, race, religion) in the algorithm's decision-making process to prevent unfair outcomes. However, even without sensitive features in the training set, algorithms can persist in discrimination. Indeed, when sensitive features are omitted (fairness under unawareness), they could be inferred through non-linear relations with the so called proxy features. In this work, we propose a way to reveal the potential hidden bias of a machine learning model that can persist even when sensitive features are discarded. This study shows that it is possible to unveil whether the black-box predictor is still biased by exploiting counterfactual reasoning. In detail, when the predictor provides a negative classification outcome, our approach first builds counterfactual examples for a discriminated user category to obtain a positive outcome. Then, the same counterfactual samples feed an external classifier (that targets a sensitive feature) that reveals whether the modifications to the user characteristics needed for a positive outcome moved the individual to the non-discriminated group. When this occurs, it could be a warning sign for discriminatory behavior in the decision process. Furthermore, we leverage the deviation of counterfactuals from the original sample to determine which features are proxies of specific sensitive information. Our experiments show that, even if the model is trained without sensitive features, it often suffers discriminatory biases. ",

In this paper, a three-stage approach is proposed to accomplish incremental discovery of event types. For an existing annotated financial event dataset, the three-stage approach consists of: for a set of financial event data with a mixture of original and unknown event types, a semi-supervised deep clustering model with anomaly detection is first applied to classify the data into normal and abnormal events, where abnormal events are events that do not belong to known types; then normal events are tagged with appropriate event types and abnormal events are reasonably clustered. Finally, a cluster keyword extraction method is used to recommend the type names of events for the new event clusters, thus incrementally discovering new event types.

    "abstract": "3D visual perception tasks based on multi-camera images are essential for autonomous driving systems. Latest work in this field performs 3D object detection by leveraging multi-view images as an input and iteratively enhancing object queries (object proposals) by cross-attending multi-view features. However, individual backbone features are not updated with multi-view features and it stays as a mere collection of the output of the single-image backbone network. Therefore we propose 3M3D: A Multi-view, Multi-path, Multi-representation for 3D Object Detection where we update both multi-view features and query features to enhance the representation of the scene in both fine panoramic view and coarse global view. Firstly, we update multi-view features by multi-view axis self-attention. It will incorporate panoramic information in the multi-view features and enhance understanding of the global scene. Secondly, we update multi-view features by self-attention of the ROI (Region of Interest) windows which encodes local finer details in the features. It will help exchange the information not only along the multi-view axis but also along the other spatial dimension. Lastly, we leverage the fact of multi-representation of queries in different domains to further boost the performance. Here we use sparse floating queries along with dense BEV (Bird's Eye View) queries, which are later post-processed to filter duplicate detections. Moreover, we show performance improvements on nuScenes benchmark dataset on top of our baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) with missing node features have recently received increasing interest. Such missing node features seriously hurt the performance of the existing GNNs. Some recent methods have been proposed to reconstruct the missing node features by the information propagation among nodes with known and unknown attributes. Although these methods have achieved superior performance, how to exactly exploit the complex data correlations among nodes to reconstruct missing node features is still a great challenge. To solve the above problem, we propose a self-supervised guided hypergraph feature propagation (SGHFP). Specifically, the feature hypergraph is first generated according to the node features with missing information. And then, the reconstructed node features produced by the previous iteration are fed to a two-layer GNNs to construct a pseudo-label hypergraph. Before each iteration, the constructed feature hypergraph and pseudo-label hypergraph are fused effectively, which can better preserve the higher-order data correlations among nodes. After then, we apply the fused hypergraph to the feature propagation for reconstructing missing features. Finally, the reconstructed node features by multi-iteration optimization are applied to the downstream semi-supervised classification task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SGHFP outperforms the existing semi-supervised classification with missing node feature methods. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples are carefully crafted attack points that are supposed to fool machine learning classifiers. In the last years, the field of adversarial machine learning, especially the study of perturbation-based adversarial examples, in which a perturbation that is not perceptible for humans is added to the images, has been studied extensively. Adversarial training can be used to achieve robustness against such inputs. Another type of adversarial examples are invariance-based adversarial examples, where the images are semantically modified such that the predicted class of the model does not change, but the class that is determined by humans does. How to ensure robustness against this type of adversarial examples has not been explored yet. This work addresses the impact of adversarial training with invariance-based adversarial examples on a convolutional neural network (CNN). We show that when adversarial training with invariance-based and perturbation-based adversarial examples is applied, it should be conducted simultaneously and not consecutively. This procedure can achieve relatively high robustness against both types of adversarial examples. Additionally, we find that the algorithm used for generating invariance-based adversarial examples in prior work does not correctly determine the labels and therefore we use human-determined labels.

    "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the field of drug discovery has been a growing area of interdisciplinary scientific research. However, conventional AI models are heavily limited in handling complex biomedical structures (such as 2D or 3D protein and molecule structures) and providing interpretations for outputs, which hinders their practical application. As of late, Graph Machine Learning (GML) has gained considerable attention for its exceptional ability to model graph-structured biomedical data and investigate their properties and functional relationships. Despite extensive efforts, GML methods still suffer from several deficiencies, such as the limited ability to handle supervision sparsity and provide interpretability in learning and inference processes, and their ineffectiveness in utilising relevant domain knowledge. In response, recent studies have proposed integrating external biomedical knowledge into the GML pipeline to realise more precise and interpretable drug discovery with limited training instances. However, a systematic definition for this burgeoning research direction is yet to be established. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of long-standing drug discovery principles, provides the foundational concepts and cutting-edge techniques for graph-structured data and knowledge databases, and formally summarises Knowledge-augmented Graph Machine Learning (KaGML) for drug discovery. A thorough review of related KaGML works, collected following a carefully designed search methodology, are organised into four categories following a novel-defined taxonomy. To facilitate research in this promptly emerging field, we also share collected practical resources that are valuable for intelligent drug discovery and provide an in-depth discussion of the potential avenues for future advancements.

    "abstract": "Comprehending human motion is a fundamental challenge for developing Human-Robot Collaborative applications. Computer vision researchers have addressed this field by only focusing on reducing error in predictions, but not taking into account the requirements to facilitate its implementation in robots. In this paper, we propose a new model based on Transformer that simultaneously deals with the real time 3D human motion forecasting in the short and long term. Our 2-Channel Transformer (2CH-TR) is able to efficiently exploit the spatio-temporal information of a shortly observed sequence (400ms) and generates a competitive accuracy against the current state-of-the-art. 2CH-TR stands out for the efficient performance of the Transformer, being lighter and faster than its competitors. In addition, our model is tested in conditions where the human motion is severely occluded, demonstrating its robustness in reconstructing and predicting 3D human motion in a highly noisy environment. Our experiment results show that the proposed 2CH-TR outperforms the ST-Transformer, which is another state-of-the-art model based on the Transformer, in terms of reconstruction and prediction under the same conditions of input prefix. Our model reduces in 8.89% the mean squared error of ST-Transformer in short-term prediction, and 2.57% in long-term prediction in Human3.6M dataset with 400ms input prefix. ",

    "abstract": "Social visual behavior, as a type of non-verbal communication, plays a central role in studying social cognitive processes in interactive and complex settings of autism therapy interventions. However, for social visual behavior analytics in children with autism, it is challenging to collect gaze data manually and evaluate them because it costs a lot of time and effort for human coders. In this paper, we introduce a social visual behavior analytics approach by quantifying the mutual gaze performance of children receiving play-based autism interventions using an automated mutual gaze detection framework. Our analysis is based on a video dataset that captures and records social interactions between children with autism and their therapy trainers (N=28 observations, 84 video clips, 21 Hrs duration). The effectiveness of our framework was evaluated by comparing the mutual gaze ratio derived from the mutual gaze detection framework with the human-coded ratio values. We analyzed the mutual gaze frequency and duration across different therapy settings, activities, and sessions. We created mutual gaze-related measures for social visual behavior score prediction using multiple machine learning-based regression models. The results show that our method provides mutual gaze measures that reliably represent (or even replace) the human coders' hand-coded social gaze measures and effectively evaluates and predicts ASD children's social visual performance during the intervention. Our findings have implications for social interaction analysis in small-group behavior assessments in numerous co-located settings in (special) education and in the workplace. ",

In this work, we introduce a framework, Defect Transfer GAN (DT-GAN), which learns to represent defect types independent of and across various background products and yet can apply defect-specific styles to generate realistic defective images. An empirical study on the MVTec AD and two additional datasets showcase DT-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art image synthesis methods w.r.t. sample fidelity and diversity in defect generation. We further demonstrate benefits for a critical downstream task in manufacturing -- defect classification. Results show that the augmented data from DT-GAN provides consistent gains even in the few samples regime and reduces the error rate up to 51% compared to both traditional and advanced data augmentation methods.

However, its specific bilayer structure makes the channel estimation problem more challenging than the conventional intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) or intelligent omni-surface (IOS). In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem in the BIOS-assisted multi-user multiple-input multiple-output system. We find that in contrast to the IRS or IOS, where the forms of the cascaded channels of all user equipments (UEs) are the same, in the BIOS, those of the UEs on the reflection side are different from those on the refraction side, which is referred to as the heterogeneous channel property. By exploiting it along with the two-timescale and sparsity properties of channels and applying the manifold optimization method, we propose an efficient channel estimation scheme to reduce the training overhead in the BIOS-assisted system. Moreover, we investigate the joint optimization of base station digital beamforming and BIOS passive analog beamforming. Simulation results show that the proposed estimation scheme can significantly reduce the training overhead with competitive estimation quality, and thus keeps the performance advantage of BIOS over IRS and IOS with imperfect channel state information.

In this context, a key enabling factor to fully support those mixed-criticality scenarios will be the network and the system-level support for time-sensitive communication. Although a lot of work has been conducted on devising efficient orchestration and CPU scheduling strategies, the networking aspects of performance-critical components remain largely unstudied. Bridging this gap, we propose KuberneTSN, an original solution built on the Kubernetes platform, providing support for time-sensitive traffic to unmodified application binaries. We define an architecture for an accelerated and deterministic overlay network, which includes kernel-bypassing networking features as well as a novel userspace packet scheduler compliant with the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) standard. The solution is implemented as tsn-cni, a Kubernetes network plugin that can coexist alongside popular alternatives. To assess the validity of the approach, we conduct an experimental analysis on a real distributed testbed, demonstrating that KuberneTSN enables applications to easily meet deterministic deadlines, provides the same guarantees of bare-metal deployments, and outperforms overlay networks built using the Flannel plugin.

Recently, the analysis of the impact of a priori knowledge is of interest. In graph problems, one form of a priori knowledge is a map of the graph. We survey the graph exploration and treasure hunt problem with an unlabeled map, which is an isomorphic copy of the graph, that is provided to the searcher. We formulate decision variants of both problems by interpreting the online problems as a game between the online algorithm (the searcher) and the adversary. The map, however, is not controllable by the adversary. The question is, whether the searcher is able to explore the graph fully or find the treasure for all possible decisions of the adversary. We prove the PSPACE-completeness of these games, whereby we analyze the variations which ask for the mere existence of a tour through the graph or path to the treasure and the variations that include costs. Additionally, we analyze the complexity of related problems that ask for a tour in the graph or a s-t path. ",

The attacker solves this problem to select the most informative queries that simultaneously maximise the entropy and reduce the mismatch between the target and the stolen models. This leads us to an active sampling-based query selection algorithm, Marich. We evaluate Marich on different text and image data sets, and different models, including BERT and ResNet18. Marich is able to extract models that achieve $69-96\\%$ of true model's accuracy and uses $1,070 - 6,950$ samples from the publicly available query datasets, which are different from the private training datasets. Models extracted by Marich yield prediction distributions, which are $\\sim2-4\\times$ closer to the target's distribution in comparison to the existing active sampling-based algorithms. The extracted models also lead to $85-95\\%$ accuracy under membership inference attacks. Experimental results validate that Marich is query-efficient, and also capable of performing task-accurate, high-fidelity, and informative model extraction. ",

    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shown great potentials in automatically designing neural network architectures for real-time semantic segmentation. Unlike previous works that utilize a simplified search space with cell-sharing way, we introduce a new search space where a lightweight model can be more effectively searched by replacing the cell-sharing manner with cell-independent one. Based on this, the communication of local to global information is achieved through two well-designed modules. For local information exchange, a graph convolutional network (GCN) guided module is seamlessly integrated as a communication deliver between cells. For global information aggregation, we propose a novel dense-connected fusion module (cell) which aggregates long-range multi-level features in the network automatically. In addition, a latency-oriented constraint is endowed into the search process to balance the accuracy and latency. We name the proposed framework as Local-to-Global Information Communication Network Search (LGCNet). Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets demonstrate that LGCNet achieves the new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and speed. In particular, on Cityscapes dataset, LGCNet achieves the new best performance of 74.0\\% mIoU with the speed of 115.2 FPS on Titan Xp. ",

    "abstract": "We have designed a deep multi-stream network for automatically detecting calving signs from video. Calving sign detection from a camera, which is a non-contact sensor, is expected to enable more efficient livestock management. As large-scale, well-developed data cannot generally be assumed when establishing calving detection systems, the basis for making the prediction needs to be presented to farmers during operation, so black-box modeling (also known as end-to-end modeling) is not appropriate. For practical operation of calving detection systems, the present study aims to incorporate expert knowledge into a deep neural network. To this end, we propose a multi-stream calving sign detection network in which multiple calving-related features are extracted from the corresponding feature extraction networks designed for each attribute with different characteristics, such as a cow's posture, rotation, and movement, known as calving signs, and are then integrated appropriately depending on the cow's situation. Experimental comparisons conducted using videos of 15 cows demonstrated that our multi-stream system yielded a significant improvement over the end-to-end system, and the multi-stream architecture significantly contributed to a reduction in detection errors. In addition, the distinctive mixture weights we observed helped provide interpretability of the system's behavior. ",

Experiments can be expensive and are hence conducted on relatively small scales. This poses problems for typically data-hungry machine learning tools which could otherwise expedite the development cycle. We build upon prior work by applying conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) to scanning electron microscope (SEM) imagery from an emerging manufacturing process, shear assisted processing and extrusion (ShAPE). We generate realistic images conditioned on temper and either experimental parameters or material properties. In doing so, we are able to integrate machine learning into the development cycle, by allowing a user to immediately visualize the microstructure that would arise from particular process parameters or properties. This work forms a technical backbone for a fundamentally new approach for understanding manufacturing processes in the absence of first-principle models. By characterizing microstructure from a topological perspective we are able to evaluate our models' ability to capture the breadth and diversity of experimental scanning electron microscope (SEM) samples. Our method is successful in capturing the visual and general microstructural features arising from the considered process, with analysis highlighting directions to further improve the topological realism of our synthetic imagery.

We show that the soft rank energy enjoys both fast rates of statistical convergence and robust continuity properties which lead to strong performance on real datasets. Our theoretical analyses remove the need for resampling and out-of-sample extensions previously required to obtain such rates. In contrast the rank energy suffers from the curse of dimensionality in statistical estimation and moreover can signal a change point from arbitrarily small perturbations, which leads to a high rate of false alarms in CPD. Additionally, under mild regularity conditions, we quantify the discrepancy between soft rank energy and rank energy in terms of the regularization parameter. Finally, we show our approach performs favorably in numerical experiments compared to several other optimal transport-based methods as well as maximum mean discrepancy. ",

However, it is a laborious and time-consuming task to prepare the dataset. This paper presents a novel technique using a self-supervised 3D-UNet that produces a dense deformation field between an atlas and a target image that can be used for atlas-based segmentation of the ossicles. Our results show that our method outperforms traditional image segmentation methods and generates a more accurate boundary around the ossicles based on Dice similarity coefficient and point-to-point error comparison.

Inspired by this trend and the success of cooperative communication in cloud radio access network, this paper considers a networked device-free sensing architecture based on base station (BS) cooperation to transform the cellular network into a huge sensor that can provide ubiquitous and high-performance sensing services. Under this framework, the BSs first transmit the downlink communication signals to the mobile users and then estimate the range information of the targets based on their echoes. Next, a central processor collects the range information from all the BSs via the fronthaul links and localizes each target based on its distances to various BSs. To enable the above strategy in the 6G network, we will perform joint data association, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) mitigation, and clutter suppression, such that the central processor is able to find out the useful range estimations extracted from the line-of-sight (LOS) paths and match them to the right targets for localization. Numerical results show that our interested networked device-free sensing scheme for the 6G network can localize the targets with high accuracy in the challenging multi-path propagation environment.

    "abstract": "The ability for groundwater heat pumps to meet space heating and cooling demands without relying on fossil fuels, has prompted their mass roll out in dense urban environments. In regions with high subsurface groundwater flow rates, the thermal plume generated from a heat pump's injection well can propagate downstream, affecting surrounding users and reducing their heat pump efficiency. To reduce the probability of interference, regulators often rely on simple analytical models or high fidelity groundwater simulations to determine the impact that a heat pump has on the subsurface aquifer and surrounding heat pumps. These are either too inaccurate or too computationally expensive for everyday use. In this work, a surrogate model was developed to provide a quick, high accuracy prediction tool of the thermal plume generated by a heat pump within heterogeneous subsurface aquifers. Three variations of a convolutional neural network were developed that accepts the known groundwater Darcy velocities as discrete two-dimensional inputs and predicts the temperature within the subsurface aquifer around the heat pump. A data set consisting of 800 numerical simulation samples, generated from random permeability fields and pressure boundary conditions, was used to provide pseudo-randomized Darcy velocity fields as input fields and the temperature field solution for training the network. The subsurface temperature field output from the network provides a more realistic temperature field that follows the Darcy velocity streamlines, while being orders of magnitude faster than conventional high fidelity solvers ",

In this paper, we study the effect of bias on two popular consensus protocols, namely, the {\\em voter rule} and the {\\em 2-choices rule} with binary opinions. We assume that agents with opinion $1$ update their opinion with a probability $q_1$ strictly less than the probability $q_0$ with which update occurs for agents with opinion $0$. We call opinion $1$ as the superior opinion and our interest is to study the conditions under which the network reaches consensus on this opinion. We assume that the agents are located on the vertices of a regular expander graph with $n$ vertices. We show that for the voter rule, consensus is achieved on the superior opinion in $O(\\log n)$ time with high probability even if system starts with only $\\Omega(\\log n)$ agents having the superior opinion. This is in sharp contrast to the classical voter rule where consensus is achieved in $O(n)$ time and the probability of achieving consensus on any particular opinion is directly proportional to the initial number of agents with that opinion. For the 2-choices rule, we show that consensus is achieved on the superior opinion in $O(\\log n)$ time with high probability when the initial proportion of agents with the superior opinion is above a certain threshold. We explicitly characterise this threshold as a function of the strength of the bias and the spectral properties of the graph. We show that for the biased version of the 2-choice rule this threshold can be significantly less than that for the unbiased version of the same rule. Our techniques involve using sharp probabilistic bounds on the drift to characterise the Markovian dynamics of the system. ",

This work presents a physical interpretation of the ARNNs by reformulating the Boltzmann distribution of binary pairwise interacting systems into autoregressive form. The resulting ARNN architecture has weights and biases of its first layer corresponding to the Hamiltonian's couplings and external fields, featuring widely used structures like the residual connections and a recurrent architecture with clear physical meanings. However, the exponential growth, with system size, of the number of parameters of the hidden layers makes its direct application unfeasible. Nevertheless, its architecture's explicit formulation allows using statistical physics techniques to derive new ARNNs for specific systems. As examples, new effective ARNN architectures are derived from two well-known mean-field systems, the Curie-Weiss and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick models, showing superior performances in approximating the Boltzmann distributions of the corresponding physics model than other commonly used ARNNs architectures. The connection established between the physics of the system and the ARNN architecture provides a way to derive new neural network architectures for different interacting systems and interpret existing ones from a physical perspective.

The ODE has an explicit solution as a combination of exponential decay and periodic dynamics. Observations in the graph neighborhood are taken into account by integrating graph neural network layers in both the GRU state update and predictive model. The time-continuous dynamics additionally enable the model to make predictions at arbitrary time steps. We propose a loss function that leverages this and allows for training the model for forecasting over different time horizons. Experiments on simulated data and real-world data from traffic and climate modeling validate the usefulness of both the graph structure and time-continuous dynamics in settings with irregular observations.

Yet, the external factors that regularly shape online behavior remain markedly understudied. Do environmental factors alter rates of online activity? Here we show that adverse meteorological conditions markedly increase social media use in the United States. To do so, we employ climate econometric methods alongside over three and a half billion social media posts from tens of millions of individuals from both Facebook and Twitter between 2009 and 2016. We find that more extreme temperatures and added precipitation each independently amplify social media activity. Weather that is adverse on both the temperature and precipitation dimensions produces markedly larger increases in social media activity. On average across both platforms, compared to the temperate weather baseline, days colder than -5{\\deg}C with 1.5-2cm of precipitation elevate social media activity by 35%. This effect is nearly three times the typical increase in social media activity observed on New Year's Eve in New York City.
