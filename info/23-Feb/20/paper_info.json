    "title": "Federated Learning as a Network Effects Game",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) aims to foster collaboration among a population of clients to improve the accuracy of machine learning without directly sharing local data. Although there has been rich literature on designing federated learning algorithms, most prior works implicitly assume that all clients are willing to participate in a FL scheme. In practice, clients may not benefit from joining in FL, especially in light of potential costs related to issues such as privacy and computation. In this work, we study the clients' incentives in federated learning to help the service provider design better solutions and ensure clients make better decisions. We are the first to model clients' behaviors in FL as a network effects game, where each client's benefit depends on other clients who also join the network. Using this setup we analyze the dynamics of clients' participation and characterize the equilibrium, where no client has incentives to alter their decision. Specifically, we show that dynamics in the population naturally converge to equilibrium without needing explicit interventions. Finally, we provide a cost-efficient payment scheme that incentivizes clients to reach a desired equilibrium when the initial network is empty. ",

    "abstract": "Intent-based networking (IBN) facilitates the representation of consumer expectations in a declarative and domain-independent form. The deployment of intent in a network environment requires the extraction of the context from an intent expression, achieved via different levels of network and consumer information to be made available to network administrators. The network and service management domain requires organizing the available information as service and resource models in order to aid the intent propagation to available deployment controllers. Knowledge graphs provide an efficient conceptual framework for constructing contexts and organizing known information. This work proposes a knowledge organization methodology for intent processing and translation in IBN. The proposed knowledge model consists of an intent and associated extension models, and it builds on the TeleManagement forum's intent common model. Additionally, we introduce an IBN framework that leverages the specified knowledge graphs of the service model for intent interpretation, improvement, and implementation. The proposed knowledge-based IBN and service management is validated through a demonstration for both mission-critical and non-mission-critical services. ",

This paper surveys the current research and literature for the use of Generative Adversarial Networks in the malware problem space. This is done with the hope that the reader may be able to gain an overall understanding as to what the Generative Adversarial model provides for this field, and for what areas within malware research it is best utilised.

    "abstract": "3GPP has introduced Private 5G to support the next-generation industrial automation system (IAS) due to the versatility and flexibility of 5G architecture. Besides the 3.5GHz CBRS band, unlicensed spectrum bands, like 5GHz, are considered as an additional medium because of their free and abundant nature. However, while utilizing the unlicensed band, industrial equipment must coexist with incumbents, e.g., Wi-Fi, which could introduce new security threats and resuscitate old ones. In this paper, we propose a novel attack strategy conducted by a mobility-enabled malicious Wi-Fi access point (mmAP), namely \\textit{PACMAN} attack, to exploit vulnerabilities introduced by heterogeneous coexistence. A mmAP is capable of moving around the physical surface to identify mission-critical devices, hopping through the frequency domain to detect the victim's operating channel, and launching traditional MAC layer-based attacks. The multi-dimensional mobility of the attacker makes it impervious to state-of-the-art detection techniques that assume static adversaries. In addition, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) based framework to intelligently design an attacker's multi-dimensional mobility in space and frequency. Mathematical analysis and extensive simulation results exhibit the adverse effect of the proposed mobility-powered attack. ",

    "abstract": "Smartphones enable understanding human behavior with activity recognition to support people's daily lives. Prior studies focused on using inertial sensors to detect simple activities (sitting, walking, running, etc.) and were mostly conducted in homogeneous populations within a country. However, people are more sedentary in the post-pandemic world with the prevalence of remote/hybrid work/study settings, making detecting simple activities less meaningful for context-aware applications. Hence, the understanding of (i) how multimodal smartphone sensors and machine learning models could be used to detect complex daily activities that can better inform about people's daily lives and (ii) how models generalize to unseen countries, is limited. We analyzed in-the-wild smartphone data and over 216K self-reports from 637 college students in five countries (Italy, Mongolia, UK, Denmark, Paraguay). Then, we defined a 12-class complex daily activity recognition task and evaluated the performance with different approaches. We found that even though the generic multi-country approach provided an AUROC of 0.70, the country-specific approach performed better with AUROC scores in [0.79-0.89]. We believe that research along the lines of diversity awareness is fundamental for advancing human behavior understanding through smartphones and machine learning, for more real-world utility across countries.

    "abstract": "We investigate opinion dynamics in a fully-connected system, consisting of $n$ identical and anonymous agents, where one of the opinions (which is called correct) represents a piece of information to disseminate. In more detail, one source agent initially holds the correct opinion and remains with this opinion throughout the execution. The goal for non-source agents is to quickly agree on this correct opinion, and do that robustly, i.e., from any initial configuration. The system evolves in rounds. In each round, one agent chosen uniformly at random is activated: unless it is the source, the agent pulls the opinions of $\\ell$ random agents and then updates its opinion according to some rule. We consider a restricted setting, in which agents have no memory and they only revise their opinions on the basis of those of the agents they currently sample. As restricted as it is, this setting encompasses very popular opinion dynamics, such as the voter model and best-of-$k$ majority rules. Qualitatively speaking, we show that lack of memory prevents efficient convergence. Specifically, we prove that no dynamics can achieve correct convergence in an expected number of steps that is sub-quadratic in $n$, even under a strong version of the model in which activated agents have complete access to the current configuration of the entire system, i.e., the case $\\ell=n$. Conversely, we prove that the simple voter model (in which $\\ell=1$) correctly solves the problem, while almost matching the aforementioned lower bound. These results suggest that, in contrast to symmetric consensus problems (that do not involve a notion of correct opinion), fast convergence on the correct opinion using stochastic opinion dynamics may indeed require the use of memory. This insight may reflect on natural information dissemination processes that rely on a few knowledgeable individuals. ",

In this work, we consider a learnable axonal delay capped at a maximum value, which can be adapted according to the axonal delay distribution in each network layer.

Example design heuristics, or so-called acquisition functions, like expected improvement (EI), balance exploration and exploitation to furnish global solutions under stringent evaluation budgets. However, they fall short when solving for robust optima, meaning a preference for solutions in a wider domain of attraction. Robust solutions are useful when inputs are imprecisely specified, or where a series of solutions is desired. A common mathematical programming technique in such settings involves an adversarial objective, biasing a local solver away from ``sharp'' troughs. Here we propose a surrogate modeling and active learning technique called robust expected improvement (REI) that ports adversarial methodology into the BO/GP framework. After describing the methods, we illustrate and draw comparisons to several competitors on benchmark synthetic and real problems of varying complexity. ",

Split learning achieves this by splitting a neural network between a client and a server such that the client computes the initial set of layers, and the server computes the rest. However, this method introduces a unique attack vector for a malicious server attempting to recover the client's private inputs: the server can direct the client model towards learning any task of its choice, e.g. towards outputting easily invertible values. With a concrete example already proposed (Pasquini et al., ACM CCS '21), such \\textit{training-hijacking} attacks present a significant risk for the data privacy of split learning clients. We propose two methods for a split learning client to detect if it is being targeted by a training-hijacking attack or not. We experimentally evaluate our methods' effectiveness, compare them with other potential solutions, and discuss various points related to their use. Our conclusion is that by using the method that best suits their use case, split learning clients can consistently detect training-hijacking attacks and thus keep the information gained by the attacker at a minimum.

First, we propose a novel causal model that explains the generative factors in motion forecasting datasets using features that are common across all environments and with features that are specific to each environment. Selection variables are used to determine which parts of the model can be directly transferred to a new environment without fine-tuning. Second, we propose an end-to-end variational learning paradigm to learn the causal mechanisms that generate observations from features. GCRL is supported by strong theoretical results that imply identifiability of the causal model under certain assumptions. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world motion forecasting datasets show the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed method for knowledge transfer under zero-shot and low-shot settings by substantially outperforming the prior motion forecasting models on out-of-distribution prediction.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant advancement in the field of model watermarking techniques. However, the protection of image-processing neural networks remains a challenge, with only a limited number of methods being developed. The objective of these techniques is to embed a watermark in the output images of the target generative network, so that the watermark signal can be detected in the output of a surrogate model obtained through model extraction attacks. This promising technique, however, has certain limits. Analysis of the frequency domain reveals that the watermark signal is mainly concealed in the high-frequency components of the output. Thus, we propose an overwriting attack that involves forging another watermark in the output of the generative network. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this attack in sabotaging existing watermarking schemes for image-processing networks, with an almost 100% success rate. To counter this attack, we devise an adversarial framework for the watermarking network. The framework incorporates a specially designed adversarial training step, where the watermarking network is trained to defend against the overwriting network, thereby enhancing its robustness. Additionally, we observe an overfitting phenomenon in the existing watermarking method, which can render it ineffective. To address this issue, we modify the training process to eliminate the overfitting problem. ",

The GANs have shown potential usability in several computer vision applications, including image generation, image-to-image translation, video synthesis, and others. Conventionally, the generator network is the backbone of GANs, which generates the samples and the discriminator network is used to facilitate the training of the generator network. The discriminator network is usually a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Whereas, the generator network is usually either an Up-CNN for image generation or an Encoder-Decoder network for image-to-image translation. The convolution-based networks exploit the local relationship in a layer, which requires the deep networks to extract the abstract features. Hence, CNNs suffer to exploit the global relationship in the feature space. However, recently developed Transformer networks are able to exploit the global relationship at every layer. The Transformer networks have shown tremendous performance improvement for several problems in computer vision. Motivated from the success of Transformer networks and GANs, recent works have tried to exploit the Transformers in GAN framework for the image/video synthesis. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the developments and advancements in GANs utilizing the Transformer networks for computer vision applications. The performance comparison for several applications on benchmark datasets is also performed and analyzed. The conducted survey will be very useful to deep learning and computer vision community to understand the research trends \\& gaps related with Transformer-based GANs and to develop the advanced GAN architectures by exploiting the global and local relationships for different applications.

While crowdsensing may potentially exploit these sensors (of huge quantity) to derive more comprehensive knowledge, \\textit{federated learning} (FL) appears to be the necessary tool to reach this potential: it enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to train machine learning models without explicitly sharing raw sensory data. However, the multimodal sensors introduce various data heterogeneity across distributed AVs (e.g., label quantity skews and varied modalities), posing critical challenges to effective FL. To this end, we present AutoFed as a heterogeneity-aware FL framework to fully exploit multimodal sensory data on AVs and thus enable robust AD. Specifically, we first propose a novel model leveraging pseudo-labeling to avoid mistakenly treating unlabeled objects as the background. We also propose an autoencoder-based data imputation method to fill missing data modality (of certain AVs) with the available ones. To further reconcile the heterogeneity, we finally present a client selection mechanism exploiting the similarities among client models to improve both training stability and convergence rate. Our experiments on benchmark dataset confirm that AutoFed substantially improves over status quo approaches in both precision and recall, while demonstrating strong robustness to adverse weather conditions.

    "abstract": "Neural sequence labeling (NSL) aims at assigning labels for input language tokens, which covers a broad range of applications, such as named entity recognition (NER) and slot filling, etc. However, the satisfying results achieved by traditional supervised-based approaches heavily depend on the large amounts of human annotation data, which may not be feasible in real-world scenarios due to data privacy and computation efficiency issues. This paper presents SeqUST, a novel uncertain-aware self-training framework for NSL to address the labeled data scarcity issue and to effectively utilize unlabeled data. Specifically, we incorporate Monte Carlo (MC) dropout in Bayesian neural network (BNN) to perform uncertainty estimation at the token level and then select reliable language tokens from unlabeled data based on the model confidence and certainty. A well-designed masked sequence labeling task with a noise-robust loss supports robust training, which aims to suppress the problem of noisy pseudo labels. In addition, we develop a Gaussian-based consistency regularization technique to further improve the model robustness on Gaussian-distributed perturbed representations. This effectively alleviates the over-fitting dilemma originating from pseudo-labeled augmented data. Extensive experiments over six benchmarks demonstrate that our SeqUST framework effectively improves the performance of self-training, and consistently outperforms strong baselines by a large margin in low-resource scenarios ",

However, bugs and glitches, even minor ones, can cause anything from frustrating problems to serious data leaks that can have far-reaching impacts on millions of users. To mitigate these risks, fuzz testing, a method of testing with randomised inputs, can provide increased confidence in the correct functioning of a social network. However, implementing traditional fuzz testing methods can be prohibitively difficult or impractical for programmers outside of the network's development team. To tackle this challenge, we present Socialz, a novel approach to social fuzz testing that (1) characterises real users of a social network, (2) diversifies their interaction using evolutionary computation across multiple, non-trivial features, and (3) collects performance data as these interactions are executed. With Socialz, we aim to provide anyone with the capability to perform comprehensive social testing, thereby improving the reliability and security of online social networks used around the world. ",

    "abstract": "Multispectral pedestrian detection is a technology designed to detect and locate pedestrians in Color and Thermal images, which has been widely used in automatic driving, video surveillance, etc. So far most available multispectral pedestrian detection algorithms only achieved limited success in pedestrian detection because of the lacking take into account the confusion of pedestrian information and background noise in Color and Thermal images. Here we propose a multispectral pedestrian detection algorithm, which mainly consists of a cascaded information enhancement module and a cross-modal attention feature fusion module. On the one hand, the cascaded information enhancement module adopts the channel and spatial attention mechanism to perform attention weighting on the features fused by the cascaded feature fusion block. Moreover, it multiplies the single-modal features with the attention weight element by element to enhance the pedestrian features in the single-modal and thus suppress the interference from the background. On the other hand, the cross-modal attention feature fusion module mines the features of both Color and Thermal modalities to complement each other, then the global features are constructed by adding the cross-modal complemented features element by element, which are attentionally weighted to achieve the effective fusion of the two modal features. Finally, the fused features are input into the detection head to detect and locate pedestrians. Extensive experiments have been performed on two improved versions of annotations (sanitized annotations and paired annotations) of the public dataset KAIST. The experimental results show that our method demonstrates a lower pedestrian miss rate and more accurate pedestrian detection boxes compared to the comparison method. Additionally, the ablation experiment also proved the effectiveness of each module designed in this paper. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been popular in the graph classification task. Currently, shallow GNNs are more common due to the well-known over-smoothing problem facing deeper GNNs. However, they are sub-optimal without utilizing the information from distant nodes, i.e., the long-range dependencies. The mainstream methods in the graph classification task can extract the long-range dependencies either by designing the pooling operations or incorporating the higher-order neighbors, while they have evident drawbacks by modifying the original graph structure, which may result in information loss in graph structure learning. In this paper, by justifying the smaller influence of the over-smoothing problem in the graph classification task, we evoke the importance of stacking-based GNNs and then employ them to capture the long-range dependencies without modifying the original graph structure. To achieve this, two design needs are given for stacking-based GNNs, i.e., sufficient model depth and adaptive skip-connection schemes. By transforming the two design needs into designing data-specific inter-layer connections, we propose a novel approach with the help of neural architecture search (NAS), which is dubbed LRGNN (Long-Range Graph Neural Networks). Extensive experiments on five datasets show that the proposed LRGNN can achieve the best performance, and obtained data-specific GNNs with different depth and skip-connection schemes, which can better capture the long-range dependencies.

Recent years have witnessed the emerging success of many deep learning-based recommendation models for augmenting collaborative filtering architectures with various neural network architectures, such as multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder. However, the majority of them model the user-item relationship with single type of interaction, while overlooking the diversity of user behaviors on interacting with items, which can be click, add-to-cart, tag-as-favorite and purchase. Such various types of interaction behaviors have great potential in providing rich information for understanding the user preferences. In this paper, we pay special attention on user-item relationships with the exploration of multi-typed user behaviors. Technically, we contribute a new multi-behavior graph neural network (MBRec), which specially accounts for diverse interaction patterns as well as the underlying cross-type behavior inter-dependencies. In the MBRec framework, we develop a graph-structured learning framework to perform expressive modeling of high-order connectivity in behavior-aware user-item interaction graph. After that, a mutual relation encoder is proposed to adaptively uncover complex relational structures and make aggregations across layer-specific behavior representations. Through comprehensive evaluation on real-world datasets, the advantages of our MBRec method have been validated under different experimental settings. Further analysis verifies the positive effects of incorporating the multi-behavioral context into the recommendation paradigm. Additionally, the conducted case studies offer insights into the interpretability of user multi-behavior representations. ",

    "abstract": "Latent representations of drugs and their targets produced by contemporary graph autoencoder models have proved useful in predicting many types of node-pair interactions on large networks, including drug-drug, drug-target, and target-target interactions. However, most existing approaches model either the node's latent spaces in which node distributions are rigid or do not effectively capture the interrelations between drugs; these limitations hinder the methods from accurately predicting drug-pair interactions. In this paper, we present the effectiveness of variational graph autoencoders (VGAE) in modeling latent node representations on multimodal networks. Our approach can produce flexible latent spaces for each node type of the multimodal graph; the embeddings are used later for predicting links among node pairs under different edge types. To further enhance the models' performance, we suggest a new method that concatenates Morgan fingerprints, which capture the molecular structures of each drug, with their latent embeddings before preceding them to the decoding stage for link prediction. Our proposed model shows competitive results on three multimodal networks: (1) a multimodal graph consisting of drug and protein nodes, (2) a multimodal graph constructed from a subset of the DrugBank database involving drug nodes under different interaction types, and (3) a multimodal graph consisting of drug and cell line nodes.

Random Padding is parameter-free, simple to construct, and compatible with the majority of CNN-based recognition models. This technique is also complementary to data augmentations such as random cropping, rotation, flipping and erasing, and consistently improves the performance of image classification over strong baselines.

However, existing techniques have largely targeted settings where the space of labels is simple, so prediction sets can be arbitrary subsets of labels. For structured prediction problems where the space of labels is exponential in size, even prediction sets containing a small fraction of all labels can be exponentially large. In the context of code generation, we propose a solution that considers a restricted set of prediction sets that can compactly be represented as partial programs, which are programs with portions replaced with holes. Given a trained code generation model, our algorithm leverages a programming language's abstract syntax tree to generate a set of programs such that the correct program is in the set with high-confidence. Valuable applications of our algorithm include a Codex-style code generator with holes in uncertain parts of the generated code, which provides a partial program with theoretical guarantees. We evaluate our approach on PICARD (a T5 model for SQL semantic parsing) and Codex (a GPT model for over a dozen programming languages, including Python), demonstrating that our approach generates compact PAC prediction sets. This is the first research contribution that generates PAC prediction sets for generative code models. ",

We theoretically analyze the bias-variance decomposition of different models in the Gaussian Mixture Model, and then empirically test our setup on the COMPAS and folktables datasets. We instantiate the ciid model with two procedures that improve \"fairness\" by conditioning out undesirable effects: first, by conditioning directly on sensitive attributes, and second, by clustering samples into groups and conditioning on cluster membership (blind to protected group membership). Our analysis suggests that there might be principled procedures and concrete real-world use cases under which conditional models are preferred, and our striking empirical results strongly indicate that non-iid settings, such as the ciid setting proposed here, might be more suitable for big data applications in social contexts.

Many recent efforts focus on improving the prediction accuracy of target pseudo-labels to reduce conditional distribution shift. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation method, which infers target pseudo-labels through cross-domain label propagation, such that the underlying manifold structure of two domain data can be explored. Unlike existing cross-domain label propagation methods that separate domain-invariant feature learning, affinity matrix constructing and target labels inferring into three independent stages, we propose to integrate them into a unified optimization framework. In such way, these three parts can boost each other from an iterative optimization perspective and thus more effective knowledge transfer can be achieved. Furthermore, to construct a high-quality affinity matrix, we propose a discriminative graph self-learning strategy, which can not only adaptively capture the inherent similarity of the data from two domains but also effectively exploit the discriminative information contained in well-labeled source data and pseudo-labeled target data. An efficient iterative optimization algorithm is designed to solve the objective function of our proposal. Notably, the proposed method can be extended to semi-supervised domain adaptation in a simple but effective way and the corresponding optimization problem can be solved with the identical algorithm. Extensive experiments on six standard datasets verify the significant superiority of our proposal in both unsupervised and semi-supervised domain adaptation settings. ",

Therefore, automatically detecting this content is essential for banning inappropriate information, and reducing toxicity and violence on social media platforms. The existing works on hate speech and offensive language detection produce promising results based on pre-trained transformer models, however, they considered only the analysis of abusive content features generated through annotated datasets. This paper addresses a multi-task joint learning approach which combines external emotional features extracted from another corpora in dealing with the imbalanced and scarcity of labeled datasets. Our analysis are using two well-known Transformer-based models, BERT and mBERT, where the later is used to address abusive content detection in multi-lingual scenarios. Our model jointly learns abusive content detection with emotional features by sharing representations through transformers' shared encoder. This approach increases data efficiency, reduce overfitting via shared representations, and ensure fast learning by leveraging auxiliary information. Our findings demonstrate that emotional knowledge helps to more reliably identify hate speech and offensive language across datasets. Our hate speech detection Multi-task model exhibited 3% performance improvement over baseline models, but the performance of multi-task models were not significant for offensive language detection task. More interestingly, in both tasks, multi-task models exhibits less false positive errors compared to single task scenario. ",

    "abstract": "Hemodynamic velocity fields in coronary arteries could be the basis of valuable biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning in cardiovascular disease. Velocity fields are typically obtained from patient-specific 3D artery models via computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, CFD simulation requires meticulous setup by experts and is time-intensive, which hinders large-scale acceptance in clinical practice. To address this, we propose graph neural networks (GNN) as an efficient black-box surrogate method to estimate 3D velocity fields mapped to the vertices of tetrahedral meshes of the artery lumen. We train these GNNs on synthetic artery models and CFD-based ground truth velocity fields. Once the GNN is trained, velocity estimates in a new and unseen artery can be obtained with 36-fold speed-up compared to CFD. We demonstrate how to construct an SE(3)-equivariant GNN that is independent of the spatial orientation of the input mesh and show how this reduces the necessary amount of training data compared to a baseline neural network.

However, GNNs suffer from over-smoothing node information and, therefore, struggle to solve tasks where global graph properties are relevant. We introduce G-Signatures, a novel graph learning method that enables global graph propagation via randomized signatures. G-Signatures use a new graph lifting concept to embed graph structured information, which can be interpreted as path in latent space. We further introduce the idea of latent space path mapping, which allows us to repetitively traverse latent space paths, and, thus globally process information. G-Signatures excel at extracting and processing global graph properties, and effectively scale to large graph problems. Empirically, we confirm the advantages of our G-Signatures at several classification and regression tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Apple scab is a fungal disease caused by Venturia inaequalis. Disease is of particular concern for growers, as it causes significant damage to fruit and leaves, leading to loss of fruit and yield. This article examines the ability of deep learning and hyperspectral imaging to accurately identify an apple symptom infection in apple trees. In total, 168 image scenes were collected using conventional RGB and Visible to Near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectral imaging (8 channels) in infected orchards. Spectral data were preprocessed with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained in segmentation to detect scab pixels based on spectral information. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was used to find the most discriminating channels in spectral data based on the healthy leaf and scab infested leaf spectra. Five combinations of false-colour images were created from the spectral data and the segmentation net results. The images were trained and evaluated with a modified version of the YOLOv5 network. Despite the promising results of deep learning using RGB images (P=0.8, mAP@50=0.73), the detection of apple scab in apple trees using multispectral imaging proved to be a difficult task. The high-light environment of the open field made it difficult to collect a balanced spectrum from the multispectral camera, since the infrared channel and the visible channels needed to be constantly balanced so that they did not overexpose in the images.

Given an $n \\times n$ matrix $D$ and a $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the goal is to construct a $\\Delta$-periodic temporal graph with $n$ vertices such that the duration of a \\emph{fastest path} from $v_i$ to $v_j$ is equal to $D_{i,j}$, or to decide that such a temporal graph does not exist. The variations of the problem on static graphs has been well studied and understood since the 1960's, and this area of research remains active until nowadays. As it turns out, the periodic temporal graph realization problem has a very different computational complexity behavior than its static (i.e. non-temporal) counterpart. First we show that the problem is NP-hard in general, but polynomial-time solvable if the so-called underlying graph is a tree or a cycle. Building upon those results, we investigate its parameterized computational complexity with respect to structural parameters of the underlying static graph which measure the ``tree-likeness''. For those parameters, we essentially give a tight classification between parameters that allow for tractability (in the FPT sense) and parameters that presumably do not. We show that our problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the \\emph{feedback vertex number} of the underlying graph, while we show that it is in FPT when parameterized by the \\emph{feedback edge number} of the underlying graph.

For example, on CIFAR10, the accuracies for the best and worst classes are 74% and 23%, respectively. We argue that this gap can be reduced by explicitly optimizing for the worst-performing class, resulting in a min-max-max optimization formulation. Our method, called class focused online learning (CFOL), includes high probability convergence guarantees for the worst class loss and can be easily integrated into existing training setups with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate an improvement to 32% in the worst class accuracy on CIFAR10, and we observe consistent behavior across CIFAR100 and STL10.

    "abstract": "With the increasing amount of multimedia data on modern mobile systems and IoT infrastructures, harnessing these rich multimodal data without breaching user privacy becomes a critical issue. Federated learning (FL) serves as a privacy-conscious alternative to centralized machine learning. However, existing FL methods extended to multimodal data all rely on model aggregation on single modality level, which restrains the server and clients to have identical model architecture for each modality. This limits the global model in terms of both model complexity and data capacity, not to mention task diversity. In this work, we propose Contrastive Representation Ensemble and Aggregation for Multimodal FL (CreamFL), a multimodal federated learning framework that enables training larger server models from clients with heterogeneous model architectures and data modalities, while only communicating knowledge on public dataset. To achieve better multimodal representation fusion, we design a global-local cross-modal ensemble strategy to aggregate client representations. To mitigate local model drift caused by two unprecedented heterogeneous factors stemming from multimodal discrepancy (modality gap and task gap), we further propose two inter-modal and intra-modal contrasts to regularize local training, which complements information of the absent modality for uni-modal clients and regularizes local clients to head towards global consensus. Thorough evaluations and ablation studies on image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks showcase the superiority of CreamFL over state-of-the-art FL methods and its practical value. ",

We show that using random projections to estimate multiple powers of the transition matrix allows us to build a set of isomorphism-invariant features that can be used by a variety of tasks.

As a first step in this direction, we systematically explore the task of referential communication in a community of state-of-the-art pre-trained visual networks, showing that they can develop a shared protocol to refer to a target image among a set of candidates. Such shared protocol, induced in a self-supervised way, can to some extent be used to communicate about previously unseen object categories, as well as to make more granular distinctions compared to the categories taught to the original networks. Contradicting a common view in multi-agent emergent communication research, we find that imposing a discrete bottleneck on communication hampers the emergence of a general code. Moreover, we show that a new neural network can learn the shared protocol developed in a community with remarkable ease, and the process of integrating a new agent into a community more stably succeeds when the original community includes a larger set of heterogeneous networks. Finally, we illustrate the independent benefits of developing a shared communication layer by using it to directly transfer an object classifier from a network to another, and we qualitatively and quantitatively study its emergent properties.

Specifically, DIDAN first adopts a simple deep regression network consisting of a set of convolutional and fully connected layers to directly regress the source speech spectrums into the emotional labels such that the proposed DIDAN can own the emotion discriminative ability. Then, such ability is transferred to be also applicable to the target speech samples regardless of corpus variance by resorting to a well-designed regularization term called implicit distribution alignment (IDA). Unlike widely-used maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and its variants, the proposed IDA absorbs the idea of sample reconstruction to implicitly align the distribution gap, which enables DIDAN to learn both emotion discriminative and corpus invariant features from speech spectrums. To evaluate the proposed DIDAN, extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on widely-used speech emotion corpora are carried out. Experimental results show that the proposed DIDAN can outperform lots of recent state-of-the-art methods in coping with the cross-corpus SER tasks. ",

We also develop an original lexicon of PII-related terms representing PII data types curated from legislative texts. This mesoscale analysis looks at privacy policies overtime on the word, topic, and network levels to understand the stability, complexity, and sensitivity of privacy policies over time. We find that (1) privacy legislation correlates with changes in stability and turbulence of PII data types in privacy policies; (2) the complexity of privacy policies decreases over time and becomes more regularized; (3) sensitivity rises over time and shows spikes that are correlated with events when new privacy legislation is introduced.

In this paper, we fill in this gap by first studying the unlearning problem in linear-GNNs, and then introducing its extension to non-linear structures. Given a set of nodes to unlearn, we propose PROJECTOR that unlearns by projecting the weight parameters of the pre-trained model onto a subspace that is irrelevant to features of the nodes to be forgotten. PROJECTOR could overcome the challenges caused by node dependency and enjoys a perfect data removal, i.e., the unlearned model parameters do not contain any information about the unlearned node features which is guaranteed by algorithmic construction.

    "abstract": "Today, we rely on contactless smart cards to perform several critical operations (e.g., payments and accessing buildings). Attacking smart cards can have severe consequences, such as losing money or leaking sensitive information. Although the security protections embedded in smart cards have evolved over the years, those with weak security properties are still commonly used. Among the different solutions, blocking cards are affordable devices to protect smart cards. These devices are placed close to the smart cards, generating a noisy jamming signal or shielding them. Whereas vendors claim the reliability of their blocking cards, no previous study has ever focused on evaluating their effectiveness. In this paper, we shed light on the security threats on smart cards even in the presence of blocking cards, showing the possibility of being bypassed by an attacker. We analyze blocking cards by inspecting their emitted signal and assessing a vulnerability in their internal design. We propose a novel attack that bypasses the jamming signal emitted by a blocking card and reads the content of the smart card. We evaluate the effectiveness of 14 blocking cards when protecting a MIFARE Ultralight smart card and a MIFARE Classic card. We demonstrate that the protection of the 8 blocking cards among the 14 we evaluate can be successfully bypassed to dump the content of the smart card. Based on this observation, we propose a countermeasure that may lead to the design of effective blocking cards. To assist further security improvement, the tool that we developed to inspect the spectrum emitted by blocking cards and set up our attack is made available in open source. ",

To this end, we define a novel exact training method and an iterative inference method that improve pick-and-place precision with Transporter Networks. We conduct a large scale experiment on 8 simulated tasks. A systematic analysis shows, that the proposed modifications have a significant positive effect on model performance. Considering picking and placing independently, our methods achieve up to 60% lower rotation and translation errors than baselines. For the whole pick-and-place process we observe 50% lower rotation errors for most tasks with slight improvements in terms of translation errors.

    "abstract": "In the past decades, there has been a significant increase in sensor density and sensor deployment, driven by a significant miniaturization and decrease in size down to the chip level, addressing ubiquitous computing, edge computing, as well as distributed sensor networks. Material-integrated and intelligent systems (MIIS) provide the next integration and application level, but they create new challenges and introduce hard constraints (resources, energy supply, communication, resilience, and security). Commonly, low-resource systems are statically programmed processors with application-specific software or application-specific hardware (FPGA). This work demonstrates the need for and solution to virtualization in such low-resource and constrained systems towards resilient distributed sensor and cyber-physical networks using a unified low-resource, customizable, and real-time capable embedded and extensible stack virtual machine (REXAVM) that can be implemented and cooperate in both software and hardware. In a holistic architecture approach, the VM specifically addresses digital signal processing and tiny machine learning. The REXAVM is highly customizable through the use of VM program code generators at compile time and incremental code processing at run time. The VM uses an integrated, highly efficient just-in-time compiler to create Bytecode from text code. This paper shows and evaluates the suitability of the proposed VM architecture for operationally equivalent software and hardware (FPGA) implementations. Specific components supporting tiny ML and DSP using fixed-point arithmetic with respect to efficiency and accuracy are discussed. An extended use-case section demonstrates the usability of the introduced VM architecture for a broad range of applications. ",

From medical images, coronavirus illness may be accurately identified and predicted using a variety of machine learning methods. Most of the published machine learning methods may need extensive hyperparameter adjustment and are unsuitable for small datasets. By leveraging the data in a comparatively small dataset, few-shot learning algorithms aim to reduce the requirement of large datasets. This inspired us to develop a few-shot learning model for early detection of COVID-19 to reduce the post-effect of this dangerous disease. The proposed architecture combines few-shot learning with an ensemble of pre-trained convolutional neural networks to extract feature vectors from CT scan images for similarity learning. The proposed Triplet Siamese Network as the few-shot learning model classified CT scan images into Normal, COVID-19, and Community-Acquired Pneumonia. The suggested model achieved an overall accuracy of 98.719%, a specificity of 99.36%, a sensitivity of 98.72%, and a ROC score of 99.9% with only 200 CT scans per category for training data. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable capability in representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition. Existing methods mainly focus on applying global data augmentation to generate different views of the skeleton sequence for contrastive learning. However, due to the rich action clues in the skeleton sequences, existing methods may only take a global perspective to learn to discriminate different skeletons without thoroughly leveraging the local relationship between different skeleton joints and video frames, which is essential for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (PSTL) framework to exploit the local relationship from a partial skeleton sequences built by a unique spatio-temporal masking strategy. Specifically, we construct a negative-sample-free triplet steam structure that is composed of an anchor stream without any masking, a spatial masking stream with Central Spatial Masking (CSM), and a temporal masking stream with Motion Attention Temporal Masking (MATM). The feature cross-correlation matrix is measured between the anchor stream and the other two masking streams, respectively. (1) Central Spatial Masking discards selected joints from the feature calculation process, where the joints with a higher degree of centrality have a higher possibility of being selected. (2) Motion Attention Temporal Masking leverages the motion of action and remove frames that move faster with a higher possibility. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on NTURGB+D 60, NTURGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD under various downstream tasks. Furthermore, a practical evaluation is performed where some skeleton joints are lost in downstream tasks.In contrast to previous methods that suffer from large performance drops, our PSTL can still achieve remarkable results under this challenging setting, validating the robustness of our method.

    "abstract": "Tensor networks (TNs) and neural networks (NNs) are two fundamental types of data modeling approaches. TNs have been proposed as a solution to the curse of dimensionality faced by large-scale tensors by converting an exponential number of dimensions to polynomial complexity. Thus, they have attracted many studies in the fields of quantum physics and machine learning. On the other hand, NNs are computing systems inspired by the biological NNs that constitute human brains. Recently, NNs and their variants have achieved outstanding performance in various applications, e.g., computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics research. Interestingly, although these two types of networks come from different observations, they are inextricably linked via the common intrinsic multilinearity structure underlying both TNs and NNs. Consequently, a significant number of intellectual sparks regarding combinations of TNs and NNs have burst out. The combinations described as ``tensor networks meet neural networks'' are termed tensorial neural networks (TNNs) in this paper. This survey introduces TNNs based on three aspects. This survey also investigates methods for improving TNNs, examines useful toolboxes for implementing TNNs, and attempts to document TNN development and highlight its potential future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to bridge the connections among NNs, TNs, and quantum circuits.

    "abstract": "Many games are reliant on creating new and engaging content constantly to maintain the interest of their player-base. One such example are puzzle games, in such it is common to have a recurrent need to create new puzzles. Creating new puzzles requires guaranteeing that they are solvable and interesting to players, both of which require significant time from the designers. Automatic validation of puzzles provides designers with a significant time saving and potential boost in quality. Automation allows puzzle designers to estimate different properties, increase the variety of constraints, and even personalize puzzles to specific players. Puzzles often have a large design space, which renders exhaustive search approaches infeasible, if they require significant time. Specifically, those puzzles can be formulated as quadratic combinatorial optimization problems. This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm, empowered by expert-knowledge informed heuristics, for solving logical puzzles in video games efficiently, leading to a more efficient design process. We discuss multiple variations of hybrid genetic approaches for constraint satisfaction problems that allow us to find a diverse set of near-optimal solutions for puzzles. We demonstrate our approach on a fantasy Party Building Puzzle game, and discuss how it can be applied more broadly to other puzzles to guide designers in their creative process. ",

Extensive evaluation in automated driving domains on the BDD100K and MOT17 datasets shows that our TempO approach outperforms existing self-supervised single-frame pre-training methods as well as supervised transfer learning initialization strategies on standard object detection and multi-object tracking benchmarks.

When extrapolated literally, this decay implies that the entropy rate of natural language is zero. To understand this phenomenon -- or an artifact -- better, we construct a simple stationary stochastic process and its memory-based predictor that exhibit a power-law decay of cross entropy with the vanishing entropy rate. Our example is based on previously discussed Santa Fe processes, which decompose a random text into a process of narration and time-independent knowledge. Previous discussions assumed that narration is a memoryless source with Zipf's distribution. In this paper, we propose a model of narration that has the vanishing entropy rate and applies a randomly chosen deterministic sequence called a multiperiodic sequence. Under a suitable parameterization, multiperiodic sequences exhibit asymptotic relative frequencies given by Zipf's law. Remaining agnostic about the value of the entropy rate of natural language, we discuss relevance of similar constructions for language modeling. ",

Very large language models are good at leveraging public data on standard problems but once you want to tackle more specific complex questions or problems you may need specific architecture, knowledge, skills, tasks, methods, sensitive data, performance, human approval and versatile feedback... This survey extends findings from the robust community edited research papers BIG, BLOOM and HELM which open source, benchmark and analyze limits and challenges of large language models in terms of tasks complexity and strict evaluation on accuracy (e.g. fairness, robustness, toxicity, ...). It identifies the key elements used with Large Language Models (LLM) to solve complex questions or problems. Recent projects like ChatGPT and GALACTICA have allowed non-specialists to grasp the great potential as well as the equally strong limitations of language models in complex QA. Hybridizing these models with different components could allow to overcome these different limits and go much further. We discuss some challenges associated with complex QA, including domain adaptation, decomposition and efficient multi-step QA, long form QA, non-factoid QA, safety and multi-sensitivity data protection, multimodal search, hallucinations, QA explainability and truthfulness, time dimension. Therefore we review current solutions and promising strategies, using elements such as hybrid LLM architectures, human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning, prompting adaptation, neuro-symbolic and structured knowledge grounding, program synthesis, and others.

To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for the SCD task, where an additional SCD module is built on top of an existing Transformer Transducer ASR (TT-ASR) network. Two variants of the SCD network are explored in this framework that naturally estimate speaker change probability for each word, while allowing the ASR and SCD to have independent optimization scheme for the best performance.

    "abstract": "Providing small-scale information about weather and climate is challenging, especially for variables strongly controlled by processes that are unresolved by low-resolution (LR) models. This paper explores emerging machine learning methods from the fields of image super-resolution (SR) and deep learning for statistical downscaling of near-surface winds to convection-permitting scales. Specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are conditioned on LR inputs from a global reanalysis to generate high-resolution (HR) surface winds that emulate those simulated over North America by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Unlike traditional SR models, where LR inputs are idealized coarsened versions of the HR images, WRF emulation involves non-idealized LR inputs from a coarse-resolution reanalysis. In addition to matching the statistical properties of WRF simulations, GANs quickly generate HR fields with impressive realism. However, objectively assessing the realism of the SR models requires careful selection of evaluation metrics. In particular, performance measures based on spatial power spectra reveal the way that GAN configurations change spatial structures in the generated fields, where biases in spatial variability originate, and how models depend on different LR covariates. Inspired by recent computer vision research, a novel methodology that separates spatial frequencies in HR fields is used in an attempt to optimize the SR GANs further. This method, called frequency separation, resulted in deterioration in realism of the generated HR fields. However, frequency separation did show how spatial structures are influenced by the metrics used to optimize the SR models, which led to the development of a more effective partial frequency separation approach.

In this article, we compared 5 well-known neural networks (Shallow ConvNet, Deep ConvNet, EEGNet, EEGNet Fusion, MI-EEGNet) using open-access databases with many subjects next to the BCI Competition 4 2a dataset to acquire statistically significant results. We removed artifacts from the EEG using the FASTER algorithm as a signal processing step. Moreover, we investigated whether transfer learning can further improve the classification results on artifact filtered data. We aimed to rank the neural networks; therefore, next to the classification accuracy, we introduced two additional metrics: the accuracy improvement from chance level and the effect of transfer learning. The former can be used with different class-numbered databases, while the latter can highlight neural networks with sufficient generalization abilities. Our metrics showed that the researchers should not avoid Shallow ConvNet and Deep ConvNet because they can perform better than the later published ones from the EEGNet family. ",

However, finding appropriate topological structures for specific phylogenetic inference tasks often requires significant design effort and domain expertise. In this paper, we propose a novel structural representation method for phylogenetic inference based on learnable topological features. By combining the raw node features that minimize the Dirichlet energy with modern graph representation learning techniques, our learnable topological features can provide efficient structural information of phylogenetic trees that automatically adapts to different downstream tasks without requiring domain expertise. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method on a simulated data tree probability estimation task and a benchmark of challenging real data variational Bayesian phylogenetic inference problems.

    "abstract": "Sparse reconstruction is an important aspect of modern medical imaging, reducing the acquisition time of relatively slow modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Popular methods are based mostly on compressed sensing (CS), which relies on the random sampling of Fourier coefficients ($k$-space) to produce incoherent (noise-like) artefacts that can be removed via convex optimisation. Hardware constraints currently limit Cartesian CS to one dimensional (1D) phase-encode undersampling schemes, leading to coherent and structured artefacts. Reconstruction algorithms typically deploy an idealised and limited 2D regularisation for artefact removal, which increases the difficulty of image recovery. Recognising that phase-encode artefacts can be separated into contiguous 1D signals, we develop two decoupling techniques that enable explicit 1D regularisation. We thereby leverage the excellent incoherence characteristics in the phase-encode direction. We also derive a combined 1D + 2D reconstruction technique that further takes advantage of spatial relationships within the image, leading to an improvement of existing 2D deep-learned (DL) recovery techniques. Performance is evaluated on a brain and knee dataset. We find the proposed 1D CNN modules significantly improve PSNR and SSIM scores compared to the base 2D models, demonstrating a superior scaling of performance compared to increasing the size of 2D network layers.

    "abstract": "This paper focusses on the optimal implementation of a Mean Variance Estimation network (MVE network) (Nix and Weigend, 1994). This type of network is often used as a building block for uncertainty estimation methods in a regression setting, for instance Concrete dropout (Gal et al., 2017) and Deep Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). Specifically, an MVE network assumes that the data is produced from a normal distribution with a mean function and variance function. The MVE network outputs a mean and variance estimate and optimizes the network parameters by minimizing the negative loglikelihood. In this paper, we discuss two points: firstly, the convergence difficulties reported in recent work can be relatively easily prevented by following the recommendation from the original authors that a warm-up period should be used. During this period, only the mean is optimized assuming a fixed variance. This recommendation is often not used in practice. We experimentally demonstrate how essential this step is. We also examine if keeping the mean estimate fixed after the warm-up leads to different results than estimating both the mean and the variance simultaneously after the warm-up. We do not observe a substantial difference. Secondly, we propose a novel improvement of the MVE network: separate regularization of the mean and the variance estimate. We demonstrate, both on toy examples and on a number of benchmark UCI regression data sets, that following the original recommendations and the novel separate regularization can lead to significant improvements.

Interesting aspects of this problem include its time reliance as well as its volatility and other complex relationships. To combine them, hidden markov models (HMMs) have been utilized to anticipate the price of stocks. We demonstrated the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) HMM method for predicting stock prices for the next day based on previous data. An HMM is trained by analyzing the fractional change in the stock price as well as the intraday high and low values. It is then utilized to produce a MAP estimate across all possible stock prices for the next day. The approach demonstrated in our work is quite generalized and can be used to predict the stock price for any company, given that the HMM is trained on the dataset of that company's stocks dataset. We evaluated the accuracy of our models using some extensively used accuracy metrics for regression problems and came up with a satisfactory outcome. ",

    "abstract": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) can identify subtle brain changes due to its high contrast for soft tissues and high spatial resolution. It has been widely used in diagnosing neurological brain diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the size of 3D high-resolution data poses a significant challenge for data analysis and processing. Since only a few areas of the brain show structural changes highly associated with AD, the patch-based methods dividing the whole image data into several small regular patches have shown promising for more efficient sMRI-based image analysis. The major challenges of the patch-based methods on sMRI include identifying the discriminative patches, combining features from the discrete discriminative patches, and designing appropriate classifiers. This work proposes a novel patch-based deep learning network (sMRI-PatchNet) with explainable patch localisation and selection for AD diagnosis using sMRI. Specifically, it consists of two primary components: 1) A fast and efficient explainable patch selection mechanism for determining the most discriminative patches based on computing the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) contribution to a transfer learning model for AD diagnosis on massive medical data; and 2) A novel patch-based network for extracting deep features and AD classfication from the selected patches with position embeddings to retain position information, capable of capturing the global and local information of inter- and intra-patches. This method has been applied for the AD classification and the prediction of the transitional state moderate cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion with real datasets. ",

    "abstract": "6G is envisioned to connect everything and yet to be a hundred times more energy efficient than the 5G. Thanks for its ability to use sources of ambient energy, energy harvesting (EH) is promising in alleviating the challenge of meeting such conflicting demands. Moreover, when it comes to the Internet of things (IoT), one of the foundations for enabling connecting everything, the need for EH may become inevitable. IoT involves connecting not only devices that are large in number, but also hard to reach. The good news, nevertheless, is that the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), owning to its flexibility and ease of deployment is emerging to offer communication services when infrastructure is lacking. Merging the UAV and IoT is of quite interest as the former could not just enable flexible connectivity for the IoT but also powering them in spite of any restrictions. However, managing the UAV assisted IoT resources to meet certain data communications and EH quality measures while keeping the UAV consumed energy minimized is a major challenge as this corresponds to a non-convex optimization problem. Things, obviously, become even worse when the IoT network devices are mobile. Owing to the success of artificial intelligence (AI) in solving complicated problems, in this project we rely on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) technique, to manage the UAV assisted IoT resources. Our results show that DDPG achieves joint optimization of three objectives, namely sum data rate and harvested energy maximization, and energy consumption minimization, while out performing traditional mathematical schemes.

    "abstract": "First principle network models are crucial to make sense of the intricate topology of real complex networks. While modeling efforts have been quite successful in undirected networks, generative models for networks with asymmetric interactions are still not well developed and are unable to reproduce several basic topological properties. This is particularly disconcerting considering that real directed networks are the norm rather than the exception in many natural and human-made complex systems. In this paper, we fill this gap and show how the network geometry paradigm can be elegantly extended to the case of directed networks. We define a maximum entropy ensemble of geometric (directed) random graphs with a given sequence of in- and out-degrees. Beyond these local properties, the ensemble requires only two additional parameters to fix the level of reciprocity and the seven possible types of 3-node cycles in directed networks. A systematic comparison with several representative empirical datasets shows that fixing the level of reciprocity alongside the coupling with an underlying geometry is able to reproduce the wide diversity of clustering patterns observed in real complex directed networks.
