    "title": "Robust Scheduling with GFlowNets",
    "abstract": "Finding the best way to schedule operations in a computation graph is a classical NP-hard problem which is central to compiler optimization. However, evaluating the goodness of a schedule on the target hardware can be very time-consuming. Traditional approaches as well as previous machine learning ones typically optimize proxy metrics, which are fast to evaluate but can lead to bad schedules when tested on the target hardware. In this work, we propose a new approach to scheduling by sampling proportionally to the proxy metric using a novel GFlowNet method. We introduce a technique to control the trade-off between diversity and goodness of the proposed schedules at inference time and demonstrate empirically that the pure optimization baselines can lead to subpar performance with respect to our approach when tested on a target model. Furthermore, we show that conditioning the GFlowNet on the computation graph enables generalization to unseen scheduling problems for both synthetic and real-world compiler datasets. ",

    "abstract": "The ambitious goal of neuroscientific studies is to find an accurate and reliable brain Effective Connectome (EC). Although current EC discovery methods have contributed to our understanding of brain organization, their performances are severely constrained by the short sample size and poor temporal resolution of fMRI data, and high dimensionality of the brain connectome. By leveraging the DTI data as prior knowledge, we introduce two Bayesian casual discovery frameworks -- the Bayesian GOLEM (BGOLEM) and Bayesian FGES (BFGES) methods -- as the most reliable and accurate methods in discovering EC that address the shortcomings of the current causal discovery methods in discovering ECs based on only fMRI data. Through a series of simulation studies on synthetic and hybrid (DTI of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) subjects and synthetic fMRI) data, we first demonstrate the effectiveness and importance of the proposed methods in discovering EC. We also introduce the Pseudo False Discovery Rate (PFDR) as a new accuracy metric for causal discovery in the brain and show that our Bayesian methods achieve higher accuracy than traditional methods on empirical data (DTI and fMRI of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) subjects). Additionally, we measure the reliability of discovered ECs using the Rogers-Tanimoto index for test-retest data and show that our Bayesian methods provide significantly more reproducible ECs compared to traditional methods.

    "abstract": "Spreadsheets are one of the most popular data analysis tools, wherein users can express computation as formulae alongside data. The ensuing dependencies are tracked as formula graphs. Efficiently querying and maintaining these formula graphs is critical for interactivity across multiple settings. Unfortunately, formula graphs are often large and complex such that querying and maintaining them is time-consuming, reducing interactivity. We propose TACO, a framework for efficiently compressing formula graphs, thereby reducing the time for querying and maintenance. The efficiency of TACO stems from a key spreadsheet property: tabular locality, which means that cells close to each other are likely to have similar formula structures. We leverage four such tabular locality-based patterns and develop algorithms for compressing formula graphs using these patterns, directly querying the compressed graph without decompression, and incrementally maintaining the graph during updates. We integrate TACO into an open-source spreadsheet system and show that TACO can significantly reduce formula graph sizes. For querying formula graphs, the speedups of TACO over a baseline implemented in our framework and a commercial spreadsheet system are up to 34,972x and 632x, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a robust and accurate non-parametric method for single-view 3D face reconstruction (SVFR). While tremendous efforts have been devoted to parametric SVFR, a visible gap still lies between the result 3D shape and the ground truth. We believe there are two major obstacles: 1) the representation of the parametric model is limited to a certain face database; 2) 2D images and 3D shapes in the fitted datasets are distinctly misaligned. To resolve these issues, a large-scale pseudo 2D\\&3D dataset is created by first rendering the detailed 3D faces, then swapping the face in the wild images with the rendered face. These pseudo 2D&3D pairs are created from publicly available datasets which eliminate the gaps between 2D and 3D data while covering diverse appearances, poses, scenes, and illumination. We further propose a non-parametric scheme to learn a well-generalized SVFR model from the created dataset, and the proposed hierarchical signed distance function turns out to be effective in predicting middle-scale and small-scale 3D facial geometry. Our model outperforms previous methods on FaceScape-wild/lab and MICC benchmarks and is well generalized to various appearances, poses, expressions, and in-the-wild environments.

    "abstract": "Class imbalance problems frequently occur in real-world tasks, and conventional deep learning algorithms are well known for performance degradation on imbalanced training datasets. To mitigate this problem, many approaches have aimed to balance among given classes by re-weighting or re-sampling training samples. These re-balancing methods increase the impact of minority classes and reduce the influence of majority classes on the output of models. However, the extracted representations may be of poor quality owing to the limited number of minority samples. To handle this restriction, several methods have been developed that increase the representations of minority samples by leveraging the features of the majority samples. Despite extensive recent studies, no deep analysis has been conducted on determination of classes to be augmented and strength of augmentation has been conducted. In this study, we first investigate the correlation between the degree of augmentation and class-wise performance, and find that the proper degree of augmentation must be allocated for each class to mitigate class imbalance problems. Motivated by this finding, we propose a simple and efficient novel curriculum, which is designed to find the appropriate per-class strength of data augmentation, called CUDA: CUrriculum of Data Augmentation for long-tailed recognition. CUDA can simply be integrated into existing long-tailed recognition methods. We present the results of experiments showing that CUDA effectively achieves better generalization performance compared to the state-of-the-art method on various imbalanced datasets such as CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.

For prediction, each RNN is guided by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) which constructs the optimal structure for each RNN model. However, finding the model uncertainty level is challenging in many cases. Although the Bayesian NNs (BNNs)-based methods are popular for providing the confidence bound of the models, they cannot be employed in complex NN structures as they are computationally intractable. This paper uses the Monte Carlo (MC) dropout as an approximation version of BNNs. Then these uncertainty levels and each predictive model suggested by GA are used to generate a new model, which is then used for forecasting the TS and AD. Simulation results show that the forecasting and AD capability of the ensemble model outperforms existing approaches. ",

In this paper, we propose CodeBERTScore: an automatic evaluation metric for code generation, which builds on BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020). Instead of measuring exact token matching as BLEU, CodeBERTScore computes a soft similarity score between each token in the generated code and in the reference code, using the contextual encodings of large pretrained models. Further, instead of encoding only the generated tokens as in BERTScore, CodeBERTScore also encodes the programmatic context surrounding the generated code. We perform an extensive evaluation of CodeBERTScore across four programming languages. We find that CodeBERTScore achieves a higher correlation with human preference and with functional correctness than all existing metrics. That is, generated code that receives a higher score by CodeBERTScore is more likely to be preferred by humans, as well as to function correctly when executed. Finally, while CodeBERTScore can be used with a multilingual CodeBERT as its base model, we release five language-specific pretrained models to use with our publicly available code at https://github.com/neulab/code-bert-score .

In this paper we investigate a scenario in which two agents, namely `Bug' and `Ant', must team up and push another agent `Spider' out of the arena. To tackle this goal, the newly added agent `Bug' is trained during an ongoing match between `Ant' and `Spider'. `Bug' must develop awareness of the other agents' actions, infer the strategy of both sides, and eventually learn an action policy to cooperate. The reinforcement learning algorithm Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is implemented with a hybrid reward structure combining dense and sparse rewards. The cooperative behavior is quantitatively evaluated by the mean probability of winning the match and mean number of steps needed to win. ",

We identify a natural and necessary condition called the \"Optimal Value Dominance\" for our objective. Under this condition, we propose novel online learning algorithms such that, for the high-tier task, it can achieve constant regret on partial states depending on the task similarity and retain near-optimal regret when the two tasks are dissimilar, while for the low-tier task, it can keep near-optimal without making sacrifice. Moreover, we further study the setting with multiple low-tier tasks, and propose a novel transfer source selection mechanism, which can ensemble the information from all low-tier tasks and allow provable benefits on a much larger state-action space.

This paper proposes a new semi-supervised deep learning method for large-scale elliptical fiber detection with synthetic data, which frees people from heavy data annotations and is robust to various kinds of image degradations. A domain adaptation strategy is utilized to reduce the domain distribution discrepancy between the synthetic data and the real data, and a new Region of Interest (RoI)-ellipse learning and a novel RoI ranking with the symmetry constraint are embedded in the proposed method.

    "abstract": "A novel form of inference attack in vertical federated learning (VFL) is proposed, where two parties collaborate in training a machine learning (ML) model. Logistic regression is considered for the VFL model. One party, referred to as the active party, possesses the ground truth labels of the samples in the training phase, while the other, referred to as the passive party, only shares a separate set of features corresponding to these samples. It is shown that the active party can carry out inference attacks on both training and prediction phase samples by acquiring an ML model independently trained on the training samples available to them. This type of inference attack does not require the active party to be aware of the score of a specific sample, hence it is referred to as an agnostic inference attack. It is shown that utilizing the observed confidence scores during the prediction phase, before the time of the attack, can improve the performance of the active party's autonomous model, and thus improve the quality of the agnostic inference attack. As a countermeasure, privacy-preserving schemes (PPSs) are proposed. While the proposed schemes preserve the utility of the VFL model, they systematically distort the VFL parameters corresponding to the passive party's features. The level of the distortion imposed on the passive party's parameters is adjustable, giving rise to a trade-off between privacy of the passive party and interpretabiliy of the VFL outcomes by the active party. The distortion level of the passive party's parameters could be chosen carefully according to the privacy and interpretabiliy concerns of the passive and active parties, respectively, with the hope of keeping both parties (partially) satisfied. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack and the PPSs. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep network pruning has attracted significant attention in order to enable the rapid deployment of AI into small devices with computation and memory constraints. Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting. Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.

The uncertain system is modeled as a connection of a nonlinear system and a perturbation. The analysis relies on three ingredients. First, the nonlinear system is approximated by a linear time-varying (LTV) system via linearization along a trajectory. This linearization introduces an additional forcing input due to the nominal trajectory. Second, the input/output behavior of the perturbation is described by time-domain, integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). Third, a dissipation inequality is formulated to bound the worst-case deviation of an output signal due to the uncertainty. These steps yield a differential linear matrix inequality (DLMI) condition to bound the worst-case performance. The robustness condition is then converted to an equivalent condition in terms of a Riccati Differential Equation. This yields a computational method that avoids heuristics often used to solve DLMIs, e.g. time gridding. The approach is demonstrated by a two-link robotic arm example. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved promising performance for 3D medical image segmentation tasks. Most current methods follow existing SSL paradigm originally designed for photographic or natural images, which cannot explicitly and thoroughly exploit the intrinsic similar anatomical structures across varying medical images. This may in fact degrade the quality of learned deep representations by maximizing the similarity among features containing spatial misalignment information and different anatomical semantics. In this work, we propose a new self-supervised learning framework, namely Alice, that explicitly fulfills Anatomical invariance modeling and semantic alignment via elaborately combining discriminative and generative objectives. Alice introduces a new contrastive learning strategy which encourages the similarity between views that are diversely mined but with consistent high-level semantics, in order to learn invariant anatomical features. Moreover, we design a conditional anatomical feature alignment module to complement corrupted embeddings with globally matched semantics and inter-patch topology information, conditioned by the distribution of local image content, which permits to create better contrastive pairs. Our extensive quantitative experiments on two public 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks of FLARE 2022 and BTCV demonstrate and validate the performance superiority of Alice, surpassing the previous best SSL counterpart methods by 2.11% and 1.77% in Dice coefficients, respectively.

    "title": "Evaluating the Robustness of Discrete Prompts",
    "abstract": "Discrete prompts have been used for fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models for diverse NLP tasks. In particular, automatic methods that generate discrete prompts from a small set of training instances have reported superior performance. However, a closer look at the learnt prompts reveals that they contain noisy and counter-intuitive lexical constructs that would not be encountered in manually-written prompts. This raises an important yet understudied question regarding the robustness of automatically learnt discrete prompts when used in downstream tasks. To address this question, we conduct a systematic study of the robustness of discrete prompts by applying carefully designed perturbations into an application using AutoPrompt and then measure their performance in two Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets. Our experimental results show that although the discrete prompt-based method remains relatively robust against perturbations to NLI inputs, they are highly sensitive to other types of perturbations such as shuffling and deletion of prompt tokens. Moreover, they generalize poorly across different NLI datasets. We hope our findings will inspire future work on robust discrete prompt learning. ",

    "abstract": "Searchable symmetric encryption enables private queries over an encrypted database, but it also yields information leakages. Adversaries can exploit these leakages to launch injection attacks (Zhang et al., USENIX'16) to recover the underlying keywords from queries. The performance of the existing injection attacks is strongly dependent on the amount of leaked information or injection. In this work, we propose two new injection attacks, namely BVA and BVMA, by leveraging a binary volumetric approach. We enable adversaries to inject fewer files than the existing volumetric attacks by using the known keywords and reveal the queries by observing the volume of the query results. Our attacks can thwart well-studied defenses (e.g., threshold countermeasure, static padding) without exploiting the distribution of target queries and client databases. We evaluate the proposed attacks empirically in real-world datasets with practical queries. The results show that our attacks can obtain a high recovery rate (>80%) in the best case and a roughly 60% recovery even under a large-scale dataset with a small number of injections (<20 files). ",

In this paper, we summarize the recent development of spectral GNNs, including model, theory, and application. Specifically, we first discuss the connection between spatial GNNs and spectral GNNs, which shows that spectral GNNs can capture global information and have better expressiveness and interpretability. Next, we categorize existing spectral GNNs according to the spectrum information they use, \\ie, eigenvalues or eigenvectors. In addition, we review major theoretical results and applications of spectral GNNs, followed by a quantitative experiment to benchmark some popular spectral GNNs.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is an effective method for model compression. However, it is still a challenging topic to apply knowledge distillation to detection tasks. There are two key points resulting poor distillation performance for detection tasks. One is the serious imbalance between foreground and background features, another one is that small object lacks enough feature representation. To solve the above issues, we propose a new distillation method named dual relation knowledge distillation (DRKD), including pixel-wise relation distillation and instance-wise relation distillation.The pixel-wise relation distillation embeds pixel-wise features in the graph space and applies graph convolution to capture the global pixel relation. By distilling the global pixel relation, the student detector can learn the relation between foreground and background features, avoid the difficulty of distilling feature directly for feature imbalance issue.Besides, we find that instance-wise relation supplements valuable knowledge beyond independent features for small objects. Thus, the instance-wise relation distillation is designed, which calculates the similarity of different instances to obtain a relation matrix. More importantly, a relation filter module is designed to highlight valuable instance relations.The proposed dual relation knowledge distillation is general and can be easily applied for both one-stage and two-stage detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, which improves Faster R-CNN based on ResNet50 from 38.4\\% to 41.6\\% mAP and improves RetinaNet based on ResNet50 from 37.4% to 40.3% mAP on COCO 2017.

Temporal KGs(TKGs) extend traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by associating static triples with timestamps forming quadruples. Different from KGs and TKGs in the transductive setting, constantly emerging entities and relations in incomplete TKGs create demand to predict missing facts with unseen components, which is the extrapolation setting. Traditional temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) methods are limited in the extrapolation setting since they are trained within a fixed set of components. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Learning based Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation (MTKGE) model, which is trained on link prediction tasks sampled from the existing TKGs and tested in the emerging TKGs with unseen entities and relations. Specifically, we meta-train a GNN framework that captures relative position patterns and temporal sequence patterns between relations. The learned embeddings of patterns can be transferred to embed unseen components. Experimental results on two different TKG extrapolation datasets show that MTKGE consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-the-art models for knowledge graph extrapolation and specifically adapted KGE and TKGE baselines.

The evolution of these two technologies led to the focus on VR locomotion and interaction. Locomotion is generally controller-based, but today hand gesture recognition methods were also used for this purpose. However, hand gestures can be stressful for the user who has to keep the gesture activation for a long time to ensure locomotion, especially continuously. Likewise, in Head Mounted Display (HMD)-based virtual environment or Spherical-based system, the use of classic controllers for the 3D scene interaction could be unnatural for the user compared to using hand gestures such \\eg pinching to grab 3D objects. To address these issues, we propose a user study comparing the use of the classic controllers (six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) or trackballs) in HMD and spherical-based systems, and the hand tracking and gestures in both VR immersive modes. In particular, we focused on the possible differences between spherical-based systems and HMD in terms of the level of immersion perceived by the user, the mode of user interaction (controller and hands), on the reaction of users concerning usefulness, easiness, and behavioral intention to use.

    "abstract": "Collaboration between healthcare institutions can significantly lessen the imbalance in medical resources across various geographic areas. However, directly sharing diagnostic information between institutions is typically not permitted due to the protection of patients' highly sensitive privacy. As a novel privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) makes it possible to maximize the data utility among multiple medical institutions. These feature-enrichment FL techniques are referred to as vertical FL (VFL). Traditional VFL can only benefit multi-parties' shared samples, which strongly restricts its application scope. In order to improve the information-sharing capability and innovation of various healthcare-related institutions, and then to establish a next-generation open medical collaboration network, we propose a unified framework for vertical federated knowledge transfer mechanism (VFedTrans) based on a novel cross-hospital representation distillation component. Specifically, our framework includes three steps. First, shared samples' federated representations are extracted by collaboratively modeling multi-parties' joint features with current efficient vertical federated representation learning methods. Second, for each hospital, we learn a local-representation-distilled module, which can transfer the knowledge from shared samples' federated representations to enrich local samples' representations. Finally, each hospital can leverage local samples' representations enriched by the distillation module to boost arbitrary downstream machine learning tasks. The experiments on real-life medical datasets verify the knowledge transfer effectiveness of our framework. ",

Lately, multi-modal hateful content such as memes has drawn relatively more traction than uni-modal content. Moreover, the availability of implicit content payloads makes them fairly challenging to be detected by existing hateful meme detection systems. In this paper, we present a use case study to analyze such systems' vulnerabilities against external adversarial attacks. We find that even very simple perturbations in uni-modal and multi-modal settings performed by humans with little knowledge about the model can make the existing detection models highly vulnerable. Empirically, we find a noticeable performance drop of as high as 10% in the macro-F1 score for certain attacks. As a remedy, we attempt to boost the model's robustness using contrastive learning as well as an adversarial training-based method - VILLA. Using an ensemble of the above two approaches, in two of our high resolution datasets, we are able to (re)gain back the performance to a large extent for certain attacks. We believe that ours is a first step toward addressing this crucial problem in an adversarial setting and would inspire more such investigations in the future. ",

We revisit previous lower bounds at a foundational level, and show that they are a consequence of a space bottleneck rather than a sampling bottleneck.

Recently, audio-visual deception detection attracts more attention due to its better performance than using only a single modality. However, in real-world multi-modal settings, the integrity of data can be an issue (e.g., sometimes only partial modalities are available). The missing modality might lead to a decrease in performance, but the model still learns the features of the missed modality. In this paper, to further improve the performance and overcome the missing modality problem, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework with an Audio-Visual Adapter (AVA) to fuse temporal features across two modalities efficiently. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior performance compared with other multi-modal fusion methods under flexible-modal (multiple and missing modalities) settings.

Dual-use is difficult to prevent as instruction-following capabilities now enable standard attacks from computer security. The capabilities of these instruction-following LLMs provide strong economic incentives for dual-use by malicious actors. In particular, we show that instruction-following LLMs can produce targeted malicious content, including hate speech and scams, bypassing in-the-wild defenses implemented by LLM API vendors. Our analysis shows that this content can be generated economically and at cost likely lower than with human effort alone. Together, our findings suggest that LLMs will increasingly attract more sophisticated adversaries and attacks, and addressing these attacks may require new approaches to mitigations. ",

For this reason, this paper presents a scheme for locating the sources of oscillation caused by VSC control, based on the energy structure and the nonlinear detection. On one hand, the energy structure, which is according to the principle of the energy-based method and conforms to the dissipativity theory, is constructed to describe the transient energy flow for VSCs, and on this basis, a defined characteristic quantity is implemented to narrow the scope of oscillation source location; and on the other hand, according to the self-sustained oscillation characteristics of VSCs, an index for nonlinear detection is applied to locate the VSCs which produce the oscillation energy. The combination of the energy structure and the nonlinear detection could distinguish the contributions of different VSCs to the oscillation. The results of the case study implemented by the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation can verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme. ",

However, their importance in improving model usage and understanding has not been extensively studied. Hence, we consider a comorbidity risk prediction scenario and focus on contexts regarding the patients clinical state, AI predictions about their risk of complications, and algorithmic explanations supporting the predictions. We explore how relevant information for such dimensions can be extracted from Medical guidelines to answer typical questions from clinical practitioners. We identify this as a question answering (QA) task and employ several state-of-the-art LLMs to present contexts around risk prediction model inferences and evaluate their acceptability. Finally, we study the benefits of contextual explanations by building an end-to-end AI pipeline including data cohorting, AI risk modeling, post-hoc model explanations, and prototyped a visual dashboard to present the combined insights from different context dimensions and data sources, while predicting and identifying the drivers of risk of Chronic Kidney Disease - a common type-2 diabetes comorbidity. All of these steps were performed in engagement with medical experts, including a final evaluation of the dashboard results by an expert medical panel. We show that LLMs, in particular BERT and SciBERT, can be readily deployed to extract some relevant explanations to support clinical usage. To understand the value-add of the contextual explanations, the expert panel evaluated these regarding actionable insights in the relevant clinical setting.

Supervised neural networks are constructed with the objective to maximize their performance metric in any given task. This is done by reducing free energy and its associated surprisal during training. However, the bottom-up inference nature of supervised networks is a passive process that renders them fallible to noise. In this paper, we provide a thorough background of supervised neural networks, both generative and discriminative, and discuss their functionality from the perspective of free energy principle. We then provide a framework for introducing action during inference. We introduce a new measurement called stochastic surprisal that is a function of the network, the input, and any possible action. This action can be any one of the outputs that the neural network has learnt, thereby lending stochasticity to the measurement. Stochastic surprisal is validated on two applications: Image Quality Assessment and Recognition under noisy conditions. We show that, while noise characteristics are ignored to make robust recognition, they are analyzed to estimate image quality scores. We apply stochastic surprisal on two applications, three datasets, and as a plug-in on twelve networks. In all, it provides a statistically significant increase among all measures. We conclude by discussing the implications of the proposed stochastic surprisal in other areas of cognitive psychology including expectancy-mismatch and abductive reasoning. ",

We theoretically prove the functional relationship between the learned latent representation and the unknown system invariant function. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms the baseline neural networks in both coordinate error and conservation metrics by a large margin.

    "title": "TPE-Net: Track Point Extraction and Association Network for Rail Path  Proposal Generation",
    "abstract": "One essential feature of an autonomous train is minimizing collision risks with third-party objects. To estimate the risk, the control system must identify topological information of all the rail routes ahead on which the train can possibly move, especially within merging or diverging rails. This way, the train can figure out the status of potential obstacles with respect to its route and hence, make a timely decision. Numerous studies have successfully extracted all rail tracks as a whole within forward-looking images without considering element instances. Still, some image-based methods have employed hard-coded prior knowledge of railway geometry on 3D data to associate left-right rails and generate rail route instances. However, we propose a rail path extraction pipeline in which left-right rail pixels of each rail route instance are extracted and associated through a fully convolutional encoder-decoder architecture called TPE-Net. Two different regression branches for TPE-Net are proposed to regress the locations of center points of each rail route, along with their corresponding left-right pixels. Extracted rail pixels are then spatially clustered to generate topological information of all the possible train routes (ego-paths), discarding non-ego-path ones. Experimental results on a challenging, publicly released benchmark show true-positive-pixel level average precision and recall of 0.9207 and 0.8721, respectively, at about 12 frames per second. Even though our evaluation results are not higher than the SOTA, the proposed regression pipeline performs remarkably in extracting the correspondences by looking once at the image. It generates strong rail route hypotheses without reliance on camera parameters, 3D data, and geometrical constraints. ",

    "abstract": "Standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) training can produce deep neural network (DNN) models that are accurate on average but under-perform in under-represented population subgroups, especially when there are imbalanced group distributions in the long-tailed training data. Therefore, approaches that improve the accuracy-group robustness trade-off frontier of a DNN model (i.e. improving worst-group accuracy without sacrificing average accuracy, or vice versa) is of crucial importance. Uncertainty-based active learning (AL) can potentially improve the frontier by preferentially sampling underrepresented subgroups to create a more balanced training dataset. However, the quality of uncertainty estimates from modern DNNs tend to degrade in the presence of spurious correlations and dataset bias, compromising the effectiveness of AL for sampling tail groups. In this work, we propose Introspective Self-play (ISP), a simple approach to improve the uncertainty estimation of a deep neural network under dataset bias, by adding an auxiliary introspection task requiring a model to predict the bias for each data point in addition to the label. We show that ISP provably improves the bias-awareness of the model representation and the resulting uncertainty estimates. On two real-world tabular and language tasks, ISP serves as a simple \"plug-in\" for AL model training, consistently improving both the tail-group sampling rate and the final accuracy-fairness trade-off frontier of popular AL methods.

    "abstract": "Over the last few years, key architectural advances have been proposed for neural network interatomic potentials (NNIPs), such as incorporating message-passing networks, equivariance, or many-body expansion terms. Although modern NNIP models exhibit nearly negligible differences in energy/forces errors, improvements in accuracy are still considered the main target when developing new NNIP architectures. In this work, we investigate how architectural choices influence the trainability and generalization error in NNIPs, revealing trends in extrapolation, data efficiency, and loss landscapes. First, we show that modern NNIP architectures recover the underlying potential energy surface (PES) of the training data even when trained to corrupted labels. Second, generalization metrics such as errors on high-temperature samples from the 3BPA dataset are demonstrated to follow a scaling relation for a variety of models. Thus, improvements in accuracy metrics may not bring independent information on the robust generalization of NNIPs. To circumvent this problem, we relate loss landscapes to model generalization across datasets. Using this probe, we explain why NNIPs with similar accuracy metrics exhibit different abilities to extrapolate and how training to forces improves the optimization landscape of a model. As an example, we show that MACE can predict PESes with reasonable error after being trained to as few as five data points, making it an example of a \"few-shot\" model for learning PESes. On the other hand, models with similar accuracy metrics such as NequIP show smaller ability to extrapolate in this extremely low-data regime. Our work provides a deep learning justification for the performance of many common NNIPs, and introduces tools beyond accuracy metrics that can be used to inform the development of next-generation models.

Unlike most of the existing works, we focus on the role of the final nonlinear transformation of the networks. Our bound is described by the reciprocal of the determinant of the weight matrices and is tighter than existing norm-based bounds when the weight matrices do not have small singular values. According to existing theories about the low-rankness of the weight matrices, it may be counter-intuitive that we focus on the case where singular values of weight matrices are not small. However, motivated by the final nonlinear transformation, we can see that our result sheds light on a new perspective regarding a noise filtering property of neural networks. Since our bound comes from Koopman operators, this work also provides a connection between operator-theoretic analysis and generalization of neural networks. Numerical results support the validity of our theoretical results. ",

In this work, we introduce this inductive bias into GPs to improve their predictive performance for graph-structured data. We show that a prominent example of GNNs, the graph convolutional network, is equivalent to some GP when its layers are infinitely wide; and we analyze the kernel universality and the limiting behavior in depth. We further present a programmable procedure to compose covariance kernels inspired by this equivalence and derive example kernels corresponding to several interesting members of the GNN family. We also propose a computationally efficient approximation of the covariance matrix for scalable posterior inference with large-scale data.

A popular subclass of neuroevolutionary methods, called evolution strategies, relies on dense noise perturbations to mutate networks, which can be sample inefficient and challenging for large models with millions of parameters. We introduce an approach to alleviating this problem by decomposing dense mutations into low-dimensional subspaces. Restricting mutations in this way can significantly reduce variance as networks can handle stronger perturbations while maintaining performance, which enables a more controlled and targeted evolution of deep networks. This approach is uniquely effective for the task of fine tuning pre-trained models, which is an increasingly valuable area of research as networks continue to scale in size and open source models become more widely available. Furthermore, we show how this work naturally connects to ensemble learning where sparse mutations encourage diversity among children such that their combined predictions can reliably improve performance. We conduct the first large scale exploration of neuroevolutionary fine tuning and ensembling on the notoriously difficult ImageNet dataset, where we see small generalization improvements with only a single evolutionary generation using nearly a dozen different deep neural network architectures.

    "abstract": "Local feature matching is an essential component in many visual applications. In this work, we propose OAMatcher, a Tranformer-based detector-free method that imitates humans behavior to generate dense and accurate matches. Firstly, OAMatcher predicts overlapping areas to promote effective and clean global context aggregation, with the key insight that humans focus on the overlapping areas instead of the entire images after multiple observations when matching keypoints in image pairs. Technically, we first perform global information integration across all keypoints to imitate the humans behavior of observing the entire images at the beginning of feature matching. Then, we propose Overlapping Areas Prediction Module (OAPM) to capture the keypoints in co-visible regions and conduct feature enhancement among them to simulate that humans transit the focus regions from the entire images to overlapping regions, hence realizeing effective information exchange without the interference coming from the keypoints in non overlapping areas. Besides, since humans tend to leverage probability to determine whether the match labels are correct or not, we propose a Match Labels Weight Strategy (MLWS) to generate the coefficients used to appraise the reliability of the ground-truth match labels, while alleviating the influence of measurement noise coming from the data. Moreover, we integrate depth-wise convolution into Tranformer encoder layers to ensure OAMatcher extracts local and global feature representation concurrently. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OAMatcher outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, while exhibiting excellent robustness to extreme appearance variants.

    "abstract": "Majority of aircraft under the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concept are expected to be of the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle type, which will operate out of vertiports. While this is akin to the relationship between general aviation aircraft and airports, the conceived location of vertiports within dense urban environments presents unique challenges in managing the air traffic served by a vertiport. This challenge becomes pronounced within increasing frequency of scheduled landings and take-offs. This paper assumes a centralized air traffic controller (ATC) to explore the performance of a new AI driven ATC approach to manage the eVTOLs served by the vertiport. Minimum separation-driven safety and delays are the two important considerations in this case. The ATC problem is modeled as a task allocation problem, and uncertainties due to communication disruptions (e.g., poor link quality) and inclement weather (e.g., high gust effects) are added as a small probability of action failures. To learn the vertiport ATC policy, a novel graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) solution called \"Urban Air Mobility- Vertiport Schedule Management (UAM-VSM)\" is developed. This approach uses graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to abstract the vertiport space and eVTOL space as graphs, and aggregate information for a centralized ATC agent to help generalize the environment. Unreal Engine combined with Airsim is used as the simulation environment over which training and testing occurs. Uncertainties are considered only during testing, due to the high cost of Mc sampling over such realistic simulations. The proposed graph RL method demonstrates significantly better performance on the test scenarios when compared against a feasible random decision-making baseline and a first come first serve (FCFS) baseline, including the ability to generalize to unseen scenarios and with uncertainties.

Numerous works have been working on mitigating the vulnerability from adversarial attacks. Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive defense in existing works where each work targets a specific attack category or suffers from the limitation of computation overhead, irresistible to adaptive attack, etc. In this paper, we exhaustively investigate the adversarial attack algorithms in NLP, and our empirical studies have discovered that the attack algorithms mainly disrupt the importance distribution of words in a text. A well-trained model can distinguish subtle importance distribution differences between clean and adversarial texts. Based on this intuition, we propose TextDefense, a new adversarial example detection framework that utilizes the target model's capability to defend against adversarial attacks while requiring no prior knowledge. TextDefense differs from previous approaches, where it utilizes the target model for detection and thus is attack type agnostic. Our extensive experiments show that TextDefense can be applied to different architectures, datasets, and attack methods and outperforms existing methods. We also discover that the leading factor influencing the performance of TextDefense is the target model's generalizability. By analyzing the property of the target model and the property of the adversarial example, we provide our insights into the adversarial attacks in NLP and the principles of our defense method. ",

Most of the previous works employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to process the input signal. However, finding a CNN architecture is a time-consuming process and requires domain expertise. Moreover, the researchers introduce early and late fusion approaches for fusing different modalities or concatenate the representations of the different modalities during training, thus the inter-modal interactions are not captured. To tackle these limitations, first we exploit a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to automatically find a high performing CNN architecture. Next, we exploit several fusion methods, including Multimodal Factorized Bilinear Pooling and Tucker Decomposition, to combine both speech and text modalities. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work exploiting a NAS approach and these fusion methods in the task of dementia detection from spontaneous speech.

This is done by applying a linear transformation to the estimated uncertainty matrix, which is subsequently used as a measurement noise for the adopted Kalman filter. We implement two ways to estimate output uncertainty, i.e., internally, by computing the variance of the CNNs outputs and then propagating the uncertainty through the post-processing, and externally, by associating the final predictions of different samples and computing the covariance of each predicted box. In experiments, we show that the external uncertainty estimation leads to better results, outperforming both internal uncertainty estimation and classical tracking approaches.

In this work, we design and implement a bad data detection solution for electrical substations called ResiGate, that effectively combines a physics-based approach and a machine-learning-based approach to provide substantial speed-up in high-throughput substation communication scenarios, while still maintaining high detection accuracy and confidence. While many existing physics-based schemes are designed for deployment in control centers (due to their high computational requirement), ResiGate is designed as a security appliance that can be deployed on low-cost industrial computers at the edge of the smart grid so that it can detect local substation-level attacks in a timely manner. A key challenge for this is to continuously run the computationally demanding physics-based analysis to monitor the measurement data frequently transmitted in a typical substation. To provide high throughput without sacrificing accuracy, ResiGate uses machine learning to effectively filter out most of the non-suspicious (normal) data and thereby reducing the overall computational load, allowing efficient performance even with a high volume of network traffic. We implement ResiGate on a low-cost industrial computer and our experiments confirm that ResiGate can detect attacks with zero error while sustaining a high throughput. ",

    "title": "Infinite Lewis Weights in Spectral Graph Theory",
    "abstract": "We study the spectral implications of re-weighting a graph by the $\\ell_\\infty$-Lewis weights of its edges. Our main motivation is the ER-Minimization problem (Saberi et al., SIAM'08): Given an undirected graph $G$, the goal is to find positive normalized edge-weights $w\\in \\mathbb{R}_+^m$ which minimize the sum of pairwise \\emph{effective-resistances} of $G_w$ (Kirchhoff's index). By contrast, $\\ell_\\infty$-Lewis weights minimize the \\emph{maximum} effective-resistance of \\emph{edges}, but are much cheaper to approximate, especially for Laplacians. With this algorithmic motivation, we study the ER-approximation ratio obtained by Lewis weights. Our first main result is that $\\ell_\\infty$-Lewis weights provide a constant ($\\approx 3.12$) approximation for ER-minimization on \\emph{trees}. The proof introduces a new technique, a local polarization process for effective-resistances ($\\ell_2$-congestion) on trees, which is of independent interest in electrical network analysis. For general graphs, we prove an upper bound $\\alpha(G)$ on the approximation ratio obtained by Lewis weights, which is always $\\leq \\min\\{ \\text{diam}(G), \\kappa(L_{w_\\infty})\\}$, where $\\kappa$ is the condition number of the weighted Laplacian. All our approximation algorithms run in \\emph{input-sparsity} time $\\tilde{O}(m)$, a major improvement over Saberi et al.'s $O(m^{3.5})$ SDP for exact ER-minimization. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable effects of $\\ell_\\infty$-LW reweighting on the \\emph{spectral-gap} of graphs and on their \\emph{spectral-thinness} (Anari and Gharan, 2015). En-route to our results, we prove a weighted analogue of Mohar's classical bound on $\\lambda_2(G)$, and provide a new characterization of leverage-scores of a matrix, as the gradient (w.r.t weights) of the volume of the enclosing ellipsoid.

In this work, we introduce a novel self-supervision objective for the analysis of cells in biomedical microscopy images. We propose training deep learning models to pseudo-colorize masked cells. We use a physics-informed pseudo-spectral colormap that is well suited for colorizing cell topology. Our experiments reveal that approximating semantic segmentation by pseudo-colorization is beneficial for subsequent fine-tuning on cell detection. Inspired by the recent success of masked image modeling, we additionally mask out cell parts and train to reconstruct these parts to further enrich the learned representations. We compare our pre-training method with self-supervised frameworks including contrastive learning (SimCLR), masked autoencoders (MAEs), and edge-based self-supervision. We build upon our previous work and train hybrid models for cell detection, which contain both convolutional and vision transformer modules. Our pre-training method can outperform SimCLR, MAE-like masked image modeling, and edge-based self-supervision when pre-training on a diverse set of six fluorescence microscopy datasets.

    "abstract": "Multi-domain recommender systems benefit from cross-domain representation learning and positive knowledge transfer. Both can be achieved by introducing a specific modeling of input data (i.e. disjoint history) or trying dedicated training regimes. At the same time, treating domains as separate input sources becomes a limitation as it does not capture the interplay that naturally exists between domains. In this work, we efficiently learn multi-domain representation of sequential users' interactions using graph neural networks. We use temporal intra- and inter-domain interactions as contextual information for our method called MAGRec (short for Multi-domAin Graph-based Recommender). To better capture all relations in a multi-domain setting, we learn two graph-based sequential representations simultaneously: domain-guided for recent user interest, and general for long-term interest. This approach helps to mitigate the negative knowledge transfer problem from multiple domains and improve overall representation. We perform experiments on publicly available datasets in different scenarios where MAGRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we provide an ablation study and discuss further extensions of our method. ",

We analyze two popular approaches: freezing or finetuning the pretrained representations. Empirical studies on a set of popular tasks reveal several properties of pretrained representations. First, finetuning is required even when pretrained representations perfectly capture the information required to solve the target task. Second, finetuned representations improve learnability and are more robust to noise. Third, pretrained bottom layers are task-agnostic and readily transferable to new tasks, while top layers encode task-specific information and require adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose a self-supervised objective that clusters representations according to the policy they induce, as opposed to traditional representation similarity measures which are policy-agnostic (e.g. Euclidean norm, cosine similarity). Together with freezing the bottom layers, this objective results in significantly better representation than frozen, finetuned, and self-supervised alternatives on a wide range of benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Real-world robotics applications demand object pose estimation methods that work reliably across a variety of scenarios. Modern learning-based approaches require large labeled datasets and tend to perform poorly outside the training domain. Our first contribution is to develop a robust corrector module that corrects pose estimates using depth information, thus enabling existing methods to better generalize to new test domains; the corrector operates on semantic keypoints (but is also applicable to other pose estimators) and is fully differentiable. Our second contribution is an ensemble self-training approach that simultaneously trains multiple pose estimators in a self-supervised manner. Our ensemble self-training architecture uses the robust corrector to refine the output of each pose estimator; then, it evaluates the quality of the outputs using observable correctness certificates; finally, it uses the observably correct outputs for further training, without requiring external supervision. As an additional contribution, we propose small improvements to a regression-based keypoint detection architecture, to enhance its robustness to outliers; these improvements include a robust pooling scheme and a robust centroid computation. Experiments on the YCBV and TLESS datasets show the proposed ensemble self-training outperforms fully supervised baselines while not requiring 3D annotations on real data. ",

Previous approaches to UDA-OD based on self-training have been effective in overcoming changes in the general appearance of images. However, shifts in a robot's deployment environment can also impact the likelihood that different objects will occur, termed class distribution shift. Motivated by this, we propose a framework for explicitly addressing class distribution shift to improve pseudo-label reliability in self-training. Our approach uses the domain invariance and contextual understanding of a pre-trained joint vision and language model to predict the class distribution of unlabelled data. By aligning the class distribution of pseudo-labels with this prediction, we provide weak supervision of pseudo-label accuracy. To further account for low quality pseudo-labels early in self-training, we propose an approach to dynamically adjust the number of pseudo-labels per image based on model confidence. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on several benchmarks, including a 4.7 mAP improvement when facing challenging class distribution shift. ",

Existing state-of-the-art methods usually first extract multi-scale features by a classification backbone and then fuse these features by a lightweight module (e.g. the fusion module in FPN). However, we argue that it may not be sufficient to fuse the multi-scale features through such a paradigm, because the parameters allocated for feature fusion are limited compared with the heavy classification backbone. In order to address this issue, we propose a new architecture named Cascade Fusion Network (CFNet) for dense prediction. Besides the stem and several blocks used to extract initial high-resolution features, we introduce several cascaded stages to generate multi-scale features in CFNet. Each stage includes a sub-backbone for feature extraction and an extremely lightweight transition block for feature integration. This design makes it possible to fuse features more deeply and effectively with a large proportion of parameters of the whole backbone. Extensive experiments on object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation validated the effectiveness of the proposed CFNet.

To better learn dynamic node embeddings that vary over time, researchers have proposed a series of temporal graph neural networks for TIGs. However, due to the entangled temporal and structural dependencies, existing methods have to process the sequence of events chronologically and consecutively to ensure node representations are up-to-date. This prevents existing models from parallelization and reduces their flexibility in industrial applications. To tackle the above challenge, in this paper, we propose TIGER, a TIG embedding model that can restart at any timestamp. We introduce a restarter module that generates surrogate representations acting as the warm initialization of node representations. By restarting from multiple timestamps simultaneously, we divide the sequence into multiple chunks and naturally enable the parallelization of the model. Moreover, in contrast to previous models that utilize a single memory unit, we introduce a dual memory module to better exploit neighborhood information and alleviate the staleness problem. Extensive experiments on four public datasets and one industrial dataset are conducted, and the results verify both the effectiveness and the efficiency of our work. ",

To this end, we focus on this research, i.e., PAs on object detection in O-RSIs, and propose a more Threatening PA without the scarification of the visual quality, dubbed TPA. Specifically, to address the problem of inconsistency between local and global landscapes in existing patch selection schemes, we propose leveraging the First-Order Difference (FOD) of the objective function before and after masking to select the sub-patches to be attacked. Further, considering the problem of gradient inundation when applying existing coordinate-based loss to PAs directly, we design an IoU-based objective function specific for PAs, dubbed Bounding box Drifting Loss (BDL), which pushes the detected bounding boxes far from the initial ones until there are no intersections between them. Finally, on two widely used benchmarks, i.e., DIOR and DOTA, comprehensive evaluations of our TPA with four typical detectors (Faster R-CNN, FCOS, RetinaNet, and YOLO-v4) witness its remarkable effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study the PAs on object detection in O-RSIs, and we hope this work can get our readers interested in studying this topic. ",

In a query tree issued by the task owner, each agent is rewarded by the owner for contributing to the solution, for instance, solving the task or inviting others to solve it. The reward mechanism determines the reward for each agent and motivates all agents to propagate and report their information truthfully. In particular, the reward cannot exceed the budget set by the task owner. However, our impossibility results demonstrate that a reward mechanism cannot simultaneously achieve Sybil-proof (agents benefit from manipulating multiple fake identities), collusion-proof (multiple agents pretend as a single agent to improve the reward), and other essential properties. In order to address these issues, we propose two novel reward mechanisms. The first mechanism achieves Sybil-proof and collusion-proof, respectively; the second mechanism sacrifices Sybil-proof to achieve the approximate versions of Sybil-proof and collusion-proof.

Unlike existing universal algorithms, our strategy does not rely on the construction of a set of experts and an accompanying meta-algorithm. Instead, we show that the problem of dynamic online optimization can be reduced to a uniclass prediction problem. By leaving the choice of uniclass loss function in the user's hands, they are able to control and optimize dynamic regret bounds, which in turn carry over into the original problem.

Meanwhile, we observe that most existing robust AGgregation Rules (AGRs) fail to stop the aggregated gradient deviating from the optimal gradient (the average of honest gradients) in the non-IID setting. We attribute the reason of the failure of these AGRs to two newly proposed concepts: identification failure and integrity failure. The identification failure mainly comes from the exacerbated curse of dimensionality in the non-IID setting. The integrity failure is a combined result of conservative filtering strategy and gradient heterogeneity. In order to address both failures, we propose GAIN, a gradient decomposition scheme that can help adapt existing robust algorithms to heterogeneous datasets. We also provide convergence analysis for integrating existing robust AGRs into GAIN. Experiments on various real-world datasets verify the efficacy of our proposed GAIN. ",

Nevertheless, the correct position to apply dropout has rarely been discussed, and different positions have been employed depending on the practitioners. In this study, we investigate the correct position to apply dropout. We demonstrate that for a residual network with batch normalization, applying dropout at certain positions increases the performance, whereas applying dropout at other positions decreases the performance. Based on theoretical analysis, we provide the following guideline for the correct position to apply dropout: apply one dropout after the last batch normalization but before the last weight layer in the residual branch. We provide detailed theoretical explanations to support this claim and demonstrate them through module tests. In addition, we investigate the correct position of dropout in the head that produces the final prediction. Although the current consensus is to apply dropout after global average pooling, we prove that applying dropout before global average pooling leads to a more stable output. The proposed guidelines are validated through experiments using different datasets and models. ",

Moreover, we introduce an additional edge link prediction task to improve KGC. Evaluation on two public datasets shows that this framework is simple yet effective. The case study also shows that the model is able to predict explainable predictions. ",

    "title": "DCMT: A Direct Entire-Space Causal Multi-Task Framework for Post-Click  Conversion Estimation",
    "abstract": "In recommendation scenarios, there are two long-standing challenges, i.e., selection bias and data sparsity, which lead to a significant drop in prediction accuracy for both Click-Through Rate (CTR) and post-click Conversion Rate (CVR) tasks. To cope with these issues, existing works emphasize on leveraging Multi-Task Learning (MTL) frameworks (Category 1) or causal debiasing frameworks (Category 2) to incorporate more auxiliary data in the entire exposure/inference space D or debias the selection bias in the click/training space O. However, these two kinds of solutions cannot effectively address the not-missing-at-random problem and debias the selection bias in O to fit the inference in D. To fill the research gaps, we propose a Direct entire-space Causal Multi-Task framework, namely DCMT, for post-click conversion prediction in this paper. Specifically, inspired by users' decision process of conversion, we propose a new counterfactual mechanism to debias the selection bias in D, which can predict the factual CVR and the counterfactual CVR under the soft constraint of a counterfactual prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DCMT can improve the state-of-the-art methods by an average of 1.07% in terms of CVR AUC on the five offline datasets and 0.75% in terms of PV-CVR on the online A/B test (the Alipay Search). Such improvements can increase millions of conversions per week in real industrial applications, e.g., the Alipay Search. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning techniques have shown great success in automatic code generation. Inspired by the code reuse, some researchers propose copy-based approaches that can copy the content from similar code snippets to obtain better performance. Practically, human developers recognize the content in the similar code that is relevant to their needs, which can be viewed as a code sketch. The sketch is further edited to the desired code. However, existing copy-based approaches ignore the code sketches and tend to repeat the similar code without necessary modifications, which leads to generating wrong results. In this paper, we propose a sketch-based code generation approach named SkCoder to mimic developers' code reuse behavior. Given a natural language requirement, SkCoder retrieves a similar code snippet, extracts relevant parts as a code sketch, and edits the sketch into the desired code. Our motivations are that the extracted sketch provides a well-formed pattern for telling models \"how to write\". The post-editing further adds requirement-specific details to the sketch and outputs the complete code. We conduct experiments on two public datasets and a new dataset collected by this work. We compare our approach to 20 baselines using 5 widely used metrics. Experimental results show that (1) SkCoder can generate more correct programs, and outperforms the state-of-the-art - CodeT5-base by 30.30%, 35.39%, and 29.62% on three datasets. (2) Our approach is effective to multiple code generation models and improves them by up to 120.1% in Pass@1. (3) We investigate three plausible code sketches and discuss the importance of sketches. (4) We manually evaluate the generated code and prove the superiority of our SkCoder in three aspects. ",

We interpret the Cartesian birds' eye view (BEV) image projected from 3D LiDAR points as layered distribution of structures. To recover elevation information from BEVs, we slice them at different heights, and connected pixels at each level will form contours. Each contour is parameterized by abstract information, e.g., pixel count, center position, covariance, and mean height. The similarity of two BEVs is calculated in sequential discrete and continuous steps. The first step considers the geometric consensus of graph-like constellations formed by contours in particular localities. The second step models the majority of contours as a 2.5D Gaussian mixture model, which is used to calculate correlation and optimize relative transform in continuous space. A retrieval key is designed to accelerate the search of a database indexed by layered KD-trees. We validate the efficacy of our method by comparing it with recent works on public datasets. ",

Existing methods using either onboard or aerial imagery struggle with complex lane topologies, out-of-distribution scenarios, or significant occlusions in the image space. Moreover, merging overlapping lane graphs to obtain consistent large-scale graphs remains difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel bottom-up approach to lane graph estimation from aerial imagery that aggregates multiple overlapping graphs into a single consistent graph. Due to its modular design, our method allows us to address two complementary tasks: predicting ego-respective successor lane graphs from arbitrary vehicle positions using a graph neural network and aggregating these predictions into a consistent global lane graph. Extensive experiments on a large-scale lane graph dataset demonstrate that our approach yields highly accurate lane graphs, even in regions with severe occlusions. The presented approach to graph aggregation proves to eliminate inconsistent predictions while increasing the overall graph quality.

However, the data, especially the videos published on the Internet, are usually compressed with lossy compression algorithms such as H.264. The compressed data could significantly degrade the performance of recent detection algorithms. The existing anti-compression algorithms focus on enhancing the performance in detecting heavily compressed data but less consider the compression adaption to the data from various compression levels. We believe creating a forgery detection model that can handle the data compressed with unknown levels is important. To enhance the performance for such models, we consider the weak compressed and strong compressed data as two views of the original data and they should have similar representation and relationships with other samples. We propose a novel anti-compression forgery detection framework by maintaining closer relations within data under different compression levels. Specifically, the algorithm measures the pair-wise similarity within data as the relations, and forcing the relations of weak and strong compressed data close to each other, thus improving the discriminate power for detecting strong compressed data. To achieve a better strong compressed data relation guided by the less compressed one, we apply video level contrastive learning for weak compressed data, which forces the model to produce similar representations within the same video and far from the negative samples. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm could boost performance for strong compressed data while improving the accuracy rate when detecting the clean data. ",

    "abstract": "The goal of this work is to address two limitations in autoencoder-based models: latent space interpretability and compatibility with unstructured meshes. This is accomplished here with the development of a novel graph neural network (GNN) autoencoding architecture with demonstrations on complex fluid flow applications. To address the first goal of interpretability, the GNN autoencoder achieves reduction in the number nodes in the encoding stage through an adaptive graph reduction procedure. This reduction procedure essentially amounts to flowfield-conditioned node sampling and sensor identification, and produces interpretable latent graph representations tailored to the flowfield reconstruction task in the form of so-called masked fields. These masked fields allow the user to (a) visualize where in physical space a given latent graph is active, and (b) interpret the time-evolution of the latent graph connectivity in accordance with the time-evolution of unsteady flow features (e.g. recirculation zones, shear layers) in the domain. To address the goal of unstructured mesh compatibility, the autoencoding architecture utilizes a series of multi-scale message passing (MMP) layers, each of which models information exchange among node neighborhoods at various lengthscales. The MMP layer, which augments standard single-scale message passing with learnable coarsening operations, allows the decoder to more efficiently reconstruct the flowfield from the identified regions in the masked fields. Analysis of latent graphs produced by the autoencoder for various model settings are conducted using using unstructured snapshot data sourced from large-eddy simulations in a backward-facing step (BFS) flow configuration with an OpenFOAM-based flow solver at high Reynolds numbers.

As a result, HD maps are costly and time-consuming to obtain, while navigation maps with near-global coverage are freely available. We describe an approach to integrate navigation maps into learning-based motion prediction models. To exploit locally available HD maps during training, we additionally propose a model-agnostic method for knowledge distillation. In experiments on the publicly available Argoverse dataset with navigation maps obtained from OpenStreetMap, our approach shows a significant improvement over not using a map at all. Combined with our method for knowledge distillation, we achieve results that are close to the original HD map-reliant models.

In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a fully unsupervised real-time drift detection algorithm named DynAmo, which can identify drift periods as they are happening. DynAmo comprises a dynamic clustering component to capture the overall trends of monitored behaviours and a trajectory generation component, which extracts features from the densest cluster centroids.

Knowledge graph embeddings map nodes into a vector space to predict new links, scoring them according to geometric criteria. Relations in the graph may follow patterns that can be learned, e.g., some relations might be symmetric and others might be hierarchical. However, the learning capability of different embedding models varies for each pattern and, so far, no single model can learn all patterns equally well. In this paper, we combine the query representations from several models in a unified one to incorporate patterns that are independently captured by each model. Our combination uses attention to select the most suitable model to answer each query. The models are also mapped onto a non-Euclidean manifold, the Poincar\\'e ball, to capture structural patterns, such as hierarchies, besides relational patterns, such as symmetry. We prove that our combination provides a higher expressiveness and inference power than each model on its own. As a result, the combined model can learn relational and structural patterns. We conduct extensive experimental analysis with various link prediction benchmarks showing that the combined model outperforms individual models, including state-of-the-art approaches. ",

Because of these issues, Clos networks are considered as promising alternatives for constructing large-scale ROADMs and all-optical DCNs. In this article, we look at a next-generation Clos-based ROADM architecture and show that it indeed provides better blocking performance with lower element and fiber complexities compared with a traditional Spanke-based ROADM architecture.

    "abstract": "Fault detection and diagnosis is significant for reducing maintenance costs and improving health and safety in chemical processes. Convolution neural network (CNN) is a popular deep learning algorithm with many successful applications in chemical fault detection and diagnosis tasks. However, convolution layers in CNN are very sensitive to the order of features, which can lead to instability in the processing of tabular data. Optimal order of features result in better performance of CNN models but it is expensive to seek such optimal order. In addition, because of the encapsulation mechanism of feature extraction, most CNN models are opaque and have poor interpretability, thus failing to identify root-cause features without human supervision. These difficulties inevitably limit the performance and credibility of CNN methods. In this paper, we propose an order-invariant and interpretable hierarchical dilated convolution neural network (HDLCNN), which is composed by feature clustering, dilated convolution and the shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method. The novelty of HDLCNN lies in its capability of processing tabular data with features of arbitrary order without seeking the optimal order, due to the ability to agglomerate correlated features of feature clustering and the large receptive field of dilated convolution. Then, the proposed method provides interpretability by including the SHAP values to quantify feature contribution. Therefore, the root-cause features can be identified as the features with the highest contribution. Computational experiments are conducted on the Tennessee Eastman chemical process benchmark dataset. Compared with the other methods, the proposed HDLCNN-SHAP method achieves better performance on processing tabular data with features of arbitrary order, detecting faults, and identifying the root-cause features.

We then propose a novel regularization method, predecessor combination search (PCS), to improve calibration by searching a combination of best-fitting block predecessors, where block predecessors are the corresponding network blocks with weight parameters from earlier training stages.

But in the real world, the collected expert demonstrations are more likely to be imperfect, where only an unknown fraction of the demonstrations are optimal. Instead of treating imperfect expert demonstrations as absolutely positive or negative, we investigate unlabeled imperfect expert demonstrations as they are. A positive-unlabeled adversarial imitation learning algorithm is developed to dynamically sample expert demonstrations that can well match the trajectories from the constantly optimized agent policy. The trajectories of an initial agent policy could be closer to those non-optimal expert demonstrations, but within the framework of adversarial imitation learning, agent policy will be optimized to cheat the discriminator and produce trajectories that are similar to those optimal expert demonstrations. Theoretical analysis shows that our method learns from the imperfect demonstrations via a self-paced way.

However, optimizing the performance of DNNs requires careful tuning of multiple hyperparameters and network parameters via training. High-performance DNNs utilize a large number of parameters, corresponding to high energy consumption during training. To address these limitations, researchers have developed spiking neural networks (SNNs), which are more energy-efficient and can process data in a biologically plausible manner, making them well-suited for tasks involving sensory data processing, i.e., neuromorphic data. Like DNNs, SNNs are vulnerable to various threats, such as adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. Yet, the attacks and countermeasures for SNNs have been almost fully unexplored. This paper investigates the application of backdoor attacks in SNNs using neuromorphic datasets and different triggers. More precisely, backdoor triggers in neuromorphic data can change their position and color, allowing a larger range of possibilities than common triggers in, e.g., the image domain. We propose different attacks achieving up to 100\\% attack success rate without noticeable clean accuracy degradation. We also evaluate the stealthiness of the attacks via the structural similarity metric, showing our most powerful attacks being also stealthy. Finally, we adapt the state-of-the-art defenses from the image domain, demonstrating they are not necessarily effective for neuromorphic data resulting in inaccurate performance. ",

The goal in strategic classification is therefore to train predictive models that are robust to such behavior. However, the conventional framework assumes that changing features does not change actual outcomes, which depicts users as \"gaming\" the system. Here we remove this assumption, and study learning in a causal strategic setting where true outcomes do change. Focusing on accuracy as our primary objective, we show how strategic behavior and causal effects underlie two complementing forms of distribution shift. We characterize these shifts, and propose a learning algorithm that balances between these two forces and over time, and permits end-to-end training. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrate the utility of our approach. ",

This work addresses the object detection task in 3D point clouds using a highly efficient, surface-biased, feature extraction method (wang2022rbgnet), that also captures contextual cues on multiple levels. We propose a 3D object detector that extracts accurate feature representations of object candidates and leverages self-attention on point patches, object candidates, and on the global scene in 3D scene. Self-attention is proven to be effective in encoding correlation information in 3D point clouds by (xie2020mlcvnet). While other 3D detectors focus on enhancing point cloud feature extraction by selectively obtaining more meaningful local features (wang2022rbgnet) where contextual information is overlooked. To this end, the proposed architecture uses ray-based surface-biased feature extraction and multi-level context encoding to outperform the state-of-the-art 3D object detector. In this work, 3D detection experiments are performed on scenes from the ScanNet dataset whereby the self-attention modules are introduced one after the other to isolate the effect of self-attention at each level.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the World Wide Web (WWW), heterogeneous graphs (HG) have explosive growth. Recently, heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) has shown great potential in learning on HG. Current studies of HGNN mainly focus on some HGs with strong homophily properties (nodes connected by meta-path tend to have the same labels), while few discussions are made in those that are less homophilous. Recently, there have been many works on homogeneous graphs with heterophily. However, due to heterogeneity, it is non-trivial to extend their approach to deal with HGs with heterophily. In this work, based on empirical observations, we propose a meta-path-induced metric to measure the homophily degree of a HG. We also find that current HGNNs may have degenerated performance when handling HGs with less homophilous properties. Thus it is essential to increase the generalization ability of HGNNs on non-homophilous HGs. To this end, we propose HDHGR, a homophily-oriented deep heterogeneous graph rewiring approach that modifies the HG structure to increase the performance of HGNN. We theoretically verify HDHGR. In addition, experiments on real-world HGs demonstrate the effectiveness of HDHGR, which brings at most more than 10% relative gain. ",

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering based recommendation learns users' preferences from all users' historical behavior data, and has been popular to facilitate decision making. R Recently, the fairness issue of recommendation has become more and more essential. A recommender system is considered unfair when it does not perform equally well for different user groups according to users' sensitive attributes~(e.g., gender, race). Plenty of methods have been proposed to alleviate unfairness by optimizing a predefined fairness goal or changing the distribution of unbalanced training data. However, they either suffered from the specific fairness optimization metrics or relied on redesigning the current recommendation architecture. In this paper, we study how to improve recommendation fairness from the data augmentation perspective. The recommendation model amplifies the inherent unfairness of imbalanced training data. We augment imbalanced training data towards balanced data distribution to improve fairness. The proposed framework is generally applicable to any embedding-based recommendation, and does not need to pre-define a fairness metric. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework. We publish the source code at https://github.com/newlei/FDA. ",

To date, CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) achieved state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal learning tasks due to its efficient learning of visual concepts from natural language supervision. However, CLIP learns visual representations from natural language at a global level without the capability of focusing on image-object relations. This paper proposes a novel CLIP-based network for Relation Reasoning, CLIP-RR, that tackles relation-focused cross-modal information retrieval. The proposed network utilises CLIP to leverage its pre-trained knowledge, and it additionally comprises two main parts: (1) extends the capabilities of CLIP to extract and reason with object relations in images; and (2) aggregates the reasoned results for predicting the similarity scores between images and descriptions. Experiments were carried out by applying the proposed network to relation-focused cross-modal information retrieval tasks on the RefCOCOg, CLEVR, and Flickr30K datasets. The results revealed that the proposed network outperformed various other state-of-the-art networks including CLIP, VSE$\\infty$, and VSRN++ on both image-to-text and text-to-image cross-modal information retrieval tasks.

In practice, these differences manifest in significantly diverging performances on different types of graph classes. We engineer a preprocessor for symmetry detection. The result is a tool designed to shrink sparse, large substructures of the input graph. On most of the practical instances, the overall running time improves significantly for many of the state-of-the-art solvers. At the same time, our benchmarks show that the additional overhead is negligible. Overall we obtain single algorithms with competitive performance across all benchmark graphs. As such the preprocessor bridges the disparity between solvers that focus on combinatorial graphs and large practical graphs.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest types of cancer, with 25% of the diagnosed patients surviving for only one year and 6% of them for five. Computed tomography (CT) screening trials have played a key role in improving early detection of pancreatic cancer, which has shown significant improvement in patient survival rates. However, advanced analysis of such images often requires manual segmentation of the pancreas, which is a time-consuming task. Moreover, pancreas presents high variability in shape, while occupying only a very small area of the entire abdominal CT scans, which increases the complexity of the problem. The rapid development of deep learning can contribute to offering robust algorithms that provide inexpensive, accurate, and user-independent segmentation results that can guide the domain experts. This dissertation addresses this task by investigating a two-step approach for pancreas segmentation, by assisting the task with a prior rough localization or detection of pancreas. This rough localization of the pancreas is provided by an estimated probability map and the detection task is achieved by using the YOLOv4 deep learning algorithm. The segmentation task is tackled by a modified U-Net model applied on cropped data, as well as by using a morphological active contours algorithm. For comparison, the U-Net model was also applied on the full CT images, which provide a coarse pancreas segmentation to serve as reference. Experimental results of the detection network on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) dataset and the pancreas tumour task dataset within the Medical Segmentation Decathlon show 50.67% mean Average Precision. The best segmentation network achieved good segmentation results on the NIH dataset, reaching 67.67% Dice score. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting the dimensionality of graphs is a central topic in machine learning. While the problem has been tackled empirically as well as theoretically, existing methods have several drawbacks. On the one hand, empirical tools are computationally heavy and lack theoretical foundation. On the other hand, theoretical approaches do not apply to graphs with heterogeneous degree distributions, which is often the case for complex real-world networks. To address these drawbacks, we consider geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs) as a random graph model, which captures a variety of properties observed in practice. These include a heterogeneous degree distribution and non-vanishing clustering coefficient, which is the probability that two random neighbours of a vertex are adjacent. In GIRGs, $n$ vertices are distributed on a $d$-dimensional torus and weights are assigned to the vertices according to a power-law distribution. Two vertices are then connected with a probability that depends on their distance and their weights. Our first result shows that the clustering coefficient of GIRGs scales inverse exponentially with respect to the number of dimensions, when the latter is at most logarithmic in $n$. This gives a first theoretical explanation for the low dimensionality of real-world networks observed by Almagro et. al. [Nature '22]. Our second result is a linear-time algorithm for determining the dimensionality of a given GIRG. We prove that our algorithm returns the correct number of dimensions with high probability when the input is a GIRG. As a result, our algorithm bridges the gap between theory and practice, as it not only comes with a rigorous proof of correctness but also yields results comparable to that of prior empirical approaches, as indicated by our experiments on real-world instances.

To address this challenge, we present a computationally efficient approach for post-hoc uncertainty quantification in dynamic neural networks. We show that adequately quantifying and accounting for both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty through a probabilistic treatment of the last layers improves the predictive performance and aids decision-making when determining the computational budget.

It was proved that over all graphs with $N$ nodes, complete graphs have the minimum cover time $N\\log N$. However, complete graphs cannot mimic real-world networks with small average degree and scale-free small-world properties, for which the cover time has not been examined carefully, and its behavior is still not well understood. In this paper, we first experimentally evaluate the cover time for various real-world networks with scale-free small-world properties, which scales as $N\\log N$. To better understand the behavior of the cover time for real-world networks, we then study the cover time of three scale-free small-world model networks by using the connection between cover time and resistance diameter. For all the three networks, their cover time also behaves as $N\\log N$. This work indicates that sparse networks with scale-free and small-world topology are favorable architectures with optimal scaling of cover time. Our results deepen understanding the behavior of cover time in real-world networks with scale-free small-world structure, and have potential implications in the design of efficient algorithms related to cover time.

BNNs convert CNN model parameters to 1-bit precision, allowing inference of BNNs to be processed with simple XNOR and bitcount operations. This makes BNNs amenable to hardware acceleration. Several photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based BNN accelerators have been proposed. Although these accelerators provide remarkably higher throughput and energy efficiency than their electronic counterparts, the utilized XNOR and bitcount circuits in these accelerators need to be further enhanced to improve their area, energy efficiency, and throughput. This paper aims to fulfill this need. For that, we invent a single-MRR-based optical XNOR gate (OXG). Moreover, we present a novel design of bitcount circuit which we refer to as Photo-Charge Accumulator (PCA). We employ multiple OXGs in a cascaded manner using dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) and connect them to the PCA, to forge a novel Optical XNOR-Bitcount based Binary Neural Network Accelerator (OXBNN). Our evaluation for the inference of four modern BNNs indicates that OXBNN provides improvements of up to 62x and 7.6x in frames-per-second (FPS) and FPS/W (energy efficiency), respectively, on geometric mean over two PIC-based BNN accelerators from prior work.

    "abstract": "Constraint solving is an elementary way for verification of deep neural networks (DNN). In the domain of AI safety, a DNN might be modified in its structure and parameters for its repair or attack. For such situations, we propose the incremental DNN verification problem, which asks whether a safety property still holds after the DNN is modified. To solve the problem, we present an incremental satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) algorithm based on the Reluplex framework. We simulate the most important features of the configurations that infers the verification result of the searching branches in the old solving procedure (with respect to the original network), and heuristically check whether the proofs are still valid for the modified DNN. We implement our algorithm as an incremental solver called DeepInc, and exerimental results show that DeepInc is more efficient in most cases. For the cases that the property holds both before and after modification, the acceleration can be faster by several orders of magnitude, showing that DeepInc is outstanding in incrementally searching for counterexamples. Moreover, based on the framework, we propose the multi-objective DNN repair problem and give an algorithm based on our incremental SMT solving algorithm. Our repair method preserves more potential safety properties on the repaired DNNs compared with state-of-the-art. ",

    "abstract": "Enabling dexterous manipulation and safe human-robot interaction, soft robots are widely used in numerous surgical applications. One of the complications associated with using soft robots in surgical applications is reconstructing their shape and the external force exerted on them. Several sensor-based and model-based approaches have been proposed to address the issue. In this paper, a shape sensing technique based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is proposed. The performance of this sensing technique in predicting the tip position and contact force of a soft bending actuator is highlighted by conducting a series of empirical tests. The predictions were performed based on a data-driven approach using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. The tip position predictions indicate the importance of using EIT data along with pressure inputs. Changing the number of EIT channels, we evaluated the effect of the number of EIT inputs on the accuracy of the predictions. The least RMSE values for the tip position are 3.6 and 4.6 mm in Y and Z coordinates, respectively, which are 7.36% and 6.07% of the actuator's total range of motion. Contact force predictions were conducted in three different bending angles and by varying the number of EIT channels. The results of the predictions illustrated that increasing the number of channels contributes to higher accuracy of the force estimation. The mean errors of using 8 channels are 7.69%, 2.13%, and 2.96% of the total force range in three different bending angles. ",

Continuous monitoring is a possible way for early detection. However, it is somehow fundamental to be able to actually simulate failures. Reproducing the issues remotely allows to quantify in advance their consequences, causing literally no real damage. Within this context, signed directed graphs have played an essential role within the years, managing to model with a relatively simple theory diverse elements of an industrial network, as well as the logic relations between them.\\\\ In this work we present a quantitative approach, employing directed graphs to the simulation and automatic reconfiguration of a fault in a network. To model the typical operation of industrial plants, we propose several additions with respect to the standard graphs: 1. a quantitative measure to control the overall residual capacity, 2. nodes of different categories - and then different behaviors - and 3. a fault propagation procedure based on the predecessors and the redundancy of the system. The obtained graph is able to mimic the behaviour of the real target plant when one or more faults occur. Additionally, we also implement a generative approach capable to activate a particular category of nodes in order to contain the issue propagation, equipping the network with the capability of reconfigure itself and resulting then in a mathematical tool useful not only for simulating and monitoring, but also to design and optimize complex plants. The final asset of the system is provided in output with its complete diagnostics, and a detailed description of the steps that have been carried out to obtain the final realization. ",

These sensors operate with asynchronous pixels, emitting events, or \"spikes\", when the luminance change at a given pixel since the last event surpasses a certain threshold. Thanks to their inherent qualities, such as their low power consumption, low latency and high dynamic range, they seem particularly tailored to applications with challenging temporal constraints and safety requirements. Event-based sensors are an excellent fit for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), since the coupling of an asynchronous sensor with neuromorphic hardware can yield real-time systems with minimal power requirements. In this work, we seek to develop one such system, using both event sensor data from the DSEC dataset and spiking neural networks to estimate optical flow for driving scenarios. We propose a U-Net-like SNN which, after supervised training, is able to make dense optical flow estimations. To do so, we encourage both minimal norm for the error vector and minimal angle between ground-truth and predicted flow, training our model with back-propagation using a surrogate gradient. In addition, the use of 3d convolutions allows us to capture the dynamic nature of the data by increasing the temporal receptive fields. Upsampling after each decoding stage ensures that each decoder's output contributes to the final estimation. Thanks to separable convolutions, we have been able to develop a light model (when compared to competitors) that can nonetheless yield reasonably accurate optical flow estimates. ",

Existing works on 3D object detection from a single image either pursue this goal through independent predictions of each object or implicitly reason over all possible objects, failing to harness relational geometric information between objects. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic sparse graph pipeline named Explicit3D based on object geometry and semantics features. Taking the efficiency into consideration, we further define a relatedness score and design a novel dynamic pruning algorithm followed by a cluster sampling method for sparse scene graph generation and updating. Furthermore, our Explicit3D introduces homogeneous matrices and defines new relative loss and corner loss to model the spatial difference between target pairs explicitly. Instead of using ground-truth labels as direct supervision, our relative and corner loss are derived from the homogeneous transformation, which renders the model to learn the geometric consistency between objects. The experimental results on the SUN RGB-D dataset demonstrate that our Explicit3D achieves better performance balance than the-state-of-the-art. ",

    "abstract": "A growing literature on human-AI decision-making investigates strategies for combining human judgment with statistical models to improve decision-making. Research in this area often evaluates proposed improvements to models, interfaces, or workflows by demonstrating improved predictive performance on \"ground truth\" labels. However, this practice overlooks a key difference between human judgments and model predictions. Whereas humans reason about broader phenomena of interest in a decision - including latent constructs that are not directly observable, such as disease status, the \"toxicity\" of online comments, or future \"job performance\" - predictive models target proxy labels that are readily available in existing datasets. Predictive models' reliance on simplistic proxies makes them vulnerable to various sources of statistical bias. In this paper, we identify five sources of target variable bias that can impact the validity of proxy labels in human-AI decision-making tasks. We develop a causal framework to disentangle the relationship between each bias and clarify which are of concern in specific human-AI decision-making tasks. We demonstrate how our framework can be used to articulate implicit assumptions made in prior modeling work, and we recommend evaluation strategies for verifying whether these assumptions hold in practice. We then leverage our framework to re-examine the designs of prior human subjects experiments that investigate human-AI decision-making, finding that only a small fraction of studies examine factors related to target variable bias. We conclude by discussing opportunities to better address target variable bias in future research. ",

The proposed approach advocates using classical first-order variational constraints for this problem. While state-of-the-art deep neural network methods for SIDP learn the scene depth from images in a supervised setting, they often overlook the invaluable invariances and priors in the rigid scene space, such as the regularity of the scene. The paper's main contribution is to reveal the benefit of classical and well-founded variational constraints in the neural network design for the SIDP task. It is shown that imposing first-order variational constraints in the scene space together with popular encoder-decoder-based network architecture design provides excellent results for the supervised SIDP task. The imposed first-order variational constraint makes the network aware of the depth gradient in the scene space, i.e., regularity. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approach via extensive evaluation and ablation analysis over several benchmark datasets, such as KITTI, NYU Depth V2, and SUN RGB-D. The VA-DepthNet at test time shows considerable improvements in depth prediction accuracy compared to the prior art and is accurate also at high-frequency regions in the scene space. At the time of writing this paper, our method -- labeled as VA-DepthNet, when tested on the KITTI depth-prediction evaluation set benchmarks, shows state-of-the-art results, and is the top-performing published approach.

Currently, conventional medical imaging modalities are not able to accurately acquire high-resolution hemodynamic information that would be required to assess complex neurovascular pathologies. Therefore, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can be applied to tomographic reconstructions to obtain clinically relevant information. However, three-dimensional (3D) CFD simulations require enormous computational resources and simulation-related expert knowledge that are usually not available in clinical environments. Recently, deep-learning-based methods have been proposed as CFD surrogates to improve computational efficiency. Nevertheless, the prediction of high-resolution transient CFD simulations for complex vascular geometries poses a challenge to conventional deep learning models. In this work, we present an architecture that is tailored to predict high-resolution (spatial and temporal) velocity fields for complex synthetic vascular geometries. For this, an octree-based spatial discretization is combined with an implicit neural function representation to efficiently handle the prediction of the 3D velocity field for each time step. The presented method is evaluated for the task of cerebral hemodynamics prediction before and during the injection of contrast agent in the internal carotid artery (ICA). Compared to CFD simulations, the velocity field can be estimated with a mean absolute error of 0.024 m/s, whereas the run time reduces from several hours on a high-performance cluster to a few seconds on a consumer graphical processing unit.

In particular, we propose the EnergyShield framework, which repurposes a controller ''shield'' as a low-power runtime safety monitor for the ADS vehicle. Specifically, the shield in EnergyShield provides not only safety interventions but also a formal, state-based quantification of the tolerable edge response time before vehicle safety is compromised. Using EnergyShield, an ADS can then save energy by wirelessly offloading NN computations to edge computers, while still maintaining a formal guarantee of safety until it receives a response (on-vehicle hardware provides a just-in-time fail safe). To validate the benefits of EnergyShield, we implemented and tested it in the Carla simulation environment. Our results show that EnergyShield maintains safe vehicle operation while providing significant energy savings compared to on-vehicle NN evaluation: from 24% to 54% less energy across a range of wireless conditions and edge delays.

As each model family consists of pretrained models with diverse scales (e.g., DeiT-Ti/S/B), it naturally arises a fundamental question of how to effectively assemble these readily available models in a family for dynamic accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. In this work, we present Stitchable Neural Networks (SN-Net), a novel scalable and efficient framework for model deployment which cheaply produces numerous networks with different complexity and performance trade-offs. Specifically, SN-Net splits a family of pretrained neural networks, which we call anchors, across the blocks/layers and then stitches them together with simple stitching layers to map the activations from one anchor to another. With only a few epochs of training, SN-Net effectively interpolates between the performance of anchors with varying scales. At runtime, SN-Net can instantly adapt to dynamic resource constraints by switching the stitching positions. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive study on what, how and where to stitch as well as a simple strategy for effectively and efficiently training SN-Net. Extensive experiments on ImageNet classification demonstrate that SN-Net can obtain on-par or even better performance than many individually trained networks while supporting diverse deployment scenarios. For example, by stitching Swin Transformers, we challenge hundreds of models in Timm model zoo with a single network. We believe this new elastic model framework can serve as a strong baseline for further research in wider communities. ",

Weighting methods that directly incorporate covariate balancing have recently gained popularity for estimating causal effects in observational studies. These methods reduce the manual efforts required by researchers to iterate between propensity score modeling and balance checking until a satisfied covariate balance result. However, conventional solvers for determining weights lack the scalability to apply such methods on large scale datasets in companies like Snap Inc. To address the limitations and improve computational efficiency, in this paper we present scalable algorithms, DistEB and DistMS, for two balancing approaches: entropy balancing and MicroSynth. The solvers have linear time complexity and can be conveniently implemented in distributed computing frameworks such as Spark, Hive, etc. We study the properties of balancing approaches at different scales up to 1 million treated units and 487 covariates. We find that with larger sample size, both bias and variance in the causal effect estimation are significantly reduced. The results emphasize the importance of applying balancing approaches on large scale datasets. We combine the balancing approach with a synthetic control framework and deploy an end-to-end system for causal impact estimation at Snap Inc. ",

    "abstract": "Auditory attention decoding (AAD) is a technique used to identify and amplify the talker that a listener is focused on in a noisy environment. This is done by comparing the listener's brainwaves to a representation of all the sound sources to find the closest match. The representation is typically the waveform or spectrogram of the sounds. The effectiveness of these representations for AAD is uncertain. In this study, we examined the use of self-supervised learned speech representation in improving the accuracy and speed of AAD. We recorded the brain activity of three subjects using invasive electrocorticography (ECoG) as they listened to two conversations and focused on one. We used WavLM to extract a latent representation of each talker and trained a spatiotemporal filter to map brain activity to intermediate representations of speech. During the evaluation, the reconstructed representation is compared to each speaker's representation to determine the target speaker. Our results indicate that speech representation from WavLM provides better decoding accuracy and speed than the speech envelope and spectrogram. Our findings demonstrate the advantages of self-supervised learned speech representation for auditory attention decoding and pave the way for developing brain-controlled hearable technologies. ",

    "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a type of cancer that originates in the kidneys and is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. It can be classified into several subtypes, including clear cell RCC, papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC. In this study, an artificial intelligence model was developed and trained for classifying different subtypes of RCC using ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network that has been widely used for image classification tasks. The model was trained on a dataset of RCC histopathology images, which consisted of digital images of RCC surgical resection slides that were annotated with the corresponding subtype labels. The performance of the trained model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, in this research, a novel synthetic image generation tool, NephroNet, is developed on diffusion models that are used to generate original images of RCC surgical resection slides. Diffusion models are a class of generative models capable of synthesizing high-quality images from noise. Several diffusers such as Stable Diffusion, Dreambooth Text-to-Image, and Textual Inversion were trained on a dataset of RCC images and were used to generate a series of original images that resembled RCC surgical resection slides, all within the span of fewer than four seconds. The generated images were visually realistic and could be used for creating new training datasets, testing the performance of image analysis algorithms, and training medical professionals. NephroNet is provided as an open-source software package and contains files for data preprocessing, training, and visualization. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence and diffusion models for classifying and generating RCC images, respectively. These methods could be useful for improving the diagnosis and treatment of RCC and more. ",

We rigorously analyse the limiting dynamics via a deterministic and low-dimensional description in terms of the sufficient statistics for the population risk. Our unifying analysis bridges different regimes of interest, such as the classical gradient-flow regime of vanishing learning rate, the high-dimensional regime of large input dimension, and the overparameterised \"mean-field\" regime of large network width, covering as well the intermediate regimes where the limiting dynamics is determined by the interplay between these behaviours. In particular, in the high-dimensional limit, the infinite-width dynamics is found to remain close to a low-dimensional subspace spanned by the target principal directions. Our results therefore provide a unifying picture of the limiting SGD dynamics with synthetic data. ",

    "abstract": "Fraud detection is to identify, monitor, and prevent potentially fraudulent activities from complex data. The recent development and success in AI, especially machine learning, provides a new data-driven way to deal with fraud. From a methodological point of view, machine learning based fraud detection can be divided into two categories, i.e., conventional methods (decision tree, boosting...) and deep learning, both of which have significant limitations in terms of the lack of representation learning ability for the former and interpretability for the latter. Furthermore, due to the rarity of detected fraud cases, the associated data is usually imbalanced, which seriously degrades the performance of classification algorithms. In this paper, we propose deep boosting decision trees (DBDT), a novel approach for fraud detection based on gradient boosting and neural networks. In order to combine the advantages of both conventional methods and deep learning, we first construct soft decision tree (SDT), a decision tree structured model with neural networks as its nodes, and then ensemble SDTs using the idea of gradient boosting. In this way we embed neural networks into gradient boosting to improve its representation learning capability and meanwhile maintain the interpretability. Furthermore, aiming at the rarity of detected fraud cases, in the model training phase we propose a compositional AUC maximization approach to deal with data imbalances at algorithm level. Extensive experiments on several real-life fraud detection datasets show that DBDT can significantly improve the performance and meanwhile maintain good interpretability.

To begin, using SLT, we lay to rest some of the confusion surrounding discrepancies between downstream predictive performance measured via e.g., the test log predictive density, and the variational objective. Next, we use the SLT-corrected asymptotic form for singular posterior distributions to inform the design of the variational family itself. Specifically, we build upon the idealized variational family introduced in \\citet{bhattacharya_evidence_2020} which is theoretically appealing but practically intractable. Our proposal takes shape as a normalizing flow where the base distribution is a carefully-initialized generalized gamma. We conduct experiments comparing this to the canonical Gaussian base distribution and show improvements in terms of variational free energy and variational generalization error. ",

The prediction of pairwise structural proximity between each nucleotide of an RNA sequence can characterize the structural information of the RNA. Historically, this problem has been tackled by machine learning models using expert-engineered features and trained on scarce labeled datasets. Here, we find that the knowledge learned by a protein-coevolution Transformer-based deep neural network can be transferred to the RNA contact prediction task. As protein datasets are orders of magnitude larger than those for RNA contact prediction, our findings and the subsequent framework greatly reduce the data scarcity bottleneck. Experiments confirm that RNA contact prediction through transfer learning using a publicly available protein model is greatly improved. Our findings indicate that the learned structural patterns of proteins can be transferred to RNAs, opening up potential new avenues for research. ",

The authors who introduced the general position problem stated that the general position problem for butterfly networks was open. A well-known technique to solve the general position problem for a given network is to use its isometric path cover number as an upper bound. The general position problem for butterfly networks remained open because this technique is not applicable for butterfly networks. In this paper, we adopt a new technique which uses the isometric cycle cover number as its upper bound. This technique is interesting and useful because it opens new avenues to solve the general position problem for networks which do not have solutions yet. ",

    "abstract": "Formalizing surgical activities as triplets of the used instruments, actions performed, and target anatomies is becoming a gold standard approach for surgical activity modeling. The benefit is that this formalization helps to obtain a more detailed understanding of tool-tissue interaction which can be used to develop better Artificial Intelligence assistance for image-guided surgery. Earlier efforts and the CholecTriplet challenge introduced in 2021 have put together techniques aimed at recognizing these triplets from surgical footage. Estimating also the spatial locations of the triplets would offer a more precise intraoperative context-aware decision support for computer-assisted intervention. This paper presents the CholecTriplet2022 challenge, which extends surgical action triplet modeling from recognition to detection. It includes weakly-supervised bounding box localization of every visible surgical instrument (or tool), as the key actors, and the modeling of each tool-activity in the form of <instrument, verb, target> triplet. The paper describes a baseline method and 10 new deep learning algorithms presented at the challenge to solve the task. It also provides thorough methodological comparisons of the methods, an in-depth analysis of the obtained results, their significance, and useful insights for future research directions and applications in surgery.

The dual-frequency temporal phase unwrapping method (DF-TPU) is one of the prominent technologies to achieve this goal.

Deep-learning-based phase unwrapping methods for single-camera FPP usually require labeled data for training. In this letter, a novel self-supervised phase unwrapping method for single-camera FPP systems is proposed. The trained network can retrieve the absolute fringe order from one phase map of 64-period and overperform DF-TPU approaches in terms of depth accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the validation of the proposed method on real scenes of motion blur, isolated objects, low reflectivity, and phase discontinuity. ",

The ability to identify such domains enables the ability to find the confidence level of each prediction, to determine when and how the model should be employed depending on the prediction accuracy requirements of different tasks, and to improve the model for domains with high errors.

Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is a widely applied risk measure to address risk-averseness of the decision-makers. In this paper, we use the subset-based polyhedral representation of the CVaR to reformulate the bi-objective two-stage stochastic facility location problem presented in Nazemi et al. (2021). We propose an approximate cutting-plane method to deal with this more computationally challenging subset-based formulation. Then, the cutting plane method is embedded into the epsilon-constraint method, the balanced-box method, and a recently developed matheuristic method to address the bi-objective nature of the problem. Our computational results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we discuss how incorporating an approximation of the subset-based polyhedral formulation affects the obtained solutions. ",
