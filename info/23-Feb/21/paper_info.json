    "title": "Causal Confirmation Measures: From Simpson's Paradox to COVID-19",
    "abstract": "When we compare the influences of two causes on an outcome, if the conclusion from every group is against that from the conflation, we think there is Simpson's Paradox. The Existing Causal Inference Theory (ECIT) can make the overall conclusion consistent with the grouping conclusion by removing the confounder's influence to eliminate the paradox. The ECIT uses relative risk difference Pd = max(0, (R - 1)/R) (R denotes the risk ratio) as the probability of causation. In contrast, Philosopher Fitelson uses confirmation measure D (posterior probability minus prior probability) to measure the strength of causation. Fitelson concludes that from the perspective of Bayesian confirmation, we should directly accept the overall conclusion without considering the paradox. The author proposed a Bayesian confirmation measure b* similar to Pd before. To overcome the contradiction between the ECIT and Bayesian confirmation, the author uses the semantic information method with the minimum cross-entropy criterion to deduce causal confirmation measure Cc = (R -1)/max(R, 1). Cc is like Pd but has normalizing property (between -1 and 1) and cause symmetry. It especially fits cases where a cause restrains an outcome, such as the COVID-19 vaccine controlling the infection. Some examples (about kidney stone treatments and COVID-19) reveal that Pd and Cc are more reasonable than D; Cc is more useful than Pd. ",

When humans are assisted by a tool or automation to perform the same task, performance is enhanced (augmented). Recently developed cognitive systems are able to perform cognitive processing at or above the level of a human in some domains. When humans work collaboratively with such cogs in a human/cog ensemble, we expect augmentation of cognitive processing to be evident and measurable. This paper shows the degree of cognitive augmentation depends on the nature of the information the cog contributes to the ensemble. Results of an experiment are reported showing conceptual information is the most effective type of information resulting in increases in cognitive accuracy, cognitive precision, and cognitive power.

    "abstract": "There is a growing need for models that are interpretable and have reduced energy and computational cost (e.g., in health care analytics and federated learning). Examples of algorithms to train such models include logistic regression and boosting. However, one challenge facing these algorithms is that they provably suffer from label noise; this has been attributed to the joint interaction between oft-used convex loss functions and simpler hypothesis classes, resulting in too much emphasis being placed on outliers. In this work, we use the margin-based $\\alpha$-loss, which continuously tunes between canonical convex and quasi-convex losses, to robustly train simple models. We show that the $\\alpha$ hyperparameter smoothly introduces non-convexity and offers the benefit of \"giving up\" on noisy training examples. We also provide results on the Long-Servedio dataset for boosting and a COVID-19 survey dataset for logistic regression, highlighting the efficacy of our approach across multiple relevant domains. ",

Due to the variability in person posture, different lighting conditions, and occluded scenarios, together with the poor quality of the images obtained by different cameras, it is currently an unsolved problem. In machine learning-based computer vision applications with reduced data sets, one possibility to improve the performance of re-identification system is through the augmentation of the set of images or videos available for training the neural models. Currently, one of the most robust ways to generate synthetic information for data augmentation, whether it is video, images or text, are the generative adversarial networks. This article reviews the most relevant recent approaches to improve the performance of person re-identification models through data augmentation, using generative adversarial networks. We focus on three categories of data augmentation approaches: style transfer, pose transfer, and random generation. ",

While automatic story generation has advanced recently, it is treated as a \"toy task\" for advancing artificial intelligence rather than helping people. In this paper, we create a system that produces a short description that narrates a predicted plot using existing story generation approaches. Our goal is to assist writers in crafting a consistent and compelling story arc. We conducted experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to examine the quality of the generated story plots in terms of consistency and storiability. The results show that short descriptions produced by our frame-enhanced GPT-2 (FGPT-2) were rated as the most consistent and storiable among all models; FGPT-2's outputs even beat some random story snippets written by humans. Next, we conducted a preliminary user study using a story continuation task where AMT workers were given access to machine-generated story plots and asked to write a follow-up story. FGPT-2 could positively affect the writing process, though people favor other baselines more. Our study shed some light on the possibilities of future creative writing support systems beyond the scope of completing sentences.

Their interaction opens a new route to amortized marginal likelihood and posterior predictive estimation -- two important ingredients of Bayesian workflows that are often too expensive for standard methods. We benchmark the fidelity of JANA on a variety of simulation models against state-of-the-art Bayesian methods and propose a powerful and interpretable diagnostic for joint calibration. In addition, we investigate the ability of recurrent likelihood networks to emulate complex time series models without resorting to hand-crafted summary statistics. ",

We consider settings where a limited resource is shared among a set of agents, each of whom may request to use the resource over multiple consecutive rounds, receiving some utility only if they get to use the resource for the full duration of their request. Such settings are of particular significance in scientific research where large-scale instruments such as electron microscopes, particle colliders, and telescopes are shared between multiple research groups; this model also subsumes and extends existing models of repeated non-monetary allocation where resources are required for a single round only. We study a simple pseudo-market mechanism where upfront we endow each agent with some budget of artificial credits, with the budget proportion reflecting the fair share of the resource we want the agent to receive. The endowments thus define for each agent her ideal utility as that which she derives from her favorite allocation with no competition, but subject to getting at most her fair share of the items across rounds. Next, on each round, and for each available item, our mechanism runs a first-price auction with a selective reserve, wherein each agent submits a desired duration and per-round-bid (which must be at least the reserve price), and the highest bidder gets to use the item for the desired duration. We consider this problem in a Bayesian setting and show that under a carefully chosen reserve price, irrespective of how others bid, each agent has a strategy that guarantees her a $1/2$ fraction of her ideal utility in expectation. We also show this result is tight, i.e., there is no mechanism that can guarantee that all agents get more than half of their ideal utility. ",

As datasets grow larger, it becomes crucial to identify the examples that contribute the most to learning such representations.

In this work, we address this for the first time, by proving that examples that contribute the most to contrastive SSL are those that have the most similar augmentations to other examples, in expectation. We provide rigorous guarantees for the generalization performance of SSL on such subsets. Empirically, we discover, perhaps surprisingly, the subsets that contribute the most to SSL are those that contribute the least to supervised learning. Through extensive experiments, we show that our subsets outperform random subsets by more than 3% on CIFAR100, CIFAR10, and STL10. Interestingly, we also find that we can safely exclude 20% of examples from CIFAR100 and 40% from STL10, without affecting downstream task performance. ",

It is therefore of practical importance to developdetection methods for synthetic human voices. This work proposes a new approach to detect synthetic human voices based on identifying artifacts of neural vocoders in audio signals. A neural vocoder is a specially designed neural network that synthesizes waveforms from temporal-frequency representations, e.g., mel-spectrograms. The neural vocoder is a core component in most DeepFake audio synthesis models. Hence the identification of neural vocoder processing implies that an audio sample may have been synthesized. To take advantage of the vocoder artifacts for synthetic human voice detection, we introduce a multi-task learning framework for a binary-class RawNet2 model that shares the front-end feature extractor with a vocoder identification module. We treat the vocoder identification as a pretext task to constrain the front-end feature extractor to focus on vocoder artifacts and provide discriminative features for the final binary classifier. Our experiments show that the improved RawNet2 model based on vocoder identification achieves an overall high classification performance on the binary task. ",

Unfortunately, this can become computationally intractable in complex environments, such as those modeled using neural networks. Approximate posterior samples can produce effective actions, but only if they reasonably approximate joint predictive distributions of outputs across inputs. Notably, accuracy of marginal predictive distributions does not suffice. Epistemic neural networks (ENNs) are designed to produce accurate joint predictive distributions. We compare a range of ENNs through computational experiments that assess their performance in approximating TS across bandit and reinforcement learning environments. The results indicate that ENNs serve this purpose well and illustrate how the quality of joint predictive distributions drives performance. Further, we demonstrate that the \\textit{epinet} -- a small additive network that estimates uncertainty -- matches the performance of large ensembles at orders of magnitude lower computational cost.

These applications are commonly deployed on edge devices to promptly interact with the environment, and often require near real-time response. With limited computation power, it is challenging to execute 3D detection on the edge using highly complex neural networks. Common approaches such as offloading to the cloud brings latency overheads due to the large amount of 3D point cloud data during transmission. To resolve the tension between wimpy edge devices and compute-intensive inference workloads, we explore the possibility of transforming fast 2D detection results to extrapolate 3D bounding boxes. To this end, we present Moby, a novel system that demonstrates the feasibility and potential of our approach. Our main contributions are two-fold: First, we design a 2D-to-3D transformation pipeline that takes as input the point cloud data from LiDAR and 2D bounding boxes from camera that are captured at exactly the same time, and generate 3D bounding boxes efficiently and accurately based on detection results of the previous frames without running 3D detectors. Second, we design a frame offloading scheduler that dynamically launches a 3D detection when the error of 2D-to-3D transformation accumulates to a certain level, so the subsequent transformations can draw upon the latest 3D detection results with better accuracy. Extensive evaluation on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 with the autonomous driving dataset KITTI and real-world 4G/LTE traces shows that, Moby reduces the end-to-end latency by up to 91.9% with mild accuracy drop compared to baselines. Further, Moby shows excellent energy efficiency by saving power consumption and memory footprint up to 75.7% and 48.1%, respectively. ",

The different low-rank representations are utilized in the microscopic velocity for the BGK and quadratic collision model, resulting in a significant reduction in the degree of freedom.

For the quadratic collision model, a data-driven, SVD-based linear basis is built based on the BGK solution. All these will significantly improve the efficiency of the network when solving Boltzmann equation. Moreover, the specially designed adaptive-weight loss function is proposed with the strategies as multi-scale input and Maxwellian splitting applied to further enhance the approximation efficiency and speed up the learning process.

For auctions in social networks, items are needed to be sold to agents in a network, where each agent can bid and also diffuse the sale information to her neighbors. Thus, the agents' social relations are intervened with their bids in the auctions. In network auctions, the classical VCG mechanism fails to retain key properties. In order to better understand network auctions, in this paper, we characterize network auctions for the single-unit setting with respect to IR, WBB, IC, SWM, and other properties. For example, we present sufficient conditions for mechanisms to be social welfare maximizing and (weakly) incentive compatible. With the help of these properties and new concepts such as rewards, participation rewards, and so on, we show how to design SWM mechanisms to satisfy IC as much as possible, and IC mechanisms to maximize the revenue.

In particular, the eavesdropper in this system works in full-duplex (FD) mode and he will eavesdrop on the confidential message (CM) as well as send malicious jamming. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate (SR) by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming, transmit beamforming and phase shift matrix (PSM) of HR-IRS. Since the optimization problem is un-convex and the variables are coupled to each other, we solve this problem by iteratively optimizing these variables. The receive beamforming and transmit beamforming are obtained based on generalized Rayleigh-Ritz theorem and Dinkelbach's Transform respectively. And for PSM, two methods, called separate optimization of PSM (SO-PSM) and joint optimization of PSM (JO-PSM) are proposed. Thus, two iterative algorithms are proposed accordingly, namely maximizing SR based on SO-PSM (Max-SR-SOP) and maximizing SR based on JO-PSM (Max-SR-JOP). The former has better performance and the latter has lower complexity. The simulation results show that when HR-IRS has sufficient power budget, the proposed Max-SR-SOP and Max-SR-JOP can enable HR-IRS-aided DM network to obtain higher SR than passive IRS-aided DM network.

In spite of the attention and the sensitive nature of the task, privacy preservation in hate speech detection has remained under-studied. The majority of research has focused on centralised machine learning infrastructures which risk leaking data. In this paper, we show that using federated machine learning can help address privacy the concerns that are inherent to hate speech detection while obtaining up to 6.81% improvement in terms of F1-score.

    "abstract": "Users have renewed interest in protecting their private data in the digital space. When they don't believe that their privacy is sufficiently covered by one platform, they will readily switch to another. Such an increasing level of privacy awareness has made privacy preservation an essential research topic. Nevertheless, new privacy attacks are emerging day by day. Therefore, a holistic survey to compare the discovered techniques on attacks over privacy preservation and their mitigation schemes is essential in the literature. We develop a study to fill this gap by assessing the resilience of privacy-preserving methods to various attacks and conducting a comprehensive review of countermeasures from a broader perspective. First, we introduce the fundamental concepts and critical components of privacy attacks. Second, we comprehensively cover major privacy attacks targeted at anonymous data, statistical aggregate data, and privacy-preserving models. We also summarize popular countermeasures to mitigate these attacks. Finally, some promising future research directions and related issues in the privacy community are envisaged. We believe this survey will successfully shed some light on privacy research and encourage researchers to entirely understand the resilience of different existing privacy-preserving approaches. ",

    "title": "Stochastic Approximation Approaches to Group Distributionally Robust  Optimization",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO), with the purpose to learn a model that performs well over $m$ different distributions. First, we formulate GDRO as a stochastic convex-concave saddle-point problem, and demonstrate that stochastic mirror descent (SMD), using $m$ samples in each iteration, achieves an $O(m (\\log m)/\\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity for finding an $\\epsilon$-optimal solution, which matches the $\\Omega(m/\\epsilon^2)$ lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. Then, we make use of techniques from online learning to reduce the number of samples required in each round from $m$ to $1$, keeping the same sample complexity. Specifically, we cast GDRO as a two-players game where one player simply performs SMD and the other executes an online algorithm for non-oblivious multi-armed bandits. Next, we consider a more practical scenario where the number of samples that can be drawn from each distribution is different, and propose a novel formulation of weighted DRO, which allows us to derive distribution-dependent convergence rates. Denote by $n_i$ the sample budget for the $i$-th distribution, and assume $n_1 \\geq n_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq n_m$. In the first approach, we incorporate non-uniform sampling into SMD such that the sample budget is satisfied in expectation, and prove the excess risk of the $i$-th distribution decreases at an $O(\\sqrt{n_1 \\log m}/n_i)$ rate. In the second approach, we use mini-batches to meet the budget exactly and also reduce the variance in stochastic gradients, and then leverage stochastic mirror-prox algorithm, which can exploit small variances, to optimize a carefully designed weighted DRO problem. Under appropriate conditions, it attains an $O((\\log m)/\\sqrt{n_i})$ convergence rate, which almost matches the optimal $O(\\sqrt{1/n_i})$ rate of only learning from the $i$-th distribution with $n_i$ samples.

However, most sports sequential events modeling methods and performance metrics approaches could be incomprehensive in dealing with such large-scale spatiotemporal data (in particular, temporal process), thereby necessitating a more comprehensive spatiotemporal model and a holistic performance metric. To this end, we proposed the Transformer-Based Neural Marked Spatio Temporal Point Process (NMSTPP) model for football event data based on the neural temporal point processes (NTPP) framework. In the experiments, our model outperformed the prediction performance of the baseline models. Furthermore, we proposed the holistic possession utilization score (HPUS) metric for a more comprehensive football possession analysis. For verification, we examined the relationship with football teams' final ranking, average goal score, and average xG over a season. It was observed that the average HPUS showed significant correlations regardless of not using goal and details of shot information. Furthermore, we show HPUS examples in analyzing possessions, matches, and between matches. ",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation (DA) has become a de facto solution to expand training data size for deep learning. With the proliferation of deep models for time series analysis, various time series DA techniques are proposed in the literature, e.g., cropping-, warping-, flipping-, and mixup-based methods. However, these augmentation methods mainly apply to time series classification and anomaly detection tasks. In time series forecasting (TSF), we need to model the fine-grained temporal relationship within time series segments to generate accurate forecasting results given data in a look-back window. Existing DA solutions in the time domain would break such a relationship, leading to poor forecasting accuracy. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes simple yet effective frequency domain augmentation techniques that ensure the semantic consistency of augmented data-label pairs in forecasting, named FrAug. We conduct extensive experiments on eight widely-used benchmarks with several state-of-the-art TSF deep models. Our results show that FrAug can boost the forecasting accuracy of TSF models in most cases. Moreover, we show that FrAug enables models trained with 1\\% of the original training data to achieve similar performance to the ones trained on full training data, which is particularly attractive for cold-start forecasting. Finally, we show that applying test-time training with FrAug greatly improves forecasting accuracy for time series with significant distribution shifts, which often occurs in real-life TSF applications.

In the case of social applications where AI distributes resources, algorithms often must make decisions that will benefit a subset of users, sometimes repeatedly or exclusively, while attempting to maximize specific outcomes. How should we design such systems to serve users more fairly? This paper explores this question in the case where a group of users works toward a shared goal in a social exergame called Step Heroes. We identify adverse outcomes in traditional multi-armed bandits (MABs) and formalize the Greedy Bandit Problem. We then propose a solution based on a new type of fairness-aware multi-armed bandit, Shapley Bandits. It uses the Shapley Value for increasing overall player participation and intervention adherence rather than the maximization of total group output, which is traditionally achieved by favoring only high-performing participants. We evaluate our approach via a user study (n=46). Our results indicate that our Shapley Bandits effectively mediates the Greedy Bandit Problem and achieves better user retention and motivation across the participants. ",

Indeed, the last several years have shown that well-honed prompts can sometimes unlock emergent capabilities within such models. While there has been a substantial amount of empirical exploration of prompting within the community, relatively few works have studied prompting at a mathematical level. In this work we aim to take a first step towards understanding basic geometric properties induced by prompts in Stable Diffusion, focusing on the intrinsic dimension of internal representations within the model. We find that choice of prompt has a substantial impact on the intrinsic dimension of representations at both layers of the model which we explored, but that the nature of this impact depends on the layer being considered. For example, in certain bottleneck layers of the model, intrinsic dimension of representations is correlated with prompt perplexity (measured using a surrogate model), while this correlation is not apparent in the latent layers. Our evidence suggests that intrinsic dimension could be a useful tool for future studies of the impact of different prompts on text-to-image models. ",

It aims at transferring prior knowledge learned on the source dataset to novel target datasets. The CD-FSL task is especially challenged by the huge domain gap between different datasets. Critically, such a domain gap actually comes from the changes of visual styles, and wave-SAN empirically shows that spanning the style distribution of the source data helps alleviate this issue. However, wave-SAN simply swaps styles of two images. Such a vanilla operation makes the generated styles ``real'' and ``easy'', which still fall into the original set of the source styles. Thus, inspired by vanilla adversarial learning, a novel model-agnostic meta Style Adversarial training (StyleAdv) method together with a novel style adversarial attack method is proposed for CD-FSL. Particularly, our style attack method synthesizes both ``virtual'' and ``hard'' adversarial styles for model training. This is achieved by perturbing the original style with the signed style gradients. By continually attacking styles and forcing the model to recognize these challenging adversarial styles, our model is gradually robust to the visual styles, thus boosting the generalization ability for novel target datasets. Besides the typical CNN-based backbone, we also employ our StyleAdv method on large-scale pretrained vision transformer. Extensive experiments conducted on eight various target datasets show the effectiveness of our method. Whether built upon ResNet or ViT, we achieve the new state of the art for CD-FSL. Codes and models will be released. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel method to train four-dimensional spatiotemporal neural radiance fields of dynamic scenes based on temporal interpolation of feature vectors. Two feature interpolation methods are suggested depending on underlying representations, neural or grid representation. In neural representation, we extract features from space-time inputs via multiple neural network modules and interpolate them based on time frames. The proposed multi-level feature interpolation network effectively captures features of both short-term and long-term time ranges. In grid representation, space-time features are learned via four-dimensional hash grids. The grid representation remarkably reduces training time, which is more than 100$\\times$ faster compared to the neural network models, while maintaining the rendering quality of trained models. Concatenation of static and dynamic features and addition of simple smoothness term further improves the performance of the proposed models. Despite the simplicity of its network architecture, we demonstrate that the proposed method shows superior performance to previous works in neural representation and shows the fastest training speed in grid representation.

With the continuous enrichment and extensive expansion of application scenarios, the safety of UAVs is constantly being challenged. To address this challenge, we propose algorithms to detect anomalous data collected from drones to improve drone safety. We deployed a one-class kernel extreme learning machine (OCKELM) to detect anomalies in drone data. By default, OCKELM uses the radial basis (RBF) kernel function as the kernel function of the model. To improve the performance of OCKELM, we choose a Triangular Global Alignment Kernel (TGAK) instead of an RBF Kernel and introduce the Fast Independent Component Analysis (FastICA) algorithm to reconstruct UAV data. Based on the above improvements, we create a novel anomaly detection strategy FastICA-TGAK-OCELM. The method is finally validated on the UCI dataset and detected on the Aeronautical Laboratory Failures and Anomalies (ALFA) dataset. The experimental results show that compared with other methods, the accuracy of this method is improved by more than 30%, and point anomalies are effectively detected. ",

Detecting flaky tests is therefore a crucial task in maintaining code quality, as it builds the necessary foundation for any form of systematic response to flakiness, such as test quarantining or automated debugging. Previous research has proposed various methods to detect flakiness, but when trying to deploy these in an industrial context, their reliance on instrumentation, test reruns, or language-specific artifacts was inhibitive. In this paper, we therefore investigate the prediction of flaky tests without such requirements on the underlying programming language, CI, build or test execution framework. Instead, we rely only on the most commonly available artifacts, namely the tests' outcomes and durations, as well as basic information about the code evolution to build predictive models capable of detecting flakiness. Furthermore, our approach does not require additional reruns, since it gathers this data from existing test executions. We trained several established classifiers on the suggested features and evaluated their performance on a large-scale industrial software system, from which we collected a data set of 100 flaky and 100 non-flaky test- and code-histories. The best model was able to achieve an F1-score of 95.5% using only 3 features: the tests' flip rates, the number of changes to source files in the last 54 days, as well as the number of changed files in the most recent pull request.

Autoencoders often use generic deep networks as the encoder or decoder, which are difficult to interpret, and the learned representations lack clear structure. In this work, we make the explicit assumption that the image distribution is generated from a multi-stage sparse deconvolution. The corresponding inverse map, which we use as an encoder, is a multi-stage convolution sparse coding (CSC), with each stage obtained from unrolling an optimization algorithm for solving the corresponding (convexified) sparse coding program. To avoid computational difficulties in minimizing distributional distance between the real and generated images, we utilize the recent closed-loop transcription (CTRL) framework that optimizes the rate reduction of the learned sparse representations. Conceptually, our method has high-level connections to score-matching methods such as diffusion models. Empirically, our framework demonstrates competitive performance on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K, compared to existing autoencoding and generative methods under fair conditions. Even with simpler networks and fewer computational resources, our method demonstrates high visual quality in regenerated images. More surprisingly, the learned autoencoder performs well on unseen datasets. Our method enjoys several side benefits, including more structured and interpretable representations, more stable convergence, and scalability to large datasets. Our method is arguably the first to demonstrate that a concatenation of multiple convolution sparse coding/decoding layers leads to an interpretable and effective autoencoder for modeling the distribution of large-scale natural image datasets.

The most prevalent type of CAPTCHA is text-based, designed to be easily recognized by humans while being unsolvable towards machines or robots. However, as deep learning technology progresses, development of convolutional neural network (CNN) models that predict text-based CAPTCHAs becomes easier. The purpose of this research is to investigate the flaws and vulnerabilities in the CAPTCHA generating systems in order to design more resilient CAPTCHAs. To achieve this, we created CapNet, a Convolutional Neural Network. The proposed platform can evaluate both numerical and alphanumerical CAPTCHAs ",

    "abstract": "Designing an intrusion detection system is difficult as network traffic encompasses various attack types, including new and evolving ones with minor changes. The data used to construct a predictive model has a skewed class distribution and limited representation of attack types, which differ from real network traffic. These limitations result in dataset shift, negatively impacting the machine learning models' predictive abilities and reducing the detection rate against novel attacks. To address the challenge of dataset shift, we introduce the INformation FUsion and Stacking Ensemble (INFUSE) for network intrusion detection. This approach further improves its predictive power by employing a deep neural network-based Meta-Learner on top of INFUSE. First, a hybrid feature space is created by integrating decision and feature spaces. Five different classifiers are utilized to generate a pool of decision spaces. The feature space is then enriched through a deep sparse autoencoder that learns the semantic relationships between attacks. Finally, the deep Meta-Learner acts as an ensemble combiner to analyze the hybrid feature space and make a final decision. Our evaluation on stringent benchmark datasets and comparison to existing techniques showed the effectiveness of INFUSE with an F-Score of 0.91, Accuracy of 91.6%, and Recall of 0.94 on the Test+ dataset, and an F-Score of 0.91, Accuracy of 85.6%, and Recall of 0.87 on the stringent Test-21 dataset. These promising results indicate the proposed technique has strong generalization capability and the potential to detect network attacks. ",

Existing low-cost approaches that rely on cross-lingual embeddings or naive machine translation sacrifice a lot of accuracy for data efficiency, and largely fail in creating a usable dialogue agent. We propose automatic methods that use ToD training data in a source language to build a high-quality functioning dialogue agent in another target language that has no training data (i.e. zero-shot) or a small training set (i.e. few-shot). Unlike most prior work in cross-lingual ToD that only focuses on Dialogue State Tracking (DST), we build an end-to-end agent. We show that our approach closes the accuracy gap between few-shot and existing full-shot methods for ToD agents. We achieve this by (1) improving the dialogue data representation, (2) improving entity-aware machine translation, and (3) automatic filtering of noisy translations. We evaluate our approach on the recent bilingual dialogue dataset BiToD. In Chinese to English transfer, in the zero-shot setting, our method achieves 46.7% and 22.0% in Task Success Rate (TSR) and Dialogue Success Rate (DSR) respectively. In the few-shot setting where 10% of the data in the target language is used, we improve the state-of-the-art by 15.2% and 14.0%, coming within 5% of full-shot training. ",

This is especially true for deformable linear objects (DLOs) or \"rods\", whose slender and flexible structures make proper tracking and detection nontrivial. To address this challenge, we present mBEST, a robust algorithm for the realtime detection of DLOs that is capable of producing an ordered pixel sequence of each DLO's centerline along with segmentation masks. Our algorithm obtains a binary mask of the DLOs and then thins it to produce a skeleton pixel representation. After refining the skeleton to ensure topological correctness, the pixels are traversed to generate paths along each unique DLO. At the core of our algorithm, we postulate that intersections can be robustly handled by choosing the combination of paths that minimizes the cumulative bending energy of the DLO(s). We show that this simple and intuitive formulation outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for detecting DLOs with large numbers of sporadic crossings and curvatures with high variance. Furthermore, our method achieves a significant performance improvement of approximately 40 FPS compared to the 15 FPS of prior algorithms, which enables realtime applications. ",

We present a multi-task reinforcement learning framework to train the robot to accomplish a large variety of jumping tasks, such as jumping to different locations and directions. To improve performance on these challenging tasks, we develop a new policy structure that encodes the robot's long-term input/output (I/O) history while also providing direct access to its short-term I/O history. In order to train a versatile multi-task policy, we utilize a multi-stage training scheme that includes different training stages for different objectives. After multi-stage training, the multi-task policy can be directly transferred to Cassie, a physical bipedal robot. Training on different tasks and exploring more diverse scenarios leads to highly robust policies that can exploit the diverse set of learned skills to recover from perturbations or poor landings during real-world deployment. Such robustness in the proposed multi-task policy enables Cassie to succeed in completing a variety of challenging jump tasks in the real world, such as standing long jumps, jumping onto elevated platforms, and multi-axis jumps.

However, users usually edit a local region when editing faces and do not want other regions to be affected. Since changes to the latent code affect global generation results, these methods do not allow for fine-grained control of local facial regions. To improve local controllability in NeRF-based face editing, we propose LC-NeRF, which is composed of a Local Region Generators Module and a Spatial-Aware Fusion Module, allowing for local geometry and texture control of local facial regions.

This study addresses these gaps and combines theory-driven and bottom-up strategies to construct a hybrid and interpretable prediction model of valid suicide risk from images. The lead hypothesis was that images contain valuable information about emotions and interpersonal relationships, two central concepts in suicide-related treatments and theories. The dataset included 177,220 images by 841 Facebook users who completed a gold-standard suicide scale. The images were represented with CLIP, a state-of-the-art algorithm, which was utilized, unconventionally, to extract predefined features that served as inputs to a simple logistic-regression prediction model (in contrast to complex neural networks). The features addressed basic and theory-driven visual elements using everyday language (e.g., bright photo, photo of sad people). The results of the hybrid model (that integrated theory-driven and bottom-up methods) indicated high prediction performance that surpassed common bottom-up algorithms, thus providing a first proof that images (alone) can be leveraged to predict validated suicide risk. Corresponding with the lead hypothesis, at-risk users had images with increased negative emotions and decreased belonginess. The results are discussed in the context of non-verbal warning signs of suicide. Notably, the study illustrates the advantages of hybrid models in such complicated tasks and provides simple and flexible prediction strategies that could be utilized to develop real-life monitoring tools of suicide.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks are valuable for evaluating the robustness of deep learning models. Existing attacks are primarily conducted on the visible light spectrum (e.g., pixel-wise texture perturbation). However, attacks targeting texture-free X-ray images remain underexplored, despite the widespread application of X-ray imaging in safety-critical scenarios such as the X-ray detection of prohibited items. In this paper, we take the first step toward the study of adversarial attacks targeted at X-ray prohibited item detection, and reveal the serious threats posed by such attacks in this safety-critical scenario. Specifically, we posit that successful physical adversarial attacks in this scenario should be specially designed to circumvent the challenges posed by color/texture fading and complex overlapping. To this end, we propose X-adv to generate physically printable metals that act as an adversarial agent capable of deceiving X-ray detectors when placed in luggage. To resolve the issues associated with color/texture fading, we develop a differentiable converter that facilitates the generation of 3D-printable objects with adversarial shapes, using the gradients of a surrogate model rather than directly generating adversarial textures. To place the printed 3D adversarial objects in luggage with complex overlapped instances, we design a policy-based reinforcement learning strategy to find locations eliciting strong attack performance in worst-case scenarios whereby the prohibited items are heavily occluded by other items. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed X-Adv, we conduct extensive experiments in both the digital and the physical world (employing a commercial X-ray security inspection system for the latter case). Furthermore, we present the physical-world X-ray adversarial attack dataset XAD. ",

    "abstract": "State estimation is one of the greatest challenges for cloth manipulation due to cloth's high dimensionality and self-occlusion. Prior works propose to identify the full state of crumpled clothes by training a mesh reconstruction model in simulation. However, such models are prone to suffer from a sim-to-real gap due to differences between cloth simulation and the real world. In this work, we propose a self-supervised method to finetune a mesh reconstruction model in the real world. Since the full mesh of crumpled cloth is difficult to obtain in the real world, we design a special data collection scheme and an action-conditioned model-based cloth tracking method to generate pseudo-labels for self-supervised learning. By finetuning the pretrained mesh reconstruction model on this pseudo-labeled dataset, we show that we can improve the quality of the reconstructed mesh without requiring human annotations, and improve the performance of downstream manipulation task.

    "abstract": "Data collection is indispensable for spatial crowdsourcing services, such as resource allocation, policymaking, and scientific explorations. However, privacy issues make it challenging for users to share their information unless receiving sufficient compensation. Differential Privacy (DP) is a promising mechanism to release helpful information while protecting individuals' privacy. However, most DP mechanisms only consider a fixed compensation for each user's privacy loss. In this paper, we design a task assignment scheme that allows workers to dynamically improve their utility with dynamic distance privacy leakage. Specifically, we propose two solutions to improve the total utility of task assignment results, namely Private Utility Conflict-Elimination (PUCE) approach and Private Game Theory (PGT) approach, respectively. We prove that PUCE achieves higher utility than the state-of-the-art works. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our PUCE and PGT approaches on both real and synthetic data sets compared with the recent distance-based approach, Private Distance Conflict-Elimination (PDCE). PUCE is always better than PDCE slightly. PGT is 50% to 63% faster than PDCE and can improve 16% utility on average when worker range is large enough. ",

Previous studies try to resolve the issue through designing an intrinsic reward function, but the intrinsic reward is simply combined with the environment reward by summation in these studies, which makes the performance of their MARL framework unsatisfactory. We propose a novel method named Attention Individual Intrinsic Reward Mixing Network (AIIR-MIX) in MARL, and the contributions of AIIR-MIX are listed as follows:(a) we construct a novel intrinsic reward network based on the attention mechanism to make teamwork more effective. (b) we propose a Mixing network that is able to combine intrinsic and extrinsic rewards non-linearly and dynamically in response to changing conditions of the environment. We compare AIIR-MIX with many State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) MARL methods on battle games in StarCraft II. And the results demonstrate that AIIR-MIX performs admirably and can defeat the current advanced methods on average test win rate. To validate the effectiveness of AIIR-MIX, we conduct additional ablation studies. The results show that AIIR-MIX can dynamically assign each agent a real-time intrinsic reward in accordance with their actual contribution. ",

Although successful in increasing the CPU performance, exploiting the design flaws and security bugs in these components have set the background for various types of microarchitectural attacks such as Spectre and Meltdown. While many attacks such as Meltdown and Spectre have been numerously implemented and analyzed on Intel processors, few researches have been carried out to evaluate their impact on ARM processors. Moreover, SpectreRSB vulnerability, the newer variant of spectre attack based on RSB, has been neglected in recent studies. In this work, we first evaluate the SpectreRSB vulnerability by implementing this attack on ARM processors, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been implemented and analyzed on ARM processors. We further present a security evaluation of ARM processors by implementing different variants of Spectre-family attacks. By analyzing the results obtained from various experiments, we evaluate ARM processors security regarding their diverse microarchitectural designs. We also introduce a high throughput and noise-free covert channel, based on the RSB structure. Based on our experiments, the throughput of the covert channel is 94.19KB/s with negligible error. ",

An energy consumption minimization problem is formulated under some constraints including users' quality of service and information security requirements and the UAV's trajectory's causality, by jointly optimizing the CPU frequency, the offloading time, the beamforming vectors, the artificial noise and the trajectory of the UAV, as well as the CPU frequency, the offloading time and the transmission power of each user. To solve the non-convex problem, a reformulated problem is first derived by a series of convex reformation methods, i.e., semi-definite relaxation, S-Procedure and first-order approximation, and then, solved by a proposed successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm. The convergence performance and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperform existing benchmark schemes.

In the process of image restoration, it is necessary to consider not only the spatial details and contextual information of restoration to ensure the quality, but also the system complexity. Although many methods have been able to guarantee the quality of image restoration, the system complexity of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods is increasing as well. Motivated by this, we present a mixed hierarchy network that can balance these competing goals. Our main proposal is a mixed hierarchy architecture, that progressively recovers contextual information and spatial details from degraded images while we design intra-blocks to reduce system complexity. Specifically, our model first learns the contextual information using encoder-decoder architectures, and then combines them with high-resolution branches that preserve spatial detail. In order to reduce the system complexity of this architecture for convenient analysis and comparison, we replace or remove the nonlinear activation function with multiplication and use a simple network structure. In addition, we replace spatial convolution with global self-attention for the middle block of encoder-decoder. The resulting tightly interlinked hierarchy architecture, named as MHNet, delivers strong performance gains on several image restoration tasks, including image deraining, and deblurring. ",

Hand amputation can prevent a person from performing their daily activities.

As the most important use of the hands is to grasp objects, the purpose of this study is to accurately predict gripping force from surface electromyography (sEMG) signals during a pinch-type grip. In that regard, gripping force and sEMG signals are derived from 10 healthy subjects. Results show that for this task, recurrent networks outperform nonrecurrent ones, such as a fully connected multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. Gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks can predict the gripping force with R-squared values of 0.994 and 0.992, respectively, and a prediction rate of over 1300 predictions per second. The predominant advantage of using such frameworks is that the gripping force can be predicted straight from preprocessed sEMG signals without any form of feature extraction, not to mention the ability to predict future force values using larger prediction horizons adequately. The methods presented in this study can be used in the myoelectric control of prosthetic hands or robotic grippers. ",

YOLOv7 is a state-of-the-art object detector based on the YOLO family of models which have become popular for industrial applications. One such possible application domain can be semiconductor defect inspection. The performance of any machine learning model depends on its hyperparameters. Furthermore, combining predictions of one or more models in different ways can also affect performance. In this research, we experiment with YOLOv7, a recently proposed, state-of-the-art object detector, by training and evaluating models with different hyperparameters to investigate which ones improve performance in terms of detection precision for semiconductor line space pattern defects. The base YOLOv7 model with default hyperparameters and Non Maximum Suppression (NMS) prediction combining outperforms all RetinaNet models from previous work in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP). We find that vertically flipping images randomly during training yields a 3% improvement in the mean AP of all defect classes. Other hyperparameter values improved AP only for certain classes compared to the default model. Combining models that achieve the best AP for different defect classes was found to be an effective ensembling strategy. Combining predictions from ensembles using Weighted Box Fusion (WBF) prediction gave the best performance. The best ensemble with WBF improved on the mAP of the default model by 10%. ",

    "abstract": "The inability to guarantee robustness is one of the major obstacles to the application of deep learning models in security-demanding domains. We identify that the most commonly used cross-entropy (CE) loss does not guarantee robust boundary for neural networks. CE loss sharpens the neural network at the decision boundary to achieve a lower loss, rather than pushing the boundary to a more robust position. A robust boundary should be kept in the middle of samples from different classes, thus maximizing the margins from the boundary to the samples. We think this is due to the fact that CE loss has no stationary point. In this paper, we propose a family of new losses, called stationary point (SP) loss, which has at least one stationary point on the correct classification side. We proved that robust boundary can be guaranteed by SP loss without losing much accuracy. With SP loss, larger perturbations are required to generate adversarial examples. We demonstrate that robustness is improved under a variety of adversarial attacks by applying SP loss. Moreover, robust boundary learned by SP loss also performs well on imbalanced datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Split learning is a collaborative learning design that allows several participants (clients) to train a shared model while keeping their datasets private. Recent studies demonstrate that collaborative learning models, specifically federated learning, are vulnerable to security and privacy attacks such as model inference and backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks are a group of poisoning attacks in which the attacker tries to control the model output by manipulating the model's training process. While there have been studies regarding inference attacks on split learning, it has not yet been tested for backdoor attacks. This paper performs a novel backdoor attack on split learning and studies its effectiveness. Despite traditional backdoor attacks done on the client side, we inject the backdoor trigger from the server side. For this purpose, we provide two attack methods: one using a surrogate client and another using an autoencoder to poison the model via incoming smashed data and its outgoing gradient toward the innocent participants. We did our experiments using three model architectures and three publicly available datasets in the image domain and ran a total of 761 experiments to evaluate our attack methods. The results show that despite using strong patterns and injection methods, split learning is highly robust and resistant to such poisoning attacks. While we get the attack success rate of 100% as our best result for the MNIST dataset, in most of the other cases, our attack shows little success when increasing the cut layer. ",

While conceptual knowledge about emotions (emotion knowledge) has been suggested to be essential for emotion inference, evidence to date is mostly indirect and inconclusive. As the large language models (LLMs) have been shown to support effective representations of various human conceptual knowledge, the present study further employed artificial neurons in LLMs to investigate the mechanism of human emotion inference. With artificial neurons activated by prompts, the LLM (RoBERTa) demonstrated a similar conceptual structure of 27 discrete emotions as that of human behaviors. Furthermore, the LLM-based conceptual structure revealed a human-like reliance on 14 underlying conceptual attributes of emotions for emotion inference. Most importantly, by manipulating attribute-specific neurons, we found that the corresponding LLM's emotion inference performance deteriorated, and the performance deterioration was correlated to the effectiveness of representations of the conceptual attributes on the human side. Our findings provide direct evidence for the emergence of emotion knowledge representation in large language models and suggest its casual support for discrete emotion inference. ",

However, for intelligent vehicles, occupancy of both the present and future moments is required to ensure safe driving. In the automotive industry, the accurate and continuous prediction of future occupancy maps in traffic scenarios remains a formidable challenge. This paper investigates multi-sensor spatio-temporal fusion strategies for continuous occupancy prediction in a systematic manner. This paper presents FusionMotion, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) occupancy predictor which is capable of achieving the fusion of asynchronous multi-sensor data and predicting the future occupancy map with variable time intervals and temporal horizons. Remarkably, FusionMotion features the adoption of neural ordinary differential equations on recurrent neural networks for occupancy prediction. FusionMotion learns derivatives of BEV features over temporal horizons, updates the implicit sensor's BEV feature measurements and propagates future states for each ODE step. Extensive experiments on large-scale nuScenes and Lyft L5 datasets demonstrate that FusionMotion significantly outperforms previous methods. In addition, it outperforms the BEVFusion-style fusion strategy on the Lyft L5 dataset while reducing synchronization requirements. Codes and models will be made available. ",

Numerous code generation models have been proposed and proven on different benchmark datasets. However, little is known about whether this objective has been achieved and why code generation models effectively transform code sequences automatically. In other words, can we totally trust these automated code generation models? Consequently, there is a pressing need to understand the inner logic of code generation models and to investigate their replicability, reliability, and explainability. To bridge these research gaps, we conduct a thorough empirical study of five code generation models on four representative code generation datasets to assess the limits and capabilities of automatic code generation approaches. We further employ advanced explainable AI approaches to highlight the tokens that significantly contribute to the code generation. Experiments demonstrate that we successfully replicate state-of-the-art code generation approaches. We discover that state-of-the-art approaches suffer from severe data duplication and input insensitivity, which are subtle issues with significant implications. Our explainability analysis reveals that, in various experimental scenarios, code generation models can recognize code grammar and structural information, but can not capture key tokens that need to be updated.

Previous works typically combine raw messages of teammates with local information as inputs for policy. However, neglecting message aggregation poses significant inefficiency for policy learning. Motivated by recent advances in representation learning, we argue that efficient message aggregation is essential for good coordination in cooperative MARL. In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent communication via Self-supervised Information Aggregation (MASIA), where agents can aggregate the received messages into compact representations with high relevance to augment the local policy. Specifically, we design a permutation invariant message encoder to generate common information-aggregated representation from messages and optimize it via reconstructing and shooting future information in a self-supervised manner. Hence, each agent would utilize the most relevant parts of the aggregated representation for decision-making by a novel message extraction mechanism. Furthermore, considering the potential of offline learning for real-world applications, we build offline benchmarks for multi-agent communication, which is the first as we know. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our method in both online and offline settings. We also release the built offline benchmarks in this paper as a testbed for communication ability validation to facilitate further future research. ",

Considering that differential privacy has become the gold standard for privacy measures due to its simple implementation and rigorous theoretical foundation, in this paper, we study the privacy guarantees of discrete-valued mechanisms with finite output space in the lens of $f$-differential privacy (DP). By interpreting the privacy leakage as a hypothesis testing problem, we derive the closed-form expression of the tradeoff between type I and type II error rates, based on which the $f$-DP guarantees of a variety of discrete-valued mechanisms, including binomial mechanisms, sign-based methods, and ternary-based compressors, are characterized. We further investigate the Byzantine resilience of binomial mechanisms and ternary compressors and characterize the tradeoff among differential privacy, Byzantine resilience, and communication efficiency.

    "abstract": "Poor energy efficiency of homes is a major problem with urgent environmental and social implications. Housing in the UK relies heavily on fossil fuels for energy supply and has some of the lowest energy efficiency in Europe. We explore spatial variations in energy efficiency across England using data from Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), which cover approximately half of the residential stock (14M homes between 2008-22). We examine variations between authorities after accounting for the composition of the housing stock in terms of its fixed characteristics of property type, building age and size. We explore variations in terms of geographical and social context (region, urban-rural and deprivation), which gives a picture of the scale of the challenge each faces. We also examine variations in relation to the more readily upgraded factors, such as glazing types, and in relation to local participation in improvement programmes which gives some insight into local actions or progress achieved.

    "abstract": "Medical visual question answering (VQA) aims to answer clinically relevant questions regarding input medical images. This technique has the potential to improve the efficiency of medical professionals while relieving the burden on the public health system, particularly in resource-poor countries. Existing medical VQA methods tend to encode medical images and learn the correspondence between visual features and questions without exploiting the spatial, semantic, or medical knowledge behind them. This is partially because of the small size of the current medical VQA dataset, which often includes simple questions. Therefore, we first collected a comprehensive and large-scale medical VQA dataset, focusing on chest X-ray images. The questions involved detailed relationships, such as disease names, locations, levels, and types in our dataset. Based on this dataset, we also propose a novel baseline method by constructing three different relationship graphs: spatial relationship, semantic relationship, and implicit relationship graphs on the image regions, questions, and semantic labels. The answer and graph reasoning paths are learned for different questions. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we provide a large-scale empirical study of the scaling properties of multilingual neural machine translation models. We examine how increases in the model size affect the model performance and investigate the role of the training mixture composition on the scaling behavior. We find that changing the weightings of the individual language pairs in the training mixture only affect the multiplicative factor of the scaling law. In particular, we observe that multilingual models trained using different mixing rates all exhibit the same scaling exponent. Through a novel joint scaling law formulation, we compute the effective number of parameters allocated to each language pair and examine the role of language similarity in the scaling behavior of our models. We find little evidence that language similarity has any impact. In contrast, the direction of the multilinguality plays a significant role, with models translating from multiple languages into English having a larger number of effective parameters per task than their reversed counterparts. Finally, we leverage our observations to predict the performance of multilingual models trained with any language weighting at any scale, significantly reducing efforts required for language balancing in large multilingual models. Our findings apply to both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets and to multiple evaluation metrics, such as ChrF and BLEURT. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of clustering graph nodes and sparsifying graph edges over distributed graphs, when graph edges with possibly edge duplicates are observed at physically remote sites. Although edge duplicates across different sites appear to be beneficial at the first glance, in fact they could make the clustering and sparsification more complicated since potentially their processing would need extra computations and communications. We propose the first communication-optimal algorithms for two well-established communication models namely the message passing and the blackboard models. Specifically, given a graph on $n$ nodes with edges observed at $s$ sites, our algorithms achieve communication costs $\\tilde{O}(ns)$ and $\\tilde{O}(n+s)$ ($\\tilde{O}$ hides a polylogarithmic factor), which almost match their lower bounds, $\\Omega(ns)$ and $\\Omega(n+s)$, in the message passing and the blackboard models respectively. The communication costs are asymptotically the same as those under non-duplication models, under an assumption on edge distribution. Our algorithms can also guarantee clustering quality nearly as good as that of centralizing all edges and then applying any standard clustering algorithm. Moreover, we perform the first investigation of distributed constructions of graph spanners in the blackboard model. We provide almost matching communication lower and upper bounds for both multiplicative and additive spanners. For example, the communication lower bounds of constructing a $(2k-1)$-spanner in the blackboard with and without duplication models are $\\Omega(s+n^{1+1/k}\\log s)$ and $\\Omega(s+n^{1+1/k}\\max\\{1,s^{-1/2-1/(2k)}\\log s\\})$ respectively, which almost match the upper bound $\\tilde{O}(s+n^{1+1/k})$ for both models.

In addition, IBNNs are robust in the sense of Bayesian sensitivity analysis, and are more robust than BNNs to distribution shift. They can also be used to compute sets of outcomes that enjoy PAC-like properties. We apply IBNNs to two case studies.

A single camera setup positioned in the umpire's view has been employed to procure a dataset consisting of six stroke classes executed by four professional table tennis players. Ball tracking using YOLOv4, a traditional object detection model, and TrackNetv2, a temporal heatmap based model, have been implemented on our dataset and their performances have been benchmarked. A mathematical approach developed to extract temporal boundaries of strokes using the ball trajectory data yielded a total of 2023 valid strokes in our dataset, while also detecting services and missed strokes successfully. The temporal convolutional network developed performed stroke recognition on completely unseen data with an accuracy of 87.155%. Several machine learning and deep learning based model architectures have been trained for stroke recognition using ball trajectory input and benchmarked based on their performances. While stroke recognition in the field of table tennis has been extensively explored based on human action recognition using video data focused on the player's actions, the use of ball trajectory data for the same is an unexplored characteristic of the sport. Hence, the motivation behind the work is to demonstrate that meaningful inferences such as stroke detection and recognition can be drawn using minimal input information. ",

Causal mediation analysis is a method that is often used to reveal direct and indirect effects. Deep learning shows promise in mediation analysis, but the current methods only assume latent confounders that affect treatment, mediator and outcome simultaneously, and fail to identify different types of latent confounders (e.g., confounders that only affect the mediator or outcome). Furthermore, current methods are based on the sequential ignorability assumption, which is not feasible for dealing with multiple types of latent confounders. This work aims to circumvent the sequential ignorability assumption and applies the piecemeal deconfounding assumption as an alternative. We propose the Disentangled Mediation Analysis Variational AutoEncoder (DMAVAE), which disentangles the representations of latent confounders into three types to accurately estimate the natural direct effect, natural indirect effect and total effect. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods and has strong generalisation ability.

Additionally the proposed method can be used to rigorously ensure continuous collision avoidance as the vehicle transitions between the discrete poses determined by the motion planning algorithm. Numerical examples demonstrate how this can be used to prevent problems of corner cutting and passing through obstacles which can occur when collision avoidance is only enforced at discrete time steps.

An attack is considered successfully intercepted if a defender is present at the boundary location when and where the attack happens.

Extensive simulation experiments confirm the effectiveness of the algorithms.

    "abstract": "Real-world complex network systems often experience changes over time, and controlling their state has important applications in various fields. While external control signals can drive static networks to a desired state, dynamic networks have varying topologies that require changes to the driver nodes for maintaining control. Most existing approaches require knowledge of topological changes in advance to compute optimal control schemes. However, obtaining such knowledge can be difficult for many real-world dynamic networks. To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time control optimization algorithm called Dynamic Optimal Control (DOC) that predicts node control importance using historical information to minimize control scheme changes and reduce overall control cost. We design an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes the current control scheme by repairing past maximum matching to respond to changes in the network topology. Our experiments on real and synthetic dynamic networks show that DOC significantly reduces control cost and achieves more stable and focused real-time control schemes compared to traditional algorithms. The proposed algorithm has the potential to provide solutions for real-time control of complex dynamic systems in various fields. ",

However, most DNN models do not provide uncertainty estimates, which are crucial for establishing the trustworthiness of these techniques in downstream decision making tasks and scenarios. In recent years, ensemble-based methods have achieved significant success for the uncertainty quantification in DNNs on a number of benchmark problems. However, their performance on real-world applications remains under-explored. In this work, we present an automated approach to DNN discovery and demonstrate how this may also be utilized for ensemble-based uncertainty quantification. Specifically, we propose the use of a scalable neural and hyperparameter architecture search for discovering an ensemble of DNN models for complex dynamical systems. We highlight how the proposed method not only discovers high-performing neural network ensembles for our tasks, but also quantifies uncertainty seamlessly. This is achieved by using genetic algorithms and Bayesian optimization for sampling the search space of neural network architectures and hyperparameters. Subsequently, a model selection approach is used to identify candidate models for an ensemble set construction. Afterwards, a variance decomposition approach is used to estimate the uncertainty of the predictions from the ensemble. We demonstrate the feasibility of this framework for two tasks - forecasting from historical data and flow reconstruction from sparse sensors for the sea-surface temperature. We demonstrate superior performance from the ensemble in contrast with individual high-performing models and other benchmarks. ",

The detector is responsible for directly detecting anomalies, while the reconstructor provides reconstruction information to the detector and updates its learning based on anomalous information received from the detector. The central aspect of CNTS is a multi-objective optimization problem, which is solved through a cooperative solution strategy. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CNTS and confirm the cooperative effectiveness of the detector and reconstructor. The source code for this study is publicly available on GitHub. ",

    "title": "RecFNO: a resolution-invariant flow and heat field reconstruction method  from sparse observations via Fourier neural operator",
    "abstract": "Perception of the full state is an essential technology to support the monitoring, analysis, and design of physical systems, one of whose challenges is to recover global field from sparse observations. Well-known for brilliant approximation ability, deep neural networks have been attractive to data-driven flow and heat field reconstruction studies. However, limited by network structure, existing researches mostly learn the reconstruction mapping in finite-dimensional space and has poor transferability to variable resolution of outputs. In this paper, we extend the new paradigm of neural operator and propose an end-to-end physical field reconstruction method with both excellent performance and mesh transferability named RecFNO. The proposed method aims to learn the mapping from sparse observations to flow and heat field in infinite-dimensional space, contributing to a more powerful nonlinear fitting capacity and resolution-invariant characteristic. Firstly, according to different usage scenarios, we develop three types of embeddings to model the sparse observation inputs: MLP, mask, and Voronoi embedding. The MLP embedding is propitious to more sparse input, while the others benefit from spatial information preservation and perform better with the increase of observation data. Then, we adopt stacked Fourier layers to reconstruct physical field in Fourier space that regularizes the overall recovered field by Fourier modes superposition. Benefiting from the operator in infinite-dimensional space, the proposed method obtains remarkable accuracy and better resolution transferability among meshes. The experiments conducted on fluid mechanics and thermology problems show that the proposed method outperforms existing POD-based and CNN-based methods in most cases and has the capacity to achieve zero-shot super-resolution.

    "title": "Pseudo Label-Guided Model Inversion Attack via Conditional Generative  Adversarial Network",
    "abstract": "Model inversion (MI) attacks have raised increasing concerns about privacy, which can reconstruct training data from public models. Indeed, MI attacks can be formalized as an optimization problem that seeks private data in a certain space. Recent MI attacks leverage a generative adversarial network (GAN) as an image prior to narrow the search space, and can successfully reconstruct even the high-dimensional data (e.g., face images). However, these generative MI attacks do not fully exploit the potential capabilities of the target model, still leading to a vague and coupled search space, i.e., different classes of images are coupled in the search space. Besides, the widely used cross-entropy loss in these attacks suffers from gradient vanishing. To address these problems, we propose Pseudo Label-Guided MI (PLG-MI) attack via conditional GAN (cGAN). At first, a top-n selection strategy is proposed to provide pseudo-labels for public data, and use pseudo-labels to guide the training of the cGAN. In this way, the search space is decoupled for different classes of images. Then a max-margin loss is introduced to improve the search process on the subspace of a target class. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PLG-MI attack significantly improves the attack success rate and visual quality for various datasets and models, notably, 2~3 $\\times$ better than state-of-the-art attacks under large distributional shifts.

In experiments, we find that models perform well on test sets coming from the same distribution as the train data but their performance drops when evaluated on realistic noisy user inputs. We propose a fine-tuning regime with additional user-simulated noisy cell selections.

Hence, logical fragments that admit polynomial time WFOMC are of significant interest. Such fragments are called domain liftable.

To tackle this challenge, we explore the potential of leveraging data augmentation to improve data efficiency and enhance model robustness. However, most existing data augmentation methods incur a serious issue, namely that it alters the image quality and leads to training images mismatching with their original labels. Additionally, although only a few data augmentation methods are available for NR-IQA task, their ability to enrich dataset diversity is still insufficient. To address these issues, we propose a effective and general data augmentation based on just noticeable difference (JND) noise mixing for NR-IQA task, named JNDMix. In detail, we randomly inject the JND noise, imperceptible to the human visual system (HVS), into the training image without any adjustment to its label. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JNDMix significantly improves the performance and data efficiency of various state-of-the-art NR-IQA models and the commonly used baseline models, as well as the generalization ability. More importantly, JNDMix facilitates MANIQA to achieve the state-of-the-art performance on LIVEC and KonIQ-10k. ",

Our approach is to represent the controller and the value function with neural networks, and to train them using loss functions adapted from the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. In the absence of a known dynamics model, our method first learns the state transitions from data collected by interacting with the system in an offline process. The learned transition function is then integrated to the HJB equations and used to forward simulate the control signals produced by our controller in a feedback loop. In contrast to trajectory optimization methods that optimize the controller for a single initial state, our controller can generate near-optimal control signals for initial states from a large portion of the state space. Compared to recent model-based reinforcement learning algorithms, we show that our method is more sample efficient and trains faster by an order of magnitude. We demonstrate our method in a number of tasks, including the control of a quadrotor with 12 state variables. ",

Existing OOD textual detectors often rely on an anomaly score (e.g., Mahalanobis distance) computed on the embedding output of the last layer of the encoder. In this work, we observe that OOD detection performance varies greatly depending on the task and layer output. More importantly, we show that the usual choice (the last layer) is rarely the best one for OOD detection and that far better results could be achieved if the best layer were picked. To leverage this observation, we propose a data-driven, unsupervised method to combine layer-wise anomaly scores. In addition, we extend classical textual OOD benchmarks by including classification tasks with a greater number of classes (up to 77), which reflects more realistic settings. On this augmented benchmark, we show that the proposed post-aggregation methods achieve robust and consistent results while removing manual feature selection altogether. Their performance achieves near oracle's best layer performance. ",

While reparative measures, such as apologies, are often considered as possible strategic interactions, the explicit evolution of the emotion of guilt as a behavioural phenotype is not yet well understood. Here, we study the co-evolution of social and non-social guilt of homogeneous or heterogeneous populations, including well-mixed, lattice and scale-free networks. Socially aware guilt comes at a cost, as it requires agents to make demanding efforts to observe and understand the internal state and behaviour of others, while non-social guilt only requires the awareness of the agents' own state and hence incurs no social cost. Those choosing to be non-social are however more sensitive to exploitation by other agents due to their social unawareness. Resorting to methods from evolutionary game theory, we study analytically, and through extensive numerical and agent-based simulations, whether and how such social and non-social guilt can evolve and deploy, depending on the underlying structure of the populations, or systems, of agents. The results show that, in both lattice and scale-free networks, emotional guilt prone strategies are dominant for a larger range of the guilt and social costs incurred, compared to the well-mixed population setting, leading therefore to significantly higher levels of cooperation for a wider range of the costs. In structured population settings, both social and non-social guilt can evolve and deploy through clustering with emotional prone strategies, allowing them to be protected from exploiters, especially in case of non-social (less costly) strategies. Overall, our findings provide important insights into the design and engineering of self-organised and distributed cooperative multi-agent systems. ",

To address this problem, in this paper we propose a two-branch network named GlocalFuse-Depth for self-supervised depth estimation of all-day images. The daytime and nighttime image in input image pair are fed into the two branches: CNN branch and Transformer branch, respectively, where both fine-grained details and global dependency can be efficiently captured. Besides, a novel fusion module is proposed to fuse multi-dimensional features from the two branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GlocalFuse-Depth achieves state-of-the-art results for all-day images on the Oxford RobotCar dataset, which proves the superiority of our method. ",

    "abstract": "3D object recognition has successfully become an appealing research topic in the real-world. However, most existing recognition models unreasonably assume that the categories of 3D objects cannot change over time in the real-world. This unrealistic assumption may result in significant performance degradation for them to learn new classes of 3D objects consecutively, due to the catastrophic forgetting on old learned classes. Moreover, they cannot explore which 3D geometric characteristics are essential to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting on old classes of 3D objects. To tackle the above challenges, we develop a novel Incremental 3D Object Recognition Network (i.e., InOR-Net), which could recognize new classes of 3D objects continuously via overcoming the catastrophic forgetting on old classes. Specifically, a category-guided geometric reasoning is proposed to reason local geometric structures with distinctive 3D characteristics of each class by leveraging intrinsic category information. We then propose a novel critic-induced geometric attention mechanism to distinguish which 3D geometric characteristics within each class are beneficial to overcome the catastrophic forgetting on old classes of 3D objects, while preventing the negative influence of useless 3D characteristics. In addition, a dual adaptive fairness compensations strategy is designed to overcome the forgetting brought by class imbalance, by compensating biased weights and predictions of the classifier. Comparison experiments verify the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed InOR-Net model on several public point cloud datasets. ",

The reliability and security issues of the NCS therefore become an essential problem. In this paper, we systematically investigated the adversarial threats to the RRAM-based NCS and observed that the RRAM hardware feature can be leveraged to strengthen the attack effect, which has not been granted sufficient attention by previous algorithmic attack methods. Thus, we proposed two types of hardware-aware attack methods with respect to different attack scenarios and objectives. The first is adversarial attack, VADER, which perturbs the input samples to mislead the prediction of neural networks. The second is fault injection attack, EFI, which perturbs the network parameter space such that a specified sample will be classified to a target label, while maintaining the prediction accuracy on other samples. Both attack methods leverage the RRAM properties to improve the performance compared with the conventional attack methods. Experimental results show that our hardware-aware attack methods can achieve nearly 100% attack success rate with extremely low operational cost, while maintaining the attack stealthiness. ",

Creating a high-quality prompt that consists of a subject and several modifiers can be time-consuming and costly.

In this paper, we propose a novel attack, namely prompt stealing attack, which aims to steal prompts from generated images by text-to-image generation models. Successful prompt stealing attacks direct violate the intellectual property and privacy of prompt engineers and also jeopardize the business model of prompt trading marketplaces. We first perform a large-scale analysis on a dataset collected by ourselves and show that a successful prompt stealing attack should consider a prompt's subject as well as its modifiers. We then propose the first learning-based prompt stealing attack, PromptStealer, and demonstrate its superiority over two baseline methods quantitatively and qualitatively. We also make some initial attempts to defend PromptStealer. In general, our study uncovers a new attack surface in the ecosystem created by the popular text-to-image generation models.

Over a thousand of such questions and answers are covered in a period from 1995 to early 2023. Given computational analysis based on text mining, the results indicate that (a) data protection has been actively debated in the Parliament during the past twenty years. No noticeable longitudinal trends are present; the debates have been relatively constant. As could be expected, (b) the specific data protection laws in the EU have frequently been referenced in these debates, which (c) do not seem to align along conventional political dimensions such as the left-right axis. Furthermore, (d) numerous distinct data protection topics have been debated by the parliamentarians, indicating that data protection politics in the EU go well-beyond the recently enacted regulations.

To alleviate this, Query Performance Prediction (QPP) models have been developed to estimate the performance of a system without the need for human-made relevance judgements. Such models, usually relying on lexical features from queries and corpora, have been applied to traditional sparse IR methods - with various degrees of success. With the advent of neural IR and large Pre-trained Language Models, the retrieval paradigm has significantly shifted towards more semantic signals. In this work, we study and analyze to what extent current QPP models can predict the performance of such systems. Our experiments consider seven traditional bag-of-words and seven BERT-based IR approaches, as well as nineteen state-of-the-art QPPs evaluated on two collections, Deep Learning '19 and Robust '04. Our findings show that QPPs perform statistically significantly worse on neural IR systems. In settings where semantic signals are prominent (e.g., passage retrieval), their performance on neural models drops by as much as 10% compared to bag-of-words approaches. On top of that, in lexical-oriented scenarios, QPPs fail to predict performance for neural IR systems on those queries where they differ from traditional approaches the most. ",

Second, in the space of these profile vectors, we present a method to fit a meta-classifier (decision tree) and express its output as a set of interpretable (human readable) explanation rules, which leads to several target diagnosis labels: data point is either correctly classified, or faulty due to a too weak model, or faulty due to mixed (overlapped) classes in the input space. Experimental results on several real datasets show more than 80% diagnosis label accuracy and confirm that the proposed intermediate representation allows to achieve a high degree of invariance with respect to the classifier used in the input space and to the dataset being classified, i.e. we can learn the metaclassifier on a dataset with a given classifier and successfully predict diagnosis labels for a different dataset or classifier (or both).

    "abstract": "Modeling user interest accurately is crucial to recommendation systems. Existing works capture user interest from historical behaviors. Due to the sparsity and noise in user behavior data, behavior based models learn incomplete and sometimes inaccurate preference patterns and easily suffer from the cold user problem. To address these issues, we propose a social graph enhanced framework for behavior based models, namely Social4Rec. The social graph involving multiple relation types is extracted to find users with similar interests. It is challenging due to the trivial and sparse relations in social graph. Specifically, we first propose a Cluster-Calibrate-Merge network (CCM) to discover interest groups satisfying three properties: intrinsic self-organizing patterns through cluster layer, robustness to sparse relations through knowledge distillation of calibrator layer. We then use the averaged user interest representation within each group from CCM to complete each user behavior embedding and obtain relation specific interest aware embedding. To alleviate the trivial relation problem, relation specific interest aware embedding are aggregated among relation types through attention mechanism to obtain the interest aware social embedding for each user. It is combined with user behavior embedding to derive the matching score between the user and item. Both offline and online experiments on Tencent Video, which is one of the biggest video recommendation platforms with nearly one billion users in China, demonstrate the superiority of our work, especially for cold users.

    "abstract": "Air quality prediction is a typical spatio-temporal modeling problem, which always uses different components to handle spatial and temporal dependencies in complex systems separately. Previous models based on time series analysis and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) methods have only modeled time series while ignoring spatial information. Previous GCNs-based methods usually require providing spatial correlation graph structure of observation sites in advance. The correlations among these sites and their strengths are usually calculated using prior information. However, due to the limitations of human cognition, limited prior information cannot reflect the real station-related structure or bring more effective information for accurate prediction. To this end, we propose a novel Dynamic Graph Neural Network with Adaptive Edge Attributes (DGN-AEA) on the message passing network, which generates the adaptive bidirected dynamic graph by learning the edge attributes as model parameters. Unlike prior information to establish edges, our method can obtain adaptive edge information through end-to-end training without any prior information. Thus reduced the complexity of the problem. Besides, the hidden structural information between the stations can be obtained as model by-products, which can help make some subsequent decision-making analyses. Experimental results show that our model received state-of-the-art performance than other baselines. ",

A solution to this problem is adjusting human reliance through communication using reliance calibration cues (RCCs) to help humans assess agents' capabilities. Previous studies typically attempted to calibrate reliance by continuously presenting RCCs, and when an agent should provide RCCs remains an open question. To answer this, we propose Pred-RC, a method for selectively providing RCCs. Pred-RC uses a cognitive reliance model to predict whether a human will assign a task to an agent. By comparing the prediction results for both cases with and without an RCC, Pred-RC evaluates the influence of the RCC on human reliance. We tested Pred-RC in a human-AI collaboration task and found that it can successfully calibrate human reliance with a reduced number of RCCs. ",

    "abstract": "Similarity, or clone, detection has important applications in copyright violation, software theft, code search, and the detection of malicious components. There is now a good number of open source and proprietary clone detectors for programs written in traditional programming languages. However, the increasing adoption of deep learning models in software poses a challenge to these tools: these models implement functions that are inscrutable black boxes. As more software includes these DNN functions, new techniques are needed in order to assess the similarity between deep learning components of software. Previous work has unveiled techniques for comparing the representations learned at various layers of deep neural network models by feeding canonical inputs to the models. Our goal is to be able to compare DNN functions when canonical inputs are not available -- because they may not be in many application scenarios. The challenge, then, is to generate appropriate inputs and to identify a metric that, for those inputs, is capable of representing the degree of functional similarity between two comparable DNN functions. Our approach uses random input with values between -1 and 1, in a shape that is compatible with what the DNN models expect. We then compare the outputs by performing correlation analysis. Our study shows how it is possible to perform similarity analysis even in the absence of meaningful canonical inputs. The response to random inputs of two comparable DNN functions exposes those functions' similarity, or lack thereof. Of all the metrics tried, we find that Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is the most powerful and versatile, although in special cases other methods and metrics are more expressive. We present a systematic empirical study comparing the effectiveness of several similarity metrics using a dataset of 56,355 classifiers collected from GitHub. This is accompanied by a sensitivity analysis that reveals how certain models' training related properties affect the effectiveness of the similarity metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows how similarity of DNN functions can be detected by using random inputs. Our study of correlation metrics, and the identification of Spearman correlation coefficient as the most powerful among them for this purpose, establishes a complete and practical method for DNN clone detection that can be used in the design of new tools. It may also serve as inspiration for other program analysis tasks whose approaches break in the presence of DNN components. ",

However, the trie-based algorithms, e.g., SAIL and Poptrie, mainly focus on the IPv4 ruleset but have disadvantages in the edge IPv6 ruleset with longer prefix length. The binary-based algorithm Hi-BST also has limited lookup speed with too many memory accesses. Therefore, we propose the SegMobaTree algorithm to achieve high-performance IPv6 lookup in the edge network. First, MobaTree is a multilayer online balanced tree to perform high-speed binary search among rules with different prefix lengths. Second, to avoid one large tree, we propose the dynamic programming method to split prefix lengths into a few suitable segments, which tradeoff between the number of segments and the scale of trees. Compared to SAIL, Poptrie, and Hi-BST, SegMobaTree achieves 1.5x, 1.7x, 1.6x lookup speed and 11.8x, 32.8x, 1.3x update speed with low memory cost. ",

Under the assumption of regular placement and a cumulative cache size that can be optimized across the different caches, we derive the fundamental limits of performance by introducing a novel cache-size optimization and placement scheme and a novel information-theoretic converse. The converse employs new index coding techniques to bypass traditional uniformity requirements, thus finely capturing the heterogeneity of the problem, and it provides a new approach to handle asymmetric settings. The new fundamental limits reveal that heterogeneous topologies can in fact outperform their homogeneous counterparts where each cache is associated to an equal number of users. These results are extended to capture the scenario of topological uncertainty where the perceived/estimated topology does not match the true network topology. This scenario is further elevated to the stochastic setting where the user-to-cache association is random and unknown, and it is shown that the proposed scheme is robust to such noisy or inexact knowledge on the topology.

While the problem was known to be \\NP-hard, it is natural to consider the case where only a small part of the graph is still to be drawn. Here, we establish the fixed-parameter tractability of the problem when parameterized by the size of the missing subgraph. Our algorithm is based on multiple novel ingredients which intertwine geometric and combinatorial arguments. These include the identification of a new graph representation of bend-equivalent regions for vertex placement in the plane, establishing a bound on the treewidth of this auxiliary graph, and a global point-grid that allows us to discretize the possible placement of bends and vertices into locally bounded subgrids for each of the above regions.

Recently developed ensemble feature selectors like the Repeated Elastic Net Technique for Feature Selection (RENT) and the User-Guided Bayesian Framework for Feature Selection (UBayFS) allow the user to identify such features in datasets with low sample sizes. While RENT is purely data-driven, UBayFS is capable of integrating expert knowledge a priori in the feature selection process. In this work we compare both feature selectors on a dataset comprising of 63 patients and 134 features from multiple sources, including basic patient characteristics, baseline blood values, tumor histology, imaging, and treatment information. Our experiments involve data-driven and expert-driven setups, as well as combinations of both. We use findings from clinical literature as a source of expert knowledge. Our results demonstrate that both feature selectors allow accurate predictions, and that expert knowledge has a stabilizing effect on the feature set, while the impact on predictive performance is limited. The features WHO Performance Status, Albumin, Platelets, Ki-67, Tumor Morphology, Total MTV, Total TLG, and SUVmax are the most stable and predictive features in our study. ",

In this work, we describe how to obtain adversarially-robust model soups (i.e., linear combinations of parameters) that smoothly trade-off robustness to different $\\ell_p$-norm bounded adversaries. We demonstrate that such soups allow us to control the type and level of robustness, and can achieve robustness to all threats without jointly training on all of them.

However, acquiring large annotated medical imaging datasets is a challenging task, especially for rare diseases, due to the high cost, time, and effort required for annotation. In these scenarios, unsupervised disease detection methods, such as anomaly detection, can save significant human effort. A typically used approach for anomaly detection is to learn the images from healthy subjects only, assuming the model will detect the images from diseased subjects as outliers. However, in many real-world scenarios, unannotated datasets with a mix of healthy and diseased individuals are available. Recent studies have shown improvement in unsupervised disease/anomaly detection using such datasets of unannotated images from healthy and diseased individuals compared to datasets that only include images from healthy individuals. A major issue remains unaddressed in these studies, which is selecting the best model for inference from a set of trained models without annotated samples. To address this issue, we propose Brainomaly, a GAN-based image-to-image translation method for neurologic disease detection using unannotated T1-weighted brain MRIs of individuals with neurologic diseases and healthy subjects. Brainomaly is trained to remove the diseased regions from the input brain MRIs and generate MRIs of corresponding healthy brains. Instead of generating the healthy images directly, Brainomaly generates an additive map where each voxel indicates the amount of changes required to make the input image look healthy. In addition, Brainomaly uses a pseudo-AUC metric for inference model selection, which further improves the detection performance. Our Brainomaly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by large margins. ",

When using gradient descent with logistic-loss minimization, we show that the training loss converges to zero at a rate of $\\tilde O(1/\\gamma^{2/k} T)$ given a polylogarithmic number of neurons. This suggests that gradient descent can find a perfect classifier for $n$ input data within $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ iterations.

This is in contrast to existing stability results which require polynomial width and yield suboptimal generalization rates. Central to our analysis is the use of a new self-bounded weak convexity property, which leads to a generalized local quasi-convexity property for sufficiently parameterized neural-network classifiers. Eventually, despite the objective's non-convexity, this leads to convergence and generalization-gap bounds that are similar to those in the convex setting of linear logistic regression. ",

    "abstract": "While enabling accelerated acquisition and improved reconstruction accuracy, current deep MRI reconstruction networks are typically supervised, require fully sampled data, and are limited to Cartesian sampling patterns. These factors limit their practical adoption as fully-sampled MRI is prohibitively time-consuming to acquire clinically. Further, non-Cartesian sampling patterns are particularly desirable as they are more amenable to acceleration and show improved motion robustness. To this end, we present a fully self-supervised approach for accelerated non-Cartesian MRI reconstruction which leverages self-supervision in both k-space and image domains. In training, the undersampled data are split into disjoint k-space domain partitions. For the k-space self-supervision, we train a network to reconstruct the input undersampled data from both the disjoint partitions and from itself. For the image-level self-supervision, we enforce appearance consistency obtained from the original undersampled data and the two partitions. Experimental results on our simulated multi-coil non-Cartesian MRI dataset demonstrate that DDSS can generate high-quality reconstruction that approaches the accuracy of the fully supervised reconstruction, outperforming previous baseline methods. Finally, DDSS is shown to scale to highly challenging real-world clinical MRI reconstruction acquired on a portable low-field (0.064 T) MRI scanner with no data available for supervised training while demonstrating improved image quality as compared to traditional reconstruction, as determined by a radiologist study.

    "abstract": "Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in sound event detection (SED). However, traditional convolution is deficient in learning time-frequency domain representation of different sound events. To address this issue, we propose multi-dimensional frequency dynamic convolution (MFDConv), a new design that endows convolutional kernels with frequency-adaptive dynamic properties along multiple dimensions. MFDConv utilizes a novel multi-dimensional attention mechanism with a parallel strategy to learn complementary frequency-adaptive attentions, which substantially strengthen the feature extraction ability of convolutional kernels. Moreover, in order to promote the performance of mean teacher, we propose the confident mean teacher to increase the accuracy of pseudo-labels from the teacher and train the student with high confidence labels. Experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve 0.470 and 0.692 of PSDS1 and PSDS2 on the DESED real validation dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a boom in self-supervised learning (SSL) in various areas including speech processing. Speech based SSL models present promising performance in a range of speech related tasks. However, the training of SSL models is computationally expensive and a common practice is to fine-tune a released SSL model on the specific task. It is essential to use consistent front-end input during pre-training and fine-tuning. This consistency may introduce potential issues when the optimal front-end is not the same as that used in pre-training. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective front-end adapter to address this front-end discrepancy. By minimizing the distance between the outputs of different front-ends, the filterbank feature (Fbank) can be compatible with SSL models which are pre-trained with waveform. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed front-end adapter on several popular SSL models for the speech recognition task. ",

    "abstract": "Traditional dynamic security assessment faces challenges as power systems are experiencing a transformation to inverter-based-resource (IBR) dominated systems, for which electromagnetic transient (EMT) dynamics have to be considered. However, EMT simulation is time-consuming especially for a large power grid because the mathematical model based on detailed component modeling is highly stiff and needs to be integrated at tiny time steps due to numerical stability. This paper proposes a heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) to address the simulation of a power system considering EMT dynamics as a multiscale problem. The method aims to accurately simulate the macroscopic dynamics of the system even when EMT dynamics are dominating. By force estimation using a kernel function, the proposed method automatically generates a macro model on the fly of simulation based on the micro model of EMT dynamics. It can flexibly switch between the micro- and macro-models to capture important EMT dynamics during some time intervals while skipping over other time intervals of less interest to achieve a superior simulation speed. The method is illustrated by a case study on a two-machine EMT model to demonstrate its potential for power system simulation. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised speech pre-training enables deep neural network models to capture meaningful and disentangled factors from raw waveform signals. The learned universal speech representations can then be used across numerous downstream tasks. These representations, however, are sensitive to distribution shifts caused by environmental factors, such as noise and/or room reverberation. Their large sizes, in turn, make them unfeasible for edge applications. In this work, we propose a knowledge distillation methodology termed RobustDistiller which compresses universal representations while making them more robust against environmental artifacts via a multi-task learning objective. The proposed layer-wise distillation recipe is evaluated on top of three well-established universal representations, as well as with three downstream tasks. Experimental results show the proposed methodology applied on top of the WavLM Base+ teacher model outperforming all other benchmarks across noise types and levels, as well as reverberation times. Oftentimes, the obtained results with the student model (24M parameters) achieved results inline with those of the teacher model (95M). ",

MS can critically affect different organs of the central nervous system such as the eyes, the spinal cord, and the brain. Background: To help physicians in diagnosing MS lesions, computer-aided methods are widely used. In this regard, a considerable research has been carried out in the area of automatic detection and segmentation of MS lesions in magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Methodology: In this study, we review the different approaches that have been used in computer-aided detection and segmentation of MS lesions. Our review resulted in categorizing MS lesion segmentation approaches into six broad categories: data-driven, statistical, supervised machine learning, unsupervised machine learning, fuzzy, and deep learning-based techniques. We critically analyze the different techniques under these approaches and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Results: From the study, we observe that a considerable amount of work, around 25% of related literature, is focused on statistical-based MS lesion segmentation techniques, followed by 21.15% for data-driven based methods, 19.23% for deep learning and 15.38% for supervised methods. Implication: The study points out the challenges/gaps to be addressed in future research. The study shows the work which has been done in last one decade in detection and segmentation of MS lesions. The results show that, in recent years, deep learning methods are outperforming all the others methods. ",

    "abstract": "Suppression of thoracic bone shadows on chest X-rays (CXRs) has been indicated to improve the diagnosis of pulmonary disease. Previous approaches can be categorized as unsupervised physical and supervised deep learning models. Nevertheless, with physical models able to preserve morphological details but at the cost of extremely long processing time, existing DL methods face challenges of gathering sufficient/qualitative ground truth (GT) for robust training, thus leading to failure in maintaining clinically acceptable false positive rates. We hereby propose a generalizable yet efficient workflow of two stages: (1) training pairs generation with GT bone shadows eliminated in by a physical model in spatially transformed gradient fields. (2) fully supervised image denoising network training on stage-one datasets for fast rib removal on incoming CXRs. For step two, we designed a densely connected network called SADXNet, combined with peak signal to noise ratio and multi-scale structure similarity index measure objective minimization to suppress bony structures. The SADXNet organizes spatial filters in U shape (e.g., X=7; filters = 16, 64, 256, 512, 256, 64, 16) and preserves the feature map dimension throughout the network flow. Visually, SADXNet can suppress the rib edge and that near the lung wall/vertebra without jeopardizing the vessel/abnormality conspicuity. Quantitively, it achieves RMSE of ~0 during testing with one prediction taking <1s. Downstream tasks including lung nodule detection as well as common lung disease classification and localization are used to evaluate our proposed rib suppression mechanism. We observed 3.23% and 6.62% area under the curve (AUC) increase as well as 203 and 385 absolute false positive decrease for lung nodule detection and common lung disease localization, separately. ",

However, many properties of deep neural networks are not yet understood. One such mystery is the depth degeneracy phenomenon: the deeper you make your network, the closer your network is to a constant function on initialization. In this paper, we examine the evolution of the angle between two inputs to a ReLU neural network as a function of the number of layers. By using combinatorial expansions, we find precise formulas for how fast this angle goes to zero as depth increases. Our formulas capture microscopic fluctuations that are not visible in the popular framework of infinite width limits, and yet have a significant effect on predicted behaviour. The formulas are given in terms of the mixed moments of correlated Gaussians passed through the ReLU function. We also find a surprising combinatorial connection between these mixed moments and the Bessel numbers. ",

To achieve this, we present two collaborative pretext tasks that explore the latent pathological or biological relationships between regions of interest and the similarity and dissimilarity information between subjects. Our method collaboratively learns the robust latent feature representations from radiomic data in a self-supervised manner to reduce human annotation efforts, which benefits the disease diagnosis. We compared our proposed method with other state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on a simulation study and two independent datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that our method outperforms other self-supervised learning methods on both classification and regression tasks. With further refinement, our method shows the potential advantage in automatic disease diagnosis with large-scale unlabeled data available. ",

Although the comparison of phylogenetic trees is well studied, and there are multiple ways to do it in an efficient way, the situation is much different for phylogenetic networks. Some classes of phylogenetic networks, mainly tree-child networks, are known to be classified efficiently by their $\\mu$-representation, which essentially counts, for every node, the number of paths to each leaf. In this paper, we introduce the extended $\\mu$-representation of networks, where the number of paths to reticulations is also taken into account. This modification allows us to distinguish orchard networks and to define a sound metric on the space of such networks that can, moreover, be computed efficiently. The class of orchard networks, as well as being one of the classes with biological significance (one such network can be interpreted as a tree with extra arcs involving coexisting organisms), is one of the most generic ones (in mathematical terms) for which such a representation can (conjecturally) exist, since a slight relaxation of the definition leads to a problem that is Graph Isomorphism Complete.

Similarity matching objectives have served as successful starting points for deriving online algorithms that map onto neural networks (NNs) with point neurons and Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity. These NN models account for many anatomical and physiological observations; however, the objectives have limited computational power and the derived NNs do not explain multi-compartmental neuronal structures and non-Hebbian forms of plasticity that are prevalent throughout the brain. In this article, we review and unify recent extensions of the similarity matching approach to address more complex objectives, including a broad range of unsupervised and self-supervised learning tasks that can be formulated as generalized eigenvalue problems or nonnegative matrix factorization problems. Interestingly, the online algorithms derived from these objectives naturally map onto NNs with multi-compartmental neurons and local, non-Hebbian learning rules. Therefore, this unified extension of the similarity matching approach provides a normative framework that facilitates understanding the multi-compartmental neuronal structures and non-Hebbian plasticity found throughout the brain.

In contrast to energy-based models, they avoid to pay the cost of inference during training, while enjoying statistical guarantees. However, without approximation, these approaches are condemned to be used only on a limited amount of training data. In this paper, we propose to equip surrogate kernel methods with approximations based on sketching, seen as low rank projections of feature maps both on input and output feature maps. We showcase the approach on Input Output Kernel ridge Regression (or Kernel Dependency Estimation) and provide excess risk bounds that can be in turn directly plugged on the final predictive model. An analysis of the complexity in time and memory show that sketching the input kernel mostly reduces training time while sketching the output kernel allows to reduce the inference time. Furthermore, we show that Gaussian and sub-Gaussian sketches are admissible sketches in the sense that they induce projection operators ensuring a small excess risk. Experiments on different tasks consolidate our findings. ",

However, their localization accuracy is still far from satisfactory due to the vulnerability to nonspeech interference. To improve the robustness against interference, we propose a DNN based normalized time-frequency (T-F) weighted criterion which minimizes the distance between the candidate steering vectors and the filtered snapshots in the T-F domain. Our method requires no eigendecomposition and uses a simple normalization to prevent the optimization objective from being misled by noisy filtered snapshots. We also study different designs of T-F weights guided by a DNN. We find that duplicating the Hadamard product of speech ratio masks is highly effective and better than other techniques such as direct masking and taking the mean in the proposed approach. However, the best-performing design of T-F weights is criterion-dependent in general. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms popular DNN based DoA estimation methods including widely used subspace methods in noisy and reverberant environments. ",
