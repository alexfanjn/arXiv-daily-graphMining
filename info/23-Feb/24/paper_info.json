    "abstract": "Knowledge tracing (KT) serves as a primary part of intelligent education systems. Most current KTs either rely on expert judgments or only exploit a single network structure, which affects the full expression of learning features. To adequately mine features of students' learning process, Deep Knowledge Tracing Based on Spatial and Temporal Deep Representation Learning for Learning Performance Prediction (DKT-STDRL) is proposed in this paper. DKT-STDRL extracts spatial features from students' learning history sequence, and then further extracts temporal features to extract deeper hidden information. Specifically, firstly, the DKT-STDRL model uses CNN to extract the spatial feature information of students' exercise sequences. Then, the spatial features are connected with the original students' exercise features as joint learning features. Then, the joint features are input into the BiLSTM part. Finally, the BiLSTM part extracts the temporal features from the joint learning features to obtain the prediction information of whether the students answer correctly at the next time step. Experiments on the public education datasets ASSISTment2009, ASSISTment2015, Synthetic-5, ASSISTchall, and Statics2011 prove that DKT-STDRL can achieve better prediction effects than DKT and CKT. ",

    "abstract": "This paper shows that the heterogeneity in neuronal and synaptic dynamics reduces the spiking activity of a Recurrent Spiking Neural Network (RSNN) while improving prediction performance, enabling spike-efficient (unsupervised) learning. We analytically show that the diversity in neurons' integration/relaxation dynamics improves an RSNN's ability to learn more distinct input patterns (higher memory capacity), leading to improved classification and prediction performance. We further prove that heterogeneous Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) dynamics of synapses reduce spiking activity but preserve memory capacity. The analytical results motivate Heterogeneous RSNN design using Bayesian optimization to determine heterogeneity in neurons and synapses to improve $\\mathcal{E}$, defined as the ratio of spiking activity and memory capacity. The empirical results on time series classification and prediction tasks show that optimized HRSNN increases performance and reduces spiking activity compared to a homogeneous RSNN. ",

    "abstract": "A popular way to define or characterize graph classes is via forbidden subgraphs or forbidden minors. These characterizations play a key role in graph theory, but they rarely lead to efficient algorithms to recognize these classes. In contrast, many essential graph classes can be recognized efficiently thanks to characterizations of the following form: there must exist an ordering of the vertices such that some ordered pattern does not appear, where a pattern is basically an ordered subgraph. These pattern characterizations have been studied for decades, but there have been recent efforts to better understand them systematically. In this paper, we focus on a simple problem at the core of this topic: given an ordered graph of size $n$, how fast can we detect whether a fixed pattern of size $k$ is present? Following the literature on graph classes recognition, we first look for patterns that can be detected in linear time. We prove, among other results, that almost all patterns on three vertices (which capture many interesting classes, such as interval, chordal, split, bipartite, and comparability graphs) fall in this category. Then, in a finer-grained complexity perspective, we prove conditional lower bounds for this problem. In particular we show that for a large family of patterns on four vertices it is unlikely that subquadratic algorithm exist. Finally, we define a parameter for patterns, the merge-width, and prove that for patterns of merge-width $t$, one can solve the problem in $O(n^{ct})$ for some constant~$c$. As a corollary, we get that detecting outerplanar patterns and other classes of patterns can be done in time independent of the size of the pattern. ",

Certified defenses provide guarantees on a model's robustness, but most of these defenses are restricted to a single attack type. In contrast, this paper proposes feature partition aggregation (FPA) - a certified defense against a union of attack types, namely evasion, backdoor, and poisoning attacks. We specifically consider an $\\ell_0$ or sparse attacker that arbitrarily controls an unknown subset of the training and test features - even across all instances. FPA generates robustness guarantees via an ensemble whose submodels are trained on disjoint feature sets. Following existing certified sparse defenses, we generalize FPA's guarantees to top-$k$ predictions. FPA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sparse defenses providing larger and stronger robustness guarantees, while simultaneously being up to 5,000${\\times}$ faster. ",

Aim: This study aims to develop a finer grain understanding of what makes a code review comment useful to OSS developers, to what extent a code review comment is considered useful to them, and how various contextual and participant-related factors influence its usefulness level. Method: On this goal, we have conducted a three-stage mixed-method study. We randomly selected 2,500 CR comments from the OpenDev Nova project and manually categorized the comments. We designed a survey of OpenDev developers to better understand their perspectives on useful CRs. Combining our survey-obtained scores with our manually labeled dataset, we trained two regression models - one to identify factors that influence the usefulness of CR comments and the other to identify factors that improve the odds of `Functional' defect identification over the others. Key findings: The results of our study suggest that a CR comment's usefulness is dictated not only by its technical contributions such as defect findings or quality improvement tips but also by its linguistic characteristics such as comprehensibility and politeness. While a reviewer's coding experience positively associates with CR usefulness, the number of mutual reviews, comment volume in a file, the total number of lines added /modified, and CR interval has the opposite associations. While authorship and reviewership experiences for the files under review have been the most popular attributes for reviewer recommendation systems, we do not find any significant association of those attributes with CR usefulness.

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient network traffic classification is important for many network management tasks, from traffic prioritization to anomaly detection. Although classifiers using pre-computed flow statistics (e.g., packet sizes, inter-arrival times) can be efficient, they may experience lower accuracy than techniques based on raw traffic, including packet captures. Past work on representation learning-based classifiers applied to network traffic captures has shown to be more accurate, but slower and requiring considerable additional memory resources, due to the substantial costs in feature preprocessing. In this paper, we explore this trade-off and develop the Adaptive Constraint-Driven Classification (AC-DC) framework to efficiently curate a pool of classifiers with different target requirements, aiming to provide comparable classification performance to complex packet-capture classifiers while adapting to varying network traffic load. AC-DC uses an adaptive scheduler that tracks current system memory availability and incoming traffic rates to determine the optimal classifier and batch size to maximize classification performance given memory and processing constraints. Our evaluation shows that AC-DC improves classification performance by more than 100% compared to classifiers that rely on flow statistics alone; compared to the state-of-the-art packet-capture classifiers, AC-DC achieves comparable performance (less than 12.3% lower in F1-Score), but processes traffic over 150x faster.

    "abstract": "Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a type of sampling-based model predictive control that simulates thousands of trajectories and uses these trajectories to synthesize optimal controls on-the-fly. In practice, however, MPPI encounters problems limiting its application. For instance, it has been observed that MPPI tends to make poor decisions if unmodeled dynamics or environmental disturbances exist, preventing its use in safety-critical applications. Moreover, the multi-threaded simulations used by MPPI require significant onboard computational resources, making the algorithm inaccessible to robots without modern GPUs. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel (Shield-MPPI) algorithm that provides robustness against unpredicted disturbances and achieves real-time planning using a much smaller number of parallel simulations on regular CPUs. The novel Shield-MPPI algorithm is tested on an aggressive autonomous racing platform both in simulation and using experiments. The results show that the proposed controller greatly reduces the number of constraint violations compared to state-of-the-art robust MPPI variants and stochastic MPC methods. ",

Recently, data-driven methods have been widely applied in traffic prediction and outperformed traditional methods. However, data-driven methods normally require massive data for training, while data scarcity is ubiquitous in low-developmental or newly constructed regions. To tackle this problem, we can extract meta knowledge from data-rich cities to data-scarce cities via transfer learning. Besides, relations among urban regions can be organized into various semantic graphs, e.g. proximity and POI similarity, which is barely considered in previous studies. In this paper, we propose Semantic-Fused Hierarchical Graph Transfer Learning (SF-HGTL) model to achieve knowledge transfer across cities with fused semantics. In detail, we employ hierarchical graph transformation followed by meta-knowledge retrieval to achieve knowledge transfer in various granularity. In addition, we introduce meta semantic nodes to reduce the number of parameters as well as share information across semantics. Afterwards, the parameters of the base model are generated by fused semantic embeddings to predict traffic status in terms of task heterogeneity. We implement experiments on five real-world datasets and verify the effectiveness of our SF-HGTL model by comparing it with other baselines. ",

    "title": "FTM: A Frame-level Timeline Modeling Method for Temporal Graph  Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Learning representations for graph-structured data is essential for graph analytical tasks. While remarkable progress has been made on static graphs, researches on temporal graphs are still in its beginning stage. The bottleneck of the temporal graph representation learning approach is the neighborhood aggregation strategy, based on which graph attributes share and gather information explicitly. Existing neighborhood aggregation strategies fail to capture either the short-term features or the long-term features of temporal graph attributes, leading to unsatisfactory model performance and even poor robustness and domain generality of the representation learning method. To address this problem, we propose a Frame-level Timeline Modeling (FTM) method that helps to capture both short-term and long-term features and thus learns more informative representations on temporal graphs. In particular, we present a novel link-based framing technique to preserve the short-term features and then incorporate a timeline aggregator module to capture the intrinsic dynamics of graph evolution as long-term features. Our method can be easily assembled with most temporal GNNs. Extensive experiments on common datasets show that our method brings great improvements to the capability, robustness, and domain generality of backbone methods in downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have significantly advanced face detection. In particular, lightweight CNNbased architectures have achieved great success due to their lowcomplexity structure facilitating real-time detection tasks. However, current lightweight CNN-based face detectors trading accuracy for efficiency have inadequate capability in handling insufficient feature representation, faces with unbalanced aspect ratios and occlusion. Consequently, they exhibit deteriorated performance far lagging behind the deep heavy detectors. To achieve efficient face detection without sacrificing accuracy, we design an efficient deep face detector termed EfficientFace in this study, which contains three modules for feature enhancement. To begin with, we design a novel cross-scale feature fusion strategy to facilitate bottom-up information propagation, such that fusing low-level and highlevel features is further strengthened. Besides, this is conducive to estimating the locations of faces and enhancing the descriptive power of face features. Secondly, we introduce a Receptive Field Enhancement module to consider faces with various aspect ratios. Thirdly, we add an Attention Mechanism module for improving the representational capability of occluded faces. We have evaluated EfficientFace on four public benchmarks and experimental results demonstrate the appealing performance of our method. In particular, our model respectively achieves 95.1% (Easy), 94.0% (Medium) and 90.1% (Hard) on validation set of WIDER Face dataset, which is competitive with heavyweight models with only 1/15 computational costs of the state-of-the-art MogFace detector.

    "abstract": "Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) photo has gradually become the standard configuration in advanced imaging devices. The new standard unveils many issues in existing approaches for low-light image enhancement (LLIE), especially in dealing with the intricate issue of joint luminance enhancement and noise removal while remaining efficient. Unlike existing methods that address the problem in the spatial domain, we propose a new solution, UHDFour, that embeds Fourier transform into a cascaded network. Our approach is motivated by a few unique characteristics in the Fourier domain: 1) most luminance information concentrates on amplitudes while noise is closely related to phases, and 2) a high-resolution image and its low-resolution version share similar amplitude patterns.Through embedding Fourier into our network, the amplitude and phase of a low-light image are separately processed to avoid amplifying noise when enhancing luminance. Besides, UHDFour is scalable to UHD images by implementing amplitude and phase enhancement under the low-resolution regime and then adjusting the high-resolution scale with few computations. We also contribute the first real UHD LLIE dataset, \\textbf{UHD-LL}, that contains 2,150 low-noise/normal-clear 4K image pairs with diverse darkness and noise levels captured in different scenarios. With this dataset, we systematically analyze the performance of existing LLIE methods for processing UHD images and demonstrate the advantage of our solution. We believe our new framework, coupled with the dataset, would push the frontier of LLIE towards UHD. The code and dataset are available at https://li-chongyi.github.io/UHDFour. ",

    "abstract": "Monaural speech enhancement has been widely studied using real networks in the time-frequency (TF) domain. However, the input and the target are naturally complex-valued in the TF domain, a fully complex network is highly desirable for effectively learning the feature representation and modelling the sequence in the complex domain. Moreover, phase, an important factor for perceptual quality of speech, has been proved learnable together with magnitude from noisy speech using complex masking or complex spectral mapping. Many recent studies focus on either complex masking or complex spectral mapping, ignoring their performance boundaries. To address above issues, we propose a fully complex dual-path dual-decoder conformer network (D2Former) using joint complex masking and complex spectral mapping for monaural speech enhancement. In D2Former, we extend the conformer network into the complex domain and form a dual-path complex TF self-attention architecture for effectively modelling the complex-valued TF sequence. We further boost the TF feature representation in the encoder and the decoders using a dual-path learning structure by exploiting complex dilated convolutions on time dependency and complex feedforward sequential memory networks (CFSMN) for frequency recurrence. In addition, we improve the performance boundaries of complex masking and complex spectral mapping by combining the strengths of the two training targets into a joint-learning framework. As a consequence, D2Former takes fully advantages of the complex-valued operations, the dual-path processing, and the joint-training targets. Compared to the previous models, D2Former achieves state-of-the-art results on the VoiceBank+Demand benchmark with the smallest model size of 0.87M parameters. ",

In this work, we study principles for designing data augmentations for out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. In particular, we focus on real-world scenarios in which some domain-dependent features are robust, i.e., some features that vary across domains are predictive OOD. For example, in the wildlife monitoring application above, image backgrounds vary across camera locations but indicate habitat type, which helps predict the species of photographed animals. Motivated by theoretical analysis on a linear setting, we propose targeted augmentations, which selectively randomize spurious domain-dependent features while preserving robust ones. We prove that targeted augmentations improve OOD performance, allowing models to generalize better with fewer domains. In contrast, existing approaches such as generic augmentations, which fail to randomize domain-dependent features, and domain-invariant augmentations, which randomize all domain-dependent features, both perform poorly OOD. In experiments on three real-world datasets, we show that targeted augmentations set new states-of-the-art for OOD performance by 3.2-15.2%. ",

    "abstract": "Physical simulations that accurately model reality are crucial for many engineering disciplines such as mechanical engineering and robotic motion planning. In recent years, learned Graph Network Simulators produced accurate mesh-based simulations while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost of traditional simulators. Yet, the resulting predictors are confined to learning from data generated by existing mesh-based simulators and thus cannot include real world sensory information such as point cloud data. As these predictors have to simulate complex physical systems from only an initial state, they exhibit a high error accumulation for long-term predictions. In this work, we integrate sensory information to ground Graph Network Simulators on real world observations. In particular, we predict the mesh state of deformable objects by utilizing point cloud data. The resulting model allows for accurate predictions over longer time horizons, even under uncertainties in the simulation, such as unknown material properties. Since point clouds are usually not available for every time step, especially in online settings, we employ an imputation-based model. The model can make use of such additional information only when provided, and resorts to a standard Graph Network Simulator, otherwise. We experimentally validate our approach on a suite of prediction tasks for mesh-based interactions between soft and rigid bodies. Our method results in utilization of additional point cloud information to accurately predict stable simulations where existing Graph Network Simulators fail. ",

This article argues we should scale different data center applications and environments in designing, implementing, and evaluating data center networking benchmarking. We build DCNetBench, the first application-driven data center network benchmarking that can scale to different users, underlying technologies, and varying benchmarking requirements. The methodology is as follows. We built an emulated system that can simulate networking with different configurations. Then we run applications on the emulated systems to capture the realistic network traffic patterns; we analyze and classify these patterns to model and replay those traces. Finally, we provide an automatic benchmarking framework to support this pipeline. The evaluations on DCNetBench show its scaleability, effectiveness, and diversity for data center network benchmarking. ",

To address the above issues, we propose a multi-stage search architecture in order to overcome asymmetric spectral-spatial dimensions and capture significant features. First, the asymmetric pooling on the spectral-spatial dimension maximally retains the essential features of HSI. Then, the 3D convolution with a selectable range of receptive fields overcomes the constraints of fixed-sized convolution kernels. Finally, we extend these two searchable operations to different layers of each stage to build the final architecture. Extensive experiments are conducted on two challenging HSI benchmarks including Indian Pines and Houston University, and results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with superior performance compared with the related works.

Here we examine the relationship between deep architectures and their respective training regimes, with their corresponding selective prediction and uncertainty estimation performance. We consider some of the most popular estimation performance metrics previously proposed including AUROC, ECE, AURC as well as coverage for selective accuracy constraint. We present a novel and comprehensive study of selective prediction and the uncertainty estimation performance of 523 existing pretrained deep ImageNet classifiers that are available in popular repositories. We identify numerous and previously unknown factors that affect uncertainty estimation and examine the relationships between the different metrics. We find that distillation-based training regimes consistently yield better uncertainty estimations than other training schemes such as vanilla training, pretraining on a larger dataset and adversarial training. Moreover, we find a subset of ViT models that outperform any other models in terms of uncertainty estimation performance. For example, we discovered an unprecedented 99% top-1 selective accuracy on ImageNet at 47% coverage (and 95% top-1 accuracy at 80%) for a ViT model, whereas a competing EfficientNet-V2-XL cannot obtain these accuracy constraints at any level of coverage.

It is very crucial to identify such activities accurately and reliably in order to enforce an anti-money laundering (AML).

From a given graph of money transfers between accounts of a bank, existing approaches attempted to detect money laundering. In particular, some approaches employ structural and behavioural dynamics of dense subgraph detection thereby not taking into consideration that money laundering involves high-volume flows of funds through chains of bank accounts. Some approaches model the transactions in the form of multipartite graphs to detect the complete flow of money from source to destination. However, existing approaches yield lower detection accuracy, making them less reliable. In this paper, we employ semi-supervised graph learning techniques on graphs of financial transactions in order to identify nodes involved in potential money laundering.

Our novel deep learning-based method is capable of learning EPs globally by solving an inverse scattering problem based on noisy and/or incomplete magnetic resonance (MR) measurements. \\textit{Methods:} We use two separate fully-connected neural networks, namely $B_1^{+}$ Net and EP Net, to learn the $B_1^{+}$ field and EPs at any location. A random Fourier features mapping is embedded into $B_1^{+}$ Net, which allows it to learn the $B_1^{+}$ field more efficiently. These two neural networks are trained jointly by minimizing the combination of a physics-informed loss and a data mismatch loss via gradient descent. \\textit{Results:} We showed that PIFON-EPT could provide physically consistent reconstructions of EPs and transmit field in the whole domain of interest even when half of the noisy MR measurements of the entire volume was missing. The average error was $2.49\\%$, $4.09\\%$ and $0.32\\%$ for the relative permittivity, conductivity and $B_{1}^{+}$, respectively, over the entire volume of the phantom. In experiments that admitted a zero assumption of $B_z$, PIFON-EPT could yield accurate EP predictions near the interface between regions of different EP values without requiring any boundary conditions. \\textit{Conclusion:} This work demonstrated the feasibility of PIFON-EPT, suggesting it could be an accurate and effective method for electrical properties estimation. \\textit{Significance:} PIFON-EPT can efficiently de-noise MR measurements, which shows the potential to improve other MR-based EPT techniques. Furthermore, it is the first time that MR-based EPT methods can reconstruct the EPs and $B_{1}^{+}$ field simultaneously from incomplete simulated noisy MR measurements. ",

To this end, we first propose a novel Local Deep Hiding (LDH) scheme that significantly increases the embedding rate by hiding large secret images into small local regions of cover images. Our scheme consists of three DNNs: hiding, locating, and revealing. We use the hiding network to convert a secret image in a small imperceptible compact secret code that is embedded into a random local region of a cover image. The locating network assists the revealing process by identifying the position of secret codes in the stego image, while the revealing network recovers all full-size secret images from these identified local regions. Our LDH achieves an extremely high embedding rate, i.e., $16\\times24$ bpp and exhibits superior robustness to common image distortions. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate our scheme under various system settings. We further quantitatively analyze the trade-off between the embedding rate and image quality with different image restoration algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "In the forensic studies of painting masterpieces, the analysis of the support is of major importance. For plain weave fabrics, the densities of vertical and horizontal threads are used as main features, while angle deviations from the vertical and horizontal axis are also of help. These features can be studied locally through the canvas. In this work, deep learning is proposed as a tool to perform these local densities and angle studies. We trained the model with samples from 36 paintings by Vel\\'azquez, Rubens or Ribera, among others. The data preparation and augmentation are dealt with at a first stage of the pipeline. We then focus on the supervised segmentation of crossing points between threads. The U-Net with inception and Dice loss are presented as good choices for this task. Densities and angles are then estimated based on the segmented crossing points. We report test results of the analysis of a few canvases and a comparison with methods in the frequency domain, widely used in this problem. We concluded that this new approach succeeds in some cases where the frequency analysis tools fail, while improving the results in others. Besides, our proposal does not need the labeling of part of the to-be-processed image. As case studies, we apply this novel algorithm to the analysis of two pairs of canvases by Vel\\'azquez and Murillo, to conclude that the fabrics used came from the same roll. ",

    "abstract": "The health and safety hazards posed by worn crane lifting ropes mandate periodic inspection for damage. This task is time-consuming, prone to human error, halts operation, and may result in the premature disposal of ropes. Therefore, we propose using deep learning and computer vision methods to automate the process of detecting damaged ropes. Specifically, we present a novel vision-based system for detecting damage in synthetic fiber rope images using convolutional neural networks (CNN). We use a camera-based apparatus to photograph the lifting rope's surface, while in operation, and capture the progressive wear-and-tear as well as the more significant degradation in the rope's health state. Experts from Konecranes annotate the collected images in accordance with the rope's condition; normal or damaged. Then, we pre-process the images, design a CNN model in a systematic manner, evaluate its detection and prediction performance, analyze its computational complexity, and compare it with various other models. Experimental results show the proposed model outperforms other techniques with 96.4% accuracy, 95.8% precision, 97.2% recall, 96.5% F1-score, and 99.2% AUC. Besides, they demonstrate the model's real-time operation, low memory footprint, robustness to various environmental and operational conditions, and adequacy for deployment in industrial systems. ",

    "abstract": "RGB-D semantic segmentation can be advanced with convolutional neural networks due to the availability of Depth data. Although objects cannot be easily discriminated by just the 2D appearance, with the local pixel difference and geometric patterns in Depth, they can be well separated in some cases. Considering the fixed grid kernel structure, CNNs are limited to lack the ability to capture detailed, fine-grained information and thus cannot achieve accurate pixel-level semantic segmentation. To solve this problem, we propose a Pixel Difference Convolutional Network (PDCNet) to capture detailed intrinsic patterns by aggregating both intensity and gradient information in the local range for Depth data and global range for RGB data, respectively. Precisely, PDCNet consists of a Depth branch and an RGB branch. For the Depth branch, we propose a Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) to consider local and detailed geometric information in Depth data via aggregating both intensity and gradient information. For the RGB branch, we contribute a lightweight Cascade Large Kernel (CLK) to extend PDC, namely CPDC, to enjoy global contexts for RGB data and further boost performance. Consequently, both modal data's local and global pixel differences are seamlessly incorporated into PDCNet during the information propagation process. Experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets, i.e., NYUDv2 and SUN RGB-D reveal that our PDCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance for the semantic segmentation task. ",

    "abstract": "Although fast adversarial training provides an efficient approach for building robust networks, it may suffer from a serious problem known as catastrophic overfitting (CO), where the multi-step robust accuracy suddenly collapses to zero. In this paper, we for the first time decouple the FGSM examples into data-information and self-information, which reveals an interesting phenomenon called \"self-fitting\". Self-fitting, i.e., DNNs learn the self-information embedded in single-step perturbations, naturally leads to the occurrence of CO. When self-fitting occurs, the network experiences an obvious \"channel differentiation\" phenomenon that some convolution channels accounting for recognizing self-information become dominant, while others for data-information are suppressed. In this way, the network learns to only recognize images with sufficient self-information and loses generalization ability to other types of data. Based on self-fitting, we provide new insight into the existing methods to mitigate CO and extend CO to multi-step adversarial training. Our findings reveal a self-learning mechanism in adversarial training and open up new perspectives for suppressing different kinds of information to mitigate CO. ",

    "abstract": "As cellular networks evolve towards the 6th Generation (6G), Machine Learning (ML) is seen as a key enabling technology to improve the capabilities of the network. ML provides a methodology for predictive systems, which, in turn, can make networks become proactive. This proactive behavior of the network can be leveraged to sustain, for example, a specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirement. With predictive Quality of Service (pQoS), a wide variety of new use cases, both safety- and entertainment-related, are emerging, especially in the automotive sector. Therefore, in this work, we consider maximum throughput prediction enhancing, for example, streaming or HD mapping applications. We discuss the entire ML workflow highlighting less regarded aspects such as the detailed sampling procedures, the in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, the effects of splits in the provided results, and the data availability. Reliable ML models need to face a lot of challenges during their lifecycle. We highlight how confidence can be built on ML technologies by better understanding the underlying characteristics of the collected data. We discuss feature engineering and the effects of different splits for the training processes, showcasing that random splits might overestimate performance by more than twofold. Moreover, we investigate diverse sets of input features, where network information proved to be most effective, cutting the error by half. Part of our contribution is the validation of multiple ML models within diverse scenarios. We also use Explainable AI (XAI) to show that ML can learn underlying principles of wireless networks without being explicitly programmed. Our data is collected from a deployed network that was under full control of the measurement team and covered different vehicular scenarios and radio environments. ",

To assess the generalizability and robustness of synthetic image detectors in the face of real-world impairments, this paper presents a large-scale dataset named ArtiFact, comprising diverse generators, object categories, and real-world challenges.

    "abstract": "Building advanced machine learning (ML) models requires expert knowledge and many trials to discover the best architecture and hyperparameter settings. Previous work demonstrates that model information can be leveraged to assist other attacks, such as membership inference, generating adversarial examples. Therefore, such information, e.g., hyperparameters, should be kept confidential. It is well known that an adversary can leverage a target ML model's output to steal the model's information. In this paper, we discover a new side channel for model information stealing attacks, i.e., models' scientific plots which are extensively used to demonstrate model performance and are easily accessible. Our attack is simple and straightforward. We leverage the shadow model training techniques to generate training data for the attack model which is essentially an image classifier. Extensive evaluation on three benchmark datasets shows that our proposed attack can effectively infer the architecture/hyperparameters of image classifiers based on convolutional neural network (CNN) given the scientific plot generated from it. We also reveal that the attack's success is mainly caused by the shape of the scientific plots, and further demonstrate that the attacks are robust in various scenarios. Given the simplicity and effectiveness of the attack method, our study indicates scientific plots indeed constitute a valid side channel for model information stealing attacks. To mitigate the attacks, we propose several defense mechanisms that can reduce the original attacks' accuracy while maintaining the plot utility. However, such defenses can still be bypassed by adaptive attacks. ",

They exploit the semi-supervised nature of deep learning, and they bypass computational bottlenecks associated with traditional graph learning methods. In addition to the feature matrix $X$, GNNs need an adjacency matrix $A$ to perform feature propagation. In many cases the adjacency matrix $A$ is missing. We introduce a graph construction scheme that construct the adjacency matrix $A$ using unsupervised and supervised information. Unsupervised information characterize the neighborhood around points. We used Principal Axis trees (PA-trees) as a source of unsupervised information, where we create edges between points falling onto the same leaf node. For supervised information, we used the concept of penalty and intrinsic graphs. A penalty graph connects points with different class labels, whereas intrinsic graph connects points with the same class label. We used the penalty and intrinsic graphs to remove or add edges to the graph constructed via PA-tree. This graph construction scheme was tested on two well-known GNNs: 1) Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and 2) Simple Graph Convolution (SGC). The experiments show that it is better to use SGC because it is faster and delivers better or the same results as GCN. We also test the effect of oversmoothing on both GCN and SGC. We found out that the level of smoothing has to be selected carefully for SGC to avoid oversmoothing. ",

Although it is computationally efficient to construct $k$-nn graphs, the constructed graph might not be very useful for learning. In a $k$-nn graph, points are restricted to have a fixed number of edges, and all edges in the graph have equal weights. We present a new way to construct the graph and initialize the GCN. It is based on random projection forest (rpForest). rpForest enables us to assign varying weights on edges indicating varying importance, which enhanced the learning. The number of trees is a hyperparameter in rpForest. We performed spectral analysis to help us setting this parameter in the right range.

Despite its success, the behavior and robustness of deep networks are not fully understood yet, posing a significant risk. In particular, researchers recently found that neural networks are overly confident in their predictions, even on data they have never seen before. To tackle this issue, one can differentiate two approaches in the literature. One accounts for uncertainty in the predictions, while the second estimates the underlying density of the training data to decide whether a given input is close to the training data, and thus the network is able to perform as expected.In this thesis, we investigate the capabilities of EBMs at the task of fitting the training data distribution to perform detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We find that on most datasets, EBMs do not inherently outperform other density estimators at detecting OOD data despite their flexibility. Thus, we additionally investigate the effects of supervision, dimensionality reduction, and architectural modifications on the performance of EBMs. Further, we propose Energy-Prior Network (EPN) which enables estimation of various uncertainties within an EBM for classification, bridging the gap between two approaches for tackling the OOD detection problem. We identify a connection between the concentration parameters of the Dirichlet distribution and the joint energy in an EBM. Additionally, this allows optimization without a held-out OOD dataset, which might not be available or costly to collect in some applications. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that Energy-Prior Network (EPN) is able to detect OOD inputs, datasets shifts, and adversarial examples. Theoretically, EPN offers favorable properties for the asymptotic case when inputs are far from the training data. ",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that representation learning plays a critical role in sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) from pixels. Unfortunately, in real-world scenarios, representation learning is usually fragile to task-irrelevant distractions such as variations in background or viewpoint.To tackle this problem, we propose a novel clustering-based approach, namely Clustering with Bisimulation Metrics (CBM), which learns robust representations by grouping visual observations in the latent space. Specifically, CBM alternates between two steps: (1) grouping observations by measuring their bisimulation distances to the learned prototypes; (2) learning a set of prototypes according to the current cluster assignments. Computing cluster assignments with bisimulation metrics enables CBM to capture task-relevant information, as bisimulation metrics quantify the behavioral similarity between observations. Moreover, CBM encourages the consistency of representations within each group, which facilitates filtering out task-irrelevant information and thus induces robust representations against distractions. An appealing feature is that CBM can achieve sample-efficient representation learning even if multiple distractions exist simultaneously.Experiments demonstrate that CBM significantly improves the sample efficiency of popular visual RL algorithms and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both multiple and single distraction settings.

Our DMMG consists of a viewpoint variation min-max game and an edge perturbation min-max game. These two min-max games adopt an adversarial paradigm to perform data augmentation on the skeleton sequences and graph-structured body joints, respectively. Our viewpoint variation min-max game focuses on constructing various hard contrastive pairs by generating skeleton sequences from various viewpoints. These hard contrastive pairs help our model learn representative action features, thus facilitating model transfer to downstream tasks. Moreover, our edge perturbation min-max game specializes in building diverse hard contrastive samples through perturbing connectivity strength among graph-based body joints. The connectivity-strength varying contrastive pairs enable the model to capture minimal sufficient information of different actions, such as representative gestures for an action while preventing the model from overfitting. By fully exploiting the proposed DMMG, we can generate sufficient challenging contrastive pairs and thus achieve discriminative action feature representations from unlabeled skeleton data in a self-supervised manner.

Concerns are growing about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of infected individuals, who are more likely to experience depression, which can have long-lasting consequences for both the affected individuals and the world. Detection and intervention at an early stage can reduce the risk of depression in COVID-19 patients. In this paper, we investigated the relationship between COVID-19 infection and depression through social media analysis. Firstly, we managed a dataset of COVID-19 patients that contains information about their social media activity both before and after infection. Secondly,We conducted an extensive analysis of this dataset to investigate the characteristic of COVID-19 patients with a higher risk of depression. Thirdly, we proposed a deep neural network for early prediction of depression risk. This model considers daily mood swings as a psychiatric signal and incorporates textual and emotional characteristics via knowledge distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms baselines in detecting depression risk, with an AUROC of 0.9317 and an AUPRC of 0.8116.

Specifically, we exploit the maximum classifier discrepancy (MCD) principle from DA that relates the target domain performance to the discrepancy of classifiers in the model hypothesis space. By Bayesian hypothesis modeling, we express the model hypothesis space effectively as a posterior distribution over classifiers given the source domains, making adversarial MCD minimisation feasible. On the DomainBed benchmark including the large-scale DomainNet dataset, the proposed approach yields significantly improved domain generalisation performance over the state-of-the-art. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, large strides have been taken in developing machine learning methods for dermatological applications, supported in part by the success of deep learning (DL). To date, diagnosing diseases from images is one of the most explored applications of DL within dermatology. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) are the most common (DL) method in medical imaging due to their training efficiency and accuracy, although they are often described as black boxes because of their limited explainability. One popular way to obtain insight into a ConvNet's decision mechanism is gradient class activation maps (Grad-CAM). A quantitative evaluation of the Grad-CAM explainability has been recently made possible by the release of DermXDB, a skin disease diagnosis explainability dataset which enables explainability benchmarking of ConvNet architectures. In this paper, we perform a literature review to identify the most common ConvNet architectures used for this task, and compare their Grad-CAM explanations with the explanation maps provided by DermXDB. We identified 11 architectures: DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, NASNetMobile, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, VGG16, and Xception. We pre-trained all architectures on an clinical skin disease dataset, and fine-tuned them on a DermXDB subset. Validation results on the DermXDB holdout subset show an explainability F1 score of between 0.35-0.46, with Xception displaying the highest explainability performance. NASNetMobile reports the highest characteristic-level explainability sensitivity, despite it's mediocre diagnosis performance. These results highlight the importance of choosing the right architecture for the desired application and target market, underline need for additional explainability datasets, and further confirm the need for explainability benchmarking that relies on quantitative analyses.

    "abstract": "ChatGPT is a recent chatbot service released by OpenAI and is receiving increasing attention over the past few months. While evaluations of various aspects of ChatGPT have been done, its robustness, i.e., the performance when facing unexpected inputs, is still unclear to the public. Robustness is of particular concern in responsible AI, especially for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of the robustness of ChatGPT from the adversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective. To do so, we employ the AdvGLUE and ANLI benchmarks to assess adversarial robustness and the Flipkart review and DDXPlus medical diagnosis datasets for OOD evaluation. We select several popular foundation models as baselines. Results show that ChatGPT does not show consistent advantages on adversarial and OOD classification tasks, while performing well on translation tasks. This suggests that adversarial and OOD robustness remains a significant threat to foundation models. Moreover, ChatGPT shows astounding performance in understanding dialogue-related texts and we find that it tends to provide informal suggestions for medical tasks instead of definitive answers. Finally, we present in-depth discussions of possible research directions. ",

    "abstract": "Learning Automaton (LA) is an adaptive self-organized model that improves its action-selection through interaction with an unknown environment. LA with finite action set can be classified into two main categories: fixed and variable structure. Furthermore, variable action-set learning automaton (VASLA) is one of the main subsets of variable structure learning automaton. In this paper, we propose VDHLA, a novel hybrid learning automaton model, which is a combination of fixed structure and variable action set learning automaton. In the proposed model, variable action set learning automaton can increase, decrease, or leave unchanged the depth of fixed structure learning automaton during the action switching phase. In addition, the depth of the proposed model can change in a symmetric (SVDHLA) or asymmetric (AVDHLA) manner. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first hybrid model that intelligently changes the depth of fixed structure learning automaton. Several computer simulations are conducted to study the performance of the proposed model with respect to the total number of rewards and action switching in stationary and non-stationary environments. The proposed model is compared with FSLA and VSLA. In order to determine the performance of the proposed model in a practical application, the selfish mining attack which threatens the incentive-compatibility of a proof-of-work based blockchain environment is considered. The proposed model is applied to defend against the selfish mining attack in Bitcoin and compared with the tie-breaking mechanism, which is a well-known defense. Simulation results in all environments have shown the superiority of the proposed model. ",

    "abstract": "Community is a fundamental and critical characteristic of an undirected social network, making community detection be a vital yet thorny issue in network representation learning. A symmetric and non-negative matrix factorization (SNMF) model is frequently adopted to address this issue owing to its great interpretability and scalability. However, it adopts a single latent factor matrix to represent an undirected network for precisely representing its symmetry, which leads to loss of representation learning ability due to the reduced latent space. Motivated by this discovery, this paper proposes a novel Constraints Fusion-induced Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CFS) model that adopts three-fold ideas: a) Representing a target undirected network with multiple latent factor matrices, thus preserving its representation learning capacity; b) Incorporating a symmetry-regularizer that preserves the symmetry of the learnt low-rank approximation to the adjacency matrix into the loss function, thus making the resultant detector well-aware of the target network's symmetry; and c) Introducing a graph-regularizer that preserves local invariance of the network's intrinsic geometry, thus making the achieved detector well-aware of community structure within the target network. Extensively empirical studies on eight real-world social networks from industrial applications demonstrate that the proposed CFS model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in achieving highly-accurate community detection results.

To provide this flexibility, services are offered by taking requested bandwidth profile into consideration, instead of assigning a fixed amount of bandwidth to each request. New techniques are developed for the resource management of the elastic optical networks to realize services with a specified bandwidth profile, consisting of minimum, average, and maximum required number of spectrum slots, in addition to holding time. In this work, two new schemes are proposed to realize such services, exploiting a probabilistic spectrum partitioning approach. This new probabilistic spectrum partitioning scheme is devised to enhance the chance of accommodating requests and consequently lower request blocking probability. It enforces different probabilities to contributing spectrum partitions in a certain service realization. Taking advantage of this probabilistic spectrum partitioning and a profile-based routing, we introduce two multistage spectrum assignment methods to make a certain lightpath meet the requested service profile constraints, considering the time-weighted average of the assigned spectrum slots. The results indicate that our algorithms can successfully realize the requests with the probability of 0.993, for erlangs lower than 400. ",

However, predicting financial distress for Small and Medium Enterprises is challenging due to their inherent ambiguity, leading to increased funding costs and decreased chances of receiving funds. While several strategies have been developed for effective FCP, their implementation, accuracy, and data security fall short of practical applications. Additionally, many of these strategies perform well for a portion of the dataset but are not adaptable to various datasets. As a result, there is a need to develop a productive prediction model for better order execution and adaptability to different datasets. In this review, we propose a feature selection algorithm for FCP based on element credits and data source collection. Current financial distress prediction models rely mainly on financial statements and disregard the timeliness of organization tests. Therefore, we propose a corporate FCP model that better aligns with industry practice and incorporates the gathering of thin-head component analysis of financial data, corporate governance qualities, and market exchange data with a Relevant Vector Machine. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy can improve the forecast efficiency of financial distress with fewer characteristic factors. ",

    "abstract": "Previous investigations into creative and innovation networks have suggested that innovations often occurs at the boundary between the network's core and periphery. In this work, we investigate the effect of global core-periphery network structure on the speed and quality of cultural innovation. Drawing on differing notions of core-periphery structure from [arXiv:1808.07801] and [doi:10.1016/S0378-8733(99)00019-2], we distinguish decentralized core-periphery, centralized core-periphery, and affinity network structure. We generate networks of these three classes from stochastic block models (SBMs), and use them to run an agent-based model (ABM) of collective cultural innovation, in which agents can only directly interact with their network neighbors. In order to discover the highest-scoring innovation, agents must discover and combine the highest innovations from two completely parallel technology trees. We find that decentralized core-periphery networks outperform the others by finding the final crossover innovation more quickly on average. We hypothesize that decentralized core-periphery network structure accelerates collective problem-solving by shielding peripheral nodes from the local optima known by the core community at any given time. We then build upon the \"Two Truths\" hypothesis regarding community structure in spectral graph embeddings, first articulated in [arXiv:1808.07801], which suggests that the adjacency spectral embedding (ASE) captures core-periphery structure, while the Laplacian spectral embedding (LSE) captures affinity. We find that, for core-periphery networks, ASE-based resampling best recreates networks with similar performance on the innovation SBM, compared to LSE-based resampling. Since the Two Truths hypothesis suggests that ASE captures core-periphery structure, this result further supports our hypothesis. ",

The previous works for the political stance problem focus on (1) identifying political factors that could reflect the political stance of a news article and (2) capturing those factors effectively. Despite their empirical successes, they are not sufficiently justified in terms of how effective their identified factors are in the political stance prediction. Motivated by this, in this work, we conduct a user study to investigate important factors in political stance prediction, and observe that the context and tone of a news article (implicit) and external knowledge for real-world entities appearing in the article (explicit) are important in determining its political stance. Based on this observation, we propose a novel knowledge-aware approach to political stance prediction (KHAN), employing (1) hierarchical attention networks (HAN) to learn the relationships among words and sentences in three different levels and (2) knowledge encoding (KE) to incorporate external knowledge for real-world entities into the process of political stance prediction. Also, to take into account the subtle and important difference between opposite political stances, we build two independent political knowledge graphs (KG) (i.e., KG-lib and KG-con) by ourselves and learn to fuse the different political knowledge. Through extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of DASH in terms of (1) accuracy, (2) efficiency, and (3) effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "One of the central economic paradigms in multi-agent systems is that agents should not be better off by acting dishonestly. In the context of collective decision-making, this axiom is known as strategyproofness and turns out to be rather prohibitive, even when allowing for randomization. In particular, Gibbard's random dictatorship theorem shows that only rather unattractive social decision schemes (SDSs) satisfy strategyproofness on the full domain of preferences. In this paper, we obtain more positive results by investigating strategyproof SDSs on the Condorcet domain, which consists of all preference profiles that admit a Condorcet winner. In more detail, we show that, if the number of voters $n$ is odd, every strategyproof and non-imposing SDS on the Condorcet domain can be represented as a mixture of dictatorial SDSs and the Condorcet rule (which chooses the Condorcet winner with probability $1$). Moreover, we prove that the Condorcet domain is a maximal connected domain that allows for attractive strategyproof SDSs if $n$ is odd as only random dictatorships are strategyproof and non-imposing on any sufficiently connected superset of it. We also derive analogous results for even $n$ by slightly extending the Condorcet domain. Finally, we also characterize the set of group-strategyproof and non-imposing SDSs on the Condorcet domain and its supersets. These characterizations strengthen Gibbard's random dictatorship theorem and establish that the Condorcet domain is essentially a maximal domain that allows for attractive strategyproof SDSs. ",

The results are shown to apply when the system to be observed is unstable. They also apply to situations where the communication networks are disconnected at every instant. They also apply to the usual connected static networks, or, switching networks that are connected at every time, as special cases. We present sufficient conditions for the existence of distributed observers for general linear systems over periodic communication networks. Using an averaging approach, it is shown that the proposed distributed observer can provide exponentially converging state estimates of the state of the linear system when the network is uniformly connected on average. This average connectedness condition offers a more relaxed assumption that includes periodic switching, Markovian switching and switching subject to the Cox process as special cases. All the nodes in the network share the estimated state with their neighbours through the network and cooperatively reconstruct the entire state locally. Furthermore, this study presents two exponential stability results for two classes of switched systems, providing valuable tools for future research in related distributed state estimation fields. A toy example and three practical applications are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. ",

    "abstract": "The widespread availability of internet access and handheld devices confers to social media a power similar to the one newspapers used to have. People seek affordable information on social media and can reach it within seconds. Yet this convenience comes with dangers; any user may freely post whatever they please and the content can stay online for a long period, regardless of its truthfulness. A need to detect untruthful information, also known as fake news, arises. In this paper, we present an end-to-end solution that accurately detects fake news and immunizes network nodes that spread them in real-time. To detect fake news, we propose two new stack deep learning architectures that utilize convolutional and bidirectional LSTM layers. To mitigate the spread of fake news, we propose a real-time network-aware strategy that (1) constructs a minimum-cost weighted directed spanning tree for a detected node, and (2) immunizes nodes in that tree by scoring their harmfulness using a novel ranking function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on five real-world datasets. ",

    "abstract": "While deep neural networks have led to major advances in image recognition, language translation, data mining, and game playing, there are well-known limits to the paradigm such as lack of explainability, difficulty of incorporating prior knowledge, and modularity. Neuro symbolic hybrid systems have recently emerged as a straightforward way to extend deep neural networks by incorporating ideas from symbolic reasoning such as computational logic. In this paper, we propose a list desirable criteria for neuro symbolic systems and examine how some of the existing approaches address these criteria. We then propose an extension to generalized annotated logic that allows for the creation of an equivalent neural architecture comprising an alternate neuro symbolic hybrid. However, unlike previous approaches that rely on continuous optimization for the training process, our framework is designed as a binarized neural network that uses discrete optimization. We provide proofs of correctness and discuss several of the challenges that must be overcome to realize this framework in an implemented system. ",

We introduce algorithms for this task that provide formal guarantees on the accuracy and calibration of probabilistic predictions even on adversarial input. We demonstrate the practical utility of our methods on several forecasting tasks, showing that our probabilistic predictions improve over natural baselines.

We propose a novel framework called Camera Pose Augmentation (CP+) to improve the camera poses and align them directly with the LiDAR-based point cloud. Initial coarse camera poses are given by LiDAR-Inertial or LiDAR-Inertial-Visual Odometry with approximate extrinsic parameters and time synchronization. The key steps to improve the alignment of the images consist of selecting a point cloud corresponding to a region of interest in each camera view, extracting reliable edge features from this point cloud, and deriving 2D-3D line correspondences which are used towards iterative minimization of the re-projection error.

We analyze the discrete case where load items are indivisible, moreover our results also carry over to the continuous case where load items can be split arbitrarily. For the choice of the matchings we consider three different models, random matchings of linear size, random matchings containing only single edges, and deterministic sequences of matchings covering the whole graph. We bound the discrepancy, which is defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum load. Our results cover a broad range of graph classes and, to the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first result for discrete and dynamic averaging load balancing processes. As our main technical contribution we develop a drift result that allows us to apply techniques based on the effective resistance in an electrical network to the setting of dynamic load balancing. ",

    "abstract": "Under good conditions, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive results on novel view synthesis tasks. NeRFs learn a scene's color and density fields by minimizing the photometric discrepancy between training views and differentiable renders of the scene. Once trained from a sufficient set of views, NeRFs can generate novel views from arbitrary camera positions. However, the scene geometry and color fields are severely under-constrained, which can lead to artifacts, especially when trained with few input views. To alleviate this problem we learn a prior over scene geometry and color, using a denoising diffusion model (DDM). Our DDM is trained on RGBD patches of the synthetic Hypersim dataset and can be used to predict the gradient of the logarithm of a joint probability distribution of color and depth patches. We show that, during NeRF training, these gradients of logarithms of RGBD patch priors serve to regularize geometry and color for a scene. During NeRF training, random RGBD patches are rendered and the estimated gradients of the log-likelihood are backpropagated to the color and density fields. Evaluations on LLFF, the most relevant dataset, show that our learned prior achieves improved quality in the reconstructed geometry and improved generalization to novel views. Evaluations on DTU show improved reconstruction quality among NeRF methods. ",

Some recent works represent the dynamic human as a canonical neural radiance field (NeRF) and a motion field, which are learned from videos through differentiable rendering. But the per-scene optimization generally requires hours. Other generalizable NeRF models leverage learned prior from datasets and reduce the optimization time by only finetuning on new scenes at the cost of visual fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning neural volumetric videos of dynamic humans from sparse view videos in minutes with competitive visual quality. Specifically, we define a novel part-based voxelized human representation to better distribute the representational power of the network to different human parts. Furthermore, we propose a novel 2D motion parameterization scheme to increase the convergence rate of deformation field learning. Experiments demonstrate that our model can be learned 100 times faster than prior per-scene optimization methods while being competitive in the rendering quality. Training our model on a $512 \\times 512$ video with 100 frames typically takes about 5 minutes on a single RTX 3090 GPU.

To produce valid intervals which are also adaptive to the difficulty of each instance, a common approach is to compute normalized nonconformity scores on a separate calibration set. Self-supervised learning has been effectively utilized in many domains to learn general representations for downstream predictors. However, the use of self-supervision beyond model pretraining and representation learning has been largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate how self-supervised pretext tasks can improve the quality of the conformal regressors, specifically by improving the adaptability of conformal intervals. We train an auxiliary model with a self-supervised pretext task on top of an existing predictive model and use the self-supervised error as an additional feature to estimate nonconformity scores. We empirically demonstrate the benefit of the additional information using both synthetic and real data on the efficiency (width), deficit, and excess of conformal prediction intervals. ",

Our approach models the semantic segmentation task as a region recognition problem.

This decoupled design has the benefit CLIP in recognizing the class of mask proposals. Since the attached side network can reuse CLIP features, it can be very light. In addition, the entire network can be trained end-to-end, allowing the side network to be adapted to the frozen CLIP model, which makes the predicted mask proposals CLIP-aware. Our approach is fast, accurate, and only adds a few additional trainable parameters. We evaluate our approach on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our method significantly outperforms other counterparts, with up to 18 times fewer trainable parameters and 19 times faster inference speed.

The early and intermediate regimes (i) and (ii) exhibit a rich phase diagram depending on learning rate $\\eta \\equiv c/\\lambda^H_0$, depth $d$, and width $w$. We identify several critical values of $c$ which separate qualitatively distinct phenomena in the early time dynamics of training loss and sharpness, and extract their dependence on $d/w$.

In this case, an attack is generated from a known surrogate \\eg, the ImageNet trained model, and transferred to change the decision of an unknown (black-box) model trained on an image dataset. However, attacks generated from image models do not capture the dynamic nature of a moving object or a changing scene due to a lack of temporal cues within image models. This leads to reduced transferability of adversarial attacks from representation-enriched \\emph{image} models such as Supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs), Self-supervised ViTs (\\eg, DINO), and Vision-language models (\\eg, CLIP) to black-box \\emph{video} models. In this work, we induce dynamic cues within the image models without sacrificing their original performance on images. To this end, we optimize \\emph{temporal prompts} through frozen image models to capture motion dynamics. Our temporal prompts are the result of a learnable transformation that allows optimizing for temporal gradients during an adversarial attack to fool the motion dynamics. Specifically, we introduce spatial (image) and temporal (video) cues within the same source model through task-specific prompts. Attacking such prompts maximizes the adversarial transferability from image-to-video and image-to-image models using the attacks designed for image models. Our attack results indicate that the attacker does not need specialized architectures, \\eg, divided space-time attention, 3D convolutions, or multi-view convolution networks for different data modalities.

We also propose to replace the length normalization pre-processing technique with a length scaling technique for the application of uncertainty propagation in the back-end. Experimental results on the VoxCeleb-1, SITW test sets as well as a domain-mismatched CNCeleb1-E set show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques with 14.5%-41.3% EER reductions and 4.6%-25.3% minDCF reductions.

    "title": "Bounds on Functionality and Symmetric Difference -- Two Intriguing Graph  Parameters",
    "abstract": "[Alecu et al.: Graph functionality, JCTB2021] define functionality, a graph parameter that generalizes graph degeneracy. They research the relation of functionality to many other graph parameters (tree-width, clique-width, VC-dimension, etc.). Extending their research, we prove logarithmic lower bound for functionality of random graph $G(n,p)$ for large range of $p$. Previously known graphs have functionality logarithmic in number of vertices. We show that for every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices we have $\\mathrm{fun}(G) \\le O(\\sqrt{ n \\log n})$ and we give a nearly matching $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$-lower bound provided by projective planes. Further, we study a related graph parameter \\emph{symmetric difference}, the minimum of $|N(u) \\Delta N(v)|$ over all pairs of vertices of the ``worst possible'' induced subgraph. It was observed by Alecu et al. that $\\mathrm{fun}(G) \\le \\mathrm{sd}(G)+1$ for every graph $G$. We compare $\\mathrm{fun}$ and $\\mathrm{sd}$ for the class $\\mathrm{INT}$ of interval graphs and $\\mathrm{CA}$ of circular-arc graphs. We let $\\mathrm{INT}_n$ denote the $n$-vertex interval graphs, similarly for $\\mathrm{CA}_n$. Alecu et al. ask, whether $\\mathrm{fun}(\\mathrm{INT})$ is bounded. Dallard et al. answer this positively in a recent preprint. On the other hand, we show that $\\Omega(\\sqrt[4]{n}) \\leq \\mathrm{sd}(\\mathrm{INT}_n) \\leq O(\\sqrt[3]{n})$. For the related class $\\mathrm{CA}$ we show that $\\mathrm{sd}(\\mathrm{CA}_n) = \\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$. We propose a follow-up question: is $\\mathrm{fun}(\\mathrm{CA})$ bounded? ",

    "abstract": "We propose an ML-based model that automates and expedites the solution of MIPs by predicting the values of variables. Our approach is motivated by the observation that many problem instances share salient features and solution structures since they differ only in few (time-varying) parameters. Examples include transportation and routing problems where decisions need to be re-optimized whenever commodity volumes or link costs change. Our method is the first to exploit the sequential nature of the instances being solved periodically, and can be trained with ``unlabeled'' instances, when exact solutions are unavailable, in a semi-supervised setting. Also, we provide a principled way of transforming the probabilistic predictions into integral solutions. Using a battery of experiments with representative binary MIPs, we show the gains of our model over other ML-based optimization approaches. ",

    "title": "EquiPocket: an E(3)-Equivariant Geometric Graph Neural Network for  Ligand Binding Site Prediction",
    "abstract": "Predicting the binding sites of the target proteins plays a fundamental role in drug discovery. Most existing deep-learning methods consider a protein as a 3D image by spatially clustering its atoms into voxels and then feed the voxelized protein into a 3D CNN for prediction. However, the CNN-based methods encounter several critical issues: 1) defective in representing irregular protein structures; 2) sensitive to rotations; 3) insufficient to characterize the protein surface; 4) unaware of data distribution shift. To address the above issues, this work proposes EquiPocket, an E(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) for binding site prediction. In particular, EquiPocket consists of three modules: the first one to extract local geometric information for each surface atom, the second one to model both the chemical and spatial structure of the protein, and the last one to capture the geometry of the surface via equivariant message passing over the surface atoms. We further propose a dense attention output layer to better alleviate the data distribution shift effect incurred by the variable protein size. Extensive experiments on several representative benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework to the state-of-the-art methods. ",
