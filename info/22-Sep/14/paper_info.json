    "abstract": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress in understanding molecules in a wide range of fields, existing models generally acquire the single cognitive ability from the single molecular modality. Since the hierarchy of molecular knowledge is profound, even humans learn from different modalities including both intuitive diagrams and professional texts to assist their understanding. Inspired by this, we propose a molecular multimodal foundation model which is pretrained from molecular graphs and their semantically related textual data (crawled from published Scientific Citation Index papers) via contrastive learning. This AI model represents a critical attempt that directly bridges molecular graphs and natural language. Importantly, through capturing the specific and complementary information of the two modalities, our proposed model can better grasp molecular expertise. Experimental results show that our model not only exhibits promising performance in cross-modal tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and molecule caption, but also enhances molecular property prediction and possesses capability to generate meaningful molecular graphs from natural language descriptions. We believe that our model would have a broad impact on AI-empowered fields across disciplines such as biology, chemistry, materials, environment, and medicine, among others. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks are, from a physical perspective, graphs whose `links` and `vertices` iteratively process data and solve tasks sub-optimally. We use Complex Network Theory (CNT) to represents Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as directed weighted graphs: within this framework, we introduce metrics to study DNNs as dynamical systems, with a granularity that spans from weights to layers, including neurons. CNT discriminates networks that differ in the number of parameters and neurons, the type of hidden layers and activations, and the objective task. We further show that our metrics discriminate low vs. high performing networks. CNT is a comprehensive method to reason about DNNs and a complementary approach to explain a model's behavior that is physically grounded to networks theory and goes beyond the well-studied input-output relation.

    "title": "Mathematical Framework for Online Social Media Regulation",
    "abstract": "Social media platforms (SMPs) leverage algorithmic filtering (AF) as a means of selecting the content that constitutes a user's feed with the aim of maximizing their rewards. Selectively choosing the contents to be shown on the user's feed may yield a certain extent of influence, either minor or major, on the user's decision-making, compared to what it would have been under a natural/fair content selection. As we have witnessed over the past decade, algorithmic filtering can cause detrimental side effects, ranging from biasing individual decisions to shaping those of society as a whole, for example, diverting users' attention from whether to get the COVID-19 vaccine or inducing the public to choose a presidential candidate. The government's constant attempts to regulate the adverse effects of AF are often complicated, due to bureaucracy, legal affairs, and financial considerations. On the other hand SMPs seek to monitor their own algorithmic activities to avoid being fined for exceeding the allowable threshold. In this paper, we mathematically formalize this framework and utilize it to construct a data-driven statistical algorithm to regulate the AF from deflecting users' beliefs over time, along with sample and complexity guarantees. We show that our algorithm is robust against potential adversarial users. This state-of-the-art algorithm can be used either by authorities acting as external regulators or by SMPs for self-regulation. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) aims to perform privacy-preserving machine learning on distributed data held by multiple data owners. To this end, FL requires the data owners to perform training locally and share the gradient updates (instead of the private inputs) with the central server, which are then securely aggregated over multiple data owners. Although aggregation by itself does not provably offer privacy protection, prior work showed that it may suffice if the batch size is sufficiently large. In this paper, we propose the Cocktail Party Attack (CPA) that, contrary to prior belief, is able to recover the private inputs from gradients aggregated over a very large batch size. CPA leverages the crucial insight that aggregate gradients from a fully connected layer is a linear combination of its inputs, which leads us to frame gradient inversion as a blind source separation (BSS) problem (informally called the cocktail party problem). We adapt independent component analysis (ICA)--a classic solution to the BSS problem--to recover private inputs for fully-connected and convolutional networks, and show that CPA significantly outperforms prior gradient inversion attacks, scales to ImageNet-sized inputs, and works on large batch sizes of up to 1024.

The basic task of an IDS is to act as the first line of defense, in detecting attacks on the internet. As intrusion tactics from intruders become more sophisticated and difficult to detect, researchers have started to apply novel Machine Learning (ML) techniques to effectively detect intruders and hence preserve internet users' information and overall trust in the entire internet network security. Over the last decade, there has been an explosion of research on intrusion detection techniques based on ML and Deep Learning (DL) architectures on various cyber security-based datasets such as the DARPA, KDDCUP'99, NSL-KDD, CAIDA, CTU-13, UNSW-NB15. In this research, we review contemporary literature and provide a comprehensive survey of different types of intrusion detection technique that applies Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithms as a classifier. We focus only on studies that have been evaluated on the two most widely used datasets in cybersecurity namely: the KDDCUP'99 and the NSL-KDD datasets. We provide a summary of each method, identifying the role of the SVMs classifier, and all other algorithms involved in the studies. Furthermore, we present a critical review of each method, in tabular form, highlighting the performance measures, strengths, and limitations of each of the methods surveyed. ",

    "abstract": "Query-based transformer has shown great potential in constructing long-range attention in many image-domain tasks, but has rarely been considered in LiDAR-based 3D object detection due to the overwhelming size of the point cloud data. In this paper, we propose CenterFormer, a center-based transformer network for 3D object detection. CenterFormer first uses a center heatmap to select center candidates on top of a standard voxel-based point cloud encoder. It then uses the feature of the center candidate as the query embedding in the transformer. To further aggregate features from multiple frames, we design an approach to fuse features through cross-attention. Lastly, regression heads are added to predict the bounding box on the output center feature representation. Our design reduces the convergence difficulty and computational complexity of the transformer structure. The results show significant improvements over the strong baseline of anchor-free object detection networks. CenterFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance for a single model on the Waymo Open Dataset, with 73.7% mAPH on the validation set and 75.6% mAPH on the test set, significantly outperforming all previously published CNN and transformer-based methods.

Techniques for CD include randomized experiments which are generally unbiased but expensive. It also includes algorithms like regression, matching, and Granger causality, which are only correct under strong assumptions made by human designers. However, as we found in other areas of machine learning, humans are usually not quite right and are usually outperformed by data-driven approaches. Here we test if we can improve causal discovery in a data-driven way. We take a system with a large number of causal components (transistors), the MOS 6502 processor, and meta-learn the causal discovery procedure represented as a neural network. We find that this procedure far outperforms human-designed causal discovery procedures, such as Mutual Information and Granger Causality. We argue that the causality field should consider, where possible, a supervised approach, where CD procedures are learned from large datasets with known causal relations instead of being designed by a human specialist. Our findings promise a new approach toward CD in neural and medical data and for the broader machine learning community. ",

    "abstract": "Risk assessment of roadways is commonly practiced based on historical crash data. Information on driver behaviors and real-time traffic situations is sometimes missing. In this paper, the Safe Route Mapping (SRM) model, a methodology for developing dynamic risk heat maps of roadways, is extended to consider driver behaviors when making predictions. An Android App is designed to gather drivers' information and upload it to a server. On the server, facial recognition extracts drivers' data, such as facial landmarks, gaze directions, and emotions. The driver's drowsiness and distraction are detected, and driving performance is evaluated. Meanwhile, dynamic traffic information is captured by a roadside camera and uploaded to the same server. A longitudinal-scanline-based arterial traffic video analytics is applied to recognize vehicles from the video to build speed and trajectory profiles. Based on these data, a LightGBM model is introduced to predict conflict indices for drivers in the next one or two seconds. Then, multiple data sources, including historical crash counts and predicted traffic conflict indicators, are combined using a Fuzzy logic model to calculate risk scores for road segments. The proposed SRM model is illustrated using data collected from an actual traffic intersection and a driving simulation platform. The prediction results show that the model is accurate, and the added driver behavior features will improve the model's performance. Finally, risk heat maps are generated for visualization purposes. The authorities can use the dynamic heat map to designate safe corridors and dispatch law enforcement and drivers for early warning and trip planning. ",

While prior neural approaches have often treated this as a sequence tagging problem with independent predictions, we put forward a checklist system, trained via reinforcement learning, that maintains a representation of recent predictions in addition to a hidden state, allowing it to learn soft constraints on output structure. We also demonstrate that by modifying input representations -- which in prior work using neural models have often taken the form of one-hot encodings over individual keys on the piano -- to encode relative position on the keyboard to the prior note instead, we can achieve much better performance. Additionally, we reassess the use of raw per-note labeling precision as an evaluation metric, noting that it does not adequately measure the fluency, i.e. human playability, of a model's output. To this end, we compare methods across several statistics which track the frequency of adjacent finger predictions that while independently reasonable would be physically challenging to perform in sequence, and implement a reinforcement learning strategy to minimize these as part of our training loss. Finally through human expert evaluation, we demonstrate significant gains in performability directly attributable to improvements with respect to these metrics. ",

Our approach represents an object category as a cuboid mesh and learns a generative model of the neural feature activations at each mesh vertex to perform pose estimation through differentiable rendering. A common problem of rendering-based approaches is that they rely on bounding box proposals, which do not convey information about the 3D rotation of the object and are not reliable when objects are partially occluded. Instead, we introduce a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy that utilizes the rendering process to estimate a sparse set of 6D object proposals, which are subsequently refined with gradient-based optimization. The key to enabling the convergence of our approach is a neural feature representation that is trained to be scale- and rotation-invariant using contrastive learning. Our experiments demonstrate an enhanced category-level 6D pose estimation performance compared to prior work, particularly under strong partial occlusion. ",

Previous research suggests diverse approaches to TKG reasoning that uses historical information. However, less attention has been given to the hierarchies within such information at different timestamps. Given that TKG is a sequence of knowledge graphs based on time, the chronology in the sequence derives hierarchies between the graphs. Furthermore, each knowledge graph has its hierarchical level which may differ from one another. To address these hierarchical characteristics in TKG, we propose HyperVC, which utilizes hyperbolic space that better encodes the hierarchies than Euclidean space. The chronological hierarchies between knowledge graphs at different timestamps are represented by embedding the knowledge graphs as vectors in a common hyperbolic space. Additionally, diverse hierarchical levels of knowledge graphs are represented by adjusting the curvatures of hyperbolic embeddings of their entities and relations. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show substantial improvements, especially on the datasets with higher hierarchical levels. ",

The IRS is powered via the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technique. The IRS boosts users' uplink signals to improve the network's longevity and energy efficiency. It simultaneously harvests energy with a non-linear energy harvesting circuit and reflects the incident signals by controlling its reflection coefficients and phase shifts. The trajectory of the UAV impacts the efficiency of these operations. We minimize the maximum energy consumption of all users by joint optimization of user scheduling, UAV trajectory/velocity, and IRS phase shifts/reflection coefficients while guaranteeing each user's minimum required data rate and harvested energy of the IRS. We first derive a closed-form solution for the IRS phase shifts and then address the non-convexity of the critical problem. Finally, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to optimize the remaining variables iteratively. We demonstrate the gains over several benchmarks. For instance, with a 50-element IRS, min-max energy consumption can be as low as 0.0404 (Joule), a 7.13% improvement over the No IRS case (achieving 0.0435 (Joule)). We also show that IRS-UAV without EH performs best at the cost of circuit power consumption of the IRS (a 20% improvement over the No IRS case). ",

We hypothesize that within these domains, agents tend to exhibit short-term motion patterns that reveal context information related to the agent's general direction, intermediate goals and rules of motion, e.g., social behavior. From this intuition, we propose Social-PatteRNN, an algorithm for recurrent, multi-modal trajectory prediction that exploits motion patterns to encode the aforesaid contexts. Our approach guides long-term trajectory prediction by learning to predict short-term motion patterns. It then extracts sub-goal information from the patterns and aggregates it as social context.

We consider complex manipulation tasks where there are constraints on the motion of the end effector of the robot. Examples of such tasks include opening a door, opening a drawer, transferring granular material from one container to another with a spoon, and loading dishes to a dishwasher. Our approach consists of two steps: First, using the fact that a motion in the task space of the robot can be approximated by using a sequence of constant screw motions, we segment a human demonstration into a sequence of constant screw motions. Second, we use the segmented screws to generate motion plans via screw-linear interpolation for other instances of the same task. The use of screw segmentation allows us to capture the invariants of the demonstrations in a coordinate-free fashion, thus allowing us to plan for different task instances from just one example. We present extensive experimental results on a variety of manipulation scenarios showing that our method can be used across a wide range of manipulation tasks. ",

    "abstract": "The knowledge graph (KG) is an essential form of knowledge representation that has grown in prominence in recent years. Because it concentrates on nominal entities and their relationships, traditional knowledge graphs are static and encyclopedic in nature. On this basis, event knowledge graph (Event KG) models the temporal and spatial dynamics by text processing to facilitate downstream applications, such as question-answering, recommendation and intelligent search. Existing KG research, on the other hand, mostly focuses on text processing and static facts, ignoring the vast quantity of dynamic behavioral information included in photos, movies, and pre-trained neural networks. In addition, no effort has been done to include behavioral intelligence information into the knowledge graph for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and robot learning. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic knowledge and skill graph (KSG), and then we develop a basic and specific KSG based on CN-DBpedia. The nodes are divided into entity and attribute nodes, with entity nodes containing the agent, environment, and skill (DRL policy or policy representation), and attribute nodes containing the entity description, pre-train network, and offline dataset. KSG can search for different agents' skills in various environments and provide transferable information for acquiring new skills. This is the first study that we are aware of that looks into dynamic KSG for skill retrieval and learning. Extensive experimental results on new skill learning show that KSG boosts new skill learning efficiency. ",

    "title": "Non-Parametric Temporal Adaptation for Social Media Topic Classification",
    "abstract": "User-generated social media data is constantly changing as new trends influence online discussion, causing distribution shift in test data for social media NLP applications. In addition, training data is often subject to change as user data is deleted. Most current NLP systems are static and rely on fixed training data. As a result, they are unable to adapt to temporal change -- both test distribution shift and deleted training data -- without frequent, costly re-training. In this paper, we study temporal adaptation through the task of longitudinal hashtag prediction and propose a non-parametric technique as a simple but effective solution: non-parametric classifiers use datastores which can be updated, either to adapt to test distribution shift or training data deletion, without re-training. We release a new benchmark dataset comprised of 7.13M Tweets from 2021, along with their hashtags, broken into consecutive temporal buckets. We compare parametric neural hashtag classification and hashtag generation models, which need re-training for adaptation, with a non-parametric, training-free dense retrieval method that returns the nearest neighbor's hashtags based on text embedding distance. In experiments on our longitudinal Twitter dataset we find that dense nearest neighbor retrieval has a relative performance gain of 64.12% over the best parametric baseline on test sets that exhibit distribution shift without requiring gradient-based re-training. Furthermore, we show that our datastore approach is particularly well-suited to dynamically deleted user data, with negligible computational cost and performance loss. Our novel benchmark dataset and empirical analysis can support future inquiry into the important challenges presented by temporality in the deployment of AI systems on real-world user data. ",

Hierarchical multi-label classification applies when a multi-class image classification problem is arranged into smaller ones based upon a hierarchy or taxonomy. Thus, hierarchical classification modes generally provide multiple class predictions on each instance, whereby these are expected to reflect the structure of image classes as related to one another. In this paper, we propose a multi-label capsule network (ML-CapsNet) for hierarchical classification. Our ML-CapsNet predicts multiple image classes based on a hierarchical class-label tree structure. To this end, we present a loss function that takes into account the multi-label predictions of the network. As a result, the training approach for our ML-CapsNet uses a coarse to fine paradigm while maintaining consistency with the structure in the classification levels in the label-hierarchy. We also perform experiments using widely available datasets and compare the model with alternatives elsewhere in the literature. In our experiments, our ML-CapsNet yields a margin of improvement with respect to these alternative methods. ",

In this paper, we present a straightforward yet effective defense strategy based on obfuscating the gradients of sensitive data with concealing data. Specifically, we alter a few samples within a mini batch to mimic the sensitive data at the gradient levels. Using a gradient projection technique, our method seeks to obscure sensitive data without sacrificing FL performance.

In lieu of analyzing traffic as raw packets, network analysts often rely on compressed network flows (netflows) that contain the start time, stop time, source, destination, and number of packets in each direction. However, many traffic analyses benefit from temporal aggregation of multiple simultaneous netflows, which can be computationally challenging. To alleviate this concern, a novel netflow compression and resampling method has been developed leveraging GraphBLAS hyperspace traffic matrices that preserve anonymization while enabling subrange analysis. Standard multitemporal spatial analyses are then performed on each subrange to generate detailed statistical aggregates of the source packets, source fan-out, unique links, destination fan-in, and destination packets of each subrange which can then be used for background modeling and anomaly detection. A simple file format based on GraphBLAS sparse matrices is developed for storing these statistical aggregates. This method is scale tested on the MIT SuperCloud using a 50 trillion packet netflow corpus from several hundred sites collected over several months. The resulting compression achieved is significant (<0.1 bit per packet) enabling extremely large netflow analyses to be stored and transported. The single node parallel performance is analyzed in terms of both processors and threads showing that a single node can perform hundreds of simultaneous analyses at over a million packets/sec (roughly equivalent to a 10 Gigabit link).

    "abstract": "Existing data-driven and feedback traffic control strategies do not consider the heterogeneity of real-time data measurements. Besides, traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods for traffic control usually converge slowly for lacking data efficiency. Moreover, conventional optimal perimeter control schemes require exact knowledge of the system dynamics and thus would be fragile to endogenous uncertainties. To handle these challenges, this work proposes an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) based approach to learning the macroscopic traffic dynamics for adaptive optimal perimeter control. This work makes the following primary contributions to the transportation literature: (a) A continuous-time control is developed with discrete gain updates to adapt to the discrete-time sensor data. (b) To reduce the sampling complexity and use the available data more efficiently, the experience replay (ER) technique is introduced to the IRL algorithm. (c) The proposed method relaxes the requirement on model calibration in a \"model-free\" manner that enables robustness against modeling uncertainty and enhances the real-time performance via a data-driven RL algorithm. (d) The convergence of the IRL-based algorithms and the stability of the controlled traffic dynamics are proven via the Lyapunov theory. The optimal control law is parameterized and then approximated by neural networks (NN), which moderates the computational complexity. Both state and input constraints are considered while no model linearization is required. Numerical examples and simulation experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "Rank aggregation with pairwise comparisons has shown promising results in elections, sports competitions, recommendations, and information retrieval. However, little attention has been paid to the security issue of such algorithms, in contrast to numerous research work on the computational and statistical characteristics. Driven by huge profits, the potential adversary has strong motivation and incentives to manipulate the ranking list. Meanwhile, the intrinsic vulnerability of the rank aggregation methods is not well studied in the literature. To fully understand the possible risks, we focus on the purposeful adversary who desires to designate the aggregated results by modifying the pairwise data in this paper. From the perspective of the dynamical system, the attack behavior with a target ranking list is a fixed point belonging to the composition of the adversary and the victim. To perform the targeted attack, we formulate the interaction between the adversary and the victim as a game-theoretic framework consisting of two continuous operators while Nash equilibrium is established. Then two procedures against HodgeRank and RankCentrality are constructed to produce the modification of the original data. Furthermore, we prove that the victims will produce the target ranking list once the adversary masters the complete information. It is noteworthy that the proposed methods allow the adversary only to hold incomplete information or imperfect feedback and perform the purposeful attack. The effectiveness of the suggested target attack strategies is demonstrated by a series of toy simulations and several real-world data experiments. These experimental results show that the proposed methods could achieve the attacker's goal in the sense that the leading candidate of the perturbed ranking list is the designated one by the adversary.

MFLD-net can achieve competitive or better results in low data regimes while being lightweight and therefore suitable for embedded and mobile devices. Furthermore, we show that MFLD-net can achieve keypoint (landmark) estimation accuracies on-par or even better than some of the state-of-the-art (CNNs) on a fish image dataset. Additionally, unlike ViT, MFLD-net does not need a pre-trained model and can generalise well when trained on a small dataset.

Simultaneously, deep learning-based deformable image registration is able to estimate discrete vector fields which warp one time step of a CMR sequence to the following in a self-supervised manner. However, despite the rich source of information included in these 3D+t vector fields, a standardised interpretation is challenging and the clinical applications remain limited so far. In this work, we show how to efficiently use a deformable vector field to describe the underlying dynamic process of a cardiac cycle in form of a derived 1D motion descriptor. Additionally, based on the expected cardiovascular physiological properties of a contracting or relaxing ventricle, we define a set of rules that enables the identification of five cardiovascular phases including the end-systole (ES) and end-diastole (ED) without the usage of labels. We evaluate the plausibility of the motion descriptor on two challenging multi-disease, -center, -scanner short-axis CMR datasets. First, by reporting quantitative measures such as the periodic frame difference for the extracted phases. Second, by comparing qualitatively the general pattern when we temporally resample and align the motion descriptors of all instances across both datasets.

    "abstract": "Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: adding well-crafted, imperceptible perturbations to their input can modify their output. Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches to training robust models against such attacks. Unfortunately, this method is much slower than vanilla training of neural networks since it needs to construct adversarial examples for the entire training data at every iteration. By leveraging the theory of coreset selection, we show how selecting a small subset of training data provides a principled approach to reducing the time complexity of robust training. To this end, we first provide convergence guarantees for adversarial coreset selection. In particular, we show that the convergence bound is directly related to how well our coresets can approximate the gradient computed over the entire training data. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we propose using this gradient approximation error as our adversarial coreset selection objective to reduce the training set size effectively. Once built, we run adversarial training over this subset of the training data. Unlike existing methods, our approach can be adapted to a wide variety of training objectives, including TRADES, $\\ell_p$-PGD, and Perceptual Adversarial Training. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach speeds up adversarial training by 2-3 times while experiencing a slight degradation in the clean and robust accuracy. ",

The effectiveness of logic obfuscation is challenged by the recently introduced Boolean satisfiability (SAT) attack and its variants. A plethora of countermeasures has also been proposed to thwart the SAT attack. Irrespective of the implemented defense against SAT attacks, large power, performance, and area overheads are indispensable. In contrast, we propose a cognitive solution: a neural network-based unSAT clause translator, SATConda, that incurs a minimal area and power overhead while preserving the original functionality with impenetrable security. SATConda is incubated with an unSAT clause generator that translates the existing conjunctive normal form (CNF) through minimal perturbations such as the inclusion of pair of inverters or buffers or adding a new lightweight unSAT block depending on the provided CNF. For efficient unSAT clause generation, SATConda is equipped with a multi-layer neural network that first learns the dependencies of features (literals and clauses), followed by a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) network to validate and backpropagate the SAT-hardness for better learning and translation. Our proposed SATConda is evaluated on ISCAS85 and ISCAS89 benchmarks and is seen to defend against multiple state-of-the-art successfully SAT attacks devised for hardware RE. In addition, we also evaluate our proposed SATCondas empirical performance against MiniSAT, Lingeling and Glucose SAT solvers that form the base for numerous existing deobfuscation SAT attacks. ",

Inspired by recent successes in image-to-image translation methods, we aim to perform style transfer for architectural photographs. However, the special composition in architectural photography poses great challenges for style transfer in this type of photographs. Existing neural style transfer methods treat the architectural images as a single entity, which would generate mismatched chrominance and destroy geometric features of the original architecture, yielding unrealistic lighting, wrong color rendition, and visual artifacts such as ghosting, appearance distortion, or color mismatching. In this paper, we specialize a neural style transfer method for architectural photography. Our method addresses the composition of the foreground and background in an architectural photograph in a two-branch neural network that separately considers the style transfer of the foreground and the background, respectively. Our method comprises a segmentation module, a learning-based image-to-image translation module, and an image blending optimization module. We trained our image-to-image translation neural network with a new dataset of unconstrained outdoor architectural photographs captured at different magic times of a day, utilizing additional semantic information for better chrominance matching and geometry preservation. Our experiments show that our method can produce photorealistic lighting and color rendition on both the foreground and background, and outperforms general image-to-image translation and arbitrary style transfer baselines quantitatively and qualitatively.

We prove optimal convergence of the proposed method under mild assumptions on the homogeneity, connectivity, and locality of the network on the coarse scale. The theoretical findings are numerically confirmed for both scalar-valued (heat conduction) and vector-valued (structural) models. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting mass in mammogram is significant due to the high occurrence and mortality of breast cancer. In mammogram mass detection, modeling pairwise lesion correspondence explicitly is particularly important. However, most of the existing methods build relatively coarse correspondence and have not utilized correspondence supervision. In this paper, we propose a new transformer-based framework CL-Net to learn lesion detection and pairwise correspondence in an end-to-end manner. In CL-Net, View-Interactive Lesion Detector is proposed to achieve dynamic interaction across candidates of cross views, while Lesion Linker employs the correspondence supervision to guide the interaction process more accurately. The combination of these two designs accomplishes precise understanding of pairwise lesion correspondence for mammograms. Experiments show that CL-Net yields state-of-the-art performance on the public DDSM dataset and our in-house dataset. Moreover, it outperforms previous methods by a large margin in low FPI regime. ",

However, there might be several rules that could be applied for reasoning for one relation, and how to select appropriate rules for completion of different triples has not been discussed. In this paper, we propose to take the context information into consideration, which helps select suitable rules for the inference tasks. Based on this idea, we propose a transformer-based rule mining approach, Ruleformer. It consists of two blocks: 1) an encoder extracting the context information from subgraph of head entities with modified attention mechanism, and 2) a decoder which aggregates the subgraph information from the encoder output and generates the probability of relations for each step of reasoning. The basic idea behind Ruleformer is regarding rule mining process as a sequence to sequence task. To make the subgraph a sequence input to the encoder and retain the graph structure, we devise a relational attention mechanism in Transformer. The experiment results show the necessity of considering these information in rule mining task and the effectiveness of our model. ",

The main idea is to train the DNN expert during executing the self-adaptive $hp$-finite element method ($hp$-FEM) algorithm and use it later to predict further $hp$ refinements. For the training, we use a two-grid paradigm self-adaptive $hp$-FEM algorithm. It employs the fine mesh to provide the optimal $hp$ refinements for coarse mesh elements. We aim to construct the DNN expert to identify quasi-optimal $hp$ refinements of the coarse mesh elements. During the training phase, we use the direct solver to obtain the solution for the fine mesh to guide the optimal refinements over the coarse mesh element. After training, we turn off the self-adaptive $hp$-FEM algorithm and continue with quasi-optimal refinements as proposed by the DNN expert trained. We test our method on three-dimensional Fichera and two-dimensional L-shaped domain problems. We verify the convergence of the numerical accuracy with respect to the mesh size. We show that the exponential convergence delivered by the self-adaptive $hp$-FEM can be preserved if we continue refinements with a properly trained DNN expert. Thus, in this paper, we show that from the self-adaptive $hp$-FEM it is possible to train the DNN expert the location of the singularities, and continue with the selection of the quasi-optimal $hp$ refinements, preserving the exponential convergence of the method.

In this survey, we first summarize the common types and typical cases of smart contract vulnerabilities from three levels, i.e., Solidity code layer, EVM execution layer, and Block dependency layer. Further, we review the research progress of smart contract vulnerability detection and classify existing counterparts into five categories, i.e., formal verification, symbolic execution, fuzzing detection, intermediate representation, and deep learning. Empirically, we take 300 real-world smart contracts deployed on Ethereum as the test samples and compare the representative methods in terms of accuracy, F1-Score, and average detection time. Finally, we discuss the challenges in the field of smart contract vulnerability detection and combine with the deep learning technology to look forward to future research directions. ",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a transfer learning approach to recalibrate our previously developed Wheel Odometry Neural Network (WhONet) for vehicle positioning in environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are unavailable. The WhONet has been shown to possess the capability to learn the uncertainties in the wheel speed measurements needed for correction and accurate positioning of vehicles. These uncertainties may be manifested as tyre pressure changes from driving on muddy and uneven terrains or wheel slips. However, a common cause for concern for data-driven approaches, such as the WhONet model, is usually the inability to generalise the models to a new vehicle. In scenarios where machine learning models are trained in a specific domain but deployed in another domain, the model's performance degrades. In real-life scenarios, several factors are influential to this degradation, from changes to the dynamics of the vehicle to new pattern distributions of the sensor's noise, and bias will make the test sensor data vary from training data. Therefore, the challenge is to explore techniques that allow the trained machine learning models to spontaneously adjust to new vehicle domains. As such, we propose the Recalibrated-Wheel Odometry neural Network (R-WhONet), that adapts the WhONet model from its source domain (a vehicle and environment on which the model is initially trained) to the target domain (a new vehicle on which the trained model is to be deployed). Through a performance evaluation on several GNSS outage scenarios - short-term complex driving scenarios, and on longer-term GNSS outage scenarios. We demonstrate that a model trained in the source domain does not generalise well to a new vehicle in the target domain. However, we show that our new proposed framework improves the generalisation of the WhONet model to new vehicles in the target domains by up to 32%. ",

Experiments are performed for two different datasets containing binaural recordings and synchronous sound event and acoustic scene labels to analyse the differences between performing SED and ASC separately or jointly. The presented results show that the use of specific binaural features, mainly the Generalized Cross Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-phat) and sines and cosines of phase differences, result in a better performing model in both separate and joint tasks as compared with baseline methods based on logmel energies only.

This problem is applicable to a broad variety of domains, including E-commerce networks, database systems, and program analysis. In reality, users are frequently most concerned with the hop-constrained cycles (i.e., cycles with a limited number of hops). For instance, in the E-commerce networks, the fraud detection team would discard cycles with a high number of hops since they are less relevant and grow exponentially in size. Thus, it is quite reasonable to investigate the feedback vertex set problem in the context of hop-constrained cycles, namely hop-constrained cycle cover problem. It is concerned with determining a set of vertices that covers all hop-constrained cycles in a given directed graph. A common method to solve this is to use a bottom-up algorithm, where it iteratively selects cover vertices into the result set. Based on this paradigm, the existing works mainly focus on the vertices orders and several heuristic strategies. In this paper, a totally opposite cover process topdown is proposed and bounds are presented on it. Surprisingly, both theoretical time complexity and practical performance are improved. ",

In this paper, a novel single image dehazing algorithm is introduced by combining model-based and data-driven approaches. Both transmission map and atmospheric light are first estimated by the model-based methods, and then refined by dual-scale generative adversarial networks (GANs) based approaches. The resultant algorithm forms a neural augmentation which converges very fast while the corresponding data-driven approach might not converge. Haze-free images are restored by using the estimated transmission map and atmospheric light as well as the Koschmiederlaw. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can remove haze well from real-world and synthetic hazy images. ",

Here the two discriminator networks - Global and Local work on different image ratios and use focal loss as generator loss. The proposed model has been thoroughly tested with different versions of DIBCO dataset having challenges like holes, erased or smudged ink, dust, and misplaced fibres.

    "abstract": "Efficiency and robustness are increasingly needed for applications on 3D point clouds, with the ubiquitous use of edge devices in scenarios like autonomous driving and robotics, which often demand real-time and reliable responses. The paper tackles the challenge by designing a general framework to construct 3D learning architectures with SO(3) equivariance and network binarization. However, a naive combination of equivariant networks and binarization either causes sub-optimal computational efficiency or geometric ambiguity. We propose to locate both scalar and vector features in our networks to avoid both cases. Precisely, the presence of scalar features makes the major part of the network binarizable, while vector features serve to retain rich structural information and ensure SO(3) equivariance. The proposed approach can be applied to general backbones like PointNet and DGCNN. Meanwhile, experiments on ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and the real-world dataset ScanObjectNN, demonstrated that the method achieves a great trade-off between efficiency, rotation robustness, and accuracy.

Specifically, we propose a novel language-aware detector OmDet and a novel training mechanism. The proposed multimodal detection network can resolve the technical challenges in multi-dataset joint training and it can generalize to arbitrary number of training datasets without the requirements for manual label taxonomy merging. Experiment results on COCO, Pascal VOC, and Wider Face/Pedestrian confirmed the efficacy by achieving on par or higher scores in joint training compared to training separately. Moreover, we pre-train on more than 20 million images with 4 million unique object vocabulary, and the resulting model is evaluated on 35 downstream tasks of ODinW. Results show that OmDet is able to achieve the state-of-the-art fine-tuned performance on ODinW.

Though large models significantly outperform their smaller counterparts, a survey with 2,631 participants reveals that around 70\\% displayed code completions from Copilot are not accepted by developers. Being reviewed but not accepted, these completions bring a threat to productivity. Besides, considering the high cost of the large models, it is a huge waste of computing resources and energy, which severely goes against the sustainable development principle of AI technologies. Additionally, in code completion systems, the completion requests are automatically and actively issued to the models as developers type out, which significantly aggravates the workload. However, to the best of our knowledge, such waste has never been realized, not to mention effectively addressed, in the context of neural code completion. Hence, preventing such profitless code completions from happening in a cost-friendly way is of urgent need. To fill this gap, we first investigate the prompts of these completions and find four observable prompt patterns, which demonstrate the feasibility of identifying such prompts based on prompts themselves. Motivated by this finding, we propose an early-rejection mechanism to turn down low-return prompts by foretelling the completion qualities without sending them to the LCM. Further, we propose a lightweight Transformer-based estimator to demonstrate the feasibility of the mechanism. The experimental results show that the estimator rejects low-return prompts with a promising accuracy of 83.2%. ",

These attacks can disadvantage a particular subgroup of nodes in GNN-based node classification, where nodes of the underlying network have sensitive attributes, such as race or gender. We conduct qualitative and experimental analyses explaining how adversarial link injection impairs the fairness of GNN predictions. For example, an attacker can compromise the fairness of GNN-based node classification by injecting adversarial links between nodes belonging to opposite subgroups and opposite class labels. Our experiments on empirical datasets demonstrate that adversarial fairness attacks can significantly degrade the fairness of GNN predictions (attacks are effective) with a low perturbation rate (attacks are efficient) and without a significant drop in accuracy (attacks are deceptive). This work demonstrates the vulnerability of GNN models to adversarial fairness attacks. We hope our findings raise awareness about this issue in our community and lay a foundation for the future development of GNN models that are more robust to such attacks. ",

To overcome this difficulty, we develop a weakly-supervised learning mechanism to train the stitching model without requiring genuine ground truth images. In addition, we propose a stitching model that takes multiple real-world fisheye images as inputs and creates a 360 output image in an equirectangular projection format. In particular, our model consists of color consistency corrections, warping, and blending, and is trained by perceptual and SSIM losses.

    "abstract": "With the current trend towards low Earth orbit mega-constellations with inter-satellite links, efficient routing in such highly dynamic space-borne networks is becoming increasingly important. Due to the distinct network topology, specifically tailored solutions are required. Firstly, the relative movement of the constellation causes frequent handover events between the satellites and the terminals on ground. Furthermore, unevenly distributed traffic demands lead to geographical hot spots. The physical size of the network also implies significant propagation delays. Therefore, monitoring the dynamic topology changes and link loads on a network-wide basis for routing purposes is typically impractical with massive signaling overhead. To address these issues, we propose a distributed load-balanced routing scheme based on Software Defined Networking. The approach divides the large-scale network into sub-sections, called clusters. In order to minimize signaling overhead, packets are forwarded between these clusters according to geographical heuristics. Within each cluster active Quality of Service-aware load-balancing is applied. The responsible on-board network controller forwards routing instructions based on the network state information in its cluster. We also analyze specific design choices for the clusters and the interfaces between them. The protocol has been implemented in a system-level simulator and compared to a source-routed benchmark solution. ",

Recent tools like llvm-mca, uiCA, and Ithemal use a variety of techniques and different models for their throughput predictions. When put to the test, it is common to see these state-of-the-art tools give very different results. These inconsistencies are either errors, or they point to different and rarely documented assumptions made by the tool designers. In this paper, we present AnICA, a tool taking inspiration from differential testing and abstract interpretation to systematically analyze inconsistencies among these code analyzers. Our evaluation shows that AnICA can summarize thousands of inconsistencies in a few dozen descriptions that directly lead to high-level insights into the different behavior of the tools. In several case studies, we further demonstrate how AnICA automatically finds and characterizes known and unknown bugs in llvm-mca, as well as a quirk in AMD's Zen microarchitectures. ",

In this work, we propose the M^2-3DLaneNet, a Multi-Modal framework for effective 3D lane detection. Aiming at integrating complementary information from multi-sensors, M^2-3DLaneNet first extracts multi-modal features with modal-specific backbones, then fuses them in a unified Bird's-Eye View (BEV) space. Specifically, our method consists of two core components. 1) To achieve accurate 2D-3D mapping, we propose the top-down BEV generation. Within it, a Line-Restricted Deform-Attention (LRDA) module is utilized to effectively enhance image features in a top-down manner, fully capturing the slenderness features of lanes. After that, it casts the 2D pyramidal features into 3D space using depth-aware lifting and generates BEV features through pillarization. 2) We further propose the bottom-up BEV fusion, which aggregates multi-modal features through multi-scale cascaded attention, integrating complementary information from camera and LiDAR sensors. Sufficient experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of M^2-3DLaneNet, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, i.e., 12.1% F1-score improvement on OpenLane dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), has been widely and successfully adopted in many critical applications for its high effectiveness and efficiency. The rapid development of DNNs has benefited from the existence of some high-quality datasets ($e.g.$, ImageNet), which allow researchers and developers to easily verify the performance of their methods. Currently, almost all existing released datasets require that they can only be adopted for academic or educational purposes rather than commercial purposes without permission. However, there is still no good way to ensure that. In this paper, we formulate the protection of released datasets as verifying whether they are adopted for training a (suspicious) third-party model, where defenders can only query the model while having no information about its parameters and training details. Based on this formulation, we propose to embed external patterns via backdoor watermarking for the ownership verification to protect them. Our method contains two main parts, including dataset watermarking and dataset verification. Specifically, we exploit poison-only backdoor attacks ($e.g.$, BadNets) for dataset watermarking and design a hypothesis-test-guided method for dataset verification. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets of different tasks are conducted, which verify the effectiveness of our method.

In the face of medical data scarcity and high-privacy, training such data-hungry models remains challenging. Federated learning brings an efficient solution to this issue by allowing to train models on multiple datasets, collected independently by different hospitals, in fully data-preserving manner. Although both state-of-the-art GNNs and federated learning techniques focus on boosting classification accuracy, they overlook a critical unsolved problem: investigating the reproducibility of the most discriminative biomarkers (i.e., features) selected by the GNN models within a federated learning paradigm. Quantifying the reproducibility of a predictive medical model against perturbations of training and testing data distributions presents one of the biggest hurdles to overcome in developing translational clinical applications. To the best of our knowledge, this presents the first work investigating the reproducibility of federated GNN models with application to classifying medical imaging and brain connectivity datasets. We evaluated our framework using various GNN models trained on medical imaging and connectomic datasets. More importantly, we showed that federated learning boosts both the accuracy and reproducibility of GNN models in such medical learning tasks.

In addition, the existing works use fixed parameters and network architecture to deblur images with different distribution and content information, which also affects the generalization ability of the model. In this paper, we propose a dynamic multi-scale network, named DMTNet, for dual-pixel images defocus deblurring. DMTNet mainly contains two modules: feature extraction module and reconstruction module. The feature extraction module is composed of several vision transformer blocks, which uses its powerful feature extraction capability to obtain richer features and improve the robustness of the model. The reconstruction module is composed of several Dynamic Multi-scale Sub-reconstruction Module (DMSSRM). DMSSRM can restore images by adaptively assigning weights to features from different scales according to the blur distribution and content information of the input images. DMTNet combines the advantages of transformer and CNN, in which the vision transformer improves the performance ceiling of CNN, and the inductive bias of CNN enables transformer to extract more robust features without relying on a large amount of data. DMTNet might be the first attempt to use vision transformer to restore the blurring images to clarity. By combining with CNN, the vision transformer may achieve better performance on small datasets. Experimental results on the popular benchmarks demonstrate that our DMTNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Autonomous mobile robots, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have received significant attention for their applications in construction. These platforms have great potential to automate and enhance the quality and frequency of the required data for many tasks such as construction schedule updating, inspections, and monitoring. Robust localization is a critical enabler for reliable deployments of autonomous robotic platforms. Automated robotic solutions rely mainly on the global positioning system (GPS) for outdoor localization. However, GPS signals are denied indoors, and pre-built environment maps are often used for indoor localization. This entails generating high-quality maps by teleoperating the mobile robot in the environment. Not only is this approach time-consuming and tedious, but it also is unreliable in indoor construction settings. Layout changes with construction progress, requiring frequent mapping sessions to support autonomous missions. Moreover, the effectiveness of vision-based solutions relying on visual features is highly impacted in low texture and repetitive areas on site. To address these challenges, we previously proposed a low-cost, lightweight tag-based visual-inertial localization method using AprilTags. Tags, in this method, are paper printable landmarks with known sizes and locations, representing the environment's quasi-map. Since tag placement/replacement is a manual process, it is subject to human errors. In this work, we study the impact of human error in the manual tag installation process and propose a stochastic approach to account for this uncertainty using the Lie group theory. Employing Monte Carlo simulation, we experimentally show that the proposed stochastic model incorporated in our on-manifold formulation improves the robustness and accuracy of tag-based localization against inevitable imperfections in manual tag installation on site.

However, far less attention has been paid to the overfitting problem of models in recommendation systems, which, on the contrary, is recognized as a critical issue for deep neural networks. In the context of Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, we observe an interesting one-epoch overfitting problem: the model performance exhibits a dramatic degradation at the beginning of the second epoch. Such a phenomenon has been witnessed widely in real-world applications of CTR models. Thereby, the best performance is usually achieved by training with only one epoch. To understand the underlying factors behind the one-epoch phenomenon, we conduct extensive experiments on the production data set collected from the display advertising system of Alibaba. The results show that the model structure, the optimization algorithm with a fast convergence rate, and the feature sparsity are closely related to the one-epoch phenomenon. We also provide a likely hypothesis for explaining such a phenomenon and conduct a set of proof-of-concept experiments. We hope this work can shed light on future research on training more epochs for better performance. ",

Constructing random walks in a graph, i.e., sequences of vertices selected with a specific probability distribution, is a prominent task in many of these graph applications as well as machine learning (ML) on graph-structured data. In a streaming scenario, random walks need to constantly keep up with the graph updates to avoid stale walks and thus, performance degradation in the downstream tasks. We present Wharf, a system that efficiently stores and updates random walks on streaming graphs. It avoids a potential size explosion by maintaining a compressed, high-throughput, and low-latency data structure. It achieves (i) the succinct representation by coupling compressed purely functional binary trees and pairing functions for storing the walks, and (ii) efficient walk updates by effectively pruning the walk search space. We evaluate Wharf, with real and synthetic graphs, in terms of throughput and latency when updating random walks. The results show the high superiority of Wharf over inverted index- and tree-based baselines. ",

Although the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss is the most popular option when dealing with natural images, for biomedical image segmentation the soft Dice loss is often preferred due to its ability to handle imbalanced scenarios. On the other hand, the combination of both functions has also been successfully applied in this kind of tasks. A much less studied problem is the generalization ability of all these losses in the presence of Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data. This refers to samples appearing in test time that are drawn from a different distribution than training images. In our case, we train our models on images that always contain lesions, but in test time we also have lesion-free samples. We analyze the impact of the minimization of different loss functions on in-distribution performance, but also its ability to generalize to OoD data, via comprehensive experiments on polyp segmentation from endoscopic images and ulcer segmentation from diabetic feet images. Our findings are surprising: CE-Dice loss combinations that excel in segmenting in-distribution images have a poor performance when dealing with OoD data, which leads us to recommend the adoption of the CE loss for this kind of problems, due to its robustness and ability to generalize to OoD samples.

Compared to other kinds of methods, the methods based on experience replay have shown great advantages to overcome catastrophic forgetting. One common limitation of this method is the data imbalance between the previous and current tasks, which would further aggravate forgetting. Moreover, how to effectively address the stability-plasticity dilemma in this setting is also an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, we overcome these challenges by proposing a novel framework called Meta-learning update via Multi-scale Knowledge Distillation and Data Augmentation (MMKDDA). Specifically, we apply multiscale knowledge distillation to grasp the evolution of long-range and short-range spatial relationships at different feature levels to alleviate the problem of data imbalance. Besides, our method mixes the samples from the episodic memory and current task in the online continual training procedure, thus alleviating the side influence due to the change of probability distribution. Moreover, we optimize our model via the meta-learning update resorting to the number of tasks seen previously, which is helpful to keep a better balance between stability and plasticity. Finally, our experimental evaluation on four benchmark datasets shows the effectiveness of the proposed MMKDDA framework against other popular baselines, and ablation studies are also conducted to further analyze the role of each component in our framework.

    "abstract": "Despite great success in many applications, deep neural networks are not always robust in practice. For instance, a convolutional neuron network (CNN) model for classification tasks often performs unsatisfactorily in classifying some particular classes of objects. In this work, we are concerned with patching the weak part of a CNN model instead of improving it through the costly retraining of the entire model. Inspired by the fundamental concepts of modularization and composition in software engineering, we propose a compressed modularization approach, CNNSplitter, which decomposes a strong CNN model for $N$-class classification into $N$ smaller CNN modules. Each module is a sub-model containing a part of the convolution kernels of the strong model. To patch a weak CNN model that performs unsatisfactorily on a target class (TC), we compose the weak CNN model with the corresponding module obtained from a strong CNN model. The ability of the weak CNN model to recognize the TC can thus be improved through patching. Moreover, the ability to recognize non-TCs is also improved, as the samples misclassified as TC could be classified as non-TCs correctly. Experimental results with two representative CNNs on three widely-used datasets show that the averaged improvement on the TC in terms of precision and recall are 12.54% and 2.14%, respectively. Moreover, patching improves the accuracy of non-TCs by 1.18%. The results demonstrate that CNNSplitter can patch a weak CNN model through modularization and composition, thus providing a new solution for developing robust CNN models. ",

Particularly, the LTL formula requires the system to reach and avoid certain regions in a temporal/logical order. We assume that the system is equipped with a finite set of trained NN controllers. Each controller has been trained so that it can drive the system towards a specific region of interest while avoiding others. Our goal is to check if there exists a temporal composition of the trained NN controllers - and if so, to compute it - that will yield composite system behaviors that satisfy a user-specified LTL task for any initial system state belonging to a given set. To address this problem, we propose a new approach that relies on a novel integration of automata theory and recently proposed reachability analysis tools for NN-controlled systems. We note that the proposed method can be applied to other controllers, not necessarily modeled by NNs, by appropriate selection of the reachability analysis tool. We focus on NN controllers due to their lack of robustness. The proposed method is demonstrated on navigation tasks for aerial vehicles. ",

Presented models suggest staging communicated data through host processes then using node-aware communication strategies for high inter-node message counts. Notably, the models also predict that node-aware communication utilizing all available CPU cores to communicate inter-node data leads to the most performant strategy when communicating with a high number of nodes.

    "title": "Mandator and Sporades: Robust Wide-Area Consensus with Efficient Request  Dissemination",
    "abstract": "Consensus algorithms are deployed in the wide area to achieve high availability for geographically replicated applications. Wide-area consensus is challenging due to two main reasons: (1) low throughput due to the high latency overhead of client request dissemination and (2) network asynchrony that causes consensus protocols to lose liveness. In this paper, we propose Mandator and Sporades, a modular state machine replication algorithm that enables high performance and resiliency in the wide-area setting. To address the high client request dissemination overhead challenge, we propose Mandator, a novel consensus-agnostic asynchronous dissemination layer. Mandator separates client request dissemination from the critical path of consensus to obtain high performance. Composing Mandator with Multi-Paxos (Mandator-Paxos) delivers significantly high throughput under synchronous networks. However, under asynchronous network conditions, Mandator-Paxos loses liveness which results in high latency. To achieve low latency and robustness under asynchrony, we propose Sporades, a novel omission fault-tolerant consensus algorithm. Sporades consists of two modes of operations -- synchronous and asynchronous -- that always ensure liveness. The combination of Mandator and Sporades (Mandator-Sporades) provides a robust and high-performing state machine replication system. We implement and evaluate Mandator-Sporades in a wide-area deployment running on Amazon EC2. Our evaluation shows that in the synchronous execution, Mandator-Sporades achieves 300k tx/sec throughput in less than 900ms latency, outperforming Multi-Paxos, EPaxos and Rabia by 650\\% in throughput, at a modest expense of latency. Furthermore, we show that Mandator-Sporades outperforms Mandator-Paxos, Multi-Paxos, and EPaxos in the face of targeted distributed denial-of-service attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Sarcasm can be defined as saying or writing the opposite of what one truly wants to express, usually to insult, irritate, or amuse someone. Because of the obscure nature of sarcasm in textual data, detecting it is difficult and of great interest to the sentiment analysis research community. Though the research in sarcasm detection spans more than a decade, some significant advancements have been made recently, including employing unsupervised pre-trained transformers in multimodal environments and integrating context to identify sarcasm. In this study, we aim to provide a brief overview of recent advancements and trends in computational sarcasm research for the English language. We describe relevant datasets, methodologies, trends, issues, challenges, and tasks relating to sarcasm that are beyond detection. Our study provides well-summarized tables of sarcasm datasets, sarcastic features and their extraction methods, and performance analysis of various approaches which can help researchers in related domains understand current state-of-the-art practices in sarcasm detection.

    "title": "Characterizing Graph Datasets for Node Classification: Beyond  Homophily-Heterophily Dichotomy",
    "abstract": "Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect similar nodes; the opposite is called heterophily. While homophily is natural for many real-world networks, there are also networks without this property. It is often believed that standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) do not perform well on non-homophilous graphs, and thus such datasets need special attention. While a lot of effort has been put into developing graph representation learning methods for heterophilous graphs, there is no universally agreed upon measure of homophily. Several metrics for measuring homophily have been used in the literature, however, we show that all of them have critical drawbacks preventing comparison of homophily levels between different datasets. We formalize desirable properties for a proper homophily measure and show how existing literature on the properties of classification performance metrics can be linked to our problem. In doing so we find a measure that we call adjusted homophily that satisfies more desirable properties than existing homophily measures. Interestingly, this measure is related to two classification performance metrics - Cohen's Kappa and Matthews correlation coefficient. Then, we go beyond the homophily-heterophily dichotomy and propose a new property that we call label informativeness (LI) that characterizes how much information a neighbor's label provides about a node's label. We theoretically show that LI is comparable across datasets with different numbers of classes and class size balance. Through a series of experiments we show that LI is a better predictor of the performance of GNNs on a dataset than homophily. We show that LI explains why GNNs can sometimes perform well on heterophilous datasets - a phenomenon recently observed in the literature. ",

    "abstract": "In the present work, we propose a Self-supervised COordinate Projection nEtwork (SCOPE) to reconstruct the artifacts-free CT image from a single SV sinogram by solving the inverse tomography imaging problem. Compared with recent related works that solve similar problems using implicit neural representation network (INR), our essential contribution is an effective and simple re-projection strategy that pushes the tomography image reconstruction quality over supervised deep learning CT reconstruction works. The proposed strategy is inspired by the simple relationship between linear algebra and inverse problems. To solve the under-determined linear equation system, we first introduce INR to constrain the solution space via image continuity prior and achieve a rough solution. And secondly, we propose to generate a dense view sinogram that improves the rank of the linear equation system and produces a more stable CT image solution space. Our experiment results demonstrate that the re-projection strategy significantly improves the image reconstruction quality (+3 dB for PSNR at least). Besides, we integrate the recent hash encoding into our SCOPE model, which greatly accelerates the model training. Finally, we evaluate SCOPE in parallel and fan X-ray beam SVCT reconstruction tasks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SCOPE model outperforms two latest INR-based methods and two well-popular supervised DL methods quantitatively and qualitatively. ",

The literature reports numerous investigations at different levels (world, regional, airline) considering various targeted attack strategies. However, few works consider the mesoscopic organization of the network. To fill this gap, we rely on the component structure recently introduced in the network literature. Indeed, the world air transportation network possesses seven local components capturing the regional flights in localized areas. Its global component, distributed worldwide, capture the interregional routes. We investigate the impact of two influential attacks (Degree, Betweenness) on the world air transportation network at the regional and inter-regional levels. Results show that the seven regions are isolated one after the other from the world air transportation network. Additionally, although the Betweenness attack effectively splits the network, its impact on regional routes is less pronounced. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks have a broad array of applications today due to their high degree of flexibility and ability to model nonlinear functions from data. However, the trustworthiness of neural networks is limited due to their black-box nature, their poor ability to generalize from small datasets, and their inconsistent convergence during training. Aluminum electrolysis is a complex nonlinear process with many interrelated sub-processes. Artificial neural networks can potentially be well suited for modeling the aluminum electrolysis process, but the safety-critical nature of this process requires trustworthy models. In this work, sparse neural networks are trained to model the system dynamics of an aluminum electrolysis simulator. The sparse model structure has a significantly reduction in model complexity compared to a corresponding dense neural network. We argue that this makes the model more interpretable. Furthermore, the empirical study shows that the sparse models generalize better from small training sets than dense neural networks. Moreover, training an ensemble of sparse neural networks with different parameter initializations show that the models converge to similar model structures with similar learned input features. ",

In this case, to construct one's outcome under a counterfactual treatment, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in its observed factual outcome on top of the covariates. We propose a deep variational Bayesian framework that rigorously integrates two main sources of information for outcome construction under a counterfactual treatment: one source is the individual features embedded in the high-dimensional factual outcome; the other source is the response distribution of similar subjects (subjects with the same covariates) that factually received this treatment of interest.

A proper coloring $\\alpha$ of $G$ is called an $L$-coloring of $G$ if $\\alpha(v)\\in L(v)$ for every $v\\in V(G)$. For a list assignment $L$ of $G$, the $L$-recoloring graph $\\mathcal{G}(G,L)$ of $G$ is a graph whose vertices correspond to the $L$-colorings of $G$ and two vertices of $\\mathcal{G}(G,L)$ are adjacent if their corresponding $L$-colorings differ at exactly one vertex of $G$. A $d$-face in a plane graph is a face of length $d$. Dvo\\v{r}\\'ak and Feghali conjectured for a planar graph $G$ and a list assignment $L$ of $G$, that: (i) If $|L(v)|\\geq 10$ for every $v\\in V(G)$, then the diameter of $\\mathcal{G}(G,L)$ is $O(|V(G)|)$. (ii) If $G$ is triangle-free and $|L(v)|\\geq 7$ for every $v\\in V(G)$, then the diameter of $\\mathcal{G}(G,L)$ is $O(|V(G)|)$. In a recent paper, Cranston (European J. Combin.

Let $G$ be a plane graph and $L$ be a list assignment of $G$. $\\bullet$ If for every $3$-face of $G$, there are at most two $3$-faces adjacent to it and $|L(v)|\\geq 10$ for every $v\\in V(G)$, then the diameter of $\\mathcal{G}(G,L)$ is at most $190|V(G)|$. $\\bullet$ If for every $3$-face of $G$, there is at most one $3$-face adjacent to it and $|L(v)|\\geq 9$ for every $v\\in V(G)$, then the diameter of $\\mathcal{G}(G,L)$ is at most $13|V(G)|$. $\\bullet$ If the faces adjacent to any $3$-face have length at least $6$ and $|L(v)|\\geq 7$ for every $v\\in V(G)$, then the diameter of $\\mathcal{G}(G,L)$ is at most $242|V(G)|$.

    "title": "Predicting Brain Multigraph Population From a Single Graph Template for  Boosting One-Shot Classification",
    "abstract": "A central challenge in training one-shot learning models is the limited representativeness of the available shots of the data space. Particularly in the field of network neuroscience where the brain is represented as a graph, such models may lead to low performance when classifying brain states (e.g., typical vs. autistic). To cope with this, most of the existing works involve a data augmentation step to increase the size of the training set, its diversity and representativeness. Though effective, such augmentation methods are limited to generating samples with the same size as the input shots (e.g., generating brain connectivity matrices from a single shot matrix). To the best of our knowledge, the problem of generating brain multigraphs capturing multiple types of connectivity between pairs of nodes (i.e., anatomical regions) from a single brain graph remains unsolved. In this paper, we unprecedentedly propose a hybrid graph neural network (GNN) architecture, namely Multigraph Generator Network or briefly MultigraphGNet, comprising two subnetworks: (1) a many-to-one GNN which integrates an input population of brain multigraphs into a single template graph, namely a connectional brain temple (CBT), and (2) a reverse one-to-many U-Net network which takes the learned CBT in each training step and outputs the reconstructed input multigraph population. Both networks are trained in an end-to-end way using a cyclic loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our MultigraphGNet boosts the performance of an independent classifier when trained on the augmented brain multigraphs in comparison with training on a single CBT from each class. We hope that our framework can shed some light on the future research of multigraph augmentation from a single graph.
