    "abstract": "Increasing the layer number of on-chip photonic neural networks (PNNs) is essential to improve its model performance. However, the successively cascading of network hidden layers results in larger integrated photonic chip areas. To address this issue, we propose the optical neural ordinary differential equations (ON-ODE) architecture that parameterizes the continuous dynamics of hidden layers with optical ODE solvers. The ON-ODE comprises the PNNs followed by the photonic integrator and optical feedback loop, which can be configured to represent residual neural networks (ResNet) and recurrent neural networks with effectively reduced chip area occupancy. For the interference-based optoelectronic nonlinear hidden layer, the numerical experiments demonstrate that the single hidden layer ON-ODE can achieve approximately the same accuracy as the two-layer optical ResNet in image classification tasks. Besides, the ONODE improves the model classification accuracy for the diffraction-based all-optical linear hidden layer. The time-dependent dynamics property of ON-ODE is further applied for trajectory prediction with high accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models have achieved unprecedented success in speech representation learning, but some questions regarding their representation ability remain unanswered. This paper addresses two of them: (1) Can SSL speech models deal with non-speech audio?; (2) Would different SSL speech models have insights into diverse aspects of audio features? To answer the two questions, we conduct extensive experiments on abundant speech and non-speech audio datasets to evaluate the representation ability of currently state-of-the-art SSL speech models, which are wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT in this paper. These experiments are carried out during NeurIPS 2021 HEAR Challenge as a standard evaluation pipeline provided by competition officials. Results show that (1) SSL speech models could extract meaningful features of a wide range of non-speech audio, while they may also fail on certain types of datasets; (2) different SSL speech models have insights into different aspects of audio features. The two conclusions provide a foundation for the ensemble of representation models. We further propose an ensemble framework to fuse speech representation models' embeddings. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art SSL speech/audio models and has generally superior performance on abundant datasets compared with other teams in HEAR Challenge.

From voice assistants to mobile healthcare and autonomous driving, we rely on the performance of AI methods for many critical tasks; therefore, it is essential to assert the performance of models in proper means to prevent damage. One of the shortfalls of AI models in general, and deep machine learning in particular, is a drop in performance when faced with shifts in the distribution of data. Nonetheless, these shifts are always expected in real-world applications; thus, a field of study has emerged, focusing on detecting out-of-distribution data subsets and enabling a more comprehensive generalization. Furthermore, as many deep learning based models have achieved near-perfect results on benchmark datasets, the need to evaluate these models' reliability and trustworthiness for pushing towards real-world applications is felt more strongly than ever. This has given rise to a growing number of studies in the field of out-of-distribution detection and domain generalization, which begs the need for surveys that compare these studies from various perspectives and highlight their straightens and weaknesses. This paper presents a survey that, in addition to reviewing more than 70 papers in this field, presents challenges and directions for future works and offers a unifying look into various types of data shifts and solutions for better generalization.

With the recent development of radar technologies and open-sourced annotated data sets, semantic segmentation with radar signals has become very promising. However, existing methods are either computationally expensive or discard significant amounts of valuable information from raw 3D radar signals by reducing them to 2D planes via averaging. In this work, we introduce ERASE-Net, an Efficient RAdar SEgmentation Network to segment the raw radar signals semantically. The core of our approach is the novel detect-then-segment method for raw radar signals. It first detects the center point of each object, then extracts a compact radar signal representation, and finally performs semantic segmentation. We show that our method can achieve superior performance on radar semantic segmentation task compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) technique. Furthermore, our approach requires up to 20x less computational resources. Finally, we show that the proposed ERASE-Net can be compressed by 40% without significant loss in performance, significantly more than the SOTA network, which makes it a more promising candidate for practical automotive applications.

Aiming to improve DN operational efficiency, as quantified by a generic optimal reactive power flow (ORPF) problem, we propose a two-stage approach. The first stage involves learning the manifold of optimal operating points determined by an ORPF instance. To synthesize local Volt/Var controllers, the learning task is partitioned into learning local surrogates (one per DER) of the optimal manifold with voltage input and reactive power output. Since these surrogates characterize efficient DN operating points, in the second stage, we develop local control schemes that steer the DN to these operating points. We identify the conditions on the surrogates and control parameters to ensure that the locally acting controllers collectively converge, in a global asymptotic sense, to a DN operating point agreeing with the local surrogates. We use neural networks to model the surrogates and enforce the identified conditions in the training phase. AC power flow simulations on the IEEE 37-bus network empirically bolster the theoretical stability guarantees obtained under linearized power flow assumptions. The tests further highlight the optimality improvement compared to prevalent benchmark methods. ",

A framework is proposed to optimize the decisions to unicast, multicast, broadcast, or not transmit updates to vehicles as well as power allocations to minimize the AoI and the RSU's power consumption over a time horizon. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP), thus a global optimal solution is difficult to achieve. In this context, we first develop an ant colony optimization (ACO) solution which provides near-optimal performance and thus serves as an efficient benchmark. Then, for real-time implementation, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that captures the vehicles' demands and channel conditions in the state space and assigns processes to vehicles through dynamic unicast-multicast scheduling actions. Complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms is presented. Simulation results depict interesting trade-offs between AoI and power consumption as a function of the network parameters. ",

In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning multi-task visuo-tactile representations in a self-supervised manner. We design a mechanism which enables a robot to autonomously collect spatially aligned visual and tactile data, a key property for downstream tasks. We then train visual and tactile encoders to embed these paired sensory inputs into a shared latent space using cross-modal contrastive loss. The learned representations are evaluated without fine-tuning on 5 perception and control tasks involving deformable surfaces: tactile classification, contact localization, anomaly detection (e.g., surgical phantom tumor palpation), tactile search from a visual query (e.g., garment feature localization under occlusion), and tactile servoing along cloth edges and cables. The learned representations achieve an 80% success rate on towel feature classification, a 73% average success rate on anomaly detection in surgical materials, a 100% average success rate on vision-guided tactile search, and 87.8% average servo distance along cables and garment seams. These results suggest the flexibility of the learned representations and pose a step toward task-agnostic visuo-tactile representation learning for robot control. ",

Here we develop the notion of geometric complexity, which is a measure of the variability of the model function, computed using a discrete Dirichlet energy. Using a combination of theoretical arguments and empirical results, we show that many common training heuristics such as parameter norm regularization, spectral norm regularization, flatness regularization, implicit gradient regularization, noise regularization and the choice of parameter initialization all act to control geometric complexity, providing a unifying framework in which to characterize the behavior of deep learning models.

Non-volatile memory (NVM) is an alternative to DRAM, but it has high latency and low bandwidth. We observe that the VM with heterogeneous memory may incur up to a $1.5\\times$ slowdown compared to a DRAM VM, if not managed well. However, none of the state-of-the-art heterogeneous memory management designs are customized for virtualization on a real system. In this paper, we propose HMM-V, a Heterogeneous Memory Management system for Virtualization. HMM-V automatically determines page hotness and migrates pages between DRAM and NVM to achieve performance close to the DRAM system. First, HMM-V tracks memory accesses through page table manipulation, but reduces the cost by leveraging Intel page-modification logging (PML) and a multi-level queue. Second, HMM-V quantifies the ``temperature'' of page and determines the hot set with bucket-sorting. HMM-V then efficiently migrates pages with minimal access pause and handles dirty pages with the assistance of PML. Finally, HMM-V provides pooling management to balance precious DRAM across multiple VMs to maximize utilization and overall performance. HMM-V is implemented on a real system with Intel Optane DC persistent memory. The four-VM co-running results show that HMM-V outperforms NUMA balancing and hardware management (Intel Optane memory mode) by $51\\%$ and $31\\%$, respectively. ",

Relatively, another interesting observation is Neural Collapse (NC), which means the feature variability may collapse during the terminal phase of training. Motivated by this, we propose to generate UAP by attacking the layer where NC phenomenon happens. Because of NC, the proposed attack could gather all the natural images' features to its surrounding, which is hence called Feature-Gathering UAP (FG-UAP). We evaluate the effectiveness our proposed algorithm on abundant experiments, including untargeted and targeted universal attacks, attacks under limited dataset, and transfer-based black-box attacks among different architectures including Vision Transformers, which are believed to be more robust. Furthermore, we investigate FG-UAP in the view of NC by analyzing the labels and extracted features of adversarial examples, finding that collapse phenomenon becomes stronger after the model is corrupted.

To address this issue, we propose a semi-synchronous PFL algorithm, termed as Semi-Synchronous Personalized FederatedAveraging (PerFedS$^2$), over mobile edge networks. By jointly optimizing the wireless bandwidth allocation and UE scheduling policy, it not only mitigates the straggler problem but also provides convergent training loss guarantees. We derive an upper bound of the convergence rate of PerFedS2 in terms of the number of participants per global round and the number of rounds. On this basis, the bandwidth allocation problem can be solved using analytical solutions and the UE scheduling policy can be obtained by a greedy algorithm. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of PerFedS2 in saving training time as well as guaranteeing the convergence of training loss, in contrast to synchronous and asynchronous PFL algorithms.

Therefore, object-scene relation actually plays a crucial role in anomaly detection but is inadequately explored in previous works. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Relation Learning (STRL) framework to tackle the video anomaly detection task. First, considering dynamic characteristics of the objects as well as scene areas, we construct a Spatio-Temporal Auto-Encoder (STAE) to jointly exploit spatial and temporal evolution patterns for representation learning. For better pattern extraction, two decoding branches are designed in the STAE module, i.e. an appearance branch capturing spatial cues by directly predicting the next frame, and a motion branch focusing on modeling the dynamics via optical flow prediction. Then, to well concretize the object-scene relation, a Relation Learning (RL) module is devised to analyze and summarize the normal relations by introducing the Knowledge Graph Embedding methodology. Specifically in this process, the plausibility of object-scene relation is measured by jointly modeling object/scene features and optimizable object-scene relation maps. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, and the superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. ",

Moreover, most of the existing deep learning traffic forecasting models are black box, presenting additional challenges related to explainability and interpretability. We develop Graph Pyramid Autoformer (X-GPA), an explainable attention-based spatial-temporal graph neural network that uses a novel pyramid autocorrelation attention mechanism. It enables learning from long temporal sequences on graphs and improves long-term traffic forecasting accuracy. Our model can achieve up to 35 % better long-term traffic forecast accuracy than that of several state-of-the-art methods. The attention-based scores from the X-GPA model provide spatial and temporal explanations based on the traffic dynamics, which change for normal vs. peak-hour traffic and weekday vs. weekend traffic.

    "abstract": "Feature extractor plays a critical role in text recognition (TR), but customizing its architecture is relatively less explored due to expensive manual tweaking. In this work, inspired by the success of neural architecture search (NAS), we propose to search for suitable feature extractors. We design a domain-specific search space by exploring principles for having good feature extractors. The space includes a 3D-structured space for the spatial model and a transformed-based space for the sequential model. As the space is huge and complexly structured, no existing NAS algorithms can be applied. We propose a two-stage algorithm to effectively search in the space. In the first stage, we cut the space into several blocks and progressively train each block with the help of an auxiliary head. We introduce the latency constraint into the second stage and search sub-network from the trained supernet via natural gradient descent. In experiments, a series of ablation studies are performed to better understand the designed space, search algorithm, and searched architectures. We also compare the proposed method with various state-of-the-art ones on both hand-written and scene TR tasks. Extensive results show that our approach can achieve better recognition performance with less latency. ",

Specifically, these methods firstly identify the reaction center, and break target molecule accordingly to generate synthons. Reactants are generated by either adding atoms sequentially to synthon graphs or directly adding proper leaving groups. However, both two strategies suffer since adding atoms results in a long prediction sequence which increases generation difficulty, while adding leaving groups can only consider the ones in the training set which results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end graph generation model for retrosynthesis prediction, which sequentially identifies the reaction center, generates the synthons, and adds motifs to the synthons to generate reactants. Since chemically meaningful motifs are bigger than atoms and smaller than leaving groups, our method enjoys lower prediction complexity than adding atoms and better generalization than adding leaving groups. Experiments on a benchmark dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art algorithms. ",

KENER first retrieves candidate entities for a sentence without mentions, and then utilizes the entity descriptions as extra information to help recognize mentions. The candidate entities retrieved by a dense retrieval module are especially useful when the input is short or noisy. Moreover, we investigate various data sampling strategies and design effective loss functions, in order to improve the quality of retrieved entities in both recognition and disambiguation stages.

Our results indicate that good performance can be achieved even when using only negative samples, if additional consideration is given to the training process.

The system, dubbed as NEURAL MARIONETTE, can produce high-quality and meaningful motions with smooth transitions from simple user input, including a sequence of action tags with expected action duration, and optionally a hand-drawn moving trajectory if the user specifies. The core of our system is a novel Transformer-based motion generation model, namely MARIONET, which can generate diverse motions given action tags. Different from existing motion generation models, MARIONET utilizes contextual information from the past motion clip and future action tag, dedicated to generating actions that can smoothly blend historical and future actions. Specifically, MARIONET first encodes target action tag and contextual information into an action-level latent code. The code is unfolded into frame-level control signals via a time unrolling module, which could be then combined with other frame-level control signals like the target trajectory. Motion frames are then generated in an auto-regressive way. By sequentially applying MARIONET, the system NEURAL MARIONETTE can robustly generate long-term, multi-action motions with the help of two simple schemes, namely \"Shadow Start\" and \"Action Revision\". Along with the novel system, we also present a new dataset dedicated to the multi-action motion synthesis task, which contains both action tags and their contextual information. Extensive experiments are conducted to study the action accuracy, naturalism, and transition smoothness of the motions generated by our system. ",

In addition, considering human's insensitivity to some specific color components, a channel-referenced watermark embedding method is designed for less impact on video quality. Moreover, compared with other methods' embedding watermark only at low frequencies, our method tends to modify low-frequency coefficients close to mid frequencies, further ensuring stable retention of the watermark information in the video encoding process.

However, research on 360{\\deg} ISOD has not been widely explored due to the lack of large, complex, high-resolution, and well-labeled datasets. Towards this end, we construct a large scale 360{\\deg} ISOD dataset with object-level pixel-wise annotation on equirectangular projection (ERP), which contains rich panoramic scenes with not less than 2K resolution and is the largest dataset for 360{\\deg} ISOD by far to our best knowledge. By observing the data, we find current methods face three significant challenges in panoramic scenarios: diverse distortion degrees, discontinuous edge effects and changeable object scales. Inspired by humans' observing process, we propose a view-aware salient object detection method based on a Sample Adaptive View Transformer (SAVT) module with two sub-modules to mitigate these issues. Specifically, the sub-module View Transformer (VT) contains three transform branches based on different kinds of transformations to learn various features under different views and heighten the model's feature toleration of distortion, edge effects and object scales. Moreover, the sub-module Sample Adaptive Fusion (SAF) is to adjust the weights of different transform branches based on various sample features and make transformed enhanced features fuse more appropriately. The benchmark results of 20 state-of-the-art ISOD methods reveal the constructed dataset is very challenging. Moreover, exhaustive experiments verify the proposed approach is practical and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. ",

The characteristics of frequent on-off ISLs, the highly dynamic network topology of satellite networks make it face the challenges of routing strategy design as a delay/interruption tolerant network (DTN). As a deterministic dynamic routing algorithm, contact graph routing (CGR) uses a contact plan to calculate the path and forward data, but it still has problems such as high computational overhead, low prediction accuracy caused by ignoring queue delay, and overbooked problem caused by limited cache. Therefore, we first start with the time-space resource contact graph (TSRCG) to accurately characterize the time-varying and predictable characteristics of the satellite network and the network resource parameters under multi-tasks. Then, we optimize the route-list computation and dynamic route computation process to ensure task delivery and reduce the consumption of various resources, such as contact capacity, computing resources, and storage resources. And the resource optimization for the multi-task delivery guarantee algorithm based on CGR (RMDG-CGR) strategy we propose is compared with standard CGR in ION 4.0.1. Finally, the simulation results show that the RMDG-CGR can achieve higher task delivery in advance and successful task delivery rate, save contact volume occupancy rate, computing and storage resource, and the above effects are more prominent, especially in the task scenario with critical bundles.

Neural network-based deep learning methods are effective for image classification, but they typically require large-scale training data and have major limitations such as requiring expertise to design network architectures and having poor interpretability. Evolutionary deep learning is a recent hot topic that combines evolutionary computation with deep learning. However, most evolutionary deep learning methods focus on evolving architectures of neural networks, which still suffer from limitations such as poor interpretability. To address this, this paper proposes a new genetic programming-based evolutionary deep learning approach to data-efficient image classification. The new approach can automatically evolve variable-length models using many important operators from both image and classification domains. It can learn different types of image features from colour or gray-scale images, and construct effective and diverse ensembles for image classification. A flexible multi-layer representation enables the new approach to automatically construct shallow or deep models/trees for different tasks and perform effective transformations on the input data via multiple internal nodes. The new approach is applied to solve five image classification tasks with different training set sizes. The results show that it achieves better performance in most cases than deep learning methods for data-efficient image classification. A deep analysis shows that the new approach has good convergence and evolves models with high interpretability, different lengths/sizes/shapes, and good transferability. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the large-scale deployment of space spacecraft entities and the increase of satellite onboard capabilities, delay/disruption tolerant network (DTN) emerged as a more robust communication protocol than TCP/IP in the case of excessive network dynamics. DTN node buffer management is still an active area of research, as the current implementation of the DTN core protocol still relies on the assumption that there is always enough memory available in different network nodes to store and forward bundles. In addition, the classical queuing theory does not apply to the dynamic management of DTN node buffers. Therefore, this paper proposes a centralized approach to automatically manage cognitive DTN nodes in low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation scenarios based on the advanced reinforcement learning (RL) strategy advantage actor-critic (A2C). The method aims to explore training a geosynchronous earth orbit intelligent agent to manage all DTN nodes in an LEO satellite constellation scenario. The goal of the A2C agent is to maximize delivery success rate and minimize network resource consumption cost while considering node memory utilization. The intelligent agent can dynamically adjust the radio data rate and perform drop operations based on bundle priority. In order to measure the effectiveness of applying A2C technology to DTN node management issues in LEO satellite constellation scenarios, this paper compares the trained intelligent agent strategy with the other two non-RL policies, including random and standard policies. Experiments show that the A2C strategy balances delivery success rate and cost, and provides the highest reward and the lowest node memory utilization. ",

The need of an efficient translation system becomes obvious in a large multilingual environment like India, where English and a set of Indian Languages (ILs) are officially used. In contrast with English, ILs are still entreated as low-resource languages due to unavailability of corpora. In order to address such asymmetric nature, multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) system evolves as an ideal approach in this direction. In this paper, we propose a MNMT system to address the issues related to low-resource language translation. Our model comprises of two MNMT systems i.e. for English-Indic (one-to-many) and the other for Indic-English (many-to-one) with a shared encoder-decoder containing 15 language pairs (30 translation directions). Since most of IL pairs have scanty amount of parallel corpora, not sufficient for training any machine translation model. We explore various augmentation strategies to improve overall translation quality through the proposed model. A state-of-the-art transformer architecture is used to realize the proposed model. Trials over a good amount of data reveal its superiority over the conventional models. In addition, the paper addresses the use of language relationships (in terms of dialect, script, etc.), particularly about the role of high-resource languages of the same family in boosting the performance of low-resource languages. Moreover, the experimental results also show the advantage of backtranslation and domain adaptation for ILs to enhance the translation quality of both source and target languages. Using all these key approaches, our proposed model emerges to be more efficient than the baseline model in terms of evaluation metrics i.e BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) score for a set of ILs.

In this work, we explore the security goals of the repository administrators and the requirements for deployments of such malware scanners via a case study of the Python ecosystem and PyPI repository, which includes interviews with administrators and maintainers. Further, we evaluate existing malware detection techniques for deployment in this setting by creating a benchmark dataset and comparing several existing tools, including the malware checks implemented in PyPI, Bandit4Mal, and OSSGadget's OSS Detect Backdoor. We find that repository administrators have exacting technical demands for such malware detection tools. Specifically, they consider a false positive rate of even 0.01% to be unacceptably high, given the large number of package releases that might trigger false alerts. Measured tools have false positive rates between 15% and 97%; increasing thresholds for detection rules to reduce this rate renders the true positive rate useless. In some cases, these checks emitted alerts more often for benign packages than malicious ones. However, we also find a successful socio-technical malware detection system: external security researchers also perform repository malware scans and report the results to repository administrators. These parties face different incentives and constraints on their time and tooling. We conclude with recommendations for improving detection capabilities and strengthening the collaboration between security researchers and software repository administrators. ",

Evaluation is performed on the famous FaceForensics++ dataset, which contains four sub-datasets, Deepfakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap and NeuralTextures. The best results are from Xception, where the accuracy could surpass over 99\\% when the training and test set are both from the same sub-dataset. In comparison, the results drop dramatically when the training set mismatches the test set. This phenomenon reveals the challenge of creating a universal deepfake detection system. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate joint sensor-actuator cyber attacks in discrete event systems. We assume that attackers can attack some sensors and actuators at the same time by altering observations and control commands. Because of the nondeterminism in observation and control caused by cyber attacks, the behavior of the supervised system becomes nondeterministic and may deviate from the safety specification. We define the upper-bound on all possible languages that can be generated by the supervised system to investigate the safety supervisory control problem under cyber attacks. After introducing CA-controllability and CA-observability, we prove that the supervisory control problem under cyber attacks is solvable if and only if the given specification language is CA-controllable and CA-observable. Furthermore, we obtain methods to calculate the state estimates under sensor attacks and to synthesize a state-estimate-based supervisor to achieve a given safety specification under cyber attacks. We further show that the proposed state-estimate-based supervisor is maximally-permissive. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an accurate yet fast small object detection method for RSI, named SuperYOLO, which fuses multimodal data and performs high resolution (HR) object detection on multiscale objects by utilizing the assisted super resolution (SR) learning and considering both the detection accuracy and computation cost. First, we construct a compact baseline by removing the Focus module to keep the HR features and significantly overcomes the missing error of small objects. Second, we utilize pixel-level multimodal fusion (MF) to extract information from various data to facilitate more suitable and effective features for small objects in RSI. Furthermore, we design a simple and flexible SR branch to learn HR feature representations that can discriminate small objects from vast backgrounds with low-resolution (LR) input, thus further improving the detection accuracy. Moreover, to avoid introducing additional computation, the SR branch is discarded in the inference stage and the computation of the network model is reduced due to the LR input. Experimental results show that, on the widely used VEDAI RS dataset, SuperYOLO achieves an accuracy of 73.61% (in terms of mAP50), which is more than 10% higher than the SOTA large models such as YOLOv5l, YOLOv5x and RS designed YOLOrs. Meanwhile, the GFOLPs and parameter size of SuperYOLO are about 18.1x and 4.2x less than YOLOv5x. Our proposed model shows a favorable accuracy-speed trade-off compared to the state-of-art models.

This thesis explores the creation and refinement of optimized student learning communities as a mean to support online and blended learning in the pandemic and post-pandemic setting. Students enrolled in university courses can be modeled as an enrollment network akin to a circuit netlist. Learning communities are created by clustering students into groups, optimized for maximum internal connection to support student learning, and minimum external connection to reduce disease transmission. Three VLSI-based clustering algorithms: Hyperedge Coarsening, Modified Hyperedge Coarsening, and Best Choice, are modified to cluster student enrollment networks. The learning communities created by the clustering algorithms are further refined by the Simulated Annealing algorithm using the same optimization criteria. The Learning Community Creation and Refinement Framework combines all three stages of network modeling, learning community creation, and learning community refinement. The proposed framework is tested on both the 3rd year Electrical Engineering Fall 2020 enrollment dataset and a very large Fall 2020 and Winter 2021 enrollment dataset. Best Choice performed the best among the clustering algorithms, capable of creating learning communities for the optimization criteria for a given maximum cluster size. Simulated Annealing can refine the clustering results by significantly increase cluster quality. The framework is capable of creating and refining learning communities for both the small and the large enrollment networks, but it is better suited for creating tailored learning communities at a program level. Future work, including creating student learning communities based on other optimization criteria, should be explored. ",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely applied for purposes of inspection, search, and rescue operations by the virtue of low-cost, large-coverage, real-time, and high-resolution data acquisition capacities. Massive volumes of aerial videos are produced in these processes, in which normal events often account for an overwhelming proportion. It is extremely difficult to localize and extract abnormal events containing potentially valuable information from long video streams manually. Therefore, we are dedicated to developing anomaly detection methods to solve this issue. In this paper, we create a new dataset, named DroneAnomaly, for anomaly detection in aerial videos. This dataset provides 37 training video sequences and 22 testing video sequences from 7 different realistic scenes with various anomalous events. There are 87,488 color video frames (51,635 for training and 35,853 for testing) with the size of $640 \\times 640$ at 30 frames per second. Based on this dataset, we evaluate existing methods and offer a benchmark for this task. Furthermore, we present a new baseline model, ANomaly Detection with Transformers (ANDT), which treats consecutive video frames as a sequence of tubelets, utilizes a Transformer encoder to learn feature representations from the sequence, and leverages a decoder to predict the next frame. Our network models normality in the training phase and identifies an event with unpredictable temporal dynamics as an anomaly in the test phase. Moreover, To comprehensively evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we use not only our Drone-Anomaly dataset but also another dataset. We will make our dataset and code publicly available.

    "abstract": "Ensemble methods are a reliable way to combine several models to achieve superior performance. However, research on the application of ensemble methods in the remote sensing object detection scenario is mostly overlooked. Two problems arise. First, one unique characteristic of remote sensing object detection is the Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) of the objects and the fusion of multiple OBBs requires further research attention. Second, the widely used deep learning object detectors provide a score for each detected object as an indicator of confidence, but how to use these indicators effectively in an ensemble method remains a problem. Trying to address these problems, this paper proposes OBBStacking, an ensemble method that is compatible with OBBs and combines the detection results in a learned fashion. This ensemble method helps take 1st place in the Challenge Track \\textit{Fine-grained Object Recognition in High-Resolution Optical Images}, which was featured in \\textit{2021 Gaofen Challenge on Automated High-Resolution Earth Observation Image Interpretation}. The experiments on DOTA dataset and FAIR1M dataset demonstrate the improved performance of OBBStacking and the features of OBBStacking are analyzed. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of neural face reenactment, where, given a pair of a source and a target facial image, we need to transfer the target's pose (defined as the head pose and its facial expressions) to the source image, by preserving at the same time the source's identity characteristics (e.g., facial shape, hair style, etc), even in the challenging case where the source and the target faces belong to different identities. In doing so, we address some of the limitations of the state-of-the-art works, namely, a) that they depend on paired training data (i.e., source and target faces have the same identity), b) that they rely on labeled data during inference, and c) that they do not preserve identity in large head pose changes. More specifically, we propose a framework that, using unpaired randomly generated facial images, learns to disentangle the identity characteristics of the face from its pose by incorporating the recently introduced style space $\\mathcal{S}$ of StyleGAN2, a latent representation space that exhibits remarkable disentanglement properties. By capitalizing on this, we learn to successfully mix a pair of source and target style codes using supervision from a 3D model. The resulting latent code, that is subsequently used for reenactment, consists of latent units corresponding to the facial pose of the target only and of units corresponding to the identity of the source only, leading to notable improvement in the reenactment performance compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. In comparison to state of the art, we quantitatively and qualitatively show that the proposed method produces higher quality results even on extreme pose variations. Finally, we report results on real images by first embedding them on the latent space of the pretrained generator.

The current work focuses on fine-grained pruning, which uses metrics to calculate weight scores for weight screening, and extends from the initial single-order pruning to iterative pruning. Through these works, we argue that network pruning can be summarized as an expressive force transfer process of weights, where the reserved weights will take on the expressive force from the removed ones for the purpose of maintaining the performance of original networks. In order to achieve optimal expressive force scheduling, we propose a pruning scheme before training called Neural Network Panning which guides expressive force transfer through multi-index and multi-process steps, and designs a kind of panning agent based on reinforcement learning to automate processes. Experimental results show that Panning performs better than various available pruning before training methods. ",

A metric reflecting the overfitting level might be, however, extremely helpful for the comparison of different architectures and for the evaluation of various techniques to tackle overfitting. Motivated by the fact that overfitted neural networks tend to rather memorize noise in the training data than generalize to unseen data, we examine how the training accuracy changes in the presence of increasing data perturbations and study the connection to overfitting. While previous work focused on label noise only, we examine a spectrum of techniques to inject noise into the training data, including adversarial perturbations and input corruptions. Based on this, we define two new metrics that can confidently distinguish between correct and overfitted models. For the evaluation, we derive a pool of models for which the overfitting behavior is known beforehand. To test the effect of various factors, we introduce several anti-overfitting measures in architectures based on VGG and ResNet and study their impact, including regularization techniques, training set size, and the number of parameters. Finally, we assess the applicability of the proposed metrics by measuring the overfitting degree of several CNN architectures outside of our model pool. ",

Natural causes or soft errors in digital design could cause some of these gates to malfunction in the field, which could cause the multiplier to produce incorrect outputs. To ensure that they are not susceptible to error, it is crucial to use a finite field multiplier implementation that is effective and has a high fault detection capability. In this paper, we propose a novel fault detection scheme for a recent bit-parallel polynomial basis multiplier over GF(2m), where the proposed method aims at obtaining high fault detection performance for finite field multipliers and meanwhile maintain low-complexity implementation which is favored in resource constrained applications such as smart cards. The proposed method is based on BCH error correction codes, with an area-delay efficient architecture. The experimental results show that for 45-bit multiplier with 5-bit errors the proposed error detection and correction architecture results in 37% and %49 reduction in critical path delay with compared to the existing method in [18]. Moreover, the area overhead for 45-bit multiplier with 5 errors is within 80% which is significantly lower than the best existing BCH based fault detection method in finite field multiplier [18]. ",

Given the abundance and omnipresence of smart devices, \"smart ecosystems\" are being formed where sensing happens simultaneously rather than standalone. This is shifting the on-device inference paradigm towards deploying centralised neural processing units (NPUs) at the edge, where multiple devices (e.g. in smart homes or autonomous vehicles) can stream their data for processing with dynamic rates. While this provides enhanced potential for input batching, naive solutions can lead to subpar performance and quality of experience, especially under spiking loads. At the same time, the deployment of dynamic DNNs, comprising stochastic computation graphs (e.g. early-exit (EE) models), introduces a new dimension of dynamic behaviour in such systems. In this work, we propose a novel early-exit-aware scheduling algorithm that allows sample preemption at run time, to account for the dynamicity introduced both by the arrival and early-exiting processes. At the same time, we introduce two novel dimensions to the design space of the NPU hardware architecture, namely Fluid Batching and Stackable Processing Elements, that enable run-time adaptability to different batch sizes and significantly improve the NPU utilisation even at small batch sizes. Our evaluation shows that our system achieves an average 1.97x and 6.7x improvement over state-of-the-art DNN streaming systems in terms of average latency and tail latency SLO satisfaction, respectively.

    "abstract": "The accurate and personalized estimation of task difficulty provides many opportunities for optimizing user experience. However, user diversity makes such difficulty estimation hard, in that empirical measurements from some user sample do not necessarily generalize to others. In this paper, we contribute a new approach for personalized difficulty estimation of game levels, borrowing methods from content recommendation. Using factorization machines (FM) on a large dataset from a commercial puzzle game, we are able to predict difficulty as the number of attempts a player requires to pass future game levels, based on observed attempt counts from earlier levels and levels played by others. In addition to performance and scalability, FMs offer the benefit that the learned latent variable model can be used to study the characteristics of both players and game levels that contribute to difficulty. We compare the approach to a simple non-personalized baseline and a personalized prediction using Random Forests. Our results suggest that FMs are a promising tool enabling game designers to both optimize player experience and learn more about their players and the game. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate vehicle type classification serves a significant role in the intelligent transportation system. It is critical for ruler to understand the road conditions and usually contributive for the traffic light control system to response correspondingly to alleviate traffic congestion. New technologies and comprehensive data sources, such as aerial photos and remote sensing data, provide richer and high-dimensional information. Also, due to the rapid development of deep neural network technology, image based vehicle classification methods can better extract underlying objective features when processing data. Recently, several deep learning models have been proposed to solve the problem. However, traditional pure convolutional based approaches have constraints on global information extraction, and the complex environment, such as bad weather, seriously limits the recognition capability. To improve the vehicle type classification capability under complex environment, this study proposes a novel Densely Connected Convolutional Transformer in Transformer Neural Network (Dense-TNT) framework for the vehicle type classification by stacking Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet) and Transformer in Transformer (TNT) layers. Three-region vehicle data and four different weather conditions are deployed for recognition capability evaluation. Experimental findings validate the recognition ability of our proposed vehicle classification model with little decay, even under the heavy foggy weather condition. ",

    "abstract": "To achieve accurate 3D object detection at a low cost for autonomous driving, many multi-camera methods have been proposed and solved the occlusion problem of monocular approaches. However, due to the lack of accurate estimated depth, existing multi-camera methods often generate multiple bounding boxes along a ray of depth direction for difficult small objects such as pedestrians, resulting in an extremely low recall. Furthermore, directly applying depth prediction modules to existing multi-camera methods, generally composed of large network architectures, cannot meet the real-time requirements of self-driving applications. To address these issues, we propose Cross-view and Depth-guided Transformers for 3D Object Detection, CrossDTR. First, our lightweight depth predictor is designed to produce precise object-wise sparse depth maps and low-dimensional depth embeddings without extra depth datasets during supervision. Second, a cross-view depth-guided transformer is developed to fuse the depth embeddings as well as image features from cameras of different views and generate 3D bounding boxes. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method hugely surpassed existing multi-camera methods by 10 percent in pedestrian detection and about 3 percent in overall mAP and NDS metrics. Also, computational analyses showed that our method is 5 times faster than prior approaches. Our codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/sty61010/CrossDTR. ",

To address this challenge, we propose a physics-model-based DNN framework, called Phy-Taylor, that accelerates learning compliant representations with physical knowledge. The Phy-Taylor framework makes two key contributions; it introduces a new architectural Physics-compatible neural network (PhN), and features a novel compliance mechanism, we call {\\em Physics-guided Neural Network Editing\\/}. The PhN aims to directly capture nonlinearities inspired by physical quantities, such as kinetic energy, potential energy, electrical power, and aerodynamic drag force. To do so, the PhN augments neural network layers with two key components: (i) monomials of Taylor series expansion of nonlinear functions capturing physical knowledge, and (ii) a suppressor for mitigating the influence of noise. The neural-network editing mechanism further modifies network links and activation functions consistently with physical knowledge. As an extension, we also propose a self-correcting Phy-Taylor framework that introduces two additional capabilities: (i) physics-model-based safety relationship learning, and (ii) automatic output correction when violations of safety occur. Through experiments, we show that (by expressing hard-to-learn nonlinearities directly and by constraining dependencies) Phy-Taylor features considerably fewer parameters, and a remarkably accelerated training process, while offering enhanced model robustness and accuracy.

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC) between regions of the brain is commonly estimated through statistical dependency measures applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The resulting functional connectivity matrix (FCM) is often taken to represent the adjacency matrix of a brain graph. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to FCMs to learn brain graph representations. A common limitation of existing GNN approaches, however, is that they require the graph adjacency matrix to be known prior to model training. As such, it is implicitly assumed the ground-truth dependency structure of the data is known. Unfortunately, for fMRI this is not the case as the choice of which statistical measure best represents the dependency structure of the data is non-trivial. Also, most GNN applications to fMRI assume FC is static over time, which is at odds with neuroscientific evidence that functional brain networks are time-varying and dynamic. These compounded issues can have a detrimental effect on the capacity of GNNs to learn representations of brain graphs. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Brain Graph Structure Learning (DBGSL), a supervised method for learning the optimal time-varying dependency structure of fMRI data. Specifically, DBGSL learns a dynamic graph from fMRI timeseries via spatial-temporal attention applied to brain region embeddings. The resulting graph is then fed to a spatial-temporal GNN to learn a graph representation for classification. Experiments on large resting-state as well as task fMRI datasets for the task of gender classification demonstrate that DBGSL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, analysis of the learnt dynamic graphs highlights prediction-related brain regions which align with findings from existing neuroscience literature. ",

While existing methods mostly rely on tedious network and loss designs, they still struggle in the information balancing between the source and target faces, and tend to produce visible artifacts. In this work, we introduce a concise and effective framework named StyleSwap. Our core idea is to leverage a style-based generator to empower high-fidelity and robust face swapping, thus the generator's advantage can be adopted for optimizing identity similarity. We identify that with only minimal modifications, a StyleGAN2 architecture can successfully handle the desired information from both source and target. Additionally, inspired by the ToRGB layers, a Swapping-Driven Mask Branch is further devised to improve information blending. Furthermore, the advantage of StyleGAN inversion can be adopted. Particularly, a Swapping-Guided ID Inversion strategy is proposed to optimize identity similarity. Extensive experiments validate that our framework generates high-quality face swapping results that outperform state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. ",

It has been a longstanding challenge to assign interdisciplinary proposals to appropriate reviewers, so proposals are fairly evaluated. One of the critical steps in reviewer assignment is to generate accurate interdisciplinary topic labels for proposal-reviewer matching. Existing systems mainly collect topic labels manually generated by principal investigators. However, such human-reported labels can be non-accurate, incomplete, labor intensive, and time costly. What role can AI play in developing a fair and precise proposal reviewer assignment system? In this study, we collaborate with the National Science Foundation of China to address the task of automated interdisciplinary topic path detection. For this purpose, we develop a deep Hierarchical Interdisciplinary Research Proposal Classification Network (HIRPCN). Specifically, we first propose a hierarchical transformer to extract the textual semantic information of proposals. We then design an interdisciplinary graph and leverage GNNs for learning representations of each discipline in order to extract interdisciplinary knowledge. After extracting the semantic and interdisciplinary knowledge, we design a level-wise prediction component to fuse the two types of knowledge representations and detect interdisciplinary topic paths for each proposal. We conduct extensive experiments and expert evaluations on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. ",

We release an adversarial dataset that partially fools most publicly released SSL-pretrained ASR models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, WavLM, etc). With low-level additive noise achieving a 30dB Signal-Noise Ratio, we can force these models to predict our target sentences with up to 80% accuracy, instead of their original transcription. With an ablation study, we show that Self-Supervised pretraining is the main cause of that vulnerability. We also propose an explanation for that curious phenomenon, which increases the threat posed by adversarial attacks on state-of-the-art ASR models. ",

They are considered promising approaches for solving dynamic radio resource management (RRM) problems in next-generation networks. Given their capabilities to build an approximate and continuously updated model of the wireless network environments, DRL algorithms can deal with the multifaceted complexity of such environments. Nevertheless, several challenges hinder the practical adoption of DRL in commercial networks. In this article, we first discuss two key practical challenges that are faced but rarely tackled when developing DRL-based RRM solutions. We argue that it is inevitable to address these DRL-related challenges for DRL to find its way to RRM commercial solutions. In particular, we discuss the need to have safe and accelerated DRL-based RRM solutions that mitigate the slow convergence and performance instability exhibited by DRL algorithms. We then review and categorize the main approaches used in the RRM domain to develop safe and accelerated DRL-based solutions. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the importance of having safe and accelerated DRL-based RRM solutions. We employ multiple variants of transfer learning (TL) techniques to accelerate the convergence of intelligent radio access network (RAN) slicing DRL-based controllers. We also propose a hybrid TL-based approach and sigmoid function-based rewards as examples of safe exploration in DRL-based RAN slicing. ",

In contrast to self-attention mechanism in existing GATs, the proposed GSAT adopts a SNN module architecture which is obvious energy-efficient. Moreover, GSAT can return sparse attention coefficients in natural and thus can perform feature aggregation on the selective neighbors which makes GSAT perform robustly w.r.t graph edge noises.

However, typical methods of handling these forces require an exact hydrodynamic model of the vehicle and access to low-level torque control on the manipulator, both of which are uncommon in the field. Therefore, many UVMS control methods are kinematics-based, which cannot inherently account for these effects. Our work bridges the gap between kinematic control and dynamics by training a recurrent neural network on simulated UVMS data to predict the pitch of the vehicle in the future based on the system's previous states. Kinematic planners and controllers can use this metric to incorporate dynamic knowledge without a computationally expensive model, improving their ability to perform underwater manipulation tasks. ",

While the brain solves this blind source separation (BSS) problem continuously, its algorithms remain unknown. Previous work on biologically-plausible BSS algorithms assumed that observed signals are linear mixtures of statistically independent or uncorrelated sources, limiting the domain of applicability of these algorithms. To overcome this limitation, we propose novel biologically-plausible neural networks for the blind separation of potentially dependent/correlated sources. Differing from previous work, we assume some general geometric, not statistical, conditions on the source vectors allowing separation of potentially dependent/correlated sources. Concretely, we assume that the source vectors are sufficiently scattered in their domains which can be described by certain polytopes. Then, we consider recovery of these sources by the Det-Max criterion, which maximizes the determinant of the output correlation matrix to enforce a similar spread for the source estimates. Starting from this normative principle, and using a weighted similarity matching approach that enables arbitrary linear transformations adaptable by local learning rules, we derive two-layer biologically-plausible neural network algorithms that can separate mixtures into sources coming from a variety of source domains. We demonstrate that our algorithms outperform other biologically-plausible BSS algorithms on correlated source separation problems. ",

The development of the parallel EELS instrument and fast, sensitive detectors have greatly improved the acquisition speed of EELS spectra. However, the traditional way of core-loss edge recognition is experience based and human labor dependent, which limits the processing speed. So far, the low signal-noise ratio and the low jump ratio of the core-loss edges on the raw EELS spectra have been challenging for the automation of edge recognition. In this work, a convolutional-bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (CNN-BiLSTM) is proposed to automate the detection and elemental identification of core-loss edges from raw spectra. An EELS spectral database is synthesized by using our forward model to assist in the training and validation of the neural network. To make the synthesized spectra resemble the real spectra, we collected a large library of experimentally acquired EELS core edges. In synthesize the training library, the edges are modeled by fitting the multi-gaussian model to the real edges from experiments, and the noise and instrumental imperfectness are simulated and added. The well-trained CNN-BiLSTM network is tested against both the simulated spectra and real spectra collected from experiments. The high accuracy of the network, 94.9 %, proves that, without complicated preprocessing of the raw spectra, the proposed CNN-BiLSTM network achieves the automation of core-loss edge recognition for EELS spectra with high accuracy.

We couple our methods with a tunable rejection-based approach that employs only the fraction of the dataset that the model is able to classify with an uncertainty below a user-set threshold. We test our model in a large cohort of brain images from Alzheimer's Disease patients, where we tackle discrimination of patients from healthy controls based on morphometric images only. We demonstrate how combining the estimated uncertainty with a rejection-based approach increases classification accuracy from 0.86 to 0.95 while retaining 75% of the test set. In addition, the model can select cases to be recommended for manual evaluation based on excessive uncertainty. We believe that being able to estimate the uncertainty of a prediction, along with tools that can modulate the behavior of the network to a degree of confidence that the user is informed about (and comfortable with) can represent a crucial step in the direction of user compliance and easier integration of deep learning tools into everyday tasks currently performed by human operators.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that utilizes Frank-Wolfe policy optimization to solve Coding-Tree-Unit (CTU) bit allocation for Region-of-Interest (ROI) intra-frame coding. Most previous RL-based methods employ the single-critic design, where the rewards for distortion minimization and rate regularization are weighted by an empirically chosen hyper-parameter. Recently, the dual-critic design is proposed to update the actor by alternating the rate and distortion critics. However, its convergence is not guaranteed. To address these issues, we introduce Neural Frank-Wolfe Policy Optimization (NFWPO) in formulating the CTU-level bit allocation as an action-constrained RL problem. In this new framework, we exploit a rate critic to predict a feasible set of actions. With this feasible set, a distortion critic is invoked to update the actor to maximize the ROI-weighted image quality subject to a rate constraint. Experimental results produced with x265 confirm the superiority of the proposed method to the other baselines. ",

The results show that in the whole floor scenario, the average positioning accuracy of the fusion network is 0.506 meters. The experiment results of transfer learning show that the estimation accuracy of the inertial navigation positioning step size and rotation angle of different pedestrians can be improved by 53.3% on average, the Bluetooth positioning accuracy of different devices can be improved by 33.4%, and the fusion can be improved by 31.6%.

There exists a wide variety of approaches to detect communities in networks, each offering different interpretations and associated algorithms. For large networks, there is the additional requirement of speed. In this context, the so-called label propagation algorithm (LPA) was proposed, which runs in near linear time. In partitions uncovered by LPA, each node is ensured to have most links to its assigned community. We here propose a fast variant of LPA (FLPA) that is based on processing a queue of nodes whose neighbourhood recently changed. We test FLPA exhaustively on benchmark networks and empirical networks, finding that it runs up to 700 times faster than LPA. In partitions found by FLPA, we prove that each node is again guaranteed to have most links to its assigned community. Our results show that FLPA is generally preferable to LPA. ",

Its person-to-person transmissibility is considerably rapid and this has caused serious problems in approximately every facet of individuals lives. While some infected individuals may remain completely asymptomatic, others have been frequently witnessed to have mild to severe symptoms. In addition to this, thousands of death cases around the globe indicated that detecting COVID-19 is an urgent demand in the communities. Practically, this is prominently done with the help of screening medical images such as Computed Tomography (CT) and X-ray images. However, the cumbersome clinical procedures and a large number of daily cases have imposed great challenges on medical practitioners. Deep Learning-based approaches have demonstrated a profound potential in a wide range of medical tasks. As a result, we introduce a transformer-based method for automatically detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images using Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCT). Our extensive experiments prove the efficacy of the proposed method with an accuracy of 98% which outperforms the previous works. ",

In this paper we introduce a new product code construction which is a natural generalisation of classical product codes to quantum codes: starting from a set of component Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, a larger CSS code is obtained where both $X$ parity checks and $Z$ parity checks are associated to classical product codes. We deduce several properties of product CSS codes from the properties of the component codes, including bounds on the code distance, and show that built-in redundancies in the parity checks result in so-called meta-checks which can be exploited to correct syndrome read-out errors. We then specialise to the case of single-parity-check (SPC) product codes which in the classical domain are a common choice for constructing product codes. Logical error rate simulations of a SPC $3$-fold product CSS code having parameters $[[512,174,8]]$ are shown under both a maximum likelihood decoder for the erasure channel and belief propagation decoding for depolarising noise. We compare the results with other codes of comparable block length and rate, including a code from the family of asymptotically good quantum Tanner codes. We observe that our reference product CSS code outperforms all other examined codes. ",

Despite the boom of AI techniques in molecular representation learning, some key aspects underlying molecular property prediction haven't been carefully examined yet. In this study, we conducted a systematic comparison on three representative models, random forest, MolBERT and GROVER, which utilize three major molecular representations, extended-connectivity fingerprints, SMILES strings and molecular graphs, respectively. Notably, MolBERT and GROVER, are pretrained on large-scale unlabelled molecule corpuses in a self-supervised manner. In addition to the commonly used MoleculeNet benchmark datasets, we also assembled a suite of opioids-related datasets for downstream prediction evaluation. We first conducted dataset profiling on label distribution and structural analyses; we also examined the activity cliffs issue in the opioids-related datasets. Then, we trained 4,320 predictive models and evaluated the usefulness of the learned representations. Furthermore, we explored into the model evaluation by studying the effect of statistical tests, evaluation metrics and task settings. Finally, we dissected the chemical space generalization into inter-scaffold and intra-scaffold generalization and measured prediction performance to evaluate model generalizbility under both settings. By taking this respite, we reflected on the key aspects underlying molecular property prediction, the awareness of which can, hopefully, bring better AI techniques in this field. ",

    "abstract": "The connectional brain template (CBT) captures the shared traits across all individuals of a given population of brain connectomes, thereby acting as a fingerprint. Estimating a CBT from a population where brain graphs are derived from diverse neuroimaging modalities (e.g., functional and structural) and at different resolutions (i.e., number of nodes) remains a formidable challenge to solve. Such network integration task allows for learning a rich and universal representation of the brain connectivity across varying modalities and resolutions. The resulting CBT can be substantially used to generate entirely new multimodal brain connectomes, which can boost the learning of the downs-stream tasks such as brain state classification. Here, we propose the Multimodal Multiresolution Brain Graph Integrator Network (i.e., M2GraphIntegrator), the first multimodal multiresolution graph integration framework that maps a given connectomic population into a well centered CBT. M2GraphIntegrator first unifies brain graph resolutions by utilizing resolution-specific graph autoencoders. Next, it integrates the resulting fixed-size brain graphs into a universal CBT lying at the center of its population. To preserve the population diversity, we further design a novel clustering-based training sample selection strategy which leverages the most heterogeneous training samples. To ensure the biological soundness of the learned CBT, we propose a topological loss that minimizes the topological gap between the ground-truth brain graphs and the learned CBT. Our experiments show that from a single CBT, one can generate realistic connectomic datasets including brain graphs of varying resolutions and modalities. We further demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms benchmarks in reconstruction quality, augmentation task, centeredness and topological soundness. ",

    "abstract": "Decrypting intelligence from the human brain construct is vital in the detection of particular neurological disorders. Recently, functional brain connectomes have been used successfully to predict behavioral scores. However, state-of-the-art methods, on one hand, neglect the topological properties of the connectomes and, on the other hand, fail to solve the high inter-subject brain heterogeneity. To address these limitations, we propose a novel regression graph neural network through meta-learning namely Meta-RegGNN for predicting behavioral scores from brain connectomes. The parameters of our proposed regression GNN are explicitly trained so that a small number of gradient steps combined with a small training data amount produces a good generalization to unseen brain connectomes. Our results on verbal and full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction outperform existing methods in both neurotypical and autism spectrum disorder cohorts. Furthermore, we show that our proposed approach ensures generalizability, particularly for autistic subjects. Our Meta-RegGNN source code is available at https://github.com/basiralab/Meta-RegGNN. ",

Currently, the vision provided by these devices is limited, and accurately predicting the visual percepts resulting from stimulation is an open challenge. We propose to address this challenge by utilizing 'brain-like' convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have emerged as promising models of the visual system. To investigate the feasibility of adapting brain-like CNNs for modeling visual prostheses, we developed a proof-of-concept model to predict the perceptions resulting from electrical stimulation. We show that a neurologically-inspired decoding of CNN activations produces qualitatively accurate phosphenes, comparable to phosphenes reported by real patients. Overall, this is an essential first step towards building brain-like models of electrical stimulation, which may not just improve the quality of vision provided by cortical prostheses but could also further our understanding of the neural code of vision.

However, they often contain a potentially large number of free parameters whose values cannot be obtained from theory but need to be inferred from data. This is especially the case for models in the social sciences, economics, or computational epidemiology. Yet many current parameter estimation methods are mathematically involved and computationally slow to run. In this paper we present a computationally simple and fast method to retrieve accurate probability densities for model parameters using neural differential equations. We present a pipeline comprising multi-agent models acting as forward solvers for systems of ordinary or stochastic differential equations, and a neural network to then extract parameters from the data generated by the model. The two combined create a powerful tool that can quickly estimate densities on model parameters, even for very large systems. We demonstrate the method on synthetic time series data of the SIR model of the spread of infection, and perform an in-depth analysis of the Harris-Wilson model of economic activity on a network, representing a non-convex problem. For the latter, we apply our method both to synthetic data and to data of economic activity across Greater London. We find that our method calibrates the model orders of magnitude more accurately than a previous study of the same dataset using classical techniques, while running between 195 and 390 times faster.
