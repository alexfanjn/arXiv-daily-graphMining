    "title": "First-order Policy Optimization for Robust Markov Decision Process",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of solving robust Markov decision process (MDP), which involves a set of discounted, finite state, finite action space MDPs with uncertain transition kernels. The goal of planning is to find a robust policy that optimizes the worst-case values against the transition uncertainties, and thus encompasses the standard MDP planning as a special case. For $(\\mathbf{s},\\mathbf{a})$-rectangular uncertainty sets, we develop a policy-based first-order method, namely the robust policy mirror descent (RPMD), and establish an $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ and $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon)$ iteration complexity for finding an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy, with two increasing-stepsize schemes. The prior convergence of RPMD is applicable to any Bregman divergence, provided the policy space has bounded radius measured by the divergence when centering at the initial policy. Moreover, when the Bregman divergence corresponds to the squared euclidean distance, we establish an $\\mathcal{O}(\\max \\{1/\\epsilon, 1/(\\eta \\epsilon^2)\\})$ complexity of RPMD with any constant stepsize $\\eta$. For a general class of Bregman divergences, a similar complexity is also established for RPMD with constant stepsizes, provided the uncertainty set satisfies the relative strong convexity. We further develop a stochastic variant, named SRPMD, when the first-order information is only available through online interactions with the nominal environment. For general Bregman divergences, we establish an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^3)$ sample complexity with two increasing-stepsize schemes. For the euclidean Bregman divergence, we establish an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^3)$ sample complexity with constant stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, all the aforementioned results appear to be new for policy-based first-order methods applied to the robust MDP problem. ",

    "title": "Grape Cold Hardiness Prediction via Multi-Task Learning",
    "abstract": "Cold temperatures during fall and spring have the potential to cause frost damage to grapevines and other fruit plants, which can significantly decrease harvest yields. To help prevent these losses, farmers deploy expensive frost mitigation measures, such as, sprinklers, heaters, and wind machines, when they judge that damage may occur. This judgment, however, is challenging because the cold hardiness of plants changes throughout the dormancy period and it is difficult to directly measure. This has led scientists to develop cold hardiness prediction models that can be tuned to different grape cultivars based on laborious field measurement data. In this paper, we study whether deep-learning models can improve cold hardiness prediction for grapes based on data that has been collected over a 30-year time period. A key challenge is that the amount of data per cultivar is highly variable, with some cultivars having only a small amount. For this purpose, we investigate the use of multi-task learning to leverage data across cultivars in order to improve prediction performance for individual cultivars. We evaluate a number of multi-task learning approaches and show that the highest performing approach is able to significantly improve over learning for single cultivars and outperforms the current state-of-the-art scientific model for most cultivars.

The resulting DeepGraphONet can then predict the dynamics within a given short/medium-term time horizon by observing a finite history of the graph state information. Furthermore, we design our DeepGraphONet to be resolution-independent. That is, we do not require the finite history to be collected at the exact/same resolution. In addition, to disseminate the results from a trained DeepGraphONet, we design a zero-shot learning strategy that enables using it on a different sub-graph. Finally, empirical results on the (i) transient stability prediction problem of power grids and (ii) traffic flow forecasting problem of a vehicular system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed DeepGraphONet.

We study Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control under sparse disturbances by analyzing three distinct policies: the blind online policy, the disturbance-aware policy, and the optimal offline policy. We derive the two-dimensional recurrence structure of the optimal disturbance-aware policy, under the assumption that the controller has information about future disturbance values with only a probabilistic model of their locations in time. Under mild conditions, we show that the disturbance-aware policy converges to the blind online policy if the number of disturbances grows sublinearly in the time horizon. Finally, we provide a finite-horizon regret bound between the blind online policy and optimal offline policy, which is proven to be quadratic in the number of disturbances and in their magnitude. This provides a useful characterization of the suboptimality of a standard LQR controller when confronted with unexpected sparse perturbations. ",

It is demonstrated that ResNets and Neural-ODE models are special cases of the proposed Neural-GODE model. Based on two benchmark datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10, we show that the layer-varying Neural-GODE is more flexible and general than the standard Neural-ODE. Furthermore, the Neural-GODE enjoys the computational and memory benefits while performing comparably to ResNets in prediction accuracy. ",

In this paper, we propose the design of unified parallel intermediate representation (UPIR) for multiple parallel programming models and for enabling unified compiler transformation for the models. UPIR specifies three commonly used parallelism patterns (SPMD, data and task parallelism), data attributes and explicit data movement and memory management, and synchronization operations used in parallel programming. We demonstrate UPIR via a prototype implementation in the ROSE compiler for unifying IR for both OpenMP and OpenACC and in both C/C++ and Fortran, for unifying the transformation that lowers both OpenMP and OpenACC code to LLVM runtime, and for exporting UPIR to LLVM MLIR dialect.

We propose a framework called GraphTNC for unsupervised learning of joint representations of the graph and the time-series. Our approach employs a contrastive learning strategy. Based on an assumption that the time-series and graph evolution dynamics are piecewise smooth, we identify local windows of time where the signals exhibit approximate stationarity. We then train an encoding that allows the distribution of signals within a neighborhood to be distinguished from the distribution of non-neighboring signals. We first demonstrate the performance of our proposed framework using synthetic data, and subsequently we show that it can prove beneficial for the classification task with real-world datasets. ",

Community smells are sociotechnical anti-patterns and one source of social debt that impact software teams, development processes, outcomes, and organizations. Objective: To provide an overview of community smells based on published literature, and describe future research. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify properties, understand origins and evolution, and describe the emergence of community smells. This SLR explains the impact of community smells on teamwork and team performance. Results: We include 25 studies. Social debt describes the impacts of poor socio-technical decisions on work environments, people, software products, and society. For each of the 30 identified community smells, we provide a description, management approaches, organizational strategies, and mitigation effectiveness. We identify five groups of management approaches: organizational strategies, frameworks, models, tools, and guidelines. We describe 11 properties of community smells. We develop the Community Smell Stages Framework to concisely describe the origin and evolution of community smells. We describe the causes and effects for each community smell. We identify and describe 8 types of causes and 11 types of effects for community smells. Finally, we provide 8 Sankey diagrams that offer insights into threats the community smells pose to teamwork factors and team performance. Conclusion: Community smells explain the influence work conditions have on software developers. The literature is scarce and focuses on a small number of community smells. Thus, community smells still need more research. This review organizes the state of the art about community smells and provides motivation for future research along with educational material. ",

Disentanglement is promoted efficiently by framing this as a minmax game between the AE and an ensemble of regression networks which each provide an estimate of an element conditioned on an observation of all other elements. We quantitatively compare our approach with leading disentanglement methods using existing disentanglement metrics. Furthermore, we show that NashAE has increased reliability and increased capacity to capture salient data characteristics in the learned latent representation. ",

We crawl a total of 2,399 posts and 29,851 associated comments from the r/COVID19_support subreddit and manually extract fine-grained personal information categories and types of social support sought from each post. We develop a BERT-based ensemble classifier to automatically identify types of support offered in users' comments. We then analyze the effect of personal information sharing and posts' topical, lexical, and sentiment markers on the acquisition of support and five interaction measures (submission scores, the number of comments, the number of unique commenters, the length and sentiments of comments). Our findings show that: 1) users were more likely to share their age, education, and location information when seeking both informational and emotional support, as opposed to pursuing either one; 2) while personal information sharing was positively correlated with receiving informational support when requested, it did not correlate with emotional support; 3) as the degree of self-disclosure increased, information support seekers obtained higher submission scores and longer comments, whereas emotional support seekers' self-disclosure resulted in lower submission scores, fewer comments, and fewer unique commenters; 4) post characteristics affecting social feedback differed significantly based on types of support sought by post authors. These results provide empirical evidence for the varying effects of self-disclosure on acquiring desired support and user involvement online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, this work can assist support seekers hoping to enhance and prioritize specific types of social feedback. ",

In particular, we are interested in the scaling behaviour of these mechanisms to increasingly high-dimensional conditioning variables. As we show in our experiments, high-dimensional conditioning is key to modelling complex data distributions, thus it is important to determine what architecture choices best enable this when working on such problems. To this end, we run experiments modelling 2D, 3D, and 4D signals with neural fields, employing concatenation, hyper-network, and attention-based conditioning strategies -- a necessary but laborious effort that has not been performed in the literature.

We propose to regularize the estimated motion to be predictable. If the motion from previous frames is known, then the motion in the near future should be predictable. Therefore, we introduce a predictability regularization by first conditioning the estimated motion on latent embeddings, then by adopting a predictor network to enforce predictability on the embeddings.

However, the impact of the adversarial attack, which is vital for various safety-critical machine learning applications, is not yet addressed in FAL. Observing this, we introduce a novel task, Fair Robust Active Learning (FRAL), integrating conventional FAL and adversarial robustness. FRAL requires ML models to leverage active learning techniques to jointly achieve equalized performance on benign data and equalized robustness against adversarial attacks between groups. In this new task, previous FAL methods generally face the problem of unbearable computational burden and ineffectiveness. Therefore, we develop a simple yet effective FRAL strategy by Joint INconsistency (JIN). To efficiently find samples that can boost the performance and robustness of disadvantaged groups for labeling, our method exploits the prediction inconsistency between benign and adversarial samples as well as between standard and robust models. Extensive experiments under diverse datasets and sensitive groups demonstrate that our method not only achieves fairer performance on benign samples but also obtains fairer robustness under white-box PGD attacks compared with existing active learning and FAL baselines. We are optimistic that FRAL would pave a new path for developing safe and robust ML research and applications such as facial attribute recognition in biometrics systems. ",

Specifically, it first utilizes RoIPooling to obtain an image set with a unified size and gets the point set by sampling raw points within proposals in the RoI extraction step; then leverages an intra-modality self-attention to enhance the domain-specific features, following by a well-designed cross-attention to fuse the information from two modalities.FusionRCNN is fundamentally plug-and-play and supports different one-stage methods with almost no architectural changes. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performances of popular detectors.Remarkably, FusionRCNN significantly improves the strong SECOND baseline by 6.14% mAP on Waymo, and outperforms competing two-stage approaches.

    "abstract": "Neural networks with physics based inductive biases such as Lagrangian neural networks (LNN), and Hamiltonian neural networks (HNN) learn the dynamics of physical systems by encoding strong inductive biases. Alternatively, Neural ODEs with appropriate inductive biases have also been shown to give similar performances. However, these models, when applied to particle based systems, are transductive in nature and hence, do not generalize to large system sizes. In this paper, we present a graph based neural ODE, GNODE, to learn the time evolution of dynamical systems. Further, we carefully analyse the role of different inductive biases on the performance of GNODE. We show that, similar to LNN and HNN, encoding the constraints explicitly can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of GNODE significantly. Our experiments also assess the value of additional inductive biases, such as Newtons third law, on the final performance of the model. We demonstrate that inducing these biases can enhance the performance of model by orders of magnitude in terms of both energy violation and rollout error. Interestingly, we observe that the GNODE trained with the most effective inductive biases, namely MCGNODE, outperforms the graph versions of LNN and HNN, namely, Lagrangian graph networks (LGN) and Hamiltonian graph networks (HGN) in terms of energy violation error by approx 4 orders of magnitude for a pendulum system, and approx 2 orders of magnitude for spring systems. These results suggest that competitive performances with energy conserving neural networks can be obtained for NODE based systems by inducing appropriate inductive biases. ",

Based on the tasks' properties, the network orchestration plane needs to flexibly deploy tasks to appropriate computing nodes and arrange paths to the computing nodes. This is a orchestration problem that involves resource scheduling and path arrangement. Since CNC is relatively new, in this paper, we review some researches and applications on CNC. Then, we design a CNC orchestration method using reinforcement learning (RL), which is the first attempt, that can flexibly allocate and schedule computing resources and network resources. Which aims at high profit and low latency. Meanwhile, we use multi-factors to determine the optimization objective so that the orchestration strategy is optimized in terms of total performance from different aspects, such as cost, profit, latency and system overload in our experiment. The experiments shows that the proposed RL-based method can achieve higher profit and lower latency than the greedy method, random selection and balanced-resource method. We demonstrate RL is suitable for CNC orchestration. This paper enlightens the RL application on CNC orchestration. ",

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FoG) is one of the most common symptoms of Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system impacting millions of people around the world. To address the pressing need to improve the quality of treatment for FoG, devising a computer-aided detection and quantification tool for FoG has been increasingly important. As a non-invasive technique for collecting motion patterns, the footstep pressure sequences obtained from pressure sensitive gait mats provide a great opportunity for evaluating FoG in the clinic and potentially in the home environment. In this study, FoG detection is formulated as a sequential modelling task and a novel deep learning architecture, namely Adversarial Spatio-temporal Network (ASTN), is proposed to learn FoG patterns across multiple levels. A novel adversarial training scheme is introduced with a multi-level subject discriminator to obtain subject-independent FoG representations, which helps to reduce the over-fitting risk due to the high inter-subject variance. As a result, robust FoG detection can be achieved for unseen subjects. The proposed scheme also sheds light on improving subject-level clinical studies from other scenarios as it can be integrated with many existing deep architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies of footstep pressure-based FoG detection and the approach of utilizing ASTN is the first deep neural network architecture in pursuit of subject-independent representations. Experimental results on 393 trials collected from 21 subjects demonstrate encouraging performance of the proposed ASTN for FoG detection with an AUC 0.85. ",

Additionally, we propose a novel way of incorporating robot velocity in the costmap prediction pipeline. We validate our method in multiple short and large-scale navigation tasks on a large, autonomous all-terrain vehicle (ATV) on challenging off-road terrains, and demonstrate ease of integration on a separate large ground robot. Our short-scale navigation results show that using our learned costmaps leads to overall smoother navigation, and provides the robot with a more fine-grained understanding of the interactions between the robot and different terrain types, such as grass and gravel. Our large-scale navigation trials show that we can reduce the number of interventions by up to 57% compared to an occupancy-based navigation baseline in challenging off-road courses ranging from 400 m to 3150 m.

However, one of the most common problems is that the time series data could have missing values by the inherent nature of the data collection process. So imputing missing values from multivariate (correlated) time series data is imperative to improve a prediction performance while making an accurate data-driven decision. Conventional works for imputation simply delete missing values or fill them based on mean/zero. Although recent works based on deep neural networks have shown remarkable results, they still have a limitation to capture the complex generation process of the multivariate time series. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation method for multivariate time series data, called STING (Self-attention based Time-series Imputation Networks using GAN). We take advantage of generative adversarial networks and bidirectional recurrent neural networks to learn latent representations of the time series. In addition, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to capture the weighted correlations of the whole sequence and avoid potential bias brought by unrelated ones. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that STING outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation accuracy as well as downstream tasks with the imputed values therein.

For example, self-driving cars need an accurate forecast of other agents' future actions to plan safe trajectories. Current methods rely heavily on historical time series to accurately predict the future. However, relying entirely on the observed history is problematic since it could be corrupted by noise, have outliers, or not completely represent all possible outcomes. To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework for generating robust forecasts for robotic control. In order to model real-world factors affecting future forecasts, we introduce the notion of an adversary, which perturbs observed historical time series to increase a robot's ultimate control cost. Specifically, we model this interaction as a zero-sum two-player game between a robot's forecaster and this hypothetical adversary. We show that our proposed game may be solved to a local Nash equilibrium using gradient-based optimization techniques. Furthermore, we show that a forecaster trained with our method performs 30.14% better on out-of-distribution real-world lane change data than baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, manipulation of real-world images has been highly elaborated along with the development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and corresponding encoders, which embed real-world images into the latent space. However, designing encoders of GAN still remains a challenging task due to the trade-off between distortion and perception. In this paper, we point out that the existing encoders try to lower the distortion not only on the interest region, e.g., human facial region but also on the uninterest region, e.g., background patterns and obstacles. However, most uninterest regions in real-world images are located at out-of-distribution (OOD), which are infeasible to be ideally reconstructed by generative models. Moreover, we empirically find that the uninterest region overlapped with the interest region can mangle the original feature of the interest region, e.g., a microphone overlapped with a facial region is inverted into the white beard. As a result, lowering the distortion of the whole image while maintaining the perceptual quality is very challenging. To overcome this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective encoder training scheme, coined IntereStyle, which facilitates encoding by focusing on the interest region. IntereStyle steers the encoder to disentangle the encodings of the interest and uninterest regions. To this end, we filter the information of the uninterest region iteratively to regulate the negative impact of the uninterest region. We demonstrate that IntereStyle achieves both lower distortion and higher perceptual quality compared to the existing state-of-the-art encoders. Especially, our model robustly conserves features of the original images, which shows the robust image editing and style mixing results. We will release our code with the pre-trained model after the review. ",

For example, since GNNs update node features mainly based on local information, they have limited expressive power in capturing long-range dependencies among nodes in graphs. To address some of the limitations of GNNs, several recent works started to explore augmenting GNNs with memory for improving their expressive power in the relevant tasks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature of memory-augmented GNNs. We review these works through the lens of psychology and neuroscience, which has established multiple memory systems and mechanisms in biological brains.

As an essential factor for human perception, visual attention refers to the dynamic selection process of salient regions in biological vision systems. Although mechanisms of visual attention have achieved great success in computer vision, they are rarely introduced into SNNs. Inspired by experimental observations on predictive attentional remapping, we here propose a new spatial-channel-temporal-fused attention (SCTFA) module that can guide SNNs to efficiently capture underlying target regions by utilizing historically accumulated spatial-channel information. Through a systematic evaluation on three event stream datasets (DVS Gesture, SL-Animals-DVS and MNIST-DVS), we demonstrate that the SNN with the SCTFA module (SCTFA-SNN) not only significantly outperforms the baseline SNN (BL-SNN) and other two SNN models with degenerated attention modules, but also achieves competitive accuracy with existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our detailed analysis shows that the proposed SCTFA-SNN model has strong robustness to noise and outstanding stability to incomplete data, while maintaining acceptable complexity and efficiency. Overall, these findings indicate that appropriately incorporating cognitive mechanisms of the brain may provide a promising approach to elevate the capability of SNNs. ",

We demonstrate that CMLM is a good technique for generating context-dependent word distributions. In particular, we show that CMLM is capable of enforcing semantic consistency by conditioning on both source and target during substitution. In addition, to enhance diversity, we incorporate the idea of soft word substitution for data augmentation which replaces a word with a probabilistic distribution over the vocabulary. Experiments on four translation datasets of different scales show that the overall solution results in more realistic data augmentation and better translation quality. Our approach consistently achieves the best performance in comparison with strong and recent works and yields improvements of up to 1.90 BLEU points over the baseline. ",

A vector-quantized, variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) based feature analyzer is used to encode Mel spectrograms of speech training data by down-sampling progressively in multiple stages into MSMC Representations (MSMCRs) with different time resolutions, and quantizing them with multiple VQ codebooks, respectively. Multi-stage predictors are trained to map the input text sequence to MSMCRs progressively by minimizing a combined loss of the reconstruction Mean Square Error (MSE) and \"triplet loss\". In synthesis, the neural vocoder converts the predicted MSMCRs into final speech waveforms. The proposed approach is trained and tested with an English TTS database of 16 hours by a female speaker. The proposed TTS achieves an MOS score of 4.41, which outperforms the baseline with an MOS of 3.62. Compact versions of the proposed TTS with much less parameters can still preserve high MOS scores. Ablation studies show that both multiple stages and multiple codebooks are effective for achieving high TTS performance. ",

    "abstract": "The Vision Transformer architecture has shown to be competitive in the computer vision (CV) space where it has dethroned convolution-based networks in several benchmarks. Nevertheless, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) remain the preferential architecture for the representation module in Reinforcement Learning. In this work, we study pretraining a Vision Transformer using several state-of-the-art self-supervised methods and assess data-efficiency gains from this training framework. We propose a new self-supervised learning method called TOV-VICReg that extends VICReg to better capture temporal relations between observations by adding a temporal order verification task. Furthermore, we evaluate the resultant encoders with Atari games in a sample-efficiency regime. Our results show that the vision transformer, when pretrained with TOV-VICReg, outperforms the other self-supervised methods but still struggles to overcome a CNN. Nevertheless, we were able to outperform a CNN in two of the ten games where we perform a 100k steps evaluation. Ultimately, we believe that such approaches in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) might be the key to achieving new levels of performance as seen in natural language processing and computer vision.

There exists two significant challenges: (1) Highly insufficient target domain data; (2) Potential over-adaptation and misleading caused by inappropriately amplified target samples without any restriction. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive method consisting of two parts. First, we propose an adaptive optimization strategy to select augmented data similar to target samples rather than blindly increasing the amount. Specifically, we filter the augmented candidates which significantly deviate from the target feature distribution in the very beginning. Second, to further relieve the data limitation, we propose the multi-level domain-aware data augmentation to increase the diversity and rationality of augmented data, which exploits the cross-image foreground-background mixture. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. ",

The Tabular DDP Mechanism satisfies dependent differential privacy, a variant of Pufferfish privacy; it works by building a causal model of the sensitive data, then calibrating noise to the level of correlation between statistics. An empirical evaluation on survey data shows that the Tabular DDP Mechanism can significantly improve accuracy over the Laplace mechanism. ",

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in utilizing Deep Learning, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning, to automatically learn effective solvers for CO. The resultant new paradigm is termed Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO). However, the advantages and disadvantages of NCO over other approaches have not been well studied empirically or theoretically. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of NCO solvers and alternative solvers. Specifically, taking the Traveling Salesman Problem as the testbed problem, we assess the performance of the solvers in terms of five aspects, i.e., effectiveness, efficiency, stability, scalability and generalization ability. Our results show that in general the solvers learned by NCO approaches still fall short of traditional solvers in nearly all these aspects. A potential benefit of the former would be their superior time and energy efficiency on small-size problem instances when sufficient training instances are available. We hope this work would help better understand the strengths and weakness of NCO, and provide a comprehensive evaluation protocol for further benchmarking NCO approaches against other approaches. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel one-stage mutual gaze detection framework called Mutual Gaze TRansformer or MGTR to perform mutual gaze detection in an end-to-end manner. By designing mutual gaze instance triples, MGTR can detect each human head bounding box and simultaneously infer mutual gaze relationship based on global image information, which streamlines the whole process with simplicity.

However, the convolution and fully-connected layers are not equivariant or invariant to other affine geometric transformations. Recently, a new class of CNNs is proposed in which the conventional layers of CNNs are replaced with equivariant convolution, pooling, and batch-normalization layers. The final classification layer in equivariant neural networks is invariant to different affine geometric transformations such as rotation, reflection and translation, and the scalar value is obtained by either eliminating the spatial dimensions of filter responses using convolution and down-sampling throughout the network or average is taken over the filter responses. In this work, we propose to integrate the orthogonal moments which gives the high-order statistics of the function as an effective means for encoding global invariance with respect to rotation, reflection and translation in fully-connected layers. As a result, the intermediate layers of the network become equivariant while the classification layer becomes invariant. The most widely used Zernike, pseudo-Zernike and orthogonal Fourier-Mellin moments are considered for this purpose. The effectiveness of the proposed work is evaluated by integrating the invariant transition and fully-connected layer in the architecture of group-equivariant CNNs (G-CNNs) on rotated MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.

We propose a model based on anti-symmetric twin neural networks, trained on pairs of waveforms and their corresponding preference scores. We explore both attention and recurrent neural nets to account for the fact that stimuli in a pair are not time aligned. To obtain a large training set we convert listeners' ratings from MUSHRA tests to values that reflect how often one stimulus in the pair was rated higher than the other. Specifically, we evaluate performance on data obtained from twelve MUSHRA evaluations conducted over five years, containing different TTS systems, built from data of different speakers.

    "abstract": "Authentication systems are vulnerable to model inversion attacks where an adversary is able to approximate the inverse of a target machine learning model. Biometric models are a prime candidate for this type of attack. This is because inverting a biometric model allows the attacker to produce a realistic biometric input to spoof biometric authentication systems. One of the main constraints in conducting a successful model inversion attack is the amount of training data required. In this work, we focus on iris and facial biometric systems and propose a new technique that drastically reduces the amount of training data necessary. By leveraging the output of multiple models, we are able to conduct model inversion attacks with 1/10th the training set size of Ahmad and Fuller (IJCB 2020) for iris data and 1/1000th the training set size of Mai et al. (Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 2019) for facial data. We denote our new attack technique as structured random with alignment loss. Our attacks are black-box, requiring no knowledge of the weights of the target neural network, only the dimension, and values of the output vector. To show the versatility of the alignment loss, we apply our attack framework to the task of membership inference (Shokri et al., IEEE S&P 2017) on biometric data. For the iris, membership inference attack against classification networks improves from 52% to 62% accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Industrial analytics that includes among others equipment diagnosis and anomaly detection heavily relies on integration of heterogeneous production data. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as the data format and ontologies as the unified data schemata are a prominent solution that offers high quality data integration and a convenient and standardised way to exchange data and to layer analytical applications over it. However, poor design of ontologies of high degree of mismatch between them and industrial data naturally lead to KGs of low quality that impede the adoption and scalability of industrial analytics. Indeed, such KGs substantially increase the training time of writing queries for users, consume high volume of storage for redundant information, and are hard to maintain and update. To address this problem we propose an ontology reshaping approach to transform ontologies into KG schemata that better reflect the underlying data and thus help to construct better KGs. In this poster we present a preliminary discussion of our on-going research, evaluate our approach with a rich set of SPARQL queries on real-world industry data at Bosch and discuss our findings. ",

Inspired by large pre-trained language models, this work introduces a paradigm for pre-training a general purpose representation that can serve as a starting point for multiple tasks on a given robot. We present the Perception-Action Causal Transformer (PACT), a generative transformer-based architecture that aims to build representations directly from robot data in a self-supervised fashion. Through autoregressive prediction of states and actions over time, our model implicitly encodes dynamics and behaviors for a particular robot. Our experimental evaluation focuses on the domain of mobile agents, where we show that this robot-specific representation can function as a single starting point to achieve distinct tasks such as safe navigation, localization and mapping. We evaluate two form factors: a wheeled robot that uses a LiDAR sensor as perception input (MuSHR), and a simulated agent that uses first-person RGB images (Habitat). We show that finetuning small task-specific networks on top of the larger pretrained model results in significantly better performance compared to training a single model from scratch for all tasks simultaneously, and comparable performance to training a separate large model for each task independently. By sharing a common good-quality representation across tasks we can lower overall model capacity and speed up the real-time deployment of such systems. ",

While recent years have seen a surge in methodological improvements in this area, they mostly focused on building specialist models. Specialist models are capable of learning to neurally execute either only one algorithm or a collection of algorithms with identical control-flow backbone. Here, instead, we focus on constructing a generalist neural algorithmic learner -- a single graph neural network processor capable of learning to execute a wide range of algorithms, such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, path-finding and geometry. We leverage the CLRS benchmark to empirically show that, much like recent successes in the domain of perception, generalist algorithmic learners can be built by \"incorporating\" knowledge. That is, it is possible to effectively learn algorithms in a multi-task manner, so long as we can learn to execute them well in a single-task regime. Motivated by this, we present a series of improvements to the input representation, training regime and processor architecture over CLRS, improving average single-task performance by over 20% from prior art. We then conduct a thorough ablation of multi-task learners leveraging these improvements. Our results demonstrate a generalist learner that effectively incorporates knowledge captured by specialist models. ",

    "abstract": "We study the uniform query reliability problem, which asks, for a fixed Boolean query Q, given an instance I, how many subinstances of I satisfy Q. Equivalently, this is a restricted case of Boolean query evaluation on tuple-independent probabilistic databases where all facts must have probability 1/2. We focus on graph signatures, and on queries closed under homomorphisms. We show that for any such query that is unbounded, i.e., not equivalent to a union of conjunctive queries, the uniform reliability problem is #P-hard. This recaptures the hardness, e.g., of s-t connectedness, which counts how many subgraphs of an input graph have a path between a source and a sink. This new hardness result on uniform reliability strengthens our earlier hardness result on probabilistic query evaluation for unbounded homomorphism-closed queries (ICDT'20). Indeed, our earlier proof crucially used facts with probability 1, so it did not apply to the unweighted case. The new proof presented in this paper avoids this; it uses our recent hardness result on uniform reliability for non-hierarchical conjunctive queries without self-joins (ICDT'21), along with new techniques.

    "abstract": "We consider the Flexible Graph Connectivity model (denoted FGC) introduced by Adjiashvili, Hommelsheim and M\\\"uhlenthaler (IPCO 2020, Mathematical Programming 2021), and its generalization, $(p,q)$-FGC, where $p \\geq 1$ and $q \\geq 0$ are integers, introduced by Boyd et al.\\ (FSTTCS 2021). In the $(p,q)$-FGC model, we have an undirected connected graph $G=(V,E)$, non-negative costs $c$ on the edges, and a partition $(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{U})$ of $E$ into a set of safe edges $\\mathcal{S}$ and a set of unsafe edges $\\mathcal{U}$. A subset $F \\subseteq E$ of edges is called feasible if for any set $F'\\subseteq\\mathcal{U}$ with $|F'| \\leq q$, the subgraph $(V, F \\setminus F')$ is $p$-edge connected. The goal is to find a feasible edge-set of minimum cost. For the special case of $(p,q)$-FGC when $q = 2$, we give an $O(1)$ approximation algorithm, thus improving on the logarithmic approximation ratio of Boyd et al. (FSTTCS 2021). Our algorithm is based on the primal-dual method for covering an uncrossable family, due to Williamson et al. (Combinatorica 1995). We conclude by studying weakly uncrossable families, which are a generalization of the well-known notion of an uncrossable family. ",

    "abstract": "A widely used approach for extracting information from gene expression data employ the construction of a gene co-expression network and the subsequent application of algorithms that discover network structure. In particular, a common goal is the computational discovery of gene clusters, commonly called modules. When applied on a novel gene expression dataset, the quality of the computed modules can be evaluated automatically, using Gene Ontology enrichment, a method that measures the frequencies of Gene Ontology terms in the computed modules and evaluates their statistical likelihood. In this work we propose SGC a novel pipeline for gene clustering based on relatively recent seminal work in the mathematics of spectral network theory. SGC consists of multiple novel steps that enable the computation of highly enriched modules in an unsupervised manner. But unlike all existing frameworks, it further incorporates a novel step that leverages Gene Ontology information in a semi-supervised clustering method that further improves the quality of the computed modules. Comparing with already well-known existing frameworks, we show that SGC results in higher enrichment in real data. In particular, in 12 real gene expression datasets, SGC outperforms in all except one. ",

    "abstract": "Early sensory systems in the brain rapidly adapt to fluctuating input statistics, which requires recurrent communication between neurons. Mechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by local interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of mediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct recurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable recurrent neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one with direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate recurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic dynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with interneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct recurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic dynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections) scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their initialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally useful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the network with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening objective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can be viewed as a recurrent neural network analogue of the implicit acceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear networks.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have become the gold-standard approach for the automated segmentation of 3D medical images. Their full acceptance by clinicians remains however hampered by the lack of intelligible uncertainty assessment of the provided results. Most approaches to quantify their uncertainty, such as the popular Monte Carlo dropout, restrict to some measure of uncertainty in prediction at the voxel level. In addition not to be clearly related to genuine medical uncertainty, this is not clinically satisfying as most objects of interest (e.g. brain lesions) are made of groups of voxels whose overall relevance may not simply reduce to the sum or mean of their individual uncertainties. In this work, we propose to go beyond voxel-wise assessment using an innovative Graph Neural Network approach, trained from the outputs of a Monte Carlo dropout model. This network allows the fusion of three estimators of voxel uncertainty: entropy, variance, and model's confidence; and can be applied to any lesion, regardless of its shape or size. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach for uncertainty estimate on a task of Multiple Sclerosis lesions segmentation. ",

    "abstract": "In December 2019, the global pandemic COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, affected human life and the worldwide economy. Therefore, an efficient diagnostic system is required to control its spread. However, the automatic diagnostic system poses challenges with a limited amount of labeled data, minor contrast variation, and high structural similarity between infection and background. In this regard, a new two-phase deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based diagnostic system is proposed to detect minute irregularities and analyze COVID-19 infection. In the first phase, a novel SB-STM-BRNet CNN is proposed, incorporating a new channel Squeezed and Boosted (SB) and dilated convolutional-based Split-Transform-Merge (STM) block to detect COVID-19 infected CT lungs images. The new STM blocks performed multi-path region-smoothing and boundary operations, which helped to learn minor contrast variation and global COVID-19 specific patterns. Furthermore, the diverse boosted channels are achieved using the SB and Transfer Learning concepts in STM blocks to learn texture variation between COVID-19-specific and healthy images. In the second phase, COVID-19 infected images are provided to the novel COVID-CB-RESeg segmentation CNN to identify and analyze COVID-19 infectious regions. The proposed COVID-CB-RESeg methodically employed region-homogeneity, heterogeneity operations, and channel boosting using auxiliary channels in each encoder and decoder block to simultaneously learn the low illumination and boundaries of the COVID-19 infected region. The proposed diagnostic system yields good performance in terms of accuracy: 98.21 %, F-score: 98.24%, Dice Similarity: 96.40 %, and IOU: 98.85 % for the COVID-19 infected region. The proposed diagnostic system would reduce the burden and strengthen the radiologist's decision for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. ",

    "abstract": "The principal reason for measuring mental workload is to quantify the cognitive cost of performing tasks to predict human performance. Unfortunately, a method for assessing mental workload that has general applicability does not exist yet. This research presents a novel self-supervised method for mental workload modelling from EEG data employing Deep Learning and a continuous brain rate, an index of cognitive activation, without requiring human declarative knowledge. This method is a convolutional recurrent neural network trainable with spatially preserving spectral topographic head-maps from EEG data to fit the brain rate variable. Findings demonstrate the capacity of the convolutional layers to learn meaningful high-level representations from EEG data since within-subject models had a test Mean Absolute Percentage Error average of 11%. The addition of a Long-Short Term Memory layer for handling sequences of high-level representations was not significant, although it did improve their accuracy. Findings point to the existence of quasi-stable blocks of learnt high-level representations of cognitive activation because they can be induced through convolution and seem not to be dependent on each other over time, intuitively matching the non-stationary nature of brain responses. Across-subject models, induced with data from an increasing number of participants, thus containing more variability, obtained a similar accuracy to the within-subject models. This highlights the potential generalisability of the induced high-level representations across people, suggesting the existence of subject-independent cognitive activation patterns. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing scholars with a novel computational method for mental workload modelling that aims to be generally applicable, does not rely on ad-hoc human-crafted models supporting replicability and falsifiability.

Current state-of-the-art methods focus on training a neural network exploiting features directly contained in the acoustics, such as Mel Filter Banks (MFBs). Such methods therefore require an extra normalisation step to adapt to a new domain where the acoustics is impacted, which can be simply due to a change of speaker, microphone, or environment. In addition, this normalisation step is usually a rather rudimentary method that has certain limitations, such as being highly susceptible to the amount of data available for the new domain. Here, we exploited the crowd-sourced Common Voice (CV) corpus to show that representations based on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) can adapt well to different domains, because they are computed with contextualised representations of speech across multiple domains. SSL representations also achieve better results than systems based on hand-crafted representations (MFBs), and off-the-shelf VADs, with significant improvement in cross-domain settings. ",

We define an NNE in terms of the trajectory of the model parameters under a simple, and discrete in time, diffusive dynamics, and train the NNE by biasing these trajectories towards a small time-integrated loss, as controlled by appropriate counting fields which act as hyperparameters. We demonstrate the viability of this technique on a range of simple supervised learning tasks.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an auxiliary method used to perform both the diagnosis and the monitoring of epilepsy. Given the unexpected nature of an epileptic seizure, its prediction would improve patient care, optimizing the quality of life and the treatment of epilepsy. Predicting an epileptic seizure implies the identification of two distinct states of EEG in a patient with epilepsy: the preictal and the interictal. In this paper, we developed two deep learning models called Temporal Multi-Channel Transformer (TMC-T) and Vision Transformer (TMC-ViT), adaptations of Transformer-based architectures for multi-channel temporal signals. Moreover, we accessed the impact of choosing different preictal duration, since its length is not a consensus among experts, and also evaluated how the sample size benefits each model. Our models are compared with fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent networks. The algorithms were patient-specific trained and evaluated on raw EEG signals from the CHB-MIT database. Experimental results and statistical validation demonstrated that our TMC-ViT model surpassed the CNN architecture, state-of-the-art in seizure prediction. ",
