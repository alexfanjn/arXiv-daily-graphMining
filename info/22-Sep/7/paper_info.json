    "abstract": "Contextual ASR, which takes a list of bias terms as input along with audio, has drawn recent interest as ASR use becomes more widespread. We are releasing contextual biasing lists to accompany the Earnings21 dataset, creating a public benchmark for this task. We present baseline results on this benchmark using a pretrained end-to-end ASR model from the WeNet toolkit. We show results for shallow fusion contextual biasing applied to two different decoding algorithms. Our baseline results confirm observations that end-to-end models struggle in particular with words that are rarely or never seen during training, and that existing shallow fusion techniques do not adequately address this problem. We propose an alternate spelling prediction model that improves recall of rare words by 34.7% relative and of out-of-vocabulary words by 97.2% relative, compared to contextual biasing without alternate spellings. This model is conceptually similar to ones used in prior work, but is simpler to implement as it does not rely on either a pronunciation dictionary or an existing text-to-speech system. ",

    "abstract": "Many studies on scaling laws consider basic factors such as model size, model shape, dataset size, and compute power. These factors are easily tunable and represent the fundamental elements of any machine learning setup. But researchers have also employed more complex factors to estimate the test error and generalization performance with high predictability. These factors are generally specific to the domain or application. For example, feature diversity was primarily used for promoting syn-to-real transfer by Chen et al. (2021). With numerous scaling factors defined in previous works, it would be interesting to investigate how these factors may affect overall generalization performance in the context of self-supervised learning with CNN models. How do individual factors promote generalization, which includes varying depth, width, or the number of training epochs with early stopping? For example, does higher feature diversity result in higher accuracy held in complex settings other than a syn-to-real transfer? How do these factors depend on each other? We found that the last layer is the most diversified throughout the training. However, while the model's test error decreases with increasing epochs, its diversity drops. We also discovered that diversity is directly related to model width. ",

    "title": "Are Attribute Inference Attacks Just Imputation?",
    "abstract": "Models can expose sensitive information about their training data. In an attribute inference attack, an adversary has partial knowledge of some training records and access to a model trained on those records, and infers the unknown values of a sensitive feature of those records. We study a fine-grained variant of attribute inference we call \\emph{sensitive value inference}, where the adversary's goal is to identify with high confidence some records from a candidate set where the unknown attribute has a particular sensitive value. We explicitly compare attribute inference with data imputation that captures the training distribution statistics, under various assumptions about the training data available to the adversary. Our main conclusions are: (1) previous attribute inference methods do not reveal more about the training data from the model than can be inferred by an adversary without access to the trained model, but with the same knowledge of the underlying distribution as needed to train the attribute inference attack; (2) black-box attribute inference attacks rarely learn anything that cannot be learned without the model; but (3) white-box attacks, which we introduce and evaluate in the paper, can reliably identify some records with the sensitive value attribute that would not be predicted without having access to the model. Furthermore, we show that proposed defenses such as differentially private training and removing vulnerable records from training do not mitigate this privacy risk.

Self-knowledge distillation, the special case of knowledge distillation, has been proposed to remove the large teacher network training process while preserving the student's performance. This paper introduces a novel Self-knowledge distillation approach via Siamese representation learning, which minimizes the difference between two representation vectors of the two different views from a given sample. Our proposed method, SKD-SRL, utilizes both soft label distillation and the similarity of representation vectors. Therefore, SKD-SRL can generate more consistent predictions and representations in various views of the same data point. Our benchmark has been evaluated on various standard datasets. The experimental results have shown that SKD-SRL significantly improves the accuracy compared to existing supervised learning and knowledge distillation methods regardless of the networks. ",

    "title": "Label Structure Preserving Contrastive Embedding for Multi-Label  Learning with Missing Labels",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) has shown impressive advances in image representation learning in whichever supervised multi-class classification or unsupervised learning. However, these CL methods fail to be directly adapted to multi-label image classification due to the difficulty in defining the positive and negative instances to contrast a given anchor image in multi-label scenario, let the label missing one alone, implying that borrowing a commonly-used way from contrastive multi-class learning to define them will incur a lot of false negative instances unfavorable for learning. In this paper, with the introduction of a label correction mechanism to identify missing labels, we first elegantly generate positives and negatives for individual semantic labels of an anchor image, then define a unique contrastive loss for multi-label image classification with missing labels (CLML), the loss is able to accurately bring images close to their true positive images and false negative images, far away from their true negative images. Different from existing multi-label CL losses, CLML also preserves low-rank global and local label dependencies in the latent representation space where such dependencies have been shown to be helpful in dealing with missing labels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general multi-label CL loss in the missing-label scenario and thus can seamlessly be paired with those losses of any existing multi-label learning methods just via a single hyperparameter. The proposed strategy has been shown to improve the classification performance of the Resnet101 model by margins of 1.2%, 1.6%, and 1.3% respectively on three standard datasets, MSCOCO, VOC, and NUS-WIDE.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on mobile apps serving the underground economy by providing illegal services in the mobile system (e.g., gambling, porn, scam). These apps are named as underground economy apps, or UEware for short. As most UEware do not have malicious payloads, traditional malware detection approaches are ineffective to perform the detection. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to effectively and efficiently detect UEware by considering the transition orders of the user interfaces (UIs), which determine the usage scenarios of these apps. Based on the proposed approach, we design a system named DeUEDroid to detect the UEware via scene graph. To evaluate DeUEDroid, we collect 26, 591 apps to evaluate DeUEDroid and build up the first large-scale ground-truth UEware dataset (1, 720 underground economy apps and 831 legitimate apps). The evaluation result shows that DeUEDroid can construct scene graph accurately, and achieve the accuracy scores of 77.70% on the five-classification task (i.e., gambling game, porn, financial scam, miscellaneous, and legitimate apps), reaching obvious improvements over the SOTA approaches. Running further on 24, 017 apps, DeUEDroid performs well in the real-world scenario to mitigate the threat. Specifically, by using DeUEDroid, we found that UEware are prevalent, i.e., 61% apps in the wild and 21% apps in the app stores are UEware (with over 72% accuracy after the manual investigation). We will release our dataset and system to engage the community after been accepted. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have achieved promising disease prediction performance of the Electronic Health Records (EHR) of patients. However, most models developed under the I.I.D. hypothesis fail to consider the agnostic distribution shifts, diminishing the generalization ability of deep learning models to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. In this setting, spurious statistical correlations that may change in different environments will be exploited, which can cause sub-optimal performances of deep learning models. The unstable correlation between procedures and diagnoses existed in the training distribution can cause spurious correlation between historical EHR and future diagnosis. To address this problem, we propose to use a causal representation learning method called Causal Healthcare Embedding (CHE). CHE aims at eliminating the spurious statistical relationship by removing the dependencies between diagnoses and procedures. We introduce the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the degree of independence between the embedded diagnosis and procedure features. Based on causal view analyses, we perform the sample weighting technique to get rid of such spurious relationship for the stable learning of EHR across different environments. Moreover, our proposed CHE method can be used as a flexible plug-and-play module that can enhance existing deep learning models on EHR. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and five state-of-the-art baselines unequivocally show that CHE can improve the prediction accuracy of deep learning models on out-of-distribution data by a large margin. In addition, the interpretability study shows that CHE could successfully leverage causal structures to reflect a more reasonable contribution of historical records for predictions. ",

    "abstract": "Data aggregation in the setting of local differential privacy (LDP) guarantees strong privacy by providing plausible deniability of sensitive data. Existing works on this issue mostly focused on discovering heavy hitters, leaving the task of frequent itemset mining (FIM) as an open problem. To the best of our knowledge, the-state-of-the-art LDP solution to FIM is the SVSM protocol proposed recently. The SVSM protocol is mainly based on the padding and sampling based frequency oracle (PSFO) protocol, and regarded an itemset as an independent item without considering the frequency consistency among itemsets. In this paper, we propose a novel LDP approach to FIM called LDP-FPMiner based on frequent pattern tree (FP-tree). Our proposal exploits frequency consistency among itemsets by constructing and optimizing a noisy FP-tree with LDP. Specifically, it works as follows. First, the most frequent items are identified, and the item domain is cut down accordingly. Second, the maximum level of the FP-tree is estimated. Third, a noisy FP-tree is constructed and optimized by using itemset frequency consistency, and then mined to obtain the k most frequent itemsets. Experimental results show that the LDP-FPMiner significantly improves over the state-of-the-art approach, SVSM, especially in the case of a high privacy level. ",

In this paper, based on the singular value decompositions of some graph Laplacians, we propose two GFTs on the Cartesian product graph of two directed graphs.

Previous works mainly adopt the multi-stage architecture by stacking generator-discriminator pairs to engage multiple adversarial training, where the text semantics used to provide generation guidance remain static across all stages. This work argues that text features at each stage should be adaptively re-composed conditioned on the status of the historical stage (i.e., historical stage's text and image features) to provide diversified and accurate semantic guidance during the coarse-to-fine generation process. We thereby propose a novel Dynamical Semantic Evolution GAN (DSE-GAN) to re-compose each stage's text features under a novel single adversarial multi-stage architecture. Specifically, we design (1) Dynamic Semantic Evolution (DSE) module, which first aggregates historical image features to summarize the generative feedback, and then dynamically selects words required to be re-composed at each stage as well as re-composed them by dynamically enhancing or suppressing different granularity subspace's semantics. (2) Single Adversarial Multi-stage Architecture (SAMA), which extends the previous structure by eliminating complicated multiple adversarial training requirements and therefore allows more stages of text-image interactions, and finally facilitates the DSE module. We conduct comprehensive experiments and show that DSE-GAN achieves 7.48\\% and 37.8\\% relative FID improvement on two widely used benchmarks, i.e., CUB-200 and MSCOCO, respectively. ",

For DNN-aided receivers, obtaining labeled data conventionally involves pilot signalling at the cost of reduced spectral efficiency, typically resulting in access to limited data sets. In this paper, we study how one can enrich a small set of labeled pilots data into a larger data set for training deep receivers. Motivated by the widespread use of data augmentation techniques for enriching visual and text data, we propose dedicated augmentation schemes that exploits the characteristics of digital communication data. We identify the key considerations in data augmentations for deep receivers as the need for domain orientation, class (constellation) diversity, and low complexity. Following these guidelines, we devise three complementing augmentations that exploit the geometric properties of digital constellations. Our combined augmentation approach builds on the merits of these different augmentations to synthesize reliable data from a momentary channel distribution, to be used for training deep receivers. Furthermore, we exploit previous channel realizations to increase the reliability of the augmented samples. ",

In this paper, we raise an intriguing question - if the combination of image restoration and object detection, can boost the performance of cutting-edge detectors in adverse weather conditions. To answer it, we propose an effective yet unified detection paradigm that bridges these two subtasks together via dynamic enhancement learning to discern objects in adverse weather conditions, called TogetherNet. Different from existing efforts that intuitively apply image dehazing/deraining as a pre-processing step, TogetherNet considers a multi-task joint learning problem. Following the joint learning scheme, clean features produced by the restoration network can be shared to learn better object detection in the detection network, thus helping TogetherNet enhance the detection capacity in adverse weather conditions. Besides the joint learning architecture, we design a new Dynamic Transformer Feature Enhancement module to improve the feature extraction and representation capabilities of TogetherNet. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our TogetherNet outperforms the state-of-the-art detection approaches by a large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Each dataset contains the feature matrix and the incidence matrix of the hypergraph (i.e., constructed from the feature matrix). This novel clustering method utilizes both matrices. Initially, the hypergraph auto-encoders are employed to transform both the incidence matrix and the feature matrix from high dimensional space to low dimensional space. In the end, we apply the k-means clustering technique to the transformed matrix.

    "abstract": "Inductive link prediction (ILP) is to predict links for unseen entities in emerging knowledge graphs (KGs), considering the evolving nature of KGs. A more challenging scenario is that emerging KGs consist of only unseen entities, called as disconnected emerging KGs (DEKGs). Existing studies for DEKGs only focus on predicting enclosing links, i.e., predicting links inside the emerging KG. The bridging links, which carry the evolutionary information from the original KG to DEKG, have not been investigated by previous work so far. To fill in the gap, we propose a novel model entitled DEKG-ILP (Disconnected Emerging Knowledge Graph Oriented Inductive Link Prediction) that consists of the following two components. (1) The module CLRM (Contrastive Learning-based Relation-specific Feature Modeling) is developed to extract global relation-based semantic features that are shared between original KGs and DEKGs with a novel sampling strategy. (2) The module GSM (GNN-based Subgraph Modeling) is proposed to extract the local subgraph topological information around each link in KGs. The extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DEKG-ILP has obvious performance improvements compared with state-of-the-art methods for both enclosing and bridging link prediction.

    "abstract": "Human drivers have distinct driving techniques, knowledge, and sentiments due to unique driving traits. Driver drowsiness has been a serious issue endangering road safety; therefore, it is essential to design an effective drowsiness detection algorithm to bypass road accidents. Miscellaneous research efforts have been approached the problem of detecting anomalous human driver behaviour to examine the frontal face of the driver and automobile dynamics via computer vision techniques. Still, the conventional methods cannot capture complicated driver behaviour features. However, with the origin of deep learning architectures, a substantial amount of research has also been executed to analyze and recognize driver's drowsiness using neural network algorithms. This paper introduces a novel framework based on vision transformers and YoloV5 architectures for driver drowsiness recognition. A custom YoloV5 pre-trained architecture is proposed for face extraction with the aim of extracting Region of Interest (ROI). Owing to the limitations of previous architectures, this paper introduces vision transformers for binary image classification which is trained and validated on a public dataset UTA-RLDD. The model had achieved 96.2\\% and 97.4\\% as it's training and validation accuracies respectively. For the further evaluation, proposed framework is tested on a custom dataset of 39 participants in various light circumstances and achieved 95.5\\% accuracy. The conducted experimentations revealed the significant potential of our framework for practical applications in smart transportation systems. ",

    "abstract": "Existing Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) mainly operate on local convolutions with binarization function. However, such simple bit operations lack the ability of modeling contextual dependencies, which is critical for learning discriminative deep representations in vision models. In this work, we tackle this issue by presenting new designs of binary neural modules, which enables BNNs to learn effective contextual dependencies. First, we propose a binary multi-layer perceptron (MLP) block as an alternative to binary convolution blocks to directly model contextual dependencies. Both short-range and long-range feature dependencies are modeled by binary MLPs, where the former provides local inductive bias and the latter breaks limited receptive field in binary convolutions. Second, to improve the robustness of binary models with contextual dependencies, we compute the contextual dynamic embeddings to determine the binarization thresholds in general binary convolutional blocks. Armed with our binary MLP blocks and improved binary convolution, we build the BNNs with explicit Contextual Dependency modeling, termed as BCDNet. On the standard ImageNet-1K classification benchmark, the BCDNet achieves 72.3% Top-1 accuracy and outperforms leading binary methods by a large margin. In particular, the proposed BCDNet exceeds the state-of-the-art ReActNet-A by 2.9% Top-1 accuracy with similar operations. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sense-GVT/BCDN ",

However, the natural incompleteness has significantly hindered the applications of MKGs. To tackle the problem, existing studies employ the embedding-based reasoning models to infer the missing knowledge after fusing the multi-modal features. However, the reasoning performance of these methods is limited due to the following problems: (1) ineffective fusion of multi-modal auxiliary features; (2) lack of complex reasoning ability as well as inability to conduct the multi-hop reasoning which is able to infer more missing knowledge. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel model entitled MMKGR (Multi-hop Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Reasoning). Specifically, the model contains the following two components: (1) a unified gate-attention network which is designed to generate effective multi-modal complementary features through sufficient attention interaction and noise reduction; (2) a complementary feature-aware reinforcement learning method which is proposed to predict missing elements by performing the multi-hop reasoning process, based on the features obtained in component (1). The experimental results demonstrate that MMKGR outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in the MKG reasoning task. ",

    "abstract": "Many cyberattacks start with disseminating phishing URLs. When clicking these phishing URLs, the victim's private information is leaked to the attacker. There have been proposed several machine learning methods to detect phishing URLs. However, it still remains under-explored to detect phishing URLs with evasion, i.e., phishing URLs that pretend to be benign by manipulating patterns. In many cases, the attacker i) reuses prepared phishing web pages because making a completely brand-new set costs non-trivial expenses, ii) prefers hosting companies that do not require private information and are cheaper than others, iii) prefers shared hosting for cost efficiency, and iv) sometimes uses benign domains, IP addresses, and URL string patterns to evade existing detection methods. Inspired by those behavioral characteristics, we present a network-based inference method to accurately detect phishing URLs camouflaged with legitimate patterns, i.e., robust to evasion. In the network approach, a phishing URL will be still identified as phishy even after evasion unless a majority of its neighbors in the network are evaded at the same time. Our method consistently shows better detection performance throughout various experimental tests than state-of-the-art methods, e.g., F-1 of 0.89 for our method vs. 0.84 for the best feature-based method.

    "abstract": "Note that the serial structure of blockchain has a number of essential pitfalls, and, thus, a data network structure and its DAG-based blockchain are introduced to resolve the blockchain pitfalls. From such a network perspective, analysis of the DAG-based blockchain systems becomes interesting but difficult and challenging. So, the simulation models are adopted widely. In this paper, we first describe a simple Markov model for the DAG-based blockchain with IOTA Tangle by means of two layers of tips and internal tips' impatient connection behavior. Then we set up a continuous-time Markov process to analyze the DAG-based blockchain system and show that this Markov process is a level-dependent quasi-birth-and-death (QBD) process. Based on this, we prove that the QBD process must be irreducible and positive recurrent. Furthermore, once the stationary probability vector of the QBD process is given, we provide performance analysis of the DAG-based blockchain system. Nextly, we propose a new effective method for computing the average sojourn time of any arriving internal tip at this system by means of the first passage times and the PH distributions. Finally, we use numerical examples to check the validity of our theoretical results and indicate how some key system parameters influence the performance measures of this system. Therefore, we hope that the methodology and results developed in this paper shed light on the DAG-based blockchain systems such that a series of promising research can be developed potentially. ",

However, classical frameworks of privacy (e.g., differential privacy (DP)) have overlooked the impact of data freshness on privacy guarantees, which may lead to unnecessary accuracy loss when trying to achieve meaningful privacy guarantees in time-varying databases. In this work, we introduce \\textit{age-dependent DP}, taking into account the underlying stochastic nature of a time-varying database. In this new framework, we establish a connection between classical DP and age-dependent DP, based on which we characterize the impact of data staleness and temporal correlation on privacy guarantees. Our characterization demonstrates that \\textit{aging}, i.e., using stale data inputs and/or postponing the release of outputs, can be a new strategy to protect data privacy in addition to noise injection in the traditional DP framework. Furthermore, to generalize our results to a multi-query scenario, we present a sequential composition result for age-dependent DP under any publishing and aging policies. We then characterize the optimal tradeoffs between privacy risk and utility and show how this can be achieved. Finally, case studies show that to achieve a target of an arbitrarily small privacy risk in a single-query case, combing aging and noise injection only leads to a bounded accuracy loss, whereas using noise injection only (as in the benchmark case of DP) will lead to an unbounded accuracy loss.

By requiring the presence of any individual's data in the input to only marginally affect the distribution over the output, differential privacy provides strong protection against adversaries in possession of arbitrary background. However, the privacy constraints (e.g., the degree of randomization) imposed by differential privacy may render the released data less useful for analysis, the fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility (i.e., analysis accuracy) has attracted significant attention in various settings. In this report we present DP mechanisms with randomized parameters, i.e., randomized privacy budget, and formally analyze its privacy and utility and demonstrate that randomizing privacy budget in DP mechanisms will boost the accuracy in a humongous scale.

We apply our method to the challenging case of Sign Language videos: given a source video of a sign language user, we can faithfully transfer the performed manual (e.g. handshape, palm orientation, movement, location) and non-manual (e.g. eye gaze, facial expressions, head movements) signs to a target video in a photo-realistic manner. To effectively capture the aforementioned cues, which are crucial for sign language communication, we build upon an effective combination of the most robust and reliable deep learning methods for body, hand and face tracking that have been introduced lately. Using a 3D-aware representation, the estimated motions of the body parts are combined and retargeted to the target signer. They are then given as conditional input to our Video Rendering Network, which generates temporally consistent and photo-realistic videos. We conduct detailed qualitative and quantitative evaluations and comparisons, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its advantages over existing approaches. Our method yields promising results of unprecedented realism and can be used for Sign Language Anonymization. In addition, it can be readily applicable to reenactment of other types of full body activities (dancing, acting performance, exercising, etc.), as well as to the synthesis module of Sign Language Production systems.

However, due to the increasing complexity of automotive systems, practitioners fail to specify requirements and tests for distributed and evolving systems with complex interactions when following traditional development processes. To address this research gap, we propose a technique that starts with the early identification of validation concerns from a stakeholder perspective, which we use to systematically design tests that drive a scenario-based modeling and automated analysis of system requirements. We discover that Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are suitable to automate the test-case design and hence enable the application of our technique to real-world stakeholder requirements. To ensure complete and consistent requirements and test specifications in a form that is required in automotive development projects, we develop a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methodology. This methodology supports system architects and test designers in the collaborative application of our technique and in maintaining a central system model, in order to automatically derive the required specifications. We evaluate our methodology by applying it at KOSTAL (Tier1 supplier) and within student projects as part of the masters program Embedded Systems Engineering. Our study corroborates that our methodology is applicable and improves existing requirements and test specification processes by supporting the integrated and stakeholder-focused modeling of product and validation systems, where the early definition of stakeholder and validation concerns fosters a problem-oriented, iterative and test-driven requirements modeling.

However, traditional approaches require the knowledge of several abstract quantities such as the energy or force to infer the dynamics of these particles. Here, we present a framework, namely, Lagrangian graph neural network (LGnn), that provides a strong inductive bias to learn the Lagrangian of a particle-based system directly from the trajectory. We test our approach on challenging systems with constraints and drag -- LGnn outperforms baselines such as feed-forward Lagrangian neural network (Lnn) with improved performance. We also show the zero-shot generalizability of the system by simulating systems two orders of magnitude larger than the trained one and also hybrid systems that are unseen by the model, a unique feature. The graph architecture of LGnn significantly simplifies the learning in comparison to Lnn with ~25 times better performance on ~20 times smaller amounts of data. Finally, we show the interpretability of LGnn, which directly provides physical insights on drag and constraint forces learned by the model. LGnn can thus provide a fillip toward understanding the dynamics of physical systems purely from observable quantities. ",

    "abstract": "Preoperative and noninvasive prediction of the meningioma grade is important in clinical practice, as it directly influences the clinical decision making. What's more, brain invasion in meningioma (i.e., the presence of tumor tissue within the adjacent brain tissue) is an independent criterion for the grading of meningioma and influences the treatment strategy. Although efforts have been reported to address these two tasks, most of them rely on hand-crafted features and there is no attempt to exploit the two prediction tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel task-aware contrastive learning algorithm to jointly predict meningioma grade and brain invasion from multi-modal MRIs. Based on the basic multi-task learning framework, our key idea is to adopt contrastive learning strategy to disentangle the image features into task-specific features and task-common features, and explicitly leverage their inherent connections to improve feature representation for the two prediction tasks. In this retrospective study, an MRI dataset was collected, for which 800 patients (containing 148 high-grade, 62 invasion) were diagnosed with meningioma by pathological analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms alternative multi-task learning methods, achieving AUCs of 0:8870 and 0:9787 for the prediction of meningioma grade and brain invasion, respectively.

    "title": "Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning for Review-based Recommendation",
    "abstract": "User review data is helpful in alleviating the data sparsity problem in many recommender systems. In review-based recommendation methods, review data is considered as auxiliary information that can improve the quality of learned user/item or interaction representations for the user rating prediction task. However, these methods usually model user-item interactions in a holistic manner and neglect the entanglement of the latent factors behind them, e.g., price, quality, or appearance, resulting in suboptimal representations and reducing interpretability. In this paper, we propose a Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning framework for Review-based recommendation (DGCLR), to separately model the user-item interactions based on different latent factors through the textual review data. To this end, we first model the distributions of interactions over latent factors from both semantic information in review data and structural information in user-item graph data, forming several factor graphs. Then a factorized message passing mechanism is designed to learn disentangled user/item representations on the factor graphs, which enable us to further characterize the interactions and adaptively combine the predicted ratings from multiple factors via a devised attention mechanism. Finally, we set two factor-wise contrastive learning objectives to alleviate the sparsity issue and model the user/item and interaction features pertinent to each factor more accurately. Empirical results over five benchmark datasets validate the superiority of DGCLR over the state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis is offered to interpret the learned intent factors and rating prediction in DGCLR. ",

    "abstract": "In a multilingual neural machine translation model that fully shares parameters across all languages, an artificial language token is usually used to guide translation into the desired target language. However, recent studies show that prepending language tokens sometimes fails to navigate the multilingual neural machine translation models into right translation directions, especially on zero-shot translation. To mitigate this issue, we propose two methods, language embedding embodiment and language-aware multi-head attention, to learn informative language representations to channel translation into right directions. The former embodies language embeddings into different critical switching points along the information flow from the source to the target, aiming at amplifying translation direction guiding signals. The latter exploits a matrix, instead of a vector, to represent a language in the continuous space. The matrix is chunked into multiple heads so as to learn language representations in multiple subspaces. Experiment results on two datasets for massively multilingual neural machine translation demonstrate that language-aware multi-head attention benefits both supervised and zero-shot translation and significantly alleviates the off-target translation issue. Further linguistic typology prediction experiments show that matrix-based language representations learned by our methods are capable of capturing rich linguistic typology features. ",

    "abstract": "The growing societal dependence on social media and user generated content for news and information has increased the influence of unreliable sources and fake content, which muddles public discourse and lessens trust in the media. Validating the credibility of such information is a difficult task that is susceptible to confirmation bias, leading to the development of algorithmic techniques to distinguish between fake and real news. However, most existing methods are challenging to interpret, making it difficult to establish trust in predictions, and make assumptions that are unrealistic in many real-world scenarios, e.g., the availability of audiovisual features or provenance. In this work, we focus on fake news detection of textual content using interpretable features and methods. In particular, we have developed a deep probabilistic model that integrates a dense representation of textual news using a variational autoencoder and bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with semantic topic-related features inferred from a Bayesian admixture model. Extensive experimental studies with 3 real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art competing models while facilitating model interpretability from the learned topics. Finally, we have conducted model ablation studies to justify the effectiveness and accuracy of integrating neural embeddings and topic features both quantitatively by evaluating performance and qualitatively through separability in lower dimensional embeddings.

However, it is unfortunately accompanied by growing privacy concerns about leaking sensitive user information. How to fully utilize the data from different online social networks while preserving user privacy remains largely unsolved. To this end, we propose a Cross-network Social User Embedding framework, namely DP-CroSUE, to learn the comprehensive representations of users in a privacy-preserving way. We jointly consider information from partially aligned social networks with differential privacy guarantees. In particular, for each heterogeneous social network, we first introduce a hybrid differential privacy notion to capture the variation of privacy expectations for heterogeneous data types. Next, to find user linkages across social networks, we make unsupervised user embedding-based alignment in which the user embeddings are achieved by the heterogeneous network embedding technology. To further enhance user embeddings, a novel cross-network GCN embedding model is designed to transfer knowledge across networks through those aligned users. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach makes a significant improvement on user interest prediction tasks as well as defending user attribute inference attacks from embedding.

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of InviCloak, a system that protects the confidentiality and integrity of a user and a website's private communications without changing TLS or upgrading a CDN. InviCloak builds a lightweight but secure and practical key distribution mechanism using the existing DNS infrastructure to distribute a new public key associated with a website's domain name. A web client and a website can use the new key pair to build an encryption channel inside TLS. InviCloak accommodates the current web ecosystem. A website can deploy InviCloak unilaterally without a client's involvement to prevent a passive attacker inside a CDN from eavesdropping on their communications. If a client also installs InviCloak's browser extension, the client and the website can achieve end-to-end confidential and untampered communications in the presence of an active attacker inside a CDN. Our evaluation shows that InviCloak increases the median page load times (PLTs) of realistic web pages from 2.0s to 2.1s, which is smaller than the median PLTs (2.7s) of a state-of-the-art TEE-based solution.

As one of the critical steps to achieve a powerful BNN, the scale factor calculation plays an essential role in reducing the performance gap to their real-valued counterparts. However, existing BNNs neglect the intrinsic bilinear relationship of real-valued weights and scale factors, resulting in a sub-optimal model caused by an insufficient training process. To address this issue, Recurrent Bilinear Optimization is proposed to improve the learning process of BNNs (RBONNs) by associating the intrinsic bilinear variables in the back propagation process. Our work is the first attempt to optimize BNNs from the bilinear perspective. Specifically, we employ a recurrent optimization and Density-ReLU to sequentially backtrack the sparse real-valued weight filters, which will be sufficiently trained and reach their performance limits based on a controllable learning process. We obtain robust RBONNs, which show impressive performance over state-of-the-art BNNs on various models and datasets.

While many works have been established in domains related to node and graph classification/regression tasks, they mostly deal with a single task. Continual learning on graphs is largely unexplored and existing graph continual learning approaches are limited to the task-incremental learning scenarios. This paper proposes a graph continual learning strategy that combines the architecture-based and memory-based approaches. The structural learning strategy is driven by reinforcement learning, where a controller network is trained in such a way to determine an optimal number of nodes to be added/pruned from the base network when new tasks are observed, thus assuring sufficient network capacities. The parameter learning strategy is underpinned by the concept of Dark Experience replay method to cope with the catastrophic forgetting problem. Our approach is numerically validated with several graph continual learning benchmark problems in both task-incremental learning and class-incremental learning settings. Compared to recently published works, our approach demonstrates improved performance in both the settings. The implementation code can be found at \\url{https://github.com/codexhammer/gcl}. ",

Most previous methods conduct text augmentation without considering the different functionalities of the words in the text, which may generate unsatisfactory samples. Different words may play different roles in text classification, which inspires us to strategically select the proper roles for text augmentation. In this work, we first identify the relationships between the words in a text and the text category from the perspectives of statistical correlation and semantic similarity and then utilize them to divide the words into four roles -- Gold, Venture, Bonus, and Trivial words, which have different functionalities for text classification. Based on these word roles, we present a new augmentation technique called STA (Selective Text Augmentation) where different text-editing operations are selectively applied to words with specific roles. STA can generate diverse and relatively clean samples, while preserving the original core semantics, and is also quite simple to implement. Extensive experiments on 5 benchmark low-resource text classification datasets illustrate that augmented samples produced by STA successfully boost the performance of classification models which significantly outperforms previous non-selective methods, including two large language model-based techniques. Cross-dataset experiments further indicate that STA can help the classifiers generalize better to other datasets than previous methods. ",

It identifies the information of different abstraction levels, and thus introduces the domain knowledge on development and reveals the hierarchy of software.

We then reported our sites to VirusTotal and other platforms, with regular polling of results for 7 days, to ascertain the efficacy of each cloning technique. Results show that no security vendor detected our clones, proving the urgent need for more effective detectors.

    "abstract": "In this study, we dive deep into the unique challenges in semi-supervised object detection~(SSOD). We observe that current detectors generally suffer from 3 inconsistency problems. 1) Assignment inconsistency, that the conventional assignment policy is sensitive to labeling noise. 2) Subtasks inconsistency, where the classification and regression predictions are misaligned at the same feature point. 3) Temporal inconsistency, that the pseudo bboxes vary dramatically at different training steps. These issues lead to inconsistent optimization objectives of the student network, thus deteriorating performance and slowing down the model convergence. We, therefore, propose a systematic solution, termed Consistent Teacher, to remedy the above-mentioned challenges. First, adaptive anchor assignment substitutes the static IoU-based strategy, which enables the student network to be resistant to noisy psudo bboxes; Then we calibrate the subtask predictions by designing a feature alignment module; Lastly, We adopt a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to dynamically adjust the pseudo-boxes threshold. Consistent Teacher provides a new strong baseline on a large range of SSOD evaluations. It achieves 40.0 mAP with ResNet-50 backbone given only 10% of annotated MS-COCO data, which surpasses previous baselines using pseudo labels by around 4 mAP. When trained on fully annotated MS-COCO with additional unlabeled data, the performance further increases to 49.1 mAP. Our code will be open-sourced soon. ",

Such graphical structure is thus a store house rich information. This has various implication depending on whether we are interested in a node or the graph as a whole. In this paper, we are primarily concerned with the later, that is, the inference that the structure of the graph influences the property of the real life system it represents. A model of such structural influence would be useful in inferencing useful properties of complex and large systems, like VLSI circuits, through its structural property. However, before we can apply some machine learning (ML) based technique to model such relationship, an effective representation of the graph is imperative. In this paper, we propose a graph representation which is lossless, linear-sized in terms of number of vertices and gives a 1-D representation of the graph. Our representation is based on Prufer encoding for trees. Moreover, our method is based on a novel technique, called $\\mathcal{GT}$-enhancement whereby we first transform the graph such that it can be represented by a singular tree. The encoding also provides scope to include additional graph property and improve the interpretability of the code. ",

This problem is particularly challenging due to the topological obstructions induced by the obstacle, which preclude the existence of smooth feedback controllers able to achieve simultaneous stabilization and robust obstacle avoidance. To overcome this issue, we develop a vision-based hybrid controller that switches between two different feedback laws depending on the current position of the vehicle using a hysteresis mechanism and a data-assisted supervisor. The main innovation of the paper is the incorporation of suitable perception maps into the hybrid controller. These maps can be learned from data obtained from cameras in the vehicles and trained via convolutional neural networks (CNN). Under suitable assumptions on this perception map, we establish theoretical guarantees for the trajectories of the vehicle in terms of convergence and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, the proposed vision-based hybrid controller is numerically tested under different scenarios, including noisy data, sensors with failures, and cameras with occlusions. ",

    "abstract": "Dashboards, which comprise multiple views on a single display, help analyze and communicate multiple perspectives of data simultaneously. However, creating effective and elegant dashboards is challenging since it requires careful and logical arrangement and coordination of multiple visualizations. To solve the problem, we propose a data-driven approach for mining design rules from dashboards and automating dashboard organization. Specifically, we focus on two prominent aspects of the organization: arrangement, which describes the position, size, and layout of each view in the display space; and coordination, which indicates the interaction between pairwise views. We build a new dataset containing 854 dashboards crawled online, and develop feature engineering methods for describing the single views and view-wise relationships in terms of data, encoding, layout, and interactions. Further, we identify design rules among those features and develop a recommender for dashboard design. We demonstrate the usefulness of DMiner through an expert study and a user study. The expert study shows that our extracted design rules are reasonable and conform to the design practice of experts. Moreover, a comparative user study shows that our recommender could help automate dashboard organization and reach human-level performance. In summary, our work offers a promising starting point for design mining visualizations to build recommenders. ",

Results on (1) sample generalization show that, in the case of ImageNet, nearly all the recent improvements reduced training error while overfitting stayed flat; with nearly all the training error eliminated, future progress will require a focus on reducing overfitting. Perspectives from statistics highlight how (2) distribution generalization can be viewed alternately as a change in sample weights or a change in the input-output relationship. Transfer learning approaches to (3) domain generalization are summarized, as are recent advances and the wealth of domain adaptation benchmark datasets available. Recent breakthroughs surveyed in (4) task generalization include few-shot meta-learning approaches and the BERT NLP engine, and recent (5) modality generalization studies are discussed that integrate image and text data and that apply a biologically-inspired network across olfactory, visual, and auditory modalities. Recent (6) scope generalization results are reviewed that embed knowledge graphs into deep NLP approaches. Additionally, concepts from neuroscience are discussed on the modular architecture of brains and the steps by which dopamine-driven conditioning leads to abstract thinking. ",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformer and its variants have demonstrated great potential in various computer vision tasks. But conventional vision transformers often focus on global dependency at a coarse level, which suffer from a learning challenge on global relationships and fine-grained representation at a token level. In this paper, we introduce Multi-scale Attention Fusion into transformer (MAFormer), which explores local aggregation and global feature extraction in a dual-stream framework for visual recognition. We develop a simple but effective module to explore the full potential of transformers for visual representation by learning fine-grained and coarse-grained features at a token level and dynamically fusing them. Our Multi-scale Attention Fusion (MAF) block consists of: i) a local window attention branch that learns short-range interactions within windows, aggregating fine-grained local features; ii) global feature extraction through a novel Global Learning with Down-sampling (GLD) operation to efficiently capture long-range context information within the whole image; iii) a fusion module that self-explores the integration of both features via attention. Our MAFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on common vision tasks. In particular, MAFormer-L achieves 85.9$\\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing CSWin-B and LV-ViT-L by 1.7$\\%$ and 0.6$\\%$ respectively. On MSCOCO, MAFormer outperforms the prior art CSWin by 1.7$\\%$ mAPs on object detection and 1.4$\\%$ on instance segmentation with similar-sized parameters, demonstrating the potential to be a general backbone network.

It is necessary to train a model only on source domain (SD) and directly transferring the model to target domain (TD), when TD needs to be processed in real time and cannot be reused for training. Based on the idea of domain generalization, a Single-source Domain Expansion Network (SDEnet) is developed to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of domain extension. The method uses generative adversarial learning to train in SD and test in TD. A generator including semantic encoder and morph encoder is designed to generate the extended domain (ED) based on encoder-randomization-decoder architecture, where spatial and spectral randomization are specifically used to generate variable spatial and spectral information, and the morphological knowledge is implicitly applied as domain invariant information during domain expansion. Furthermore, the supervised contrastive learning is employed in the discriminator to learn class-wise domain invariant representation, which drives intra-class samples of SD and ED. Meanwhile, adversarial training is designed to optimize the generator to drive intra-class samples of SD and ED to be separated. Extensive experiments on two public HSI datasets and one additional multispectral image (MSI) dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method when compared with state-of-the-art techniques.

We observe the state-of-the-art frameworks follow a compute-and-share principle for every function output where the summing in linear functions, which is the last of two steps for function output, involves all rotations (which is the most expensive HE operation), and the multiplexing in nonlinear functions, which is also the last of two steps for function output, introduces noticeable communication rounds. Therefore, we challenge the conventional compute-and-share logic and introduce the first joint linear and nonlinear computation across functions that features by 1) the PHE triplet for computing the nonlinear function, with which the multiplexing is eliminated; 2) the matrix encoding to calculate the linear function, with which all rotations for summing is removed; and 3) the network adaptation to reassemble the model structure, with which the joint computation module is utilized as much as possible. The boosted efficiency is verified by the numerical complexity, and the experiments demonstrate up to 13x speedup for various functions used in the state-of-the-art models and up to 5x speedup over mainstream neural networks.

    "abstract": "Fraud detection is a challenging task due to the changing nature of fraud patterns over time and the limited availability of fraud examples to learn such sophisticated patterns. Thus, fraud detection with the aid of smart versions of machine learning (ML) tools is essential to assure safety. Fraud detection is a primary ML classification task; however, the optimum performance of the corresponding ML tool relies on the usage of the best hyperparameter values. Moreover, classification under imbalanced classes is quite challenging as it causes poor performance in minority classes, which most ML classification techniques ignore. Thus, we investigate four state-of-the-art ML techniques, namely, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and extreme gradient boost, that are suitable for handling imbalance classes to maximize precision and simultaneously reduce false positives. First, these classifiers are trained on two original benchmark unbalanced fraud detection datasets, namely, phishing website URLs and fraudulent credit card transactions. Then, three synthetically balanced datasets are produced for each original data set by implementing the sampling frameworks, namely, RandomUnderSampler, SMOTE, and SMOTEENN. The optimum hyperparameters for all the 16 experiments are revealed using the method RandomzedSearchCV. The validity of the 16 approaches in the context of fraud detection is compared using two benchmark performance metrics, namely, area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics (AUC ROC) and area under the curve of precision and recall (AUC PR). For both phishing website URLs and credit card fraud transaction datasets, the results indicate that extreme gradient boost trained on the original data shows trustworthy performance in the imbalanced dataset and manages to outperform the other three methods in terms of both AUC ROC and AUC PR.

In this work, we highlight how the structural bias of social networks impacts the fairness of different SNA methods. We further discuss fairness aspects that should be considered while proposing network structure-based solutions for different SNA problems, such as link prediction, influence maximization, centrality ranking, and community detection. This paper clearly highlights that very few works have considered fairness and bias while proposing solutions; even these works are mainly focused on some research topics, such as link prediction, influence maximization, and PageRank. However, fairness has not yet been addressed for other research topics, such as influence blocking and community detection. We review state-of-the-art for different research topics in SNA, including the considered fairness constraints, their limitations, and our vision. This paper also covers evaluation metrics, available datasets, and synthetic network generating models used in such studies. Finally, we highlight various open research directions that require researchers' attention to bridge the gap between fairness and SNA. ",

In this paper, we investigate privacy threats (re-identification and attribute inference attacks) against LDP protocols for multidimensional data following two state-of-the-art solutions for frequency estimation of multiple attributes. To broaden the scope of our study, we have also experimentally assessed five widely used LDP protocols, namely, generalized randomized response, optimal local hashing, subset selection, RAPPOR and optimal unary encoding.

Measurements from these sensors and meters can be used for many applications, including distribution system state estimation (DSSE). However, these measurements are typically sampled at different rates and could be intermittent due to losses during the aggregation process. These multi time-scale measurements should be reconciled in real-time to perform accurate grid monitoring. This paper tackles this problem by formulating a recursive multi-task Gaussian process (RGP-G) approach that sequentially aggregates sensor measurements. Specifically, we formulate a recursive multi-task GP with and without network connectivity information to reconcile the multi time-scale measurements in distribution systems. The proposed framework is capable of aggregating the multi-time scale measurements batch-wise or in real-time. Following the aggregation of the multi time-scale measurements, the spatial states of the consistent time-series are estimated using matrix completion based DSSE approach. Simulation results on IEEE 37 and IEEE 123 bus test systems illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods from the standpoint of both multi time-scale data aggregation and DSSE. ",

    "abstract": "Trojan backdoor is a poisoning attack against Neural Network (NN) classifiers in which adversaries try to exploit the (highly desirable) model reuse property to implant Trojans into model parameters for backdoor breaches through a poisoned training process. Most of the proposed defenses against Trojan attacks assume a white-box setup, in which the defender either has access to the inner state of NN or is able to run back-propagation through it. In this work, we propose a more practical black-box defense, dubbed TrojDef, which can only run forward-pass of the NN. TrojDef tries to identify and filter out Trojan inputs (i.e., inputs augmented with the Trojan trigger) by monitoring the changes in the prediction confidence when the input is repeatedly perturbed by random noise. We derive a function based on the prediction outputs which is called the prediction confidence bound to decide whether the input example is Trojan or not. The intuition is that Trojan inputs are more stable as the misclassification only depends on the trigger, while benign inputs will suffer when augmented with noise due to the perturbation of the classification features. Through mathematical analysis, we show that if the attacker is perfect in injecting the backdoor, the Trojan infected model will be trained to learn the appropriate prediction confidence bound, which is used to distinguish Trojan and benign inputs under arbitrary perturbations. However, because the attacker might not be perfect in injecting the backdoor, we introduce a nonlinear transform to the prediction confidence bound to improve the detection accuracy in practical settings. Extensive empirical evaluations show that TrojDef significantly outperforms the-state-of-the-art defenses and is highly stable under different settings, even when the classifier architecture, the training process, or the hyper-parameters change.

In this work, we design an effective way to distinguish standard/non-standard shapes with the help of intra-class shape prototypical representation, which can be calculated by the proposed supervised shape clustering pretext task, resulting in a heterogeneous component w.r.t completion network. The representative prototype, defined as feature centroid of shape categories, can provide global shape guidance, which is referred to as soft-perceptual prior, to inject into downstream completion network by the desired selective perceptual feature fusion module in a multi-scale manner. Moreover, for effective training, we consider difficulty-based sampling strategy to encourage the network to pay more attention to some partial point clouds with fewer geometric information.

    "abstract": "Traceability approves trace links among software artifacts based on whether two artifacts are related by system functionalities. The traces are valuable for software development, but are difficult to obtain manually. To cope with the costly and fallible manual recovery, automated approaches are proposed to recover traces through textual similarities among software artifacts, such as those based on Information Retrieval (IR). However, the low quality & quantity of artifact texts negatively impact the calculated IR values, thus greatly hindering the performance of IR-based approaches. In this study, we propose to extract co-occurred word pairs from the text structures of both requirements and code (i.e., consensual biterms) to improve IR-based traceability recovery. We first collect a set of biterms based on the part-of-speech of requirement texts, and then filter them through the code texts. We then use these consensual biterms to both enrich the input corpus for IR techniques and enhance the calculations of IR values. A nine-system-based evaluation shows that in general, when solely used to enhance IR techniques, our approach can outperform pure IR-based approaches and another baseline by 21.9% & 21.8% in AP, and 9.3% & 7.2% in MAP, respectively. Moreover, when used to collaborate with another enhancing strategy from different perspectives, it can outperform this baseline by 5.9% in AP and 4.8% in MAP. ",

    "abstract": "Effectively preserving and encoding structure features from objects in irregular and sparse LiDAR points is a key challenge to 3D object detection on point cloud. Recently, Transformer has demonstrated promising performance on many 2D and even 3D vision tasks. Compared with the fixed and rigid convolution kernels, the self-attention mechanism in Transformer can adaptively exclude the unrelated or noisy points and thus suitable for preserving the local spatial structure in irregular LiDAR point cloud. However, Transformer only performs a simple sum on the point features, based on the self-attention mechanism, and all the points share the same transformation for value. Such isotropic operation lacks the ability to capture the direction-distance-oriented local structure which is important for 3D object detection. In this work, we propose a Structure-Embedding transFormer (SEFormer), which can not only preserve local structure as traditional Transformer but also have the ability to encode the local structure. Compared to the self-attention mechanism in traditional Transformer, SEFormer learns different feature transformations for value points based on the relative directions and distances to the query point. Then we propose a SEFormer based network for high-performance 3D object detection. Extensive experiments show that the proposed architecture can achieve SOTA results on Waymo Open Dataset, the largest 3D detection benchmark for autonomous driving. Specifically, SEFormer achieves 79.02% mAP, which is 1.2% higher than existing works. We will release the codes. ",

    "abstract": "How will you repair a physical object with large missings? You may first recover its global yet coarse shape and stepwise increase its local details. We are motivated to imitate the above physical repair procedure to address the point cloud completion task. We propose a novel stepwise point cloud completion network (SPCNet) for various 3D models with large missings. SPCNet has a hierarchical bottom-to-up network architecture. It fulfills shape completion in an iterative manner, which 1) first infers the global feature of the coarse result; 2) then infers the local feature with the aid of global feature; and 3) finally infers the detailed result with the help of local feature and coarse result. Beyond the wisdom of simulating the physical repair, we newly design a cycle loss %based training strategy to enhance the generalization and robustness of SPCNet. Extensive experiments clearly show the superiority of our SPCNet over the state-of-the-art methods on 3D point clouds with large missings. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, federated learning (FL) has received intensive research because of its ability in preserving data privacy for scattered clients to collaboratively train machine learning models. Commonly, a parameter server (PS) is deployed for aggregating model parameters contributed by different clients. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is upgraded from FL which allows clients to aggregate model parameters with their neighbours directly. DFL is particularly feasible for vehicular networks as vehicles communicate with each other in a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) manner. However, due to the restrictions of vehicle routes and communication distances, it is hard for individual vehicles to sufficiently exchange models with others. Data sources contributing to models on individual vehicles may not diversified enough resulting in poor model accuracy. To address this problem, we propose the DFL-DDS (DFL with diversified Data Sources) algorithm to diversify data sources in DFL. Specifically, each vehicle maintains a state vector to record the contribution weight of each data source to its model. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is adopted to measure the diversity of a state vector. To boost the convergence of DFL, a vehicle tunes the aggregation weight of each data source by minimizing the KL divergence of its state vector, and its effectiveness in diversifying data sources can be theoretically proved. Finally, the superiority of DFL-DDS is evaluated by extensive experiments (with MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets) which demonstrate that DFL-DDS can accelerate the convergence of DFL and improve the model accuracy significantly compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "While generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been widely used in research on audio generation, the training of a GAN model is known to be unstable, time consuming, and data inefficient. Among the attempts to ameliorate the training process of GANs, the idea of Projected GAN emerges as an effective solution for GAN-based image generation, establishing the state-of-the-art in different image applications. The core idea is to use a pre-trained classifier to constrain the feature space of the discriminator to stabilize and improve GAN training. This paper investigates whether Projected GAN can similarly improve audio generation, by evaluating the performance of a StyleGAN2-based audio-domain loop generation model with and without using a pre-trained feature space in the discriminator. Moreover, we compare the performance of using a general versus domain-specific classifier as the pre-trained audio classifier. With experiments on both drum loop and synth loop generation, we show that a general audio classifier works better, and that with Projected GAN our loop generation models can converge around 5 times faster without performance degradation.

    "abstract": "While Transformers have had significant success in paragraph generation, they treat sentences as linear sequences of tokens and often neglect their hierarchical information. Prior work has shown that decomposing the levels of granularity~(e.g., word, phrase, or sentence) for input tokens has produced substantial improvements, suggesting the possibility of enhancing Transformers via more fine-grained modeling of granularity. In this work, we propose a continuous decomposition of granularity for neural paraphrase generation (C-DNPG). In order to efficiently incorporate granularity into sentence encoding, C-DNPG introduces a granularity-aware attention (GA-Attention) mechanism which extends the multi-head self-attention with: 1) a granularity head that automatically infers the hierarchical structure of a sentence by neurally estimating the granularity level of each input token; and 2) two novel attention masks, namely, granularity resonance and granularity scope, to efficiently encode granularity into attention. Experiments on two benchmarks, including Quora question pairs and Twitter URLs have shown that C-DNPG outperforms baseline models by a remarkable margin and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of many metrics. Qualitative analysis reveals that C-DNPG indeed captures fine-grained levels of granularity with effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "Understanding the decision process of neural networks is hard. One vital method for explanation is to attribute its decision to pivotal features. Although many algorithms are proposed, most of them solely improve the faithfulness to the model. However, the real environment contains many random noises, which may leads to great fluctuations in the explanations. More seriously, recent works show that explanation algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. All of these make the explanation hard to trust in real scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a model-agnostic method \\emph{Median Test for Feature Attribution} (MeTFA) to quantify the uncertainty and increase the stability of explanation algorithms with theoretical guarantees. MeTFA has the following two functions: (1) examine whether one feature is significantly important or unimportant and generate a MeTFA-significant map to visualize the results; (2) compute the confidence interval of a feature attribution score and generate a MeTFA-smoothed map to increase the stability of the explanation. Experiments show that MeTFA improves the visual quality of explanations and significantly reduces the instability while maintaining the faithfulness. To quantitatively evaluate the faithfulness of an explanation under different noise settings, we further propose several robust faithfulness metrics. Experiment results show that the MeTFA-smoothed explanation can significantly increase the robust faithfulness. In addition, we use two scenarios to show MeTFA's potential in the applications. First, when applied to the SOTA explanation method to locate context bias for semantic segmentation models, MeTFA-significant explanations use far smaller regions to maintain 99\\%+ faithfulness. Second, when tested with different explanation-oriented attacks, MeTFA can help defend vanilla, as well as adaptive, adversarial attacks against explanations. ",

The previous methods are devoted to improving the network's performance by increasing the network's depth and width. The current methods focus on increasing the convolutional kernel size to enhance its performance by benefiting from the larger receptive field. However, directly increasing the size of the convolutional kernel introduces a massive amount of computational overhead and parameters. Thus, a novel Large Kernel Convolution Dehaze Block (LKD Block) consisting of the Decomposition deep-wise Large Kernel Convolution Block (DLKCB) and the Channel Enhanced Feed-forward Network (CEFN) is devised in this paper. The designed DLKCB can split the deep-wise large kernel convolution into a smaller depth-wise convolution and a depth-wise dilated convolution without introducing massive parameters and computational overhead. Meanwhile, the designed CEFN incorporates a channel attention mechanism into Feed-forward Network to exploit significant channels and enhance robustness. By combining multiple LKD Blocks and Up-Down sampling modules, the Large Kernel Convolution Dehaze Network (LKD-Net) is conducted. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed DLKCB and CEFN, and our LKD-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art. On the SOTS indoor dataset, our LKD-Net dramatically outperforms the Transformer-based method Dehamer with only 1.79% #Param and 48.9% FLOPs.

Prior work has demonstrated the benefits of effective architecture design and integration of relevant cues for more accurate HOI detection.

To address this gap, we propose Relational Language-Image Pre-training (RLIP), a strategy for contrastive pre-training that leverages both entity and relation descriptions. To make effective use of such pre-training, we make three technical contributions: (1) a new Parallel entity detection and Sequential relation inference (ParSe) architecture that enables the use of both entity and relation descriptions during holistically optimized pre-training; (2) a synthetic data generation framework, Label Sequence Extension, that expands the scale of language data available within each minibatch; (3) mechanisms to account for ambiguity, Relation Quality Labels and Relation Pseudo-Labels, to mitigate the influence of ambiguous/noisy samples in the pre-training data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of these contributions, collectively termed RLIP-ParSe, for improved zero-shot, few-shot and fine-tuning HOI detection performance as well as increased robustness to learning from noisy annotations.

In these tasks, participating systems are expected to generate complex answers to biomedical questions, where the answers may contain more than one sentence. We apply query-focused extractive summarisation techniques. In particular, we follow a sentence classification-based approach that scores each candidate sentence associated to a question, and the $n$ highest-scoring sentences are returned as the answer. The Synergy Task corresponds to an end-to-end system that requires document selection, snippet selection, and finding the final answer, but it has very limited training data. For the Synergy task, we selected the candidate sentences following two phases: document retrieval and snippet retrieval, and the final answer was found by using a DistilBERT/ALBERT classifier that had been trained on the training data of BioASQ9b. Document retrieval was achieved as a standard search over the CORD-19 data using the search API provided by the BioASQ organisers, and snippet retrieval was achieved by re-ranking the sentences of the top retrieved documents, using the cosine similarity of the question and candidate sentence. We observed that vectors represented via sBERT have an edge over tf.idf. BioASQ10b Phase B focuses on finding the specific answers to biomedical questions. For this task, we followed a data-centric approach. We hypothesised that the training data of the first BioASQ years might be biased and we experimented with different subsets of the training data. We observed an improvement of results when the system was trained on the second half of the BioASQ10b training data. ",

In this paper, we propose Anomaly Detection TRansformer (ADTR) to apply a transformer to reconstruct pre-trained features. The pre-trained features contain distinguishable semantic information. Also, the adoption of transformer limits to reconstruct anomalies well such that anomalies could be detected easily once the reconstruction fails. Moreover, we propose novel loss functions to make our approach compatible with the normal-sample-only case and the anomaly-available case with both image-level and pixel-level labeled anomalies. The performance could be further improved by adding simple synthetic or external irrelevant anomalies.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method to analyze the convergence and stability in the training of Generative Adversarial Networks. For this purpose, we propose to decompose the objective function of the adversary min-max game defining a periodic GAN into its Fourier series. By studying the dynamics of the truncated Fourier series for the continuous Alternating Gradient Descend algorithm, we are able to approximate the real flow and to identify the main features of the convergence of the GAN. This approach is confirmed empirically by studying the training flow in a $2$-parametric GAN aiming to generate an unknown exponential distribution. As byproduct, we show that convergent orbits in GANs are small perturbations of periodic orbits so the Nash equillibria are spiral attractors. This theoretically justifies the slow and unstable training observed in GANs. ",

    "abstract": "Robust learning is an important issue in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). There are several works in the literature addressing this topic. However, there is an increasing demand for methods that can simultaneously consider all the different uncertainty components involved in SciML model identification. Hence, this work proposes a comprehensive methodology for uncertainty evaluation of the SciML that also considers several possible sources of uncertainties involved in the identification process. The uncertainties considered in the proposed method are the absence of theory and causal models, the sensitiveness to data corruption or imperfection, and the computational effort. Therefore, it was possible to provide an overall strategy for the uncertainty-aware models in the SciML field. The methodology is validated through a case study, developing a Soft Sensor for a polymerization reactor. The results demonstrated that the identified Soft Sensor are robust for uncertainties, corroborating with the consistency of the proposed approach. ",

Tasks are formalized as decision problems on properties of input graphs, i.e., the task is defined as a subset $\\mathcal{T}$ of all possible input graphs, and the agent must decide if the network belongs to $\\mathcal{T}$ or not. We focus on the class of the decision problems which are solvable in a polynomial number of movements, and polynomial-time local computation. The contribution of this paper is the computational power of the very weak system with one-bit agent memory and $O(1)$-bit storage (i.e. node memory) is equivalent to the one with $O(n)$-bit agent memory and $O(1)$-bit storage. We also show that the one-bit agent memory is crucial to lead this equivalence: There exists a decision task which can be solved by the one-bit memory agent but cannot be solved by the zero-bit memory (i.e., oblivious) agent. Our result is deduced by the algorithm of simulating the $O(n)$-bit memory agent by the one-bit memory agent with polynomial-time overhead, which is developed by two novel technical tools. The first one is a dynamic $s$-$t$ path maintenance mechanism which uses only $O(1)$-bit storage per node. The second one is a new lexicographically-ordered DFS algorithm for the mobile agent system with $O(1)$-bit memory and $O(1)$-bit storage per node. These tools are of independent interest. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, attention-based scene text recognition methods have been very popular and attracted the interest of many researchers. Attention-based methods can adaptively focus attention on a small area or even single point during decoding, in which the attention matrix is nearly one-hot distribution. Furthermore, the whole feature maps will be weighted and summed by all attention matrices during inference, causing huge redundant computations. In this paper, we propose an efficient attention-free Single-Point Decoding Network (dubbed SPDN) for scene text recognition, which can replace the traditional attention-based decoding network. Specifically, we propose Single-Point Sampling Module (SPSM) to efficiently sample one key point on the feature map for decoding one character. In this way, our method can not only precisely locate the key point of each character but also remove redundant computations. Based on SPSM, we design an efficient and novel single-point decoding network to replace the attention-based decoding network. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks verify that our SPDN can greatly improve decoding efficiency without sacrificing performance. ",

    "abstract": "Recapture detection of face and document images is an important forensic task. With deep learning, the performances of face anti-spoofing (FAS) and recaptured document detection have been improved significantly. However, the performances are not yet satisfactory on samples with weak forensic cues. The amount of forensic cues can be quantified to allow a reliable forensic result. In this work, we propose a forensicability assessment network to quantify the forensicability of the questioned samples. The low-forensicability samples are rejected before the actual recapturing detection process to improve the efficiency of recapturing detection systems. We first extract forensicability features related to both image quality assessment and forensic tasks. By exploiting domain knowledge of the forensic application in image quality and forensic features, we define three task-specific forensicability classes and the initialized locations in the feature space. Based on the extracted features and the defined centers, we train the proposed forensic assessment network (FANet) with cross-entropy loss and update the centers with a momentum-based update method. We integrate the trained FANet with practical recapturing detection schemes in face anti-spoofing and recaptured document detection tasks. Experimental results show that, for a generic CNN-based FAS scheme, FANet reduces the EERs from 33.75% to 19.23% under ROSE to IDIAP protocol by rejecting samples with the lowest 30% forensicability scores. The performance of FAS schemes is poor in the rejected samples, with EER as high as 56.48%. Similar performances in rejecting low-forensicability samples have been observed for the state-of-the-art approaches in FAS and recaptured document detection tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that assesses the forensicability of recaptured document images and improves the system efficiency. ",

In this paper we present our results of comparing PageRank and the more recent BiRank to infer risk-ranks based on network structure and prior fraud information. Specifically, we model our social network from company register data. We find that in this case study BiRank outperforms PageRank in both quality of the resulting ranks for fraud prediction and run time. The results show that this class of algorithms is generally useful for fraud and risk prediction and more specifically also illustrate the potential of BiRank in comparison, as it opens up new modeling opportunities. Our results show that selecting companies for tax audits based on BiRank yields a precision of 16.38% for the top 20.000 subjects selecting 83.4% of all fraud cases (recall). ",

    "abstract": "Estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) from observational data is challenging due to selection bias. Existing works mainly tackle this challenge in two ways. Some researchers propose constructing a score function that satisfies the orthogonal condition, which guarantees that the established ATE estimator is \"orthogonal\" to be more robust. The others explore representation learning models to achieve a balanced representation between the treated and the controlled groups. However, existing studies fail to 1) discriminate treated units from controlled ones in the representation space to avoid the over-balanced issue; 2) fully utilize the \"orthogonality information\". In this paper, we propose a moderately-balanced representation learning (MBRL) framework based on recent covariates balanced representation learning methods and orthogonal machine learning theory. This framework protects the representation from being over-balanced via multi-task learning. Simultaneously, MBRL incorporates the noise orthogonality information in the training and validation stages to achieve a better ATE estimation. The comprehensive experiments on benchmark and simulated datasets show the superiority and robustness of our method on treatment effect estimations compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. ",

These local problems are posed on some domains slightly larger than the subdomains with oversampling size $\\delta^{\\ast}$. The method is formulated at the continuous level as a direct discretization of the continuous problem and at the discrete level as a coarse-space approximation for its standard FE discretizations. Exponential decay rates for local approximation errors with respect to $\\delta^{\\ast}/\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta^{\\ast}/h$ (at the discrete level with $h$ denoting the fine FE mesh size) and with the local degrees of freedom are established. In particular, it is shown that the method at the continuous level converges uniformly with respect to $\\varepsilon$ in the standard $H^{1}$ norm, and that if the oversampling size is relatively large with respect to $\\varepsilon$ and $h$ (at the discrete level), the solutions of the local reaction-diffusion equations provide good local approximations for the solution and thus the local eigenfunctions are not needed.

However, the spatial correlation between sensors is not specified as one but defined differently from various viewpoints. To this end, we aim to study the heterogeneous characteristics inherent in traffic signal data to learn the hidden relationships between sensors in various ways. Specifically, we designed a method to construct a heterogeneous graph for each module by dividing the spatial relationship between sensors into static and dynamic modules. We propose a network decentralization attention based heterogeneity-aware graph convolution network (HAGCN) method that aggregates the hidden states of adjacent nodes by considering the importance of each channel in a heterogeneous graph.

Moreover, the current coarse-grained analysis models make it difficult to locate system-level root causes of the application performance anomalies for effective adaptation decisions. We provide a FIne-grained Robust pErformance Diagnosis (FIRED) framework to tackle those challenges. The framework offers an ensemble of several well-selected base models for anomaly detection using a deep neural network, which adopts weakly-supervised learning considering fewer labels exist in reality. The framework also employs a real-time fine-grained analysis model to locate dependent system metrics of the anomaly. Our experiments show that the framework can achieve the best detection accuracy and algorithm robustness, and it can predict anomalies in four minutes with F1 score higher than 0.8. In addition, the framework can accurately localize the first root causes, and with an average accuracy higher than 0.7 of locating first four root causes. ",

We recreate and release a benchmark dataset in the few-shot incremental event detection task based on FewEvent.The dataset we published is more appropriate than other in this new task.

However, the CNN is a typical black-box model, and the mechanism of CNN's decision-making are not clear, which limits its application in high-reliability-required fault diagnosis scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel interpretable neural network termed as Time-Frequency Network (TFN), where the physically meaningful time-frequency transform (TFT) method is embedded into the traditional convolutional layer as an adaptive preprocessing layer. This preprocessing layer named as time-frequency convolutional (TFconv) layer, is constrained by a well-designed kernel function to extract fault-related time-frequency information. It not only improves the diagnostic performance but also reveals the logical foundation of the CNN prediction in the frequency domain. Different TFT methods correspond to different kernel functions of the TFconv layer. In this study, four typical TFT methods are considered to formulate the TFNs and their effectiveness and interpretability are proved through three mechanical fault diagnosis experiments. Experimental results also show that the proposed TFconv layer can be easily generalized to other CNNs with different depths. The code of TFN is available on https://github.com/ChenQian0618/TFN. ",

They can use Visual Odometry (VO) to estimate self-motion and localize themselves using visual sensors. This motion-estimation strategy is not compromised by drift as inertial sensors or slippage as wheel encoders. However, VO with conventional cameras is computationally demanding, limiting its application in systems with strict low-latency, -memory, and -energy requirements. Using event-based cameras and neuromorphic computing hardware offers a promising low-power solution to the VO problem. However, conventional algorithms for VO are not readily convertible to neuromorphic hardware. In this work, we present a VO algorithm built entirely of neuronal building blocks suitable for neuromorphic implementation. The building blocks are groups of neurons representing vectors in the computational framework of Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) which was proposed as an abstraction layer to program neuromorphic hardware. The VO network we propose generates and stores a working memory of the presented visual environment. It updates this working memory while at the same time estimating the changing location and orientation of the camera. We demonstrate how VSA can be leveraged as a computing paradigm for neuromorphic robotics. Moreover, our results represent an important step towards using neuromorphic computing hardware for fast and power-efficient VO and the related task of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).

Therefore, the explainability of the classifications is crucial. Besides increasing trust, the explanation can be used for model evaluation gaining new insights from the data and improving the model. In this paper, we present a visual interactive tool that combines the classification of network data with an explanation technique to form an interface between experts, algorithms, and data. ",

    "abstract": "Recent year has brought considerable advancements in Electric Vehicles (EVs) and associated infrastructures/communications. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are widely deployed for anomaly detection in such critical infrastructures. This paper presents an Interpretable Anomaly Detection System (RX-ADS) for intrusion detection in CAN protocol communication in EVs. Contributions include: 1) window based feature extraction method; 2) deep Autoencoder based anomaly detection method; and 3) adversarial machine learning based explanation generation methodology. The presented approach was tested on two benchmark CAN datasets: OTIDS and Car Hacking. The anomaly detection performance of RX-ADS was compared against the state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets: HIDS and GIDS. The RX-ADS approach presented performance comparable to the HIDS approach (OTIDS dataset) and has outperformed HIDS and GIDS approaches (Car Hacking dataset). Further, the proposed approach was able to generate explanations for detected abnormal behaviors arising from various intrusions. These explanations were later validated by information used by domain experts to detect anomalies. Other advantages of RX-ADS include: 1) the method can be trained on unlabeled data; 2) explanations help experts in understanding anomalies and root course analysis, and also help with AI model debugging and diagnostics, ultimately improving user trust in AI systems.

    "abstract": "Several engineering applications involve complex materials with significant and discontinuous variations in thermophysical properties. These include materials for thermal storage, biological tissues with blood capillaries, etc. For such applications, numerical simulations must exercise care in not smearing the interfaces by interpolating variables across the interfaces of the subdomains. In this paper, we describe a high accuracy meshless method that uses domain decomposition and cloud-based interpolation of scattered data to solve the heat conduction equation in such situations. The polyharmonic spline (PHS) function with appended polynomial of prescribed degree is used for discretization. A flux balance condition is satisfied at the interface points and the clouds of interpolation points are restricted to be within respective domains. Compared with previously proposed meshless algorithms with domain decomposition, the cloud-based interpolations are numerically better conditioned, and achieve high accuracy through the appended polynomial. The accuracy of the algorithm is demonstrated in several two and three dimensional problems using manufactured solutions to the heat conduction equation with sharp discontinuity in thermal conductivity. Subsequently, we demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm to solve heat conduction in complex domains with practical boundary conditions and internal heat generation. Systematic computations with varying conductivity ratios, interpoint spacing and degree of appended polynomial are performed to investigate the accuracy of the algorithm. ",

Anticipating the intention of surrounding vehicles, estimating their future states and integrating them into the decision-making process of an automated vehicle can enhance the reliability of autonomous driving in complex driving scenarios. This paper proposes a Prediction-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (PDRL) decision-making model that considers the manoeuvre intentions of surrounding vehicles in the decision-making process for highway driving.

This is mainly due to the strong ability of such networks in mining discriminative object pose and parts information from texture and shape. This is often inappropriate for fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) since it exhibits high intra-class and low inter-class variances due to occlusions, deformation, illuminations, etc. Thus, an expressive feature representation describing global structural information is a key to characterize an object/ scene. To this end, we propose a method that effectively captures subtle changes by aggregating context-aware features from most relevant image-regions and their importance in discriminating fine-grained categories avoiding the bounding-box and/or distinguishable part annotations. Our approach is inspired by the recent advancement in self-attention and graph neural networks (GNNs) approaches to include a simple yet effective relation-aware feature transformation and its refinement using a context-aware attention mechanism to boost the discriminability of the transformed feature in an end-to-end learning process. Our model is evaluated on eight benchmark datasets consisting of fine-grained objects and human-object interactions.

Such attacks can result in erroneous outputs, model-generated hate speech, and the exposure of users' sensitive information. While existing research has focused on adversarial attacks during either the training or the fine-tuning of PLMs, there is a deficit of information on attacks made between these two development phases. In this work, we highlight a major security vulnerability in the public release of GPT-3 and further investigate this vulnerability in other state-of-the-art PLMs. We restrict our work to pre-trained models that have not undergone fine-tuning. Further, we underscore token distance-minimized perturbations as an effective adversarial approach, bypassing both supervised and unsupervised quality measures. Following this approach, we observe a significant decrease in text classification quality when evaluating for semantic similarity. ",

In multiagent settings, adversarial policies can be developed by training an adversarial agent to minimize a victim agent's rewards. Prior work has studied black-box attacks where the adversary only sees the state observations and effectively treats the victim as any other part of the environment. In this work, we experiment with white-box adversarial policies to study whether an agent's internal state can offer useful information for other agents. We make three contributions. First, we introduce white-box adversarial policies in which an attacker can observe a victim's internal state at each timestep. Second, we demonstrate that white-box access to a victim makes for better attacks in two-agent environments, resulting in both faster initial learning and higher asymptotic performance against the victim. Third, we show that training against white-box adversarial policies can be used to make learners in single-agent environments more robust to domain shifts. ",

Recent social-economic studies suggest that nearly 50\\% of occupations are at high risk of being automated in the next decade. However, the lack of granular data and empirically informed models have limited the accuracy of these studies and made it challenging to predict which jobs will be automated. In this paper, we study the automation risk of occupations by performing a classification task between automated and non-automated occupations. The available information is 910 occupations' task statements, skills and interactions categorised by Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). To fully utilize this information, we propose a graph-based semi-supervised classification method named \\textbf{A}utomated \\textbf{O}ccupation \\textbf{C}lassification based on \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{C}onvolutional \\textbf{N}etworks (\\textbf{AOC-GCN}) to identify the automated risk for occupations.

In this paper, an AOOD method called task-wise sampling convolutions (TS-Conv) is proposed. TS-Conv adaptively samples task-wise features from respective sensitive regions and maps these features together in alignment to guide a dynamic label assignment for better predictions. Specifically, sampling positions of the localization convolution in TS-Conv is supervised by the oriented bounding box (OBB) prediction associated with spatial coordinates. While sampling positions and convolutional kernel of the classification convolution are designed to be adaptively adjusted according to different orientations for improving the orientation robustness of features. Furthermore, a dynamic task-aware label assignment (DTLA) strategy is developed to select optimal candidate positions and assign labels dynamicly according to ranked task-aware scores obtained from TS-Conv. Extensive experiments on several public datasets covering multiple scenes, multimodal images, and multiple categories of objects demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability and superior performance of the proposed TS-Conv.

Recently, deep learning (DL) based channel estimation is being explored as an efficient alternative to conventional least-square (LS) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) based channel estimation. Unlike LMMSE, DL methods do not need prior knowledge of channel statistics. Most of these approaches have not been realized on system-on-chip (SoC), and preliminary study shows that their complexity exceeds the complexity of the entire physical layer (PHY). The high latency of DL is another concern. This paper considers the design and implementation of deep neural network (DNN) augmented LS-based channel estimation (LSDNN) on Zynq multi-processor SoC (ZMPSoC). We demonstrate the gain in performance compared to the conventional LS and LMMSE channel estimation schemes. Via software-hardware co-design, word-length optimization, and reconfigurable architectures, we demonstrate the superiority of the LSDNN architecture over the LS and LMMSE for a wide range of SNR, number of pilots, preamble types, and wireless channels. Further, we evaluate the performance, power, and area (PPA) of the LS and LSDNN application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations in 45 nm technology.

Inspired by above works, we propose a statistically guided lightweight underwater image enhancement network (USLN). Concretely, we first develop a dual-statistic white balance module which can learn to use both average and maximum of images to compensate the color distortion for each specific pixel. Then this is followed by a multi-color space stretch module to adjust the histogram distribution in RGB, HSI, and Lab color spaces adaptively. Extensive experiments show that, with the guidance of statistics, USLN significantly reduces the required network capacity (over98%) and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Publishing graph statistics under node differential privacy has attracted much attention since it provides a stronger privacy guarantee than edge differential privacy. Existing works related to node differential privacy assume a trusted data curator who holds the whole graph. However, in many applications, a trusted curator is usually not available due to privacy and security issues. In this paper, for the first time, we investigate the problem of publishing the graph degree distribution under Node Local Differential privacy (Node-LDP), which does not rely on a trusted server. We propose an algorithm to publish the degree distribution with Node-LDP by exploring how to select the optimal graph projection parameter and how to execute the local graph projection. Specifically, we propose a Crypto-assisted local projection method that combines LDP and cryptographic primitives, achieving higher accuracy than our baseline PureLDP local projection method. On the other hand, we improve our baseline Node-level parameter selection by proposing an Edge-level parameter selection that preserves more neighboring information and provides better utility. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world graphs show that Edge-level local projection provides higher accuracy than Node-level local projection, and Crypto-assisted parameter selection owns the better utility than PureLDP parameter selection, improving by up to 79.8% and 57.2% respectively.

    "abstract": "In stockbreeding of beef cattle, computer vision-based approaches have been widely employed to monitor cattle conditions (e.g. the physical, physiology, and health). To this end, the accurate and effective recognition of cattle action is a prerequisite. Generally, most existing models are confined to individual behavior that uses video-based methods to extract spatial-temporal features for recognizing the individual actions of each cattle. However, there is sociality among cattle and their interaction usually reflects important conditions, e.g. estrus, and also video-based method neglects the real-time capability of the model. Based on this, we tackle the challenging task of real-time recognizing interactions between cattle in a single frame in this paper. The pipeline of our method includes two main modules: Cattle Localization Network and Interaction Recognition Network. At every moment, cattle localization network outputs high-quality interaction proposals from every detected cattle and feeds them into the interaction recognition network with a triple-stream architecture. Such a triple-stream network allows us to fuse different features relevant to recognizing interactions. Specifically, the three kinds of features are a visual feature that extracts the appearance representation of interaction proposals, a geometric feature that reflects the spatial relationship between cattle, and a semantic feature that captures our prior knowledge of the relationship between the individual action and interaction of cattle. In addition, to solve the problem of insufficient quantity of labeled data, we pre-train the model based on self-supervised learning. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation evidences the performance of our framework as an effective method to recognize cattle interaction in real time. ",

Existing methods usually aggregate features at one stroke to enhance the feature. These methods, however, usually lack spatial information from neighboring frames and suffer from insufficient feature aggregation. To address the issues, we perform a progressive way to introduce both temporal information and spatial information for an integrated enhancement. The temporal information is introduced by the temporal feature aggregation model (TFAM), by conducting an attention mechanism between the context frames and the target frame (i.e., the frame to be detected). Meanwhile, we employ a Spatial Transition Awareness Model (STAM) to convey the location transition information between each context frame and target frame. Built upon a transformer-based detector DETR, our PTSEFormer also follows an end-to-end fashion to avoid heavy post-processing procedures while achieving 88.1% mAP on the ImageNet VID dataset.

    "abstract": "Current methods for spatiotemporal action tube detection often extend a bounding box proposal at a given keyframe into a 3D temporal cuboid and pool features from nearby frames. However, such pooling fails to accumulate meaningful spatiotemporal features if the position or shape of the actor shows large 2D motion and variability through the frames, due to large camera motion, large actor shape deformation, fast actor action and so on. In this work, we aim to study the performance of cuboid-aware feature aggregation in action detection under large action. Further, we propose to enhance actor feature representation under large motion by tracking actors and performing temporal feature aggregation along the respective tracks. We define the actor motion with intersection-over-union (IoU) between the boxes of action tubes/tracks at various fixed time scales. The action having a large motion would result in lower IoU over time, and slower actions would maintain higher IoU. We find that track-aware feature aggregation consistently achieves a large improvement in action detection performance, especially for actions under large motion compared to the cuboid-aware baseline. As a result, we also report state-of-the-art on the large-scale MultiSports dataset. ",

To solve this problem, we propose a novel NLP data augmentation technique, Entity Aware Data Augmentation (EADA), which applies a tree structure, Entity Aware Syntax Tree (EAST), to represent sentences combined with attention on the entity. Our EADA technique automatically constructs an EAST from a small amount of annotated data, and then generates a large number of training instances for intent detection and slot filling. Experimental results on four datasets showed that the proposed technique significantly outperforms the existing data augmentation methods in terms of both accuracy and generalization ability. ",

The proposed mechanism completely decouples the data set used for training process from the actual data which is kept private. Moreover, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) schemes are used to prioritize failures meeting business requirements. Results show high accuracy in failure prediction under different parameter configurations. On a broader context, any classification problem, beyond failure prediction, can be performed using the proposed mechanism with artificially generated data set without looking into the actual data as long as the input features can be translated to binary values (e.g. output from private binary classifiers) and can provide classification-as-a-service.

In this paper, we examine the robustness of BERTScore, one of the most popular embedding-based metrics for text generation. We show that (a) an embedding-based metric that has the highest correlation with human evaluations on a standard benchmark can have the lowest correlation if the amount of input noise or unknown tokens increases, (b) taking embeddings from the first layer of pretrained models improves the robustness of all metrics, and (c) the highest robustness is achieved when using character-level embeddings, instead of token-based embeddings, from the first layer of the pretrained model.

    "abstract": "Object detection is the foundation of various critical computer-vision tasks such as segmentation, object tracking, and event detection. To train an object detector with satisfactory accuracy, a large amount of data is required. However, due to the intensive workforce involved with annotating large datasets, such a data curation task is often outsourced to a third party or relied on volunteers. This work reveals severe vulnerabilities of such data curation pipeline. We propose MACAB that crafts clean-annotated images to stealthily implant the backdoor into the object detectors trained on them even when the data curator can manually audit the images. We observe that the backdoor effect of both misclassification and the cloaking are robustly achieved in the wild when the backdoor is activated with inconspicuously natural physical triggers. Backdooring non-classification object detection with clean-annotation is challenging compared to backdooring existing image classification tasks with clean-label, owing to the complexity of having multiple objects within each frame, including victim and non-victim objects. The efficacy of the MACAB is ensured by constructively i abusing the image-scaling function used by the deep learning framework, ii incorporating the proposed adversarial clean image replica technique, and iii combining poison data selection criteria given constrained attacking budget. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MACAB exhibits more than 90% attack success rate under various real-world scenes. This includes both cloaking and misclassification backdoor effect even restricted with a small attack budget. The poisoned samples cannot be effectively identified by state-of-the-art detection techniques.The comprehensive video demo is at https://youtu.be/MA7L_LpXkp4, which is based on a poison rate of 0.14% for YOLOv4 cloaking backdoor and Faster R-CNN misclassification backdoor.

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive deep learning framework for detecting anomalies and changes in a priori unknown environments after a reference dataset is gathered, and without need for retraining the model. We use the SuperPoint and SuperGlue feature extraction and matching methods to detect anomalies based on reference images taken from a similar location and with partial overlapping of the field of view. We also introduce a self-calibrating method for the proposed model in order to address the problem of sensitivity to feature matching thresholds and environmental conditions. To evaluate the proposed framework, we have used a ground robot system for the purpose of reference and query data collection. We show that high accuracy can be obtained using the proposed method.

Recently, numerous objective functions regarding cognitive and computational aspects of natural languages are developed. Among which are the state-of-the-art methods of linearity, bilinearity, manifold-preserving kernels, projection-subspace, and analogical inference. However, the major challenge of such models lies in their loss functions that associate the dimension of relation embeddings to corresponding entity dimension.

Experimental results on benchmark Knowledge Graphs (KGs) such as FB15K and WN18 show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models in entity prediction task using linear and bilinear methods and other recent powerful ones.

Inspired by the MAE, we propose a spatial-temporal masked autoencoder framework for self-supervised 3D skeleton-based action recognition (SkeletonMAE). Following MAE's masking and reconstruction pipeline, we utilize a skeleton based encoder-decoder transformer architecture to reconstruct the masked skeleton sequences. A novel masking strategy, named Spatial-Temporal Masking, is introduced in terms of both joint-level and frame-level for the skeleton sequence. This pre-training strategy makes the encoder output generalizable skeleton features with spatial and temporal dependencies. Given the unmasked skeleton sequence, the encoder is fine-tuned for the action recognition task.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved impressive results in many image classification tasks. However, since their performance is usually measured in controlled settings, it is important to ensure that their decisions remain correct when deployed in noisy environments. In fact, deep networks are not robust to a large variety of semantic-preserving image modifications, even to imperceptible image changes known as adversarial perturbations. The poor robustness of image classifiers to small data distribution shifts raises serious concerns regarding their trustworthiness. To build reliable machine learning models, we must design principled methods to analyze and understand the mechanisms that shape robustness and invariance. This is exactly the focus of this thesis. First, we study the problem of computing sparse adversarial perturbations. We exploit the geometry of the decision boundaries of image classifiers for computing sparse perturbations very fast, and reveal a qualitative connection between adversarial examples and the data features that image classifiers learn. Then, to better understand this connection, we propose a geometric framework that connects the distance of data samples to the decision boundary, with the features existing in the data. We show that deep classifiers have a strong inductive bias towards invariance to non-discriminative features, and that adversarial training exploits this property to confer robustness. Finally, we focus on the challenging problem of generalization to unforeseen corruptions of the data, and we propose a novel data augmentation scheme for achieving state-of-the-art robustness to common corruptions of the images. Overall, our results contribute to the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of deep image classifiers, and pave the way for building more reliable machine learning systems that can be deployed in real-world environments.

The use of vision-based approaches results in an accurate and cost-effective solution to such systems. In this research paper, we propose a threat detection mechanism for autonomous self-driving cars using dashcam videos to ensure the presence of any unwanted obstacle on the road that falls within its visual range. This information can assist the vehicle's program to en route safely. There are four major components, namely, YOLO to identify the objects, advanced lane detection algorithm, multi regression model to measure the distance of the object from the camera, the two-second rule for measuring the safety, and limiting speed. In addition, we have used the Car Crash Dataset(CCD) for calculating the accuracy of the model. The YOLO algorithm gives an accuracy of around 93%. The final accuracy of our proposed Threat Detection Model (TDM) is 82.65%. ",

It helps us find bugs and detect patent infringements in released software and plays a key role in the prevention of supply chain attacks. A practical embedding learning framework relies on the robustness of vector representation system of assembly code and the accuracy of the annotation of function pairs. Supervised learning based methods are traditionally emploied. But annotating different function pairs with accurate labels is very difficult. These supervised learning methods are easily overtrained and suffer from vector robustness issues. To mitigate these problems, we propose Fun2Vec: a contrastive learning framework of function-level representation for binary. We take an unsupervised learning approach and formulate the binary code similarity detection as instance discrimination. Fun2Vec works directly on disassembled binary functions, and could be implemented with any encoder. It does not require manual labeled similar or dissimilar information. We use the compiler optimization options and code obfuscation techniques to generate augmented data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art in accuracy and have great advantage in few-shot settings. ",

Traditionally an adversarial example generation scheme relies on either detailed model information (gradient-based methods) or lots of samples to train a surrogate model, neither of which are available in most scenarios. We propose the notion of the instance-based attack. Our scheme is interpretable and can work in a black-box environment. Given a specific binary example and a malware classifier, we use the data augmentation strategies to produce enough data from which we can train a simple interpretable model. We explain the detection model by displaying the weight of different parts of the specific binary. By analyzing the explanations, we found that the data subsections play an important role in Windows PE malware detection. We proposed a new function preserving transformation algorithm that can be applied to data subsections. By employing the binary-diversification techniques that we proposed, we eliminated the influence of the most weighted part to generate adversarial examples. Our algorithm can fool the DNNs in certain cases with a success rate of nearly 100\\%. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method . The most important aspect is that our method operates in black-box settings and the results can be validated with domain knowledge.

Such PU setting is of great importance in various tasks such as medical diagnosis, social network analysis, financial markets analysis, and knowledge base completion, which also tend to be intrinsically imbalanced, i.e., where most examples are actually negatives. Most existing approaches for PU learning, however, only consider artificially balanced datasets and it is unclear how well they perform in the realistic scenario of imbalanced and long-tail data distribution. This paper proposes to tackle this challenge via robust and efficient self-supervised pretraining. However, training conventional self-supervised learning methods when applied with highly imbalanced PU distribution needs better reformulation.

We performed different experiments across multiple datasets to show that ImPULSeS is able to halve the error rate of the previous state-of-the-art, even compared with previous methods that are given the true prior. Moreover, our method showed increased robustness to prior misspecification and superior performance even when pretraining was performed on an unrelated dataset. We anticipate such robustness and efficiency will make it much easier for practitioners to obtain excellent results on other PU datasets of interest.

To overcome the memory staleness problem aggregate information from the nodes neighbors memory in addition to the nodes memory. Inspired by that, we design an updated embedding module that inserts the most similar node in addition to the nodes neighbors.

In this novel augmentation strategy, we first find segments in a logo and apply transformations such as rotation, scaling, and color change, on the segments, unlike the conventional image-level augmentation strategies. Moreover, we evaluate whether the recently introduced ranking-based loss function, Smooth-AP, is a better approach for learning similarity for logo retrieval.

Existing research mainly focuses on coarse-grained faulty service localization. However, the fine-grained root cause localization to identify not only faulty service but also the root cause metric in the service is more helpful for operators to fix application anomalies, which is also more challenging. Recently, causal inference (CI) based methods is becoming popular but currently used CI methods have limitations, such as linear causal relations assumption. Therefore, this paper provides a framework named CausalRCA to implement fine-grained, automated, and real-time root cause localization. The CausalRCA works with a gradient-based causal structure learning method to generate weighted causal graphs and a root cause inference method to localize root cause metrics. We conduct coarse-grained and fine-grained root cause localization to validate the localization performance of CausalRCA. Experimental results show that CausalRCA performs best localization accuracy compared with baseline methods, e.g., the average $AC@3$ of the fine-grained root cause metric localization in the faulty service is 0.719, and the average improvement is 17\\% compared with baseline methods.

The affinity matrix represents the graph structure and is vital to the performance of semi-supervised graph-based clustering. However, existing methods adopt a static affinity matrix to learn the low-dimensional representations of data points and do not optimize the affinity matrix during the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic graph structure learning method for semi-supervised clustering. In this method, we simultaneously optimize the affinity matrix and the low-dimensional representations of data points by leveraging the given pairwise constraints. Moreover, we propose an alternating minimization approach with proven convergence to solve the proposed nonconvex model. During the iteration process, our method cyclically updates the low-dimensional representations of data points and refines the affinity matrix, leading to a dynamic affinity matrix (graph structure). Specifically, for the update of the affinity matrix, we enforce the data points with remarkably different low-dimensional representations to have an affinity value of 0. Furthermore, we construct the initial affinity matrix by integrating the local distance and global self-representation among data points. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets under different settings show the advantages of the proposed approach. ",

In this work, we present a theoretical analysis where all parameters of a trained Transformer are interpreted by projecting them into the embedding space, that is, the space of vocabulary items they operate on. We derive a simple theoretical framework to support our arguments and provide ample evidence for its validity. First, an empirical analysis showing that parameters of both pretrained and fine-tuned models can be interpreted in embedding space. Second, we present two applications of our framework: (a) aligning the parameters of different models that share a vocabulary, and (b) constructing a classifier without training by ``translating'' the parameters of a fine-tuned classifier to parameters of a different model that was only pretrained. Overall, our findings open the door to interpretation methods that, at least in part, abstract away from model specifics and operate in the embedding space only. ",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) has recently been demonstrated critical in improving recommendation performance. The fundamental idea of CL-based recommendation models is to maximize the consistency between representations learned from different graph augmentations of the user-item bipartite graph. In such a self-supervised manner, CL-based recommendation models are expected to extract general features from the raw data to tackle the data sparsity issue. Despite the effectiveness of this paradigm, we still have no clue what underlies the performance gains. In this paper, we first reveal that CL enhances recommendation through endowing the model with the ability to learn more evenly distributed user/item representations, which can implicitly alleviate the pervasive popularity bias and promote long-tail items. Meanwhile, we find that the graph augmentations, which were considered a necessity in prior studies, are relatively unreliable and less significant in CL-based recommendation. On top of these findings, we put forward an eXtremely Simple Graph Contrastive Learning method (XSimGCL) for recommendation, which discards the ineffective graph augmentations and instead employs a simple yet effective noise-based embedding augmentation to create views for CL. A comprehensive experimental study on three large and highly sparse benchmark datasets demonstrates that, though the proposed method is extremely simple, it can smoothly adjust the uniformity of learned representations and outperforms its graph augmentation-based counterparts by a large margin in both recommendation accuracy and training efficiency.

First, we prove the minimax and problem-dependent regret lower bounds for stochastic and linear bandits that quantify the hardness of bandits with $\\epsilon$-global DP. These bounds suggest the existence of two hardness regimes depending on the privacy budget $\\epsilon$. In the high-privacy regime (small $\\epsilon$), the hardness depends on a coupled effect of privacy and partial information about the reward distributions. In the low-privacy regime (large $\\epsilon$), bandits with $\\epsilon$-global DP are not harder than the bandits without privacy. For stochastic bandits, we further propose a generic framework to design a near-optimal $\\epsilon$ global DP extension of an index-based optimistic bandit algorithm. The framework consists of three ingredients: the Laplace mechanism, arm-dependent adaptive episodes, and usage of only the rewards collected in the last episode for computing private statistics. Specifically, we instantiate $\\epsilon$-global DP extensions of UCB and KL-UCB algorithms, namely AdaP-UCB and AdaP-KLUCB. AdaP-KLUCB is the first algorithm that both satisfies $\\epsilon$-global DP and yields a regret upper bound that matches the problem-dependent lower bound up to multiplicative constants. ",

This finding has inspired us and other researchers to ask if the implication also runs the other way: If CNN representations become more brain-like, does the network become more accurate? Previous attempts to address this question showed very modest gains in accuracy, owing in part to limitations of the regularization method. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new neural data regularizer for CNNs that uses Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) to optimize the resemblance of the CNN's image representations to that of the monkey visual cortex. Using this new neural data regularizer, we see much larger performance gains in both classification accuracy and within-super-class accuracy, as compared to the previous state-of-the-art neural data regularizers. These networks are also more robust to adversarial attacks than their unregularized counterparts. Together, these results confirm that neural data regularization can push CNN performance higher, and introduces a new method that obtains a larger performance boost. ",

This paper justifies the use of neural networks for the approximation of coarse-scale surrogate models by analyzing their approximation properties. For a prototypical and representative numerical homogenization technique, the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition method, we show that one single neural network is sufficient to approximate the coarse contributions of all occurring coefficient-dependent local sub-problems for a non-trivial class of diffusion coefficients up to arbitrary accuracy. We present rigorous upper bounds on the depth and number of non-zero parameters for such a network to achieve a given accuracy.

However, during its training procedure, an unstable mode of \"catastrophic overfitting\" has been identified in arXiv:2001.03994 [cs.LG], where the robust accuracy abruptly drops to zero within a single training step. Existing methods use gradient regularizers or random initialization tricks to attenuate this issue, whereas they either take high computational cost or lead to lower robust accuracy. In this work, we provide the first study, which thoroughly examines a collection of tricks from three perspectives: Data Initialization, Network Structure, and Optimization, to overcome the catastrophic overfitting in FGSM-AT. Surprisingly, we find that simple tricks, i.e., a) masking partial pixels (even without randomness), b) setting a large convolution stride and smooth activation functions, or c) regularizing the weights of the first convolutional layer, can effectively tackle the overfitting issue. Extensive results on a range of network architectures validate the effectiveness of each proposed trick, and the combinations of tricks are also investigated. For example, trained with PreActResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, our method attains 49.8% accuracy against PGD-50 attacker and 46.4% accuracy against AutoAttack, demonstrating that pure FGSM-AT is capable of enabling robust learners.

We define a dynamic fitness function to obtain the smallest possible circuit and highest accuracy on unseen data, ensuring that the proposed technique is generalizable and robust. We minimize the complexity of the generated circuits in terms of the number of entanglement gates by penalizing their appearance. We reduce the size of the images with two dimensionality reduction approaches: principal component analysis (PCA), which is encoded in the individual for optimization purpose, and a small convolutional autoencoder (CAE). These two methods are compared with one another and with a classical nonlinear approach to understand their behaviors and to ensure that the classification ability is due to the quantum circuit and not the preprocessing technique used for dimensionality reduction.

We aim at two fundamental goals. The first, and the most important, we show that the solution to Poisson equation can be numerically approximated in the sup-norm by Monte Carlo methods based on a slight change of the walk on spheres algorithm. This provides estimates which are efficient with respect to the prescribed approximation error and without the curse of dimensionality. In addition, the overall number of samples does not not depend on the point at which the approximation is performed. As a second goal, we show that the obtained Monte Carlo solver renders ReLU deep neural network (DNN) solutions to Poisson problem, whose sizes depend at most polynomially in the dimension $d$ and in the desired error. In fact we show that the random DNN provides with high probability a small approximation error and low polynomial complexity in the dimension. ",

The \"proximity\" between probability laws is quantified by the Wasserstein distance, attached to optimal transport theory. The classical entropic regularization technique in this field combined with recent results from convex duality theory allow to reformulate the distributionally robust optimization problem in a way which is tractable for computations.

However, in this context, sampling from the distribution is secondary to finding representations of real images, which often come with labels and explicitly represent the content and quality of the target distribution. It remains difficult to faithfully reconstruct images from generative models, particularly those as complex as histological images. In this work, two existing methods (autoencoders and adversarial latent autoencoders) are combined in attempt to improve our ability to encode and decode real images of non-melanoma skin cancer, specifically intra-epidermal carcinoma (IEC). Utilising a dataset of high-quality images of IEC (256 x 256), this work assesses the result of both image reconstruction quality and representation learning. It is shown that adversarial training can improve baseline FID scores from 76 to 50, and that benchmarks on representation learning can be improved by up to 3%. Smooth and realistic interpolations of the variation in the morphological structure are also presented for the first time, positioning representation learning as a promising direction in the context of computational pathology.

In DCASE 2022 Task 3, types of data transform from computationally generated spatial recordings to recordings of real-sound scenes. Our system submitted to the DCASE 2022 Task 3 is based on our previous proposed Event-Independent Network V2 (EINV2) and a novel data augmentation method. To detect different sound events of the same type with different locations, our method employs EINV2, combining a track-wise output format, permutation-invariant training, and soft parameter-sharing. EINV2 is also extended to use conformer structures to learn local and global patterns. To improve the generalization ability of the model, we use a data augmentation method containing several data augmentation chains, which are composed of random combinations of several different data augmentation operations. To mitigate the lack of real-scene recordings in the development dataset and the presence of sound events being unbalanced, we exploit FSD50K, AudioSet, and TAU Spatial Room Impulse Response Database (TAU-SRIR DB) to generate simulated datasets for training. We present results on the validation set of Sony-TAu Realistic Spatial Soundscapes 2022 (STARSS22) in detail. Experimental results indicate that the ability to generalize to different environments and unbalanced performance among different classes are two main challenges.

    "abstract": "Under-Display Camera (UDC) has been widely exploited to help smartphones realize full screen display. However, as the screen could inevitably affect the light propagation process, the images captured by the UDC system usually contain flare, haze, blur, and noise. Particularly, flare and blur in UDC images could severely deteriorate the user experience in high dynamic range (HDR) scenes. In this paper, we propose a new deep model, namely UDC-UNet, to address the UDC image restoration problem with the known Point Spread Function (PSF) in HDR scenes. On the premise that Point Spread Function (PSF) of the UDC system is known, we treat UDC image restoration as a non-blind image restoration problem and propose a novel learning-based approach. Our network consists of three parts, including a U-shape base network to utilize multi-scale information, a condition branch to perform spatially variant modulation, and a kernel branch to provide the prior knowledge of the given PSF. According to the characteristics of HDR data, we additionally design a tone mapping loss to stabilize network optimization and achieve better visual quality. Experimental results show that the proposed UDC-UNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Our approach won the second place in the UDC image restoration track of MIPI challenge. Codes will be publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "The conflict in Ukraine is causing large-scale displacement in Europe and in the World. Based on the UNHCR estimates, more than 7 million people fled the country as of 5 September 2022. In this context, it is extremely important to anticipate where these people are moving so that national to local authorities can better manage challenges related to their reception and integration. This work shows how innovative data from social media can provide useful insights on conflict-induced migration flows. In particular, we explore the potential of Facebook's Social Connectedness Index (SCI) for predicting migration flows in the context of the war in Ukraine, building on previous research findings that the presence of a diaspora network is one of the major migration drivers. To do so, we first evaluate the relationship between the Ukrainian diaspora and the number of refugees from Ukraine registered for Temporary Protection or similar national schemes as a proxy of migratory flows into the EU. We find a very strong correlation between the two (Pearson's $r=0.93$, $p<0.0001$), which indicates that the diaspora is attracting the people fleeing the war, who tend to reach their compatriots, in particular in the countries where the Ukrainian immigration was more a recent phenomenon. Second, we compare Facebook's Social Connectedness Index with available official data on diaspora at regional level in Europe. Our results suggest that the index, along with other readily available covariates, is a strong predictor of the Ukrainian diaspora at regional scale. Finally, we discuss the potential of Facebook's SCI to provide timely and spatially detailed information on human diaspora for those countries where this information might be missing or outdated, and to complement official statistics for fast policy response during conflicts.

While it has been demonstrated that neural SBI methods can provide accurate posterior approximations, the simulation studies establishing these results have considered only well-specified problems -- that is, where the model and the data generating process coincide exactly. However, the behaviour of such algorithms in the case of model misspecification has received little attention. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive study of the behaviour of neural SBI algorithms in the presence of various forms of model misspecification. We find that misspecification can have a profoundly deleterious effect on performance. Some mitigation strategies are explored, but no approach tested prevents failure in all cases. We conclude that new approaches are required to address model misspecification if neural SBI algorithms are to be relied upon to derive accurate scientific conclusions. ",

Among the broad applications of machine learning, various approaches have been adopted to quantify uncertainty, such as Bayesian modeling, Monte Carlo dropout, ensembles, etc. With the aim of addressing the challenges specific to the data domain of electron microscopy, two different types of ensembles of pre-trained neural networks were implemented in this work. The ensembles performed semantic segmentation of ice crystal within a two-phase mixture, thereby tracking its phase transformation to water. The first ensemble (EA) is composed of U-net style networks having different underlying architectures, whereas the second series of ensembles (ER-i) are composed of randomly initialized U-net style networks, wherein each base learner has the same underlying architecture 'i'. The encoders of the base learners were pre-trained on the Imagenet dataset. The performance of EA and ER were evaluated on three different metrics: accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty. It is seen that EA exhibits a greater classification accuracy and is better calibrated, as compared to ER. While the uncertainty quantification of these two types of ensembles are comparable, the uncertainty scores exhibited by ER were found to be dependent on the specific architecture of its base member ('i') and not consistently better than EA. Thus, the challenges posed for the analysis of electron microscopy datasets appear to be better addressed by an ensemble design like EA, as compared to an ensemble design like ER. ",

    "abstract": "Stability is an important characteristic of network models that has implications for other desirable aspects such as controllability. The stability of a Boolean network depends on various factors, such as the topology of its wiring diagram and the type of the functions describing its dynamics. In this paper, we study the stability of linear Boolean networks by computing Derrida curves and quantifying the number of attractors and cycle lengths imposed by their network topologies. Derrida curves are commonly used to measure the stability of Boolean networks and several parameters such as the average in-degree K and the output bias p can indicate if a network is stable, critical, or unstable. For random unbiased Boolean networks there is a critical connectivity value Kc=2 such that if K<Kc networks operate in the ordered regime, and if K>Kc networks operate in the chaotic regime. Here, we show that for linear networks, which are the least canalizing and most unstable, the phase transition from order to chaos already happens at an average in-degree of Kc=1. Consistently, we also show that unstable networks exhibit a large number of attractors with very long limit cycles while stable and critical networks exhibit fewer attractors with shorter limit cycles. Additionally, we present theoretical results to quantify important dynamical properties of linear networks. First, we present a formula for the proportion of attractor states in linear systems. Second, we show that the expected number of fixed points in linear systems is 2, while general Boolean networks possess on average one fixed point. Third, we present a formula to quantify the number of bijective linear Boolean networks and provide a lower bound for the percentage of this type of network. ",

    "abstract": "Airway segmentation is crucial for the examination, diagnosis, and prognosis of lung diseases, while its manual delineation is unduly burdensome. To alleviate this time-consuming and potentially subjective manual procedure, researchers have proposed methods to automatically segment airways from computerized tomography (CT) images. However, some small-sized airway branches (e.g., bronchus and terminal bronchioles) significantly aggravate the difficulty of automatic segmentation by machine learning models. In particular, the variance of voxel values and the severe data imbalance in airway branches make the computational module prone to discontinuous and false-negative predictions. Attention mechanism has shown the capacity to segment complex structures, while fuzzy logic can reduce the uncertainty in feature representations. Therefore, the integration of deep attention networks and fuzzy theory, given by the fuzzy attention layer, should be an escalated solution. This paper presents an efficient method for airway segmentation, comprising a novel fuzzy attention neural network and a comprehensive loss function to enhance the spatial continuity of airway segmentation. The deep fuzzy set is formulated by a set of voxels in the feature map and a learnable Gaussian membership function. Different from the existing attention mechanism, the proposed channelspecific fuzzy attention addresses the issue of heterogeneous features in different channels. Furthermore, a novel evaluation metric is proposed to assess both the continuity and completeness of airway structures. The efficiency of the proposed method has been proved by testing on open datasets, including EXACT09 and LIDC datasets, and our in-house COVID-19 and fibrotic lung disease datasets. ",

The solution is then approximated by a deep neural network whose loss function is the variational integral plus soft constraint from the mixed boundary conditions. Instead of introducing mesh grids or basis functions to evaluate the loss function, our method only requires uniform samplers of the domain and boundaries. To address instability in real-world scaling, we re-normalize the input of the network at the first layer and balance the regularizing factors for each individual boundary. Finally, we illustrate the performance of our method by several numerical experiments, including a 2D model with analytical solution, Arolla glacier model with real scaling and a 3D model with periodic boundary conditions. Numerical results show that our proposed method is efficient in solving the non-Newtonian mechanics arising from glacier modeling with nonlinear rheology. ",

The approach is more scalable to large data than Markov Chain Monte Carlo, it embraces more expressive models than Variational Inference, and it does not rely on adversarial training (or density ratio estimation). We adopt the recent approach of constructing two models: (1) a primary model, tasked with performing regression or classification; and (2) a secondary, expressive (e.g. implicit) model that defines an approximate posterior distribution over the parameters of the primary model. However, we optimise the parameters of the posterior model via gradient descent according to a Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior predictive distribution -- which is our only approximation (other than the posterior model). Only a likelihood needs to be specified, which can take various forms such as loss functions and synthetic likelihoods, thus providing a form of a likelihood-free approach. Furthermore, we formulate the approach such that the posterior samples can either be independent of, or conditionally dependent upon the inputs to the primary model. The latter approach is shown to be capable of increasing the apparent complexity of the primary model. We see this being useful in applications such as surrogate and physics-based models. To promote how the Bayesian paradigm offers more than just uncertainty quantification, we demonstrate: uncertainty quantification, multi-modality, as well as an application with a recent deep forecasting neural network architecture.

In particular, given a dataset $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ and a set of noisy labels $\\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^n\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ we let $u_n:\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^n\\to\\mathbb{R}$ be the minimiser of an energy which consists of a data fidelity term and an appropriately scaled graph poly-Laplacian term. When $y_i = g(x_i)+\\xi_i$, for iid noise $\\xi_i$, and using the geometric random graph, we identify (with high probability) the rate of convergence of $u_n$ to $g$ in the large data limit $n\\to\\infty$. Furthermore, our rate, up to logarithms, coincides with the known rate of convergence in the usual smoothing spline model. ",
