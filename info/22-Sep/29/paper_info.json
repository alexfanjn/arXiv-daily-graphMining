    "abstract": "Many visual phenomena suggest that humans use top-down generative or reconstructive processes to create visual percepts (e.g., imagery, object completion, pareidolia), but little is known about the role reconstruction plays in robust object recognition. We built an iterative encoder-decoder network that generates an object reconstruction and used it as top-down attentional feedback to route the most relevant spatial and feature information to feed-forward object recognition processes. We tested this model using the challenging out-of-distribution digit recognition dataset, MNIST-C, where 15 different types of transformation and corruption are applied to handwritten digit images. Our model showed strong generalization performance against various image perturbations, on average outperforming all other models including feedforward CNNs and adversarially trained networks. Our model is particularly robust to blur, noise, and occlusion corruptions, where shape perception plays an important role. Ablation studies further reveal two complementary roles of spatial and feature-based attention in robust object recognition, with the former largely consistent with spatial masking benefits in the attention literature (the reconstruction serves as a mask) and the latter mainly contributing to the model's inference speed (i.e., number of time steps to reach a certain confidence threshold) by reducing the space of possible object hypotheses. We also observed that the model sometimes hallucinates a non-existing pattern out of noise, leading to highly interpretable human-like errors. Our study shows that modeling reconstruction-based feedback endows AI systems with a powerful attention mechanism, which can help us understand the role of generating perception in human visual processing.

    "abstract": "Automating the process of manipulating and delivering sutures during robotic surgery is a prominent problem at the frontier of surgical robotics, as automating this task can significantly reduce surgeons' fatigue during tele-operated surgery and allow them to spend more time addressing higher-level clinical decision making. Accomplishing autonomous suturing and suture manipulation in the real world requires accurate suture thread localization and reconstruction, the process of creating a 3D shape representation of suture thread from 2D stereo camera surgical image pairs. This is a very challenging problem due to how limited pixel information is available for the threads, as well as their sensitivity to lighting and specular reflection. We present a suture thread reconstruction work that uses reliable keypoints and a Minimum Variation Spline (MVS) smoothing optimization to construct a 3D centerline from a segmented surgical image pair. This method is comparable to previous suture thread reconstruction works, with the possible benefit of increased accuracy of grasping point estimation.

    "abstract": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification successively alternate convolutions and downsampling operations, such as pooling layers or strided convolutions, resulting in lower resolution features the deeper the network gets. These downsampling operations save computational resources and provide some translational invariance as well as a bigger receptive field at the next layers. However, an inherent side-effect of this is that high-level features, produced at the deep end of the network, are always captured in low resolution feature maps. The inverse is also true, as shallow layers always contain small scale features. In biomedical image analysis engineers are often tasked with classifying very small image patches which carry only a limited amount of information. By their nature, these patches may not even contain objects, with the classification depending instead on the detection of subtle underlying patterns with an unknown scale in the image's texture. In these cases every bit of information is valuable; thus, it is important to extract the maximum number of informative features possible. Driven by these considerations, we introduce a new CNN architecture which preserves multi-scale features from deep, intermediate, and shallow layers by utilizing skip connections along with consecutive contractions and expansions of the feature maps. Using a dataset of very low resolution patches from Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) CT scans we demonstrate that our network can outperform current state of the art models. ",

With the rapid growth of autonomous vehicles and intelligent infrastructure, the V2X perception systems will soon be deployed at scale, which raises a safety-critical question: how can we evaluate and improve its performance under challenging traffic scenarios before the real-world deployment? Collecting diverse large-scale real-world test scenes seems to be the most straightforward solution, but it is expensive and time-consuming, and the collections can only cover limited scenarios. To this end, we propose the first open adversarial scene generator V2XP-ASG that can produce realistic, challenging scenes for modern LiDAR-based multi-agent perception system. V2XP-ASG learns to construct an adversarial collaboration graph and simultaneously perturb multiple agents' poses in an adversarial and plausible manner. The experiments demonstrate that V2XP-ASG can effectively identify challenging scenes for a large range of V2X perception systems. Meanwhile, by training on the limited number of generated challenging scenes, the accuracy of V2X perception systems can be further improved by 12.3% on challenging and 4% on normal scenes. ",

To hindsight theory, our work brings the formal rigor and proof machinery of concurrent program logics. We substantiate the usefulness of our development by verifying the linearizability of the Logical Ordering (LO-)tree and RDCSS. Both of these involve complex proof arguments due to future-dependent linearization points. The LO-tree additionally features complex structure overlays.

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) is a widely applied paradigm for releasing data while maintaining user privacy. Its success is to a large part due to its composition property that guarantees privacy even in the case of multiple data releases. Consequently, composition has received a lot of attention from the research community: there exist several composition theorems for adversaries with different amounts of flexibility in their choice of mechanisms. But apart from mechanisms, the adversary can also choose the databases on which these mechanisms are invoked. The classic tool for analyzing the composition of DP mechanisms, the so-called composition experiment, neither allows for incorporating constraints on databases nor for different assumptions on the adversary's prior knowledge about database membership. We therefore propose a generalized composition experiment (GCE), which has this flexibility. We show that composition theorems that hold with respect to the classic composition experiment also hold with respect to the worst case of the GCE. This implies that existing composition theorems give a privacy guarantee for more cases than are explicitly covered by the classic composition experiment. Beyond these theoretical insights, we demonstrate two practical applications of the GCE: the first application is to give better privacy bounds in the presence of restrictions on the choice of databases; the second application is to reason about how the adversary's prior knowledge influences the privacy leakage. In this context, we show a connection between adversaries with an uninformative prior and subsampling, an important primitive in DP. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze the interplay between the databases in DP composition, and thereby gives both a better understanding of composition and practical tools for obtaining better composition bounds.

Yet, despite the intensive research on KRL, most existing studies either focus on homogenous KGs or assume KG completion tasks (i.e., inference of missing facts), while answering complex logical queries over KGs with multiple aspects (multi-view KGs) remains an open challenge. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we present ROMA, a novel KRL framework for answering logical queries over multi-view KGs. Compared with the prior work, ROMA departs in major aspects. (i) It models a multi-view KG as a set of overlaying sub-KGs, each corresponding to one view, which subsumes many types of KGs studied in the literature (e.g., temporal KGs). (ii) It supports complex logical queries with varying relation and view constraints (e.g., with complex topology and/or from multiple views); (iii) It scales up to KGs of large sizes (e.g., millions of facts) and fine-granular views (e.g., dozens of views); (iv) It generalizes to query structures and KG views that are unobserved during training. Extensive empirical evaluation on real-world KGs shows that \\system significantly outperforms alternative methods. ",

    "abstract": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) represent a gold standard when developing policy guidelines. However, RCTs are often narrow, and lack data on broader populations of interest. Causal effects in these populations are often estimated using observational datasets, which may suffer from unobserved confounding and selection bias. Given a set of observational estimates (e.g. from multiple studies), we propose a meta-algorithm that attempts to reject observational estimates that are biased. We do so using validation effects, causal effects that can be inferred from both RCT and observational data. After rejecting estimators that do not pass this test, we generate conservative confidence intervals on the extrapolated causal effects for subgroups not observed in the RCT. Under the assumption that at least one observational estimator is asymptotically normal and consistent for both the validation and extrapolated effects, we provide guarantees on the coverage probability of the intervals output by our algorithm. To facilitate hypothesis testing in settings where causal effect transportation across datasets is necessary, we give conditions under which a doubly-robust estimator of group average treatment effects is asymptotically normal, even when flexible machine learning methods are used for estimation of nuisance parameters. We illustrate the properties of our approach on semi-synthetic and real world datasets, and show that it compares favorably to standard meta-analysis techniques. ",

There is thus uncontrolled competition for bandwidth between and within collaborations. As a result, data \"hogs\" disk space at processing facilities for much longer than it takes to process, leading to vastly over-provisioned storage infrastructures. Integrated co-scheduling of networks as part of high-level managed workflows might reduce these storage needs by more than an order of magnitude.

We introduce REGression constrained Neural Architecture Search (REG-NAS) to design a family of highly accurate models that engender fewer negative flips. REG-NAS consists of two components: (1) A novel architecture constraint that enables a larger model to contain all the weights of the smaller one thus maximizing weight sharing. This idea stems from our observation that larger weight sharing among networks leads to similar sample-wise predictions and results in fewer negative flips; (2) A novel search reward that incorporates both Top-1 accuracy and negative flips in the architecture search metric. We demonstrate that \\regnas can successfully find desirable architectures with few negative flips in three popular architecture search spaces.

Due to the extremely large image coverage area (e.g., thousands square kilometers), candidate targets in these images are much smaller, dimer, more changeable than those targets observed by aerial-based and land-based imaging devices. Existing short imaging distance-based infrared datasets and target detection methods cannot be well adopted to the space-based surveillance task. To address these problems, we develop a space-based infrared tiny ship detection dataset (namely, NUDT-SIRST-Sea) with 48 space-based infrared images and 17598 pixel-level tiny ship annotations. Each image covers about 10000 square kilometers of area with 10000X10000 pixels. Considering the extreme characteristics (e.g., small, dim, changeable) of those tiny ships in such challenging scenes, we propose a multi-level TransUNet (MTU-Net) in this paper. Specifically, we design a Vision Transformer (ViT) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) hybrid encoder to extract multi-level features. Local feature maps are first extracted by several convolution layers and then fed into the multi-level feature extraction module (MVTM) to capture long-distance dependency. We further propose a copy-rotate-resize-paste (CRRP) data augmentation approach to accelerate the training phase, which effectively alleviates the issue of sample imbalance between targets and background. Besides, we design a FocalIoU loss to achieve both target localization and shape description. Experimental results on the NUDT-SIRST-Sea dataset show that our MTU-Net outperforms traditional and existing deep learning based SIRST methods in terms of probability of detection, false alarm rate and intersection over union.

To deal with this difficulty, this paper proposes a neural-network-based ISTD method called CourtNet, which has three sub-networks: the prosecution network is designed for improving the recall rate; the defendant network is devoted to increasing the precision rate; the jury network weights their results to adaptively balance the precision and recall rate. Furthermore, the prosecution network utilizes a densely connected transformer structure, which can prevent small targets from disappearing in the network forward propagation. In addition, a fine-grained attention module is adopted to accurately locate the small targets. Experimental results show that CourtNet achieves the best F1-score on the two ISTD datasets, MFIRST (0.62) and SIRST (0.73). ",

The results show that, with an overall accuracy of 95% in the classification of these images, the proposed model is close to what exists in the state of the art with the possibility of adjustment for better results in the manipulation techniques that arise in the future.

    "abstract": "The concepts of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are closely related to each other. IoT is often used to refer to small interconnected devices like those in smart home while CPS often refers to large interconnected devices like industry machines and smart cars. In this paper, we present a unified view of IoT and CPS: from the perspective of network architecture, IoT and CPS are similar. In both IoT and CPS, networking/communication modules are attached to original dumb things so that those dumb things become smart and can be integrated into cyber space. If needed, actuators can also be integrated with a thing so as to control the thing. With this unified view, we can perform risk assessment of an IoT/CPS system from six factors, hardware, networking, operating system (OS), software, data and human. To illustrate the use of such risk analysis framework, we analyze an air quality monitoring network, smart home using smart plugs and building automation system (BAS). We also discuss challenges such as cost and secure OS in IoT security. ",

With the availability of a large volume of health care datasets and progressions in deep learning techniques, systems are now well equipped to predict the future trend of any health problems. From the literature survey, we found the SVM was used to predict the heart failure rate without relating objective factors. Utilizing the intensity of important historical information in electronic health records (EHR), we have built a smart and predictive model utilizing long short-term memory (LSTM) and predict the future trend of heart failure based on that health record. Hence the fundamental commitment of this work is to predict the failure of the heart using an LSTM based on the patient's electronic medicinal information. We have analyzed a dataset containing the medical records of 299 heart failure patients collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan). The patients consisted of 105 women and 194 men and their ages ranged from 40 and 95 years old. The dataset contains 13 features, which report clinical, body, and lifestyle information responsible for heart failure. We have found an increasing trend in our analysis which will contribute to advancing the knowledge in the field of heart stroke prediction. ",

    "abstract": "Integrating multispectral data in object detection, especially visible and infrared images, has received great attention in recent years. Since visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images can provide complementary information to handle light variations, the paired images are used in many fields, such as multispectral pedestrian detection, RGB-IR crowd counting and RGB-IR salient object detection. Compared with natural RGB-IR images, we find detection in aerial RGB-IR images suffers from cross-modal weakly misalignment problems, which are manifested in the position, size and angle deviations of the same object. In this paper, we mainly address the challenge of cross-modal weakly misalignment in aerial RGB-IR images. Specifically, we firstly explain and analyze the cause of the weakly misalignment problem. Then, we propose a Translation-Scale-Rotation Alignment (TSRA) module to address the problem by calibrating the feature maps from these two modalities. The module predicts the deviation between two modality objects through an alignment process and utilizes Modality-Selection (MS) strategy to improve the performance of alignment. Finally, a two-stream feature alignment detector (TSFADet) based on the TSRA module is constructed for RGB-IR object detection in aerial images. With comprehensive experiments on the public DroneVehicle datasets, we verify that our method reduces the effect of the cross-modal misalignment and achieve robust detection results. ",

An approximate ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) expression is derived when the atmosphere turbulence and pointing error due to the characteristics of THz as well as the phase errors resulting from finite precision of RIS and imperfect channel estimation are taken into account simultaneously. Furthermore, according to the statistical and perfect channel state information of the untrustworthy receiver, we optimize the phase shifts of RIS to maximize the lower bound of secrecy rate (SR) and instantaneous SR, respectively, by using semidefinite relaxation method. Simulation results show that both the approximate expression for the ESR and the optimization algorithms are serviceable, and even when the jitter standard variance of the trustworthy receiver is greater than that of the untrustworthy one, a positive SR can still be guaranteed.

However, these algorithms often require instantaneous access to network state information, which is not always available. While network stability can sometimes be achieved with delayed state information, other performance metrics such as latency may degrade. Thus, instead of simply stabilizing the system, our goal is to design a framework that can mimic arbitrary scheduling algorithms with performance guarantees. A naive approach is to make decisions directly with delayed information, but we show that such methods may lead to poor performance. Instead, we propose the Universal Tracking (UT) algorithm that can mimic the actions of arbitrary scheduling algorithms under observation delay. We rigorously show that the performance gap between UT and the scheduling algorithm being tracked is bounded by constants. Our numerical experiments show that UT significantly outperforms the naive approach in various applications. ",

Previous attempts to combat spam mainly employ features related to metadata, user behaviors, or relational ties. These works have made considerable progress in understanding and filtering spamming campaigns. However, this problem remains far from fully solved. Almost all the proposed features focus on a limited number of observed attributes or explainable phenomena, making it difficult for existing methods to achieve further improvement. To broaden the vision about solving the spam problem and address long-standing challenges (class imbalance and graph incompleteness) in the spam detection area, we propose a new attempt of utilizing signed latent factors to filter fraudulent activities. The spam-contaminated relational datasets of multiple online applications in this scenario are interpreted by the unified signed network. Two competitive and highly dissimilar algorithms of latent factors mining (LFM) models are designed based on multi-relational likelihoods estimation (LFM-MRLE) and signed pairwise ranking (LFM-SPR), respectively. We then explore how to apply the mined latent factors to spam detection tasks. Experiments on real-world datasets of different kinds of Web applications (social media and Web forum) indicate that LFM models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in detecting spamming activities.

Low/medium-interaction honeypot is regarded as a promising lightweight defense to actively protect mobile Internet of things, especially UAV networks. Existing works primarily focused on honeypot design and attack pattern recognition, the incentive issue for motivating UAVs' participation (e.g., sharing trapped attack data in honeypots) to collaboratively resist distributed and sophisticated attacks is still under-explored. This paper proposes a novel game-based collaborative defense approach to address optimal, fair, and feasible incentive mechanism design, in the presence of network dynamics and UAVs' multi-dimensional private information (e.g., valid defense data (VDD) volume, communication delay, and UAV cost). Specifically, we first develop a honeypot game between UAVs under both partial and complete information asymmetry scenarios. We then devise a contract-theoretic method to solve the optimal VDD-reward contract design problem with partial information asymmetry, while ensuring truthfulness, fairness, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, under complete information asymmetry, we devise a reinforcement learning based distributed method to dynamically design optimal contracts for distinct types of UAVs in the fast-changing network. Experimental simulations show that the proposed scheme can motivate UAV's collaboration in VDD sharing and enhance defensive effectiveness, compared with existing solutions. ",

In the learning process of label distribution, the training data is collected mainly by manual annotation or label enhancement algorithms to generate label distribution. Unfortunately, the complexity of the manual annotation task or the inaccuracy of the label enhancement algorithm leads to noise and uncertainty in the label distribution training set. To alleviate this problem, we introduce the implicit distribution in the label distribution learning framework to characterize the uncertainty of each label value. Specifically, we use deep implicit representation learning to construct a label distribution matrix with Gaussian prior constraints, where each row component corresponds to the distribution estimate of each label value, and this row component is constrained by a prior Gaussian distribution to moderate the noise and uncertainty interference of the label distribution dataset. Finally, each row component of the label distribution matrix is transformed into a standard label distribution form by using the self-attention algorithm. In addition, some approaches with regularization characteristics are conducted in the training phase to improve the performance of the model. ",

The added term is mainly weighted by a hyper-parameter to control the balance of the overall formula to guide the optimization process towards the objective. The result is a parameterized NMF method. However, NMF method adopts unsupervised approaches to estimate the factorizing matrices. Thus, the ability to perform prediction (e.g. classification) using the new obtained features is not guaranteed. The objective of this work is to design an evolutionary framework to learn the hyper-parameter of the parameterized NMF and estimate the factorizing matrices in a supervised way to be more suitable for classification problems. Moreover, we claim that applying NMF-based algorithms separately to different class-pairs instead of applying it once to the whole dataset improves the effectiveness of the matrix factorization process. This results in training multiple parameterized NMF algorithms with different balancing parameter values. A cross-validation combination learning framework is adopted and a Genetic Algorithm is used to identify the optimal set of hyper-parameter values.

First, we identify that the uniform posterior of NIC has special properties, which affect the variance and bias of pathwise and score function estimators of the IWAE target. Moreover, we provide insights on a commonly adopted trick in NIC from gradient variance perspective. Based on those analysis, we further propose multiple-sample NIC (MS-NIC), an enhanced IWAE target for NIC. Experimental results demonstrate that it improves sota NIC methods.

While previous analysis shows RL algorithms are effective assuming access to a generative model, it remains unclear whether RL can be efficient under a more realistic online setting, which requires a careful balance between exploration and exploitation. In this work, we consider online robust MDP by interacting with an unknown nominal system. We propose a robust optimistic policy optimization algorithm that is provably efficient.

On $54$ distinct CPUs, a total of $669$ runs with different Isabelle configurations were reported by Isabelle users. Results range from $107$s to over $11$h. We found that current consumer CPUs performed best, with an optimal number of $8$ to $16$ threads, largely independent of heap memory. As for hardware parameters, CPU base clock affected multi-threaded execution most with a linear correlation of $0.37$, whereas boost frequency was the most influential parameter for single-threaded runs (correlation coefficient $0.55$); cache size played no significant role. When comparing our benchmark scores with popular high-performance computing benchmarks, we found a strong linear relationship with Dolfyn ($R^2 = 0.79$) in the single-threaded scenario. Using data from the 3DMark CPU Profile consumer benchmark, we created a linear model for optimal (multi-threaded) Isabelle performance. When validating, the model has an average $R^2$-score of $0.87$; the mean absolute error in the final model corresponds to a wall-clock time of $46.6$s.

A global forecasting method aims at exploiting the groundwater level time series from a wide range of locations to produce predictions at a single place or at several places at a time. Given the recent success of global forecasting methods in prestigious competitions, it is meaningful to assess them on groundwater level prediction and see how they are compared to local methods.

Each time series is made of daily measurements of groundwater levels and two exogenous variables, rainfall and evapotranspiration. This dataset is made available to the communities for reproducibility and further evaluation. To identify the best configuration to effectively predict groundwater level for the complete set of time series, we compared different predictors including local and global time series forecasting methods.

However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs has been a great hindrance to deploying SNNs ubiquitously for a long time. To leverage the full potential of SNNs, we study the effect of attention mechanisms in SNNs. We first present our idea of attention with a plug-and-play kit, termed the Multi-dimensional Attention (MA). Then, a new attention SNN architecture with end-to-end training called \"MA-SNN\" is proposed, which infers attention weights along the temporal, channel, as well as spatial dimensions separately or simultaneously. Based on the existing neuroscience theories, we exploit the attention weights to optimize membrane potentials, which in turn regulate the spiking response in a data-dependent way. At the cost of negligible additional parameters, MA facilitates vanilla SNNs to achieve sparser spiking activity, better performance, and energy efficiency concurrently. Experiments are conducted in event-based DVS128 Gesture/Gait action recognition and ImageNet-1k image classification. On Gesture/Gait, the spike counts are reduced by 84.9%/81.6%, and the task accuracy and energy efficiency are improved by 5.9%/4.7% and 3.4$\\times$/3.2$\\times$. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve top-1 accuracy of 75.92% and 77.08% on single/4-step Res-SNN-104, which are state-of-the-art results in SNNs. To our best knowledge, this is for the first time, that the SNN community achieves comparable or even better performance compared with its ANN counterpart in the large-scale dataset.

    "abstract": "The recent advances of compressing high-accuracy convolution neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed remarkable progress for real-time object detection. To accelerate detection speed, lightweight detectors always have few convolution layers using single-path backbone. Single-path architecture, however, involves continuous pooling and downsampling operations, always resulting in coarse and inaccurate feature maps that are disadvantageous to locate objects. On the other hand, due to limited network capacity, recent lightweight networks are often weak in representing large scale visual data. To address these problems, this paper presents a dual-path network, named DPNet, with a lightweight attention scheme for real-time object detection. The dual-path architecture enables us to parallelly extract high-level semantic features and low-level object details. Although DPNet has nearly duplicated shape with respect to single-path detectors, the computational costs and model size are not significantly increased. To enhance representation capability, a lightweight self-correlation module (LSCM) is designed to capture global interactions, with only few computational overheads and network parameters. In neck, LSCM is extended into a lightweight crosscorrelation module (LCCM), capturing mutual dependencies among neighboring scale features. We have conducted exhaustive experiments on MS COCO and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that DPNet achieves state-of the-art trade-off between detection accuracy and implementation efficiency.

This is considered a difficult NLP task which has a big influence when added as a component in many NLP applications, such as Question Answering Systems, text Summarization. Arabic Language is one of the most challenging low-resources languages in detecting contradictions due to its rich lexical, semantics ambiguity. We have created a data set of more than 12k sentences and named ArNLI, that will be publicly available. Moreover, we have applied a new model inspired by Stanford contradiction detection proposed solutions on English language. We proposed an approach to detect contradictions between pairs of sentences in Arabic language using contradiction vector combined with language model vector as an input to machine learning model. We analyzed results of different traditional machine learning classifiers and compared their results on our created data set (ArNLI) and on an automatic translation of both PHEME, SICK English data sets. Best results achieved using Random Forest classifier with an accuracy of 99%, 60%, 75% on PHEME, SICK and ArNLI respectively. ",

Also with developing technologies, attacks numbers are growing exponentially every few months and become more sophisticated so that traditional IDS becomes inefficient detecting them. This paper proposes a solution to detect not only new threats with higher detection rate and lower false positive than already used IDS, but also it could detect collective and contextual security attacks. We achieve those results by using Networking Chatbot, a deep recurrent neural network: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) on top of Apache Spark Framework that has an input of flow traffic and traffic aggregation and the output is a language of two words, normal or abnormal. We propose merging the concepts of language processing, contextual analysis, distributed deep learning, big data, anomaly detection of flow analysis. We propose a model that describes the network abstract normal behavior from a sequence of millions of packets within their context and analyzes them in near real-time to detect point, collective and contextual anomalies. Experiments are done on MAWI dataset, and it shows better detection rate not only than signature IDS, but also better than traditional anomaly IDS. The experiment shows lower false positive, higher detection rate and better point anomalies detection. As for prove of contextual and collective anomalies detection, we discuss our claim and the reason behind our hypothesis. But the experiment is done on random small subsets of the dataset because of hardware limitations, so we share experiment and our future vision thoughts as we wish that full prove will be done in future by other interested researchers who have better hardware infrastructure than ours.

    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been an emerging solution for graph self-supervised learning. The core principle of GCL is to reduce the distance between samples in the positive view, but increase the distance between samples in the negative view. While achieving promising performances, current GCL methods still suffer from two limitations: (1) uncontrollable validity of augmentation, that graph perturbation may produce invalid views against semantics and feature-topology correspondence of graph data; and (2) unreliable binary contrastive justification, that the positiveness and negativeness of the constructed views are difficult to be determined for non-euclidean graph data. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a new contrastive learning paradigm for graphs, namely Graph Soft-Contrastive Learning (GSCL), that conducts contrastive learning in a finer-granularity via ranking neighborhoods without any augmentations and binary contrastive justification. GSCL is built upon the fundamental assumption of graph proximity that connected neighbors are more similar than far-distant nodes. Specifically, we develop pair-wise and list-wise Gated Ranking infoNCE Loss functions to preserve the relative ranking relationship in the neighborhood. Moreover, as the neighborhood size exponentially expands with more hops considered, we propose neighborhood sampling strategies to improve learning efficiency. The extensive experimental results show that our proposed GSCL can consistently achieve state-of-the-art performances on various public datasets with comparable practical complexity to GCL. ",

    "abstract": "Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been a hot research topic because of its ability to detect new threats rather than only memorized signatures threats of signature-based IDS. Especially after the availability of advanced technologies that increase the number of hacking tools and increase the risk impact of an attack. The problem of any anomaly-based model is its high false-positive rate. The high false-positive rate is the reason why anomaly IDS is not commonly applied in practice. Because anomaly-based models classify an unseen pattern as a threat where it may be normal but not included in the training dataset. This type of problem is called overfitting where the model is not able to generalize. Optimizing Anomaly-based models by having a big training dataset that includes all possible normal cases may be an optimal solution but could not be applied in practice. Although we can increase the number of training samples to include much more normal cases, still we need a model that has more ability to generalize. In this research paper, we propose applying deep model instead of traditional models because it has more ability to generalize. Thus, we will obtain less false-positive by using big data and deep model. We made a comparison between machine learning and deep learning algorithms in the optimization of anomaly-based IDS by decreasing the false-positive rate. We did an experiment on the NSL-KDD benchmark and compared our results with one of the best used classifiers in traditional learning in IDS optimization. The experiment shows 10% lower false-positive by using deep learning instead of traditional learning. ",

However, in contrast to conventional shape representations such as polygon meshes, the implicit representations cannot be easily edited and existing works that attempt to address this problem are extremely limited. In this work, we propose the first method for efficient interactive editing of signed distance functions expressed through neural networks, allowing free-form editing. Inspired by 3D sculpting software for meshes, we use a brush-based framework that is intuitive and can in the future be used by sculptors and digital artists. In order to localize the desired surface deformations, we regulate the network by using a copy of it to sample the previously expressed surface. We introduce a novel framework for simulating sculpting-style surface edits, in conjunction with interactive surface sampling and efficient adaptation of network weights. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate our method in various different 3D objects and under many different edits. The reported results clearly show that our method yields high accuracy, in terms of achieving the desired edits, while at the same time preserving the geometry outside the interaction areas. ",

    "abstract": "Incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) as side information in recommendation has recently attracted considerable attention. Despite the success in general recommendation scenarios, prior methods may fall short of performance satisfaction for the cold-start problem in which users are associated with very limited interactive information. Since the conventional methods rely on exploring the interaction topology, they may however fail to capture sufficient information in cold-start scenarios. To mitigate the problem, we propose a novel Knowledge-aware Neural Networks with Personalized Feature Referencing Mechanism, namely KPER. Different from most prior methods which simply enrich the targets' semantics from KGs, e.g., product attributes, KPER utilizes the KGs as a \"semantic bridge\" to extract feature references for cold-start users or items. Specifically, given cold-start targets, KPER first probes semantically relevant but not necessarily structurally close users or items as adaptive seeds for referencing features. Then a Gated Information Aggregation module is introduced to learn the combinatorial latent features for cold-start users and items. Our extensive experiments over four real-world datasets show that, KPER consistently outperforms all competing methods in cold-start scenarios, whilst maintaining superiority in general scenarios without compromising overall performance, e.g., by achieving 0.81%-16.08% and 1.01%-14.49% performance improvement across all datasets in Top-10 recommendation.

Research on poisoning attacks and defenses even predates the introduction of deep neural networks, leading to several promising solutions. Among them, ensemble-based defenses, where different models are trained on portions of the training set and their predictions are then aggregated, are getting significant attention, due to their relative simplicity and theoretical and practical guarantees. The work in this paper designs and implements a hash-based ensemble approach for ML robustness and evaluates its applicability and performance on random forests, a machine learning model proved to be more resistant to poisoning attempts on tabular datasets. An extensive experimental evaluation is carried out to evaluate the robustness of our approach against a variety of attacks, and compare it with a traditional monolithic model based on random forests.

The main advantage is that no manual modeling effort is required since a behavioral model is automatically inferred from a black-box system. However, several real-world applications of this technique show that the overhead for the establishment of an active interface might hamper the practical applicability. Our recent work on the active learning of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol found that the active interaction creates a bottleneck during learning. Considering the automata learning toolset, passive learning techniques appear as a promising solution since they do not require an active interface to the system under learning. Instead, models are learned based on a given data set. In this paper, we evaluate passive learning for two network protocols: BLE and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Our results show that passive techniques can correctly learn with less data than required by active learning. However, a general random data generation for passive learning is more expensive compared to the costs of active learning. ",

In this paper, we present a research preview regarding the validation of ADFs with respect to such requirements. We investigate the suitability of Traffic Sequence Charts (TSCs) for the formalization of such requirements and present a concept for monitoring system compliance during validation runs. We find TSCs, with their intuitive visual syntax over symbols from the traffic domain, to be a promising choice for the collaborative formalization of such requirements. For an example TSC, we describe the construction of a runtime monitor according to our novel concept that exploits the separation of spatial and temporal aspects in TSCs, and successfully apply the monitor on exemplary runs. The monitor continuously provides verdicts at runtime, which is particularly beneficial in ADF validation, where validation runs are expensive. The next open research questions concern the generalization of our monitor construction, the identification of the limits of TSC monitorability, and the investigation of the monitor's performance in practical applications. Perspectively, TSC runtime monitoring could provide a useful technique in other emerging application areas such as AI training, safeguarding ADFs during operation, and gathering meaningful traffic data in the field.

To that end, the task allocation problem is formalised in first-order logic and resolved using the Alloy model analyzer, and the task scheduling problem is encoded as a Markov decision process and resolved using the PRISM probabilistic model checker.

Thus, a determinant inequality is proposed to prove that the secrecy rate of a complex Gaussian signal with a fixed covariance matrix in a degraded complex WTC is maximized if and only if the signal is proper, i.e., the pseudo-covariance matrix is a zero matrix. Moreover, based on the result of the degraded complex WTC and the min-max reformulation of the secrecy capacity, the optimality of the proper signal in the general complex WTC is also revealed. The results of this research complement the current research on complex WTC.

The proposed method can achieve increased adversarial robustness on a primary dataset by leveraging auxiliary datasets via multi-domain learning. Specifically, data amplification on both robust and non-robust features can be accomplished through the application of BiaMAT as demonstrated through a theoretical and empirical analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate that while existing methods are vulnerable to negative transfer due to the distributional discrepancy between auxiliary and primary data, the proposed method enables neural networks to flexibly leverage diverse image datasets for adversarial training by successfully handling the domain discrepancy through the application of a confidence-based selection strategy.

Objectives: Proposing an ensemble classification framework for CPDP as many existing models are lacking with better performances and analysing the main objectives of CPDP from the outcomes of the proposed classification framework. Method: For the classification task, we propose a bootstrap aggregation based hybrid-inducer ensemble learning (HIEL) technique that uses probabilistic weighted majority voting (PWMV) strategy. To know the impact of HIEL on the software project, we propose three project-specific performance measures such as percent of perfect cleans (PPC), percent of non-perfect cleans (PNPC), and false omission rate (FOR) from the predictions to calculate the amount of saved cost, remaining service time, and percent of the failures in the target project. Results: On many target projects from PROMISE, NASA, and AEEEM repositories, the proposed model outperformed recent works such as TDS, TCA+, HYDRA, TPTL, and CODEP in terms of F-measure. In terms of AUC, the TCA+ and HYDRA models stand as strong competitors to the HIEL model. Conclusion: For better predictions, we recommend ensemble learning approaches for the CPDP models. And, to estimate the benefits from the CPDP models, we recommend the above project-specific performance measures. ",

    "title": "LL-GNN: Low Latency Graph Neural Networks on FPGAs for Particle  Detectors",
    "abstract": "This work proposes a novel reconfigurable architecture for low latency Graph Neural Network (GNN) design specifically for particle detectors. Accelerating GNNs for particle detectors is challenging since it requires sub-microsecond latency to deploy the networks for online event selection in the Level-1 triggers at the CERN Large Hadron Collider experiments. This paper proposes a custom code transformation with strength reduction for the matrix multiplication operations in the interaction-network based GNNs with fully connected graphs, which avoids the costly multiplication. It exploits sparsity patterns as well as binary adjacency matrices, and avoids irregular memory access, leading to a reduction in latency and improvement in hardware efficiency. In addition, we introduce an outer-product based matrix multiplication approach which is enhanced by the strength reduction for low latency design. Also, a fusion step is introduced to further reduce the design latency. Furthermore, an GNN-specific algorithm-hardware co-design approach is presented which not only finds a design with a much better latency but also finds a high accuracy design under a given latency constraint. Finally, a customizable template for this low latency GNN hardware architecture has been designed and open-sourced, which enables the generation of low-latency FPGA designs with efficient resource utilization using a high-level synthesis tool. Evaluation results show that our FPGA implementation is up to 24 times faster and consumes up to 45 times less power than a GPU implementation. Compared to our previous FPGA implementations, this work achieves 6.51 to 16.7 times lower latency. Moreover, the latency of our FPGA design is sufficiently low to enable deployment of GNNs in a sub-microsecond, real-time collider trigger system, enabling it to benefit from improved accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Neural implicit representations are drawing a lot of attention from the robotics community recently, as they are expressive, continuous and compact. However, city-scale incremental implicit dense mapping based on sparse LiDAR input is still an under-explored challenge. To this end,we successfully build the first city-scale incremental neural mapping system with a panoptic representation that consists of both environment-level and instance-level modelling. Given a stream of sparse LiDAR point cloud, it maintains a dynamic generative model that maps 3D coordinates to signed distance field (SDF) values. To address the difficulty of representing geometric information at different levels in city-scale space, we propose a tailored three-layer sampling strategy to dynamically sample the global, local and near-surface domains. Meanwhile, to realize high fidelity mapping, category-specific prior is introduced to better model the geometric details, leading to a panoptic representation. We evaluate on the public SemanticKITTI dataset and demonstrate the significance of the newly proposed three-layer sampling strategy and panoptic representation, using both quantitative and qualitative results.

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of neural networks (NNs) in safety-critical applications calls for methods to certify safe behavior. This paper presents a backward reachability approach for safety verification of neural feedback loops (NFLs), i.e., closed-loop systems with NN control policies. While recent works have focused on forward reachability as a strategy for safety certification of NFLs, backward reachability offers advantages over the forward strategy, particularly in obstacle avoidance scenarios. Prior works have developed techniques for backward reachability analysis for systems without NNs, but the presence of NNs in the feedback loop presents a unique set of problems due to the nonlinearities in their activation functions and because NN models are generally not invertible. To overcome these challenges, we use existing forward NN analysis tools to efficiently find an over-approximation of the backprojection (BP) set, i.e., the set of states for which the NN control policy will drive the system to a given target set. We present frameworks for calculating BP over-approximations for both linear and nonlinear systems with control policies represented by feedforward NNs and propose computationally efficient strategies. We use numerical results from a variety of models to showcase the proposed algorithms, including a demonstration of safety certification for a 6D system. ",

This paper develops a new Global Weighted TRPCA method (GWTRPCA), which is the first approach simultaneously considers the significance of intra-frontal slice and inter-frontal slice singular values in the Fourier domain. Exploiting this global information, GWTRPCA penalizes the larger singular values less and assigns smaller weights to them. Hence, our method can recover the low-tubal-rank components more exactly. Moreover, we propose an effective adaptive weight learning strategy by a Modified Cauchy Estimator (MCE) since the weight setting plays a crucial role in the success of GWTRPCA. To implement the GWTRPCA method, we devise an optimization algorithm using an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method.

The major challenge is to find a way to guarantee that sensitive personal information is not disclosed while data is published and analyzed. Centralized differential privacy is established on the assumption of a trusted third-party data curator. However, this assumption is not always true in reality. As a new privacy preservation model, local differential privacy has relatively strong privacy guarantees. Although federated learning has relatively been a privacy-preserving approach for distributed learning, it still introduces various privacy concerns. To avoid privacy threats and reduce communication costs, in this article, we propose integrating federated learning and local differential privacy with momentum gradient descent to improve the performance of machine learning models.

Unlike planarity testing, upward planarity testing is NP-hard except in restricted cases, such as when the graph has the single-source property (i.e. each connected component only has one source). In this paper, we present a dynamic algorithm for maintaining a combinatorial embedding $\\mathcal{E}(G)$ of a single-source upward planar graph subject to edge deletions, edge contractions, edge insertions upwards across a face, and single-source-preserving vertex splits through specified corners. We furthermore support changes to the embedding $\\mathcal{E}(G)$ on the form of subgraph flips that mirror or slide the placement of a subgraph that is connected to the rest of the graph via at most two vertices. All update operations are supported as long as the graph remains upward planar, and all queries are supported as long as the graph remains single-source. Updates that violate upward planarity are identified as such and rejected by our update algorithm. We dynamically maintain a linear-size data structure on $G$ which supports incidence queries between a vertex and a face, and upward-linkability of vertex pairs. If a pair of vertices are not upwards-linkable, we facilitate one-flip-linkable queries that point to a subgraph flip that makes them linkable, if any such flip exists. We support all updates and queries in $O(\\log^2 n)$ time. ",

However, malicious uses of such tools are possible and likely, posing a serious threat to our society. Hence, synthetic voice detection has become a pressing research topic, and a large variety of detection methods have been recently proposed. Unfortunately, they hardly generalize to synthetic audios generated by tools never seen in the training phase, which makes them unfit to face real-world scenarios. In this work, we aim at overcoming this issue by proposing a new detection approach that leverages only the biometric characteristics of the speaker, with no reference to specific manipulations. Since the detector is trained only on real data, generalization is automatically ensured. The proposed approach can be implemented based on off-the-shelf speaker verification tools. We test several such solutions on three popular test sets, obtaining good performance, high generalization ability, and high robustness to audio impairment. ",

Currently, most of the segmentation and extraction of weld map contours is achieved manually. Its efficiency is greatly reduced. Therefore, we propose a U-net-based contour segmentation and extraction method for welding engineering drawings. The contours of the parts required for engineering drawings can be automatically divided and blanked, which significantly improves manufacturing efficiency. U-net includes an encoder-decoder, which implements end-to-end mapping through semantic differences and spatial location feature information between the encoder and decoder. While U-net excels at segmenting medical images, our extensive experiments on the Welding Structural Diagram dataset show that the classic U-Net architecture falls short in segmenting welding engineering drawings. Therefore, we design a novel Channel Spatial Sequence Attention Module (CSSAM) and improve on the classic U-net. At the same time, vertical max pooling and average horizontal pooling are proposed. Pass the pooling operation through two equal convolutions into the CSSAM module. The output and the features before pooling are fused by semantic clustering, which replaces the traditional jump structure and effectively narrows the semantic gap between the encoder and the decoder, thereby improving the segmentation performance of welding engineering drawings. We use vgg16 as the backbone network. Compared with the classic U-net, our network has good performance in engineering drawing dataset segmentation. ",

Despite the preliminary understandings devoted on adversarially robust generalization, little is known from the architectural perspective. Thus, this paper tries to bridge the gap by systematically examining the most representative architectures (e.g., Vision Transformers and CNNs). In particular, we first comprehensively evaluated \\emph{20} adversarially trained architectures on ImageNette and CIFAR-10 datasets towards several adversaries (multiple $\\ell_p$-norm adversarial attacks), and found that Vision Transformers (e.g., PVT, CoAtNet) often yield better adversarially robust generalization. To further understand what architectural ingredients favor adversarially robust generalization, we delve into several key building blocks and revealed the fact via the lens of Rademacher complexity that the higher weight sparsity contributes significantly towards the better adversarially robust generalization of Vision Transformers, which can be often achieved by attention layers. Our extensive studies discovered the close relationship between architectural design and adversarially robust generalization, and instantiated several important insights. We hope our findings could help to better understand the mechanism towards designing robust deep learning architectures. ",

The CycleGAN network model of unpaired transfer learning is used to learn the feature mapping of real welding engineering drawings to realize automatic translation of engineering drawings. U-Net and PatchGAN are the main network for the generator and discriminator, respectively. Based on removing the identity mapping function, a high-dimensional sparse network is proposed to replace the traditional dense network for the Cyclegan generator to improve noise robustness.

The improved and fine-tuned network models are experimentally validated, computing the gap between real and generated data. It meets the welding engineering precision standard and solves the main problem of low drawing recognition efficiency in the welding manufacturing process. The results show. After training with our model, the PSNR, SSIM and MSE of welding engineering drawings reach about 44.89%, 99.58% and 2.11, respectively, which are superior to traditional networks in both training speed and accuracy.

    "abstract": "Most Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) predict the labels of unseen graphs by learning the correlation between the input graphs and labels. However, by presenting a graph classification investigation on the training graphs with severe bias, surprisingly, we discover that GNNs always tend to explore the spurious correlations to make decision, even if the causal correlation always exists. This implies that existing GNNs trained on such biased datasets will suffer from poor generalization capability. By analyzing this problem in a causal view, we find that disentangling and decorrelating the causal and bias latent variables from the biased graphs are both crucial for debiasing. Inspiring by this, we propose a general disentangled GNN framework to learn the causal substructure and bias substructure, respectively. Particularly, we design a parameterized edge mask generator to explicitly split the input graph into causal and bias subgraphs. Then two GNN modules supervised by causal/bias-aware loss functions respectively are trained to encode causal and bias subgraphs into their corresponding representations. With the disentangled representations, we synthesize the counterfactual unbiased training samples to further decorrelate causal and bias variables. Moreover, to better benchmark the severe bias problem, we construct three new graph datasets, which have controllable bias degrees and are easier to visualize and explain. Experimental results well demonstrate that our approach achieves superior generalization performance over existing baselines. Furthermore, owing to the learned edge mask, the proposed model has appealing interpretability and transferability. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/googlebaba/DisC. ",

    "abstract": "5G and beyond mobile networks will support heterogeneous use cases at an unprecedented scale, thus demanding automated control and optimization of network functionalities customized to the needs of individual users. Such fine-grained control of the Radio Access Network (RAN) is not possible with the current cellular architecture. To fill this gap, the Open RAN paradigm and its specification introduce an open architecture with abstractions that enable closed-loop control and provide data-driven, and intelligent optimization of the RAN at the user level. This is obtained through custom RAN control applications (i.e., xApps) deployed on near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (near-RT RIC) at the edge of the network. Despite these premises, as of today the research community lacks a sandbox to build data-driven xApps, and create large-scale datasets for effective AI training. In this paper, we address this by introducing ns-O-RAN, a software framework that integrates a real-world, production-grade near-RT RIC with a 3GPP-based simulated environment on ns-3, enabling the development of xApps and automated large-scale data collection and testing of Deep Reinforcement Learning-driven control policies for the optimization at the user-level. In addition, we propose the first user-specific O-RAN Traffic Steering (TS) intelligent handover framework. It uses Random Ensemble Mixture, combined with a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architecture, to optimally assign a serving base station to each user in the network. Our TS xApp, trained with more than 40 million data points collected by ns-O-RAN, runs on the near-RT RIC and controls its base stations. We evaluate the performance on a large-scale deployment, showing that the xApp-based handover improves throughput and spectral efficiency by an average of 50% over traditional handover heuristics, with less mobility overhead.

Inspired by this, we propose a new convolution operator named spatial pruned sparse convolution (SPS-Conv), which includes two variants, spatial pruned submanifold sparse convolution (SPSS-Conv) and spatial pruned regular sparse convolution (SPRS-Conv), both of which are based on the idea of dynamically determining crucial areas for redundancy reduction. We validate that the magnitude can serve as important cues to determine crucial areas which get rid of the extra computations of learning-based methods. The proposed modules can easily be incorporated into existing sparse 3D CNNs without extra architectural modifications.

Object detection models and semantic segmentation models were deployed to detect road rutting on the proposed dataset, and quantitative and qualitative analysis of model predictions were done to evaluate model performance and identify challenges faced in the detection of road rutting using the proposed method. Object detection model YOLOX-s achieves mAP@IoU=0.5 of 61.6% and semantic segmentation model PSPNet (Resnet-50) achieves IoU of 54.69 and accuracy of 72.67, thus providing a benchmark accuracy for similar work in future. The proposed road rutting dataset and the results of our research study will help accelerate the research on detection of road rutting using deep learning. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural network models are massively deployed on a wide variety of hardware platforms. This results in the appearance of new attack vectors that significantly extend the standard attack surface, extensively studied by the adversarial machine learning community. One of the first attack that aims at drastically dropping the performance of a model, by targeting its parameters (weights) stored in memory, is the Bit-Flip Attack (BFA). In this work, we point out several evaluation challenges related to the BFA. First of all, the lack of an adversary's budget in the standard threat model is problematic, especially when dealing with physical attacks. Moreover, since the BFA presents critical variability, we discuss the influence of some training parameters and the importance of the model architecture. This work is the first to present the impact of the BFA against fully-connected architectures that present different behaviors compared to convolutional neural networks. These results highlight the importance of defining robust and sound evaluation methodologies to properly evaluate the dangers of parameter-based attacks as well as measure the real level of robustness offered by a defense.

    "abstract": "Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have attracted lots of attention as they bring significant advantages in terms of power efficiency, parallelism, and computational speed compared with conventional deep neural networks (DNNs), which have intrinsic limitations when implemented on digital platforms. However, inversely mapping algorithm-trained physical model parameters onto real-world optical devices with discrete values is a non-trivial task as existing optical devices have non-unified discrete levels and non-monotonic properties. This work proposes a novel device-to-system hardware-software codesign framework, which enables efficient physics-aware training of DONNs w.r.t arbitrary experimental measured optical devices across layers. Specifically, Gumbel-Softmax is employed to enable differentiable discrete mapping from real-world device parameters into the forward function of DONNs, where the physical parameters in DONNs can be trained by simply minimizing the loss function of the ML task. The results have demonstrated that our proposed framework offers significant advantages over conventional quantization-based methods, especially with low-precision optical devices. Finally, the proposed algorithm is fully verified with physical experimental optical systems in low-precision settings. ",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, deep learning has dramatically changed the traditional hand-craft feature manner with strong feature learning capability, resulting in tremendous improvement of conventional tasks. However, deep neural networks have recently been demonstrated vulnerable to adversarial examples, a kind of malicious samples crafted by small elaborately designed noise, which mislead the DNNs to make the wrong decisions while remaining imperceptible to humans. Adversarial examples can be divided into digital adversarial attacks and physical adversarial attacks. The digital adversarial attack is mostly performed in lab environments, focusing on improving the performance of adversarial attack algorithms. In contrast, the physical adversarial attack focus on attacking the physical world deployed DNN systems, which is a more challenging task due to the complex physical environment (i.e., brightness, occlusion, and so on). Although the discrepancy between digital adversarial and physical adversarial examples is small, the physical adversarial examples have a specific design to overcome the effect of the complex physical environment. In this paper, we review the development of physical adversarial attacks in DNN-based computer vision tasks, including image recognition tasks, object detection tasks, and semantic segmentation. For the sake of completeness of the algorithm evolution, we will briefly introduce the works that do not involve the physical adversarial attack. We first present a categorization scheme to summarize the current physical adversarial attacks. Then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the existing physical adversarial attacks and focus on the technique used to maintain the adversarial when applied into physical environment. Finally, we point out the issues of the current physical adversarial attacks to be solved and provide promising research directions. ",

We propose a deep learning architecture to handle this set input. Experiments on benchmark graph classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms other persistent homology-based methods and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods using graph neural networks.

Prior studies in a similar setting rely on the neighborhood interpolation capability of multi-layer perceptions to complete missing regions caused by occlusion, which leads to artifacts in their predictions. We propose 360FusionNeRF, a semi-supervised learning framework where we introduce geometric supervision and semantic consistency to guide the progressive training process. Firstly, the input image is re-projected to $360^\\circ$ images, and auxiliary depth maps are extracted at other camera positions. The depth supervision, in addition to the NeRF color guidance, improves the geometry of the synthesized views. Additionally, we introduce a semantic consistency loss that encourages realistic renderings of novel views. We extract these semantic features using a pre-trained visual encoder such as CLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on hundreds of millions of diverse 2D photographs mined from the web with natural language supervision. Experiments indicate that our proposed method can produce plausible completions of unobserved regions while preserving the features of the scene. When trained across various scenes, 360FusionNeRF consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance when transferring to synthetic Structured3D dataset (PSNR~5%, SSIM~3% LPIPS~13%), real-world Matterport3D dataset (PSNR~3%, SSIM~3% LPIPS~9%) and Replica360 dataset (PSNR~8%, SSIM~2% LPIPS~18%).

We provide theoretical guarantees for reliable learning under the information-theoretic AEP, and for the generalization error with respect to the sample size.

We also propose a mathematical intuition for the RNN as an approximation of a sparse coding solver. We verify the applicability, robustness, and computational efficiency of the proposed approach with image deblurring and optical coherence tomography (OCT) speckle suppression. Our experimental results demonstrate significant potential for improving learning models' sample efficiency, generalization, and time complexity, that can therefore be leveraged for practical real-time applications.

Its automatic understanding can facilitate a more naturalistic human-device interaction and the humanisation of artificial intelligence. Current methods of humour detection are solely based on staged data making them inadequate for 'real-world' applications. We address this deficiency by introducing the novel Passau-Spontaneous Football Coach Humour (Passau-SFCH) dataset, comprising of about 11 hours of recordings. The Passau-SFCH dataset is annotated for the presence of humour and its dimensions (sentiment and direction) as proposed in Martin's Humor Style Questionnaire. We conduct a series of experiments, employing pretrained Transformers, convolutional neural networks, and expert-designed features. The performance of each modality (text, audio, video) for spontaneous humour recognition is analysed and their complementarity is investigated. Our findings suggest that for the automatic analysis of humour and its sentiment, facial expressions are most promising, while humour direction can be best modelled via text-based features. The results reveal considerable differences among various subjects, highlighting the individuality of humour usage and style. Further, we observe that a decision-level fusion yields the best recognition result. Finally, we make our code publicly available at https://www.github.com/EIHW/passau-sfch.

In response, many explainability methods make no use of counterfactual texts, assuming they will be unavailable. In this paper, we show that robust causal explainability methods can be created using approximate counterfactuals, which can be written by humans to approximate a specific counterfactual or simply sampled using metadata-guided heuristics. The core of our proposal is the Causal Proxy Model (CPM). A CPM explains a black-box model $\\mathcal{N}$ because it is trained to have the same actual input/output behavior as $\\mathcal{N}$ while creating neural representations that can be intervened upon to simulate the counterfactual input/output behavior of $\\mathcal{N}$. Furthermore, we show that the best CPM for $\\mathcal{N}$ performs comparably to $\\mathcal{N}$ in making factual predictions, which means that the CPM can simply replace $\\mathcal{N}$, leading to more explainable deployed models.

Our analysis tackles both regression and classification problems, characterizing when and how it is possible to construct uncertainty sets that correctly cover the unobserved noiseless ground truth labels. Through stylized theoretical examples and practical experiments, we argue that naive conformal prediction covers the noiseless ground truth label unless the noise distribution is adversarially designed. This leads us to believe that correcting for label noise is unnecessary except for pathological data distributions or noise sources. In such cases, we can also correct for noise of bounded size in the conformal prediction algorithm in order to ensure correct coverage of the ground truth labels without score or data regularity. ",

However, the models cannot solve problems related to the internal relationships between segments of electrode signals within a specific brain region. In this study, we propose a Pearson correlation-based graph attention network, called PearNet, as a solution to this problem.

Therefore, it is necessary to determine which of these imaging sequences are essential for accurate detection. In this study we aimed to find the optimal combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences for deep learning-based detection of enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS). To this end, we implemented an effective light-weight U-Net adapted for ePVS detection and comprehensively investigated different combinations of information from susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) MRI sequences. We conclude that T2w MRI is the most important for accurate ePVS detection, and the incorporation of SWI, FLAIR and T1w MRI in the deep neural network could make insignificant improvements in accuracy.

However, most existing DL methods utilize the block-by-block measurement and each measurement block is restored separately, which introduces harmful blocking effects for reconstruction. Furthermore, the neuronal receptive fields of those methods are designed to be the same size in each layer, which can only collect single-scale spatial information and has a negative impact on the reconstruction process. This paper proposes a novel framework named Multi-scale Dilated Convolution Neural Network (MsDCNN) for CS measurement and reconstruction. During the measurement period, we directly obtain all measurements from a trained measurement network, which employs fully convolutional structures and is jointly trained with the reconstruction network from the input image. It needn't be cut into blocks, which effectively avoids the block effect. During the reconstruction period, we propose the Multi-scale Feature Extraction (MFE) architecture to imitate the human visual system to capture multi-scale features from the same feature map, which enhances the image feature extraction ability of the framework and improves the performance of image reconstruction. In the MFE, there are multiple parallel convolution channels to obtain multi-scale feature information. Then the multi-scale features information is fused and the original image is reconstructed with high quality. Our experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM. ",

Deep Learning models, in particular, show promising results on image segmentation and classification problems, but they require very large datasets for training.

We extracted the learnt features and use them to generate synthetic features conditioned on class labels, using Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN). We test the quality of the generated features in a downstream classification task for brain tumors according to their severity level.

In GSAU, we integrate gate mechanism and spatial attention to remove the unnecessary linear layer and aggregate informative spatial context. To confirm the effectiveness of our designs, we evaluate MAN with multiple complexities by simply stacking different numbers of MLKA and GSAU.

Specifically, the encoder and bottleneck layer of the DEMUCS model are initialized using the self-supervised pretrained WavLM model, the convolution in the encoder is replaced by causal convolution, and the transformer encoder in the bottleneck layer is based on causal attention mask. In addition, as discretizing the noisy speech representations is more beneficial for denoising, we utilize a quantization module to discretize the representation output from the bottleneck layer, which is then fed into the decoder to reconstruct the clean speech waveform. Experimental results on the Valentini dataset and an internal dataset show that the pre-trained model based initialization can improve the SE performance and the discretization operation suppresses the noise component in the representations to some extent, which can further improve the performance.

    "title": "Data-driven soliton mappings for integrable fractional nonlinear wave  equations via deep learning with Fourier neural operator",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we firstly extend the Fourier neural operator (FNO) to discovery the soliton mapping between two function spaces, where one is the fractional-order index space $\\{\\epsilon|\\epsilon\\in (0, 1)\\}$ in the fractional integrable nonlinear wave equations while another denotes the solitonic solution function space. To be specific, the fractional nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger (fNLS), fractional Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV), fractional modified Korteweg-de Vries (fmKdV) and fractional sine-Gordon (fsineG) equations proposed recently are studied in this paper. We present the train and evaluate progress by recording the train and test loss. To illustrate the accuracies, the data-driven solitons are also compared to the exact solutions. Moreover, we consider the influences of several critical factors (e.g., activation functions containing Relu$(x)$, Sigmoid$(x)$, Swish$(x)$ and $x\\tanh(x)$, depths of fully connected layer) on the performance of the FNO algorithm. We also use a new activation function, namely, $x\\tanh(x)$, which is not used in the field of deep learning. The results obtained in this paper may be useful to further understand the neural networks in the fractional integrable nonlinear wave systems and the mappings between two spaces. ",
