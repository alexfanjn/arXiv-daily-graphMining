    "title": "Dual Representation Learning for One-Step Clustering of Multi-View Data",
    "abstract": "Multi-view data are commonly encountered in data mining applications. Effective extraction of information from multi-view data requires specific design of clustering methods to cater for data with multiple views, which is non-trivial and challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel one-step multi-view clustering method by exploiting the dual representation of both the common and specific information of different views. The motivation originates from the rationale that multi-view data contain not only the consistent knowledge between views but also the unique knowledge of each view. Meanwhile, to make the representation learning more specific to the clustering task, a one-step learning framework is proposed to integrate representation learning and clustering partition as a whole. With this framework, the representation learning and clustering partition mutually benefit each other, which effectively improve the clustering performance. Results from extensive experiments conducted on benchmark multi-view datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "In this research, an integrated detection model, Swin-transformer-YOLOv5 or Swin-T-YOLOv5, was proposed for real-time wine grape bunch detection to inherit the advantages from both YOLOv5 and Swin-transformer. The research was conducted on two different grape varieties of Chardonnay (always white berry skin) and Merlot (white or white-red mix berry skin when immature; red when matured) from July to September in 2019. To verify the superiority of Swin-T-YOLOv5, its performance was compared against several commonly used/competitive object detectors, including Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5. All models were assessed under different test conditions, including two different weather conditions (sunny and cloudy), two different berry maturity stages (immature and mature), and three different sunlight directions/intensities (morning, noon, and afternoon) for a comprehensive comparison. Additionally, the predicted number of grape bunches by Swin-T-YOLOv5 was further compared with ground truth values, including both in-field manual counting and manual labeling during the annotation process. Results showed that the proposed Swin-T-YOLOv5 outperformed all other studied models for grape bunch detection, with up to 97% of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 0.89 of F1-score when the weather was cloudy. This mAP was approximately 44%, 18%, 14%, and 4% greater than Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5, respectively. Swin-T-YOLOv5 achieved its lowest mAP (90%) and F1-score (0.82) when detecting immature berries, where the mAP was approximately 40%, 5%, 3%, and 1% greater than the same. Furthermore, Swin-T-YOLOv5 performed better on Chardonnay variety with achieved up to 0.91 of R2 and 2.36 root mean square error (RMSE) when comparing the predictions with ground truth. However, it underperformed on Merlot variety with achieved only up to 0.70 of R2 and 3.30 of RMSE. ",

    "title": "Reversible Data hiding in Encrypted Domain with Public Key Embedding  Mechanism",
    "abstract": "Considering the prospects of public key embedding (PKE) mechanism in active forensics on the integrity or identity of ciphertext for distributed deep learning security, two reversible data hiding in encrypted domain (RDH-ED) algorithms with PKE mechanism are proposed, in which all the elements of the embedding function shall be open to the public, while the extraction function could be performed only by legitimate users. The first algorithm is difference expansion in single bit encrypted domain (DE-SBED), which is optimized from the homomorphic embedding framework based on the bit operations of DE in spatial domain. DE-SBED is suitable for the ciphertext of images encrypted from any single bit encryption and learning with errors (LWE) encryption is selected in this paper. Pixel value ordering is introduced to reduce the distortion of decryption and improve the embedding rates (ER). To apply to more flexible applications, public key recoding on encryption redundancy (PKR-ER) algorithm is proposed. Public embedding key is constructed by recoding on the redundancy from the probabilistic decryption of LWE. It is suitable for any plaintext regardless of the type of medium or the content. By setting different quantization rules for recoding, decryption and extraction functions are separable. No distortion exists in the directly decrypted results of the marked ciphertext and ER could reach over 1.0 bits per bit of plaintext. Correctness and security of the algorithms are proved theoretically by deducing the probability distributions of ciphertext and quantization variable. Experimental results demonstrate the performances in correctness, one-way attribute of security and efficiency of the algorithms. ",

The baseline achieves moderate performance (macro-F1=54%), highlighting the difficulty of our data. GEMNET, which uses gazetteers, improvement significantly (average improvement of macro-F1=+30%). MultiCoNER poses challenges even for large pre-trained language models, and we believe that it can help further research in building robust NER systems.

Therefore, existing large-scale datasets are used for pre-training. However, conventional transfer learning and domain adaptation cannot bridge the domain gap when the target domain differs significantly from the source domain. We propose a data synthesis method that can solve the large domain gap problem. In this method, a part of the target image is pasted onto the source image, and the position of the pasted region is aligned by utilizing the information of the object bounding box. In addition, we introduce adversarial learning to discriminate whether the original or the pasted regions. The proposed method trains on a large number of source images and a few target domain images. The proposed method achieves higher accuracy than conventional methods in a very different domain problem setting, where RGB images are the source domain, and thermal infrared images are the target domain. Similarly, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in the cases of simulation images to real images. ",

The generalized Kronecker product splitting method and Kronecker product splitting method can be unified in the GADI-KP framework. Then, we use the framework to design an effective preconditioner of Krylov subspace methods for solving TDLS. The GADI-KP method is sensitive to the splitting parameters. Different from traditional theoretical estimate methods, we propose multitask kernel learning Gaussian process regression (GPR) method to predict the relative optimal splitting parameters. This method has solved the multi-parameter optimization in GADI framework and kernel selection in GPR method. Finally, we apply our approach to solve a two-dimensional diffusion equation, a two-dimensional convection-diffusion equation, and a differential Sylvester matrix equation. Numerical experiments illustrate that the GADI-KP framework and its preconditioning form have advantage over efficiency and superiority compared with the existing results. ",

In a social network composed of many agents, smartphones or computers, one requester releases her requirement for goods or tasks to suppliers, then suppliers who have entered the market are also encouraged to invite some other suppliers to join and all the suppliers in the network could compete for the business. The key problem for this networked auction is about how to incentivize each node who have entered the sell not only to truthfully use her full ability, but also to forward the task to her neighbours. Auctions conducting over social networks have attracted considerable interests in recent years. However, most of the existing works focus on classic forward auctions. Moreover, there is no existing valid networked auction considering multiple goods/tasks. This work is the first to explore procurement auction for both homogeneous and heterogeneous goods or tasks in social networks. From both theoretical proof and experimental simulation, we proved that the proposed mechanisms are proved to be individual-rational and incentive-compatible, also both the cost of the system and the requester could get decreased.

However, these methods can only be defined in some specific fields and the result turns out to be obvious bias, due to the problem of data source and data structure. The users' query intentions are often diverse as to the open domain knowledge, so we construct a topic-aware graph network for knowledge updating based on the user query log. Our methods can be summarized as follow: 1. Extract entities through the user's log and select them as seeds 2. Scrape the attributes of seed entities in the encyclopedia website, and self-supervised construct the entity attribute graph for each entity. 3. Use the entity attribute graph to train the GNN entity update model to determine whether the entity needs to be synchronized. 4.Use the encyclopedia knowledge to match and update the filtered entity with the entity in the knowledge base according to the minimum edit times algorithm.

Despite significant efforts have been made on this task, they are mostly carried out in view of graph-structured data.

Moreover, they all lack the integration of neighborhood information. To this end, we propose a novel model named Graph Neural Network with Motif-aware for tenuous subgraph finding (GNNM), a neighborhood aggregation based GNNs framework which can capture the latent relationship between nodes. Specially, we design a GNN module to project nodes into a low dimensional vector combining the higher-order correlation within nodes based on a motif-aware module. And then design greedy algorithms in vector space to obtain a tenuous subgraph whose size is greater than a specified constraint. Particularly, considering existing evaluation indicators cannot capture the latent friendship between nodes, we introduce a novel Potential Friend(PF) concept to measure the tenuity of a graph from a new perspective. Experimental results on the real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method GNNM outperforms existing algorithms in efficiency and subgraph quality. ",

The inverter controller can curtail the PV output of each user by clamping the reactive power. To illustrate the studied distributed control scheme that may be vulnerable due to the two-hop information communication pattern, we present a heuristic attack injecting false data during the information exchange.

Several studies, however, have shown that such endpoints often experience downtime, meaning that the data they maintain becomes inaccessible. While decentralized systems based on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology have previously shown to increase the availability of knowledge graphs, even when a large proportion of the nodes fail, processing queries in such a setup can be an expensive task since data necessary to answer a single query might be distributed over multiple nodes. In this paper, we therefore propose an approach to optimizing SPARQL queries over decentralized knowledge graphs, called Lothbrok. While there are potentially many aspects to consider when optimizing such queries, we focus on three aspects: cardinality estimation, locality awareness, and data fragmentation. We empirically show that Lothbrok is able to achieve significantly faster query processing performance compared to the state of the art when processing challenging queries as well as when the network is under high load.

    "abstract": "Road accidents have become the eight leading cause of death all over the world. Lots of these accidents are due to a driver's inattention or lack of focus, due to fatigue. Various factors cause driver's fatigue. This paper considers all the measureable data that manifest driver's fatigue, namely those manifested in the vehicle measureable data while driving as well as the driver's physical and physiological data. Each of the three main factors are further subdivided into smaller details. For example, the vehicle's data is composed of the values obtained from the steering wheel's angle, yaw angle, the position on the lane, and the speed and acceleration of the vehicle while moving. Ontological knowledge and rules for driver fatigue detection are to be integrated into an intelligent system so that on the first sign of dangerous level of fatigue is detected, a warning notification is sent to the driver. This work is intended to contribute to safe road driving. ",

In spite of this explicit biological motivation, P systems have not been extensively used in modelling real-world systems. To confirm this intuition, we establish a state of the art investigation comparing the use of P systems to that of Boolean networks in this line of research. We then propose to use P systems as a tool for setting up formal frameworks to reason about other formalisms, and we introduce Boolean P systems, specifically tailored for capturing sequential controllability of Boolean networks. We show how to tackle some technical challenges and prove that sequential controllability properly embeds in the framework of Boolean P systems. ",

    "abstract": "3D object detection from monocular image(s) is a challenging and long-standing problem of computer vision. To combine information from different perspectives without troublesome 2D instance tracking, recent methods tend to aggregate multiview feature by sampling regular 3D grid densely in space, which is inefficient. In this paper, we attempt to improve multi-view feature aggregation by proposing a learnable keypoints sampling method, which scatters pseudo surface points in 3D space, in order to keep data sparsity. The scattered points augmented by multi-view geometric constraints and visual features are then employed to infer objects location and shape in the scene. To make up the limitations of single frame and model multi-view geometry explicitly, we further propose a surface filter module for noise suppression. Experimental results show that our method achieves significantly better performance than previous works in terms of 3D detection (more than 0.1 AP improvement on some categories of ScanNet). The code will be publicly available. ",

However, mainstream 3D detectors, e.g., VoteNet and its variants, either abandon considerable local features during pooling operations or ignore many global features in the whole scene context. This paper explores new modules to simultaneously learn local-global features of scene point clouds that serve 3OD positively. To this end, we propose an effective 3OD network via simultaneous local-global feature learning (dubbed 3DLG-Detector). 3DLG-Detector has two key contributions. First, it develops a Dynamic Points Interaction (DPI) module that preserves effective local features during pooling. Besides, DPI is detachable and can be incorporated into existing 3OD networks to boost their performance. Second, it develops a Global Context Aggregation module to aggregate multi-scale features from different layers of the encoder to achieve scene context-awareness. Our method shows improvements over thirteen competitors in terms of detection accuracy and robustness on both the SUN RGB-D and ScanNet datasets. Source code will be available upon publication. ",

Controlling false alarms is crucial in many applications and is rarely guaranteed by online change-detection algorithms that can monitor multivariate datastreams without knowing the data distribution. Like many change-detection algorithms, QT-EWMA builds a model of the data distribution, in our case a QuantTree histogram, from a stationary training set. To monitor datastreams even when the training set is extremely small, we propose QT-EWMA-update, which incrementally updates the QuantTree histogram during monitoring, always keeping the ARL$_0$ under control. Our experiments, performed on synthetic and real-world datastreams, demonstrate that QT-EWMA and QT-EWMA-update control the ARL$_0$ and the false alarm rate better than state-of-the-art methods operating in similar conditions, achieving lower or comparable detection delays.

However, there are differences in the acoustic characteristics of the test set and the training set under different operating conditions of the same machine (domain shifts). It is challenging for the existing detection methods to learn the domain shifts features stably with low computation overhead. To address these problems, we propose a domain shift-oriented machine anomalous sound detection model based on self-supervised learning (TranSelf-DyGCN) in this paper. Firstly, we design a time-frequency domain feature modeling network to capture global and local spatial and time-domain features, thus improving the stability of machine anomalous sound detection stability under domain shifts. Then, we adopt a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (DyGCN) to model the inter-dependence relationship between domain shifts features, enabling the model to perceive domain shifts features efficiently. Finally, we use a Domain Adaptive Network (DAN) to compensate for the performance decrease caused by domain shifts, making the model adapt to anomalous sound better in the self-supervised environment. The performance of the suggested model is validated on DCASE 2020 task 2 and DCASE 2022 task 2. ",

Detecting such structures is vital for numerous MIR tasks such as musicological analysis, key detection, or music segmentation. However, automatic cadence detection remains challenging mainly because it involves a combination of high-level musical elements like harmony, voice leading, and rhythm. In this work, we present a graph representation of symbolic scores as an intermediate means to solve the cadence detection task. We approach cadence detection as an imbalanced node classification problem using a Graph Convolutional Network. We obtain results that are roughly on par with the state of the art, and we present a model capable of making predictions at multiple levels of granularity, from individual notes to beats, thanks to the fine-grained, note-by-note representation. Moreover, our experiments suggest that graph convolution can learn non-local features that assist in cadence detection, freeing us from the need of having to devise specialized features that encode non-local context. We argue that this general approach to modeling musical scores and classification tasks has a number of potential advantages, beyond the specific recognition task presented here. ",

Since many CER/F systems use symbolic automata to represent such patterns, we propose a family of such automata where the transition-enabling conditions are defined by Answer Set Programming (ASP) rules, and which, thanks to the strong connections of ASP to symbolic learning, are directly learnable from data. We present such a learning approach in ASP and an incremental version thereof that trades optimality for efficiency and is capable to scale to large datasets.

Most of the architectures include either encoders alone or encoders and decoders, i.e., autoencoders of various sorts, to transform multi-omics data into latent representations. One important parameter is the depth of integration: the point at which the latent representations are computed or merged, which can be either early, intermediate, or late. The literature on integration methods is growing steadily, however, close to nothing is known about the relative performance of these methods under fair experimental conditions and under consideration of different use cases. We developed a comparison framework that trains and optimizes multi-omics integration methods under equal conditions. We incorporated early integration and four recently published deep learning methods: MOLI, Super.FELT, OmiEmbed, and MOMA. Further, we devised a novel method, Omics Stacking, that combines the advantages of intermediate and late integration. Experiments were conducted on a public drug response data set with multiple omics data (somatic point mutations, somatic copy number profiles and gene expression profiles) that was obtained from cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and patient samples. Our experiments confirmed that early integration has the lowest predictive performance. Overall, architectures that integrate triplet loss achieved the best results. Statistical differences can, overall, rarely be observed, however, in terms of the average ranks of methods, Super.FELT is consistently performing best in a cross-validation setting and Omics Stacking best in an external test set setting.

To tackle these problems, we propose Deep Anomaly Detection and Search (DADS), which applies Reinforcement Learning (RL) to balance exploitation and exploration. During the training process, the agent searches for possible anomalies with hierarchically-structured datasets and uses the searched anomalies to enhance performance, which in essence draws lessons from the idea of ensemble learning. Experimentally, we compare DADS with several state-of-the-art methods in the settings of leveraging labeled known anomalies to detect both other known anomalies and unknown anomalies. Results show that DADS can efficiently and precisely search anomalies from unlabeled data and learn from them, thus achieving good performance. ",

However, recent studies have shown that these explanations may not be robust to changes in the underlying model (e.g., following retraining), which raises questions about their reliability in real-world applications. Existing attempts towards solving this problem are heuristic, and the robustness to model changes of the resulting CFXs is evaluated with only a small number of retrained models, failing to provide exhaustive guarantees. To remedy this, we propose the first notion to formally and deterministically assess the robustness (to model changes) of CFXs for neural networks, that we call {\\Delta}-robustness. We introduce an abstraction framework based on interval neural networks to verify the {\\Delta}-robustness of CFXs against a possibly infinite set of changes to the model parameters, i.e., weights and biases. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach in two distinct ways. First, we analyse the {\\Delta}-robustness of a number of CFX generation methods from the literature and show that they unanimously host significant deficiencies in this regard. Second, we demonstrate how embedding {\\Delta}-robustness within existing methods can provide CFXs which are provably robust. ",

It aims to encode high-dimensional features in the Hamming space with similarity preservation between instances. However, most existing methods learn hash functions in manifold-based approaches. Those methods capture the local geometric structures (i.e., pairwise relationships) of data, and lack satisfactory performance in dealing with real-world scenarios that produce similar features (e.g. color and shape) with different semantic information. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose an effective unsupervised method, namely Jointly Personalized Sparse Hashing (JPSH), for binary representation learning. To be specific, firstly, we propose a novel personalized hashing module, i.e., Personalized Sparse Hashing (PSH). Different personalized subspaces are constructed to reflect category-specific attributes for different clusters, adaptively mapping instances within the same cluster to the same Hamming space. In addition, we deploy sparse constraints for different personalized subspaces to select important features. We also collect the strengths of the other clusters to build the PSH module with avoiding over-fitting. Then, to simultaneously preserve semantic and pairwise similarities in our JPSH, we incorporate the PSH and manifold-based hash learning into the seamless formulation. As such, JPSH not only distinguishes the instances from different clusters, but also preserves local neighborhood structures within the cluster. Finally, an alternating optimization algorithm is adopted to iteratively capture analytical solutions of the JPSH model. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify that the JPSH outperforms several hashing algorithms on the similarity search task. ",

    "abstract": "The autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is a classical, and arguably one of the most studied approaches to model time series data. It has compelling theoretical properties and is widely used among practitioners. More recent deep learning approaches popularize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and, in particular, long short-term memory (LSTM) cells that have become one of the best performing and most common building blocks in neural time series modeling. While advantageous for time series data or sequences with long-term effects, complex RNN cells are not always a must and can sometimes even be inferior to simpler recurrent approaches. In this work, we introduce the ARMA cell, a simpler, modular, and effective approach for time series modeling in neural networks. This cell can be used in any neural network architecture where recurrent structures are present and naturally handles multivariate time series using vector autoregression. We also introduce the ConvARMA cell as a natural successor for spatially-correlated time series. Our experiments show that the proposed methodology is competitive with popular alternatives in terms of performance while being more robust and compelling due to its simplicity. ",

    "abstract": "Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become an emerging technology in healthcare that leverages a large amount of free-text data in electronic health records (EHRs) to improve patient care, support clinical decisions, and facilitate clinical and translational science research. Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many clinical NLP tasks. However, training deep learning models usually require large annotated datasets, which are normally not publicly available and can be time-consuming to build in clinical domains. Working with smaller annotated datasets is typical in clinical NLP and therefore, ensuring that deep learning models perform well is crucial for the models to be used in real-world applications. A widely adopted approach is fine-tuning existing Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), but these attempts fall short when the training dataset contains only a few annotated samples. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has recently been investigated to tackle this problem. Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has been widely utilized as an FSL approach in computer vision, but has not been studied well in NLP. Furthermore, the literature on its applications in clinical domains is scarce. In this paper, we propose two SNN-based FSL approaches for clinical NLP, including pre-trained SNN (PT-SNN) and SNN with second-order embeddings (SOE-SNN). We evaluated the proposed approaches on two clinical tasks, namely clinical text classification and clinical named entity recognition. We tested three few-shot settings including 4-shot, 8-shot, and 16-shot learning. Both clinical NLP tasks were benchmarked using three PLMs, including BERT, BioBERT, and BioClinicalBERT. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed SNN-based FSL approaches in both clinical NLP tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks in which an adversary aims to predict whether or not a particular sample was contained in the target model's training dataset. Existing attack methods have commonly exploited the output information (mostly, losses) solely from the given target model. As a result, in practical scenarios where both the member and non-member samples yield similarly small losses, these methods are naturally unable to differentiate between them. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a new attack method, called \\system, which can exploit the membership information from the whole training process of the target model for improving the attack performance. To mount the attack in the common black-box setting, we leverage knowledge distillation, and represent the membership information by the losses evaluated on a sequence of intermediate models at different distillation epochs, namely \\emph{distilled loss trajectory}, together with the loss from the given target model. Experimental results over different datasets and model architectures demonstrate the great advantage of our attack in terms of different metrics. For example, on CINIC-10, our attack achieves at least 6$\\times$ higher true-positive rate at a low false-positive rate of 0.1\\% than existing methods. Further analysis demonstrates the general effectiveness of our attack in more strict scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Processing large graphs with memory-limited GPU needs to resolve issues of host-GPU data transfer, which is a key performance bottleneck. Existing GPU-accelerated graph processing frameworks reduce the data transfers by managing the active subgraph transfer at runtime. Some frameworks adopt explicit transfer management approaches based on explicit memory copy with filter or compaction. In contrast, others adopt implicit transfer management approaches based on on-demand access with zero-copy or unified-memory. Having made intensive analysis, we find that as the active vertices evolve, the performance of the two approaches varies in different workloads. Due to heavy redundant data transfers, high CPU compaction overhead, or low bandwidth utilization, adopting a single approach often results in suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a hybrid transfer management approach to take the merits of both the two approaches at runtime, with an objective to achieve the shortest execution time in each iteration. Based on the hybrid approach, we present HytGraph, a GPU-accelerated graph processing framework, which is empowered by a set of effective task scheduling optimizations to improve the performance. Our experimental results on real-world and synthesized graphs demonstrate that HyTGraph achieves up to 10.27X speedup over existing GPU-accelerated graph processing systems including Grus, Subway, and EMOGI.

    "abstract": "Deep-learning-based device fingerprinting has recently been recognized as a key enabler for automated network access authentication. Its robustness to impersonation attacks due to the inherent difficulty of replicating physical features is what distinguishes it from conventional cryptographic solutions. Although device fingerprinting has shown promising performances, its sensitivity to changes in the network operating environment still poses a major limitation. This paper presents an experimental framework that aims to study and overcome the sensitivity of LoRa-enabled device fingerprinting to such changes. We first begin by describing RF datasets we collected using our LoRa-enabled wireless device testbed. We then propose a new fingerprinting technique that exploits out-of-band distortion information caused by hardware impairments to increase the fingerprinting accuracy. Finally, we experimentally study and analyze the sensitivity of LoRa RF fingerprinting to various network setting changes. Our results show that fingerprinting does relatively well when the learning models are trained and tested under the same settings. However, when trained and tested under different settings, these models exhibit moderate sensitivity to channel condition changes and severe sensitivity to protocol configuration and receiver hardware changes when IQ data is used as input. However, with FFT data is used as input, they perform poorly under any change. ",

Our contribution is twofold. First, by leveraging results from spectral and causality theories, we expose a novel probabilistic generative model, which allows to sample an MN-DAG according to user-specified priors concerning the time-dependence and multiscale properties of the causal graph. Second, we devise a Bayesian method for the estimation of MN-DAGs, by means of stochastic variational inference (SVI), called Multiscale Non-Stationary Causal Structure Learner (MN-CASTLE). In addition to direct observations, MN-CASTLE exploits information from the decomposition of the total power spectrum of time series over different time resolutions. In our experiments, we first use the proposed model to generate synthetic data according to a latent MN-DAG, showing that the data generated reproduces well-known features of time series in different domains. Then we compare our learning method MN-CASTLE against baseline models on synthetic data generated with different multiscale and non-stationary settings, confirming the good performance of MN-CASTLE. Finally, we show some insights derived from the application of MN-CASTLE to study the causal structure of 7 global equity markets during the Covid-19 pandemic. ",

T2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides superior visualization and characterization of MS lesions, relative to other MRI modalities.

In this study, we propose a novel modification to generative adversarial networks (GANs) to predict future lesion-specific FLAIR MRI for MS at fixed time intervals. We use supervised guided attention and dilated convolutions in the discriminator, which supports making an informed prediction of whether the generated images are real or not based on attention to the lesion area, which in turn has potential to help improve the generator to predict the lesion area of future examinations more accurately. We compared our method to several baselines and one state-of-art CF-SAGAN model [1]. In conclusion, our results indicate that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and reduces the standard deviation of the prediction errors in the lesion area compared with other models with similar overall performance.

It has been widely used as a auxiliary imaging reference to detect eye-related pathology and predict longitudinal progression of the disease characteristics.

However, these images are acquired from different devices, which have different intensity distribution, or in other words, belong to different imaging domains.

It avoids the time consumption of manual labelling for the upcoming new dataset and the re-training of the existing network.

We propose transfer learning as an effective strategy for utilizing small QCNNs in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era to the full extent. In the classical-to-quantum transfer learning framework, a QCNN can solve complex classification problems without requiring a large-scale quantum circuit by utilizing a pre-trained classical convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform numerical simulations of QCNN models with various sets of quantum convolution and pooling operations for MNIST data classification under transfer learning, in which a classical CNN is trained with Fashion-MNIST data.

Design: This retrospective study evaluated the performance of 11 clinicians for detecting lung cancer from chest radiographs, with and without assistance from a commercially available AI algorithm (red dot, Behold.ai) that predicts suspected lung cancer from CXRs. Clinician performance was evaluated against clinically confirmed diagnoses. Setting: The study analysed anonymised patient data from an NHS hospital; the dataset consisted of 400 chest radiographs from adult patients (18 years and above) who had a CXR performed in 2020, with corresponding clinical text reports. Participants: A panel of readers consisting of 11 clinicians (consultant radiologists, radiologist trainees and reporting radiographers) participated in this study. Main outcome measures: Overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision for detecting lung cancer on CXRs by clinicians, with and without AI input. Agreement rates between clinicians and performance standard deviation were also evaluated, with and without AI input. Results: The use of the AI algorithm by clinicians led to an improved overall performance for lung tumour detection, achieving an overall increase of 17.4% of lung cancers being identified on CXRs which would have otherwise been missed, an overall increase in detection of smaller tumours, a 24% and 13% increased detection of stage 1 and stage 2 lung cancers respectively, and standardisation of clinician performance. Conclusions: This study showed great promise in the clinical utility of AI algorithms in improving early lung cancer diagnosis and promoting health equity through overall improvement in reader performances, without impacting downstream imaging resources.

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a new paradigm for designing efficient deep unrolling networks using dimensionality reduction schemes, including minibatch gradient approximation and operator sketching. The deep unrolling networks are currently the state-of-the-art solutions for imaging inverse problems. However, for high-dimensional imaging tasks, especially X-ray CT and MRI imaging, the deep unrolling schemes typically become inefficient both in terms of memory and computation, due to the need of computing multiple times the high-dimensional forward and adjoint operators. Recently researchers have found that such limitations can be partially addressed by unrolling the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), inspired by the success of stochastic first-order optimization. In this work, we explore further this direction and propose first a more expressive and practical stochastic primal-dual unrolling, based on the state-of-the-art Learned Primal-Dual (LPD) network, and also a further acceleration upon stochastic primal-dual unrolling, using sketching techniques to approximate products in the high-dimensional image space. The operator sketching can be jointly applied with stochastic unrolling for the best acceleration and compression performance. Our numerical experiments on X-ray CT image reconstruction demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our accelerated unrolling schemes. ",

We show that the analogous minimization problem provides an upper bound for graphon entropy. We also give a lower bound in the shape of a maximization problem. The main result of the paper is that for most graphons these two bounds actually coincide and hence precisely determine the entropy in question.
