    "title": "Improving Robust Fairness via Balance Adversarial Training",
    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) methods are effective against adversarial attacks, yet they introduce severe disparity of accuracy and robustness between different classes, known as the robust fairness problem. Previously proposed Fair Robust Learning (FRL) adaptively reweights different classes to improve fairness. However, the performance of the better-performed classes decreases, leading to a strong performance drop. In this paper, we observed two unfair phenomena during adversarial training: different difficulties in generating adversarial examples from each class (source-class fairness) and disparate target class tendencies when generating adversarial examples (target-class fairness). From the observations, we propose Balance Adversarial Training (BAT) to address the robust fairness problem. Regarding source-class fairness, we adjust the attack strength and difficulties of each class to generate samples near the decision boundary for easier and fairer model learning; considering target-class fairness, by introducing a uniform distribution constraint, we encourage the adversarial example generation process for each class with a fair tendency. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNette) demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform other baselines in mitigating the robust fairness problem (+5-10\\% on the worst class accuracy) ",

    "abstract": "Several existing works study either adversarial or natural distributional robustness of deep neural networks separately. In practice, however, models need to enjoy both types of robustness to ensure reliability. In this work, we bridge this gap and show that in fact, explicit tradeoffs exist between adversarial and natural distributional robustness. We first consider a simple linear regression setting on Gaussian data with disjoint sets of core and spurious features. In this setting, through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that (i) adversarial training with $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norms increases the model reliance on spurious features; (ii) For $\\ell_\\infty$ adversarial training, spurious reliance only occurs when the scale of the spurious features is larger than that of the core features; (iii) adversarial training can have an unintended consequence in reducing distributional robustness, specifically when spurious correlations are changed in the new test domain. Next, we present extensive empirical evidence, using a test suite of twenty adversarially trained models evaluated on five benchmark datasets (ObjectNet, RIVAL10, Salient ImageNet-1M, ImageNet-9, Waterbirds), that adversarially trained classifiers rely on backgrounds more than their standardly trained counterparts, validating our theoretical results. We also show that spurious correlations in training data (when preserved in the test domain) can improve adversarial robustness, revealing that previous claims that adversarial vulnerability is rooted in spurious correlations are incomplete.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a neural network model to predict future human motion from an observed human motion history. We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model. ",

Most current calibration techniques address classification problems while focusing on improving calibration on in-domain predictions. Little to no attention is paid towards addressing calibration of visual object detectors which occupy similar space and importance in many decision making systems. In this paper, we study the calibration of current object detection models, particularly under domain shift. To this end, we first introduce a plug-and-play train-time calibration loss for object detection. It can be used as an auxiliary loss function to improve detector's calibration. Second, we devise a new uncertainty quantification mechanism for object detection which can implicitly calibrate the commonly used self-training based domain adaptive detectors. We include in our study both single-stage and two-stage object detectors. We demonstrate that our loss improves calibration for both in-domain and out-of-domain detections with notable margins. Finally, we show the utility of our techniques in calibrating the domain adaptive object detectors in diverse domain shift scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "In the last two decades we are witnessing a huge increase of valuable big data structured in the form of graphs or networks. To apply traditional machine learning and data analytic techniques to such data it is necessary to transform graphs into vector-based representations that preserve the most essential structural properties of graphs. For this purpose, a large number of graph embedding methods have been proposed in the literature. Most of them produce general-purpose embeddings suitable for a variety of applications such as node clustering, node classification, graph visualisation and link prediction. In this paper, we propose two novel graph embedding algorithms based on random walks that are specifically designed for the node classification problem. Random walk sampling strategies of the proposed algorithms have been designed to pay special attention to hubs -- high-degree nodes that have the most critical role for the overall connectedness in large-scale graphs. The proposed methods are experimentally evaluated by analyzing the classification performance of three classification algorithms trained on embeddings of real-world networks. The obtained results indicate that our methods considerably improve the predictive power of examined classifiers compared to currently the most popular random walk method for generating general-purpose graph embeddings (node2vec).

    "abstract": "In social networks, a node's position is a form of \\it{social capital}. Better-positioned members not only benefit from (faster) access to diverse information, but innately have more potential influence on information spread. Structural biases often arise from network formation, and can lead to significant disparities in information access based on position. Further, processes such as link recommendation can exacerbate this inequality by relying on network structure to augment connectivity. We argue that one can understand and quantify this social capital through the lens of information flow in the network. We consider the setting where all nodes may be sources of distinct information, and a node's (dis)advantage deems its ability to access all information available on the network. We introduce three new measures of advantage (broadcast, influence, and control), which are quantified in terms of position in the network using \\it{access signatures} -- vectors that represent a node's ability to share information. We then consider the problem of improving equity by making interventions to increase the access of the least-advantaged nodes. We argue that edge augmentation is most appropriate for mitigating bias in the network structure, and frame a budgeted intervention problem for maximizing minimum pairwise access. Finally, we propose heuristic strategies for selecting edge augmentations and empirically evaluate their performance on a corpus of real-world social networks. We demonstrate that a small number of interventions significantly increase the broadcast measure of access for the least-advantaged nodes (over 5 times more than random), and also improve the minimum influence. Additional analysis shows that these interventions can also dramatically shrink the gap in advantage between nodes (over \\%82) and reduce disparities between their access signatures. ",

We explore the construction of a cycle basis in an incremental manner while maximizing the sparsity. We validate an algorithm that constructs a sparse cycle basis incrementally and compare its performance with a minimum cycle basis. Additionally, we present an algorithm to approximate the minimum cycle basis of two graphs that are sparsely connected as is common in multi-agent scenarios. Lastly, the relative parameterization of pose graph optimization has been limited to using rigid body transforms on SE(2) or SE(3) as the constraints between poses.

Despite the ubiquitous adoption of production-scale deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, these general-purpose frameworks fall short of business demands in recommendation scenarios for various reasons: on one hand, tweaking systems based on static parameters and dense computations for recommendation with dynamic and sparse features is detrimental to model quality; on the other hand, such frameworks are designed with batch-training stage and serving stage completely separated, preventing the model from interacting with customer feedback in real-time. These issues led us to reexamine traditional approaches and explore radically different design choices. In this paper, we present Monolith, a system tailored for online training. Our design has been driven by observations of our application workloads and production environment that reflects a marked departure from other recommendations systems. Our contributions are manifold: first, we crafted a collisionless embedding table with optimizations such as expirable embeddings and frequency filtering to reduce its memory footprint; second, we provide an production-ready online training architecture with high fault-tolerance; finally, we proved that system reliability could be traded-off for real-time learning.

Many algorithms have been proposed to reduce overestimation, including several recent ensemble methods, however none have shown success in sample-efficient learning through addressing estimation variance as the root cause of overestimation. In this paper, we propose MeanQ, a simple ensemble method that estimates target values as ensemble means. Despite its simplicity, MeanQ shows remarkable sample efficiency in experiments on the Atari Learning Environment benchmark. Importantly, we find that an ensemble of size 5 sufficiently reduces estimation variance to obviate the lagging target network, eliminating it as a source of bias and further gaining sample efficiency. We justify intuitively and empirically the design choices in MeanQ, including the necessity of independent experience sampling. On a set of 26 benchmark Atari environments, MeanQ outperforms all tested baselines, including the best available baseline, SUNRISE, at 100K interaction steps in 16/26 environments, and by 68% on average. MeanQ also outperforms Rainbow DQN at 500K steps in 21/26 environments, and by 49% on average, and achieves average human-level performance using 200K ($\\pm$100K) interaction steps.

    "abstract": "Packaged fresh-cut lettuce is widely consumed as a major component of vegetable salad owing to its high nutrition, freshness, and convenience. However, enzymatic browning discoloration on lettuce cut edges significantly reduces product quality and shelf life. While there are many research and breeding efforts underway to minimize browning, the progress is hindered by the lack of a rapid and reliable methodology to evaluate browning. Current methods to identify and quantify browning are either too subjective, labor intensive, or inaccurate. In this paper, we report a deep learning model for lettuce browning prediction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first-of-its-kind on deep learning for lettuce browning prediction using a pretrained Siamese Quadratic Swin (SQ-Swin) transformer with several highlights. First, our model includes quadratic features in the transformer model which is more powerful to incorporate real-world representations than the linear transformer. Second, a multi-scale training strategy is proposed to augment the data and explore more of the inherent self-similarity of the lettuce images. Third, the proposed model uses a siamese architecture which learns the inter-relations among the limited training samples. Fourth, the model is pretrained on the ImageNet and then trained with the reptile meta-learning algorithm to learn higher-order gradients than a regular one. Experiment results on the fresh-cut lettuce datasets show that the proposed SQ-Swin outperforms the traditional methods and other deep learning-based backbones. ",

    "abstract": "Lying on the heart of intelligent decision-making systems, how policy is represented and optimized is a fundamental problem. The root challenge in this problem is the large scale and the high complexity of policy space, which exacerbates the difficulty of policy learning especially in real-world scenarios. Towards a desirable surrogate policy space, recently policy representation in a low-dimensional latent space has shown its potential in improving both the evaluation and optimization of policy. The key question involved in these studies is by what criterion we should abstract the policy space for desired compression and generalization. However, both the theory on policy abstraction and the methodology on policy representation learning are less studied in the literature. In this work, we make very first efforts to fill up the vacancy. First, we propose a unified policy abstraction theory, containing three types of policy abstraction associated to policy features at different levels. Then, we generalize them to three policy metrics that quantify the distance (i.e., similarity) of policies, for more convenient use in learning policy representation. Further, we propose a policy representation learning approach based on deep metric learning. For the empirical study, we investigate the efficacy of the proposed policy metrics and representations, in characterizing policy difference and conveying policy generalization respectively. Our experiments are conducted in both policy optimization and evaluation problems, containing trust-region policy optimization (TRPO), diversity-guided evolution strategy (DGES) and off-policy evaluation (OPE). Somewhat naturally, the experimental results indicate that there is no a universally optimal abstraction for all downstream learning problems; while the influence-irrelevance policy abstraction can be a generally preferred choice.

    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is prevalent to tackle the supervision shortage issue in graph learning tasks. Many recent GCL methods have been proposed with various manually designed augmentation techniques, aiming to implement challenging augmentations on the original graph to yield robust representation. Although many of them achieve remarkable performances, existing GCL methods still struggle to improve model robustness without risking losing task-relevant information because they ignore the fact the augmentation-induced latent factors could be highly entangled with the original graph, thus it is more difficult to discriminate the task-relevant information from irrelevant information. Consequently, the learned representation is either brittle or unilluminating. In light of this, we introduce the Adversarial Cross-View Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (ACDGCL), which follows the information bottleneck principle to learn minimal yet sufficient representations from graph data. To be specific, our proposed model elicits the augmentation-invariant and augmentation-dependent factors separately. Except for the conventional contrastive loss which guarantees the consistency and sufficiency of the representations across different contrastive views, we introduce a cross-view reconstruction mechanism to pursue the representation disentanglement. Besides, an adversarial view is added as the third view of contrastive loss to enhance model robustness. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-arts on graph classification task over multiple benchmark datasets. ",

We explore the procedure from the perspective of NFT social media communities and its impact on the NFT price moves with two experiments. We perform a Granger causality test on the number of tweets and the NFT price time series and find that the number of tweets has a positive impact on (Granger-causes) the price or reversely for more than half of the 19 top authentic NFT projects but seldom copycat projects. Besides, to investigate the price moves predictability using social media features, we conduct an experiment of predicting Markov normalized NFT price (representing the direction and magnitude of price moves) given social-media-extracted word features and interpret the feature importance to find insights into the NFT communities. Our results show that social media words as the predictors result in all 19 top projects having a testing accuracy above the random baseline.

    "abstract": "A few lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) models have been recently designed for remote sensing object detection (RSOD). However, most of them simply replace vanilla convolutions with stacked separable convolutions, which may not be efficient due to a lot of precision losses and may not be able to detect oriented bounding boxes (OBB). Also, the existing OBB detection methods are difficult to constrain the shape of objects predicted by CNNs accurately. In this paper, we propose an effective lightweight oriented object detector (LO-Det). Specifically, a channel separation-aggregation (CSA) structure is designed to simplify the complexity of stacked separable convolutions, and a dynamic receptive field (DRF) mechanism is developed to maintain high accuracy by customizing the convolution kernel and its perception range dynamically when reducing the network complexity. The CSA-DRF component optimizes efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Then, a diagonal support constraint head (DSC-Head) component is designed to detect OBBs and constrain their shapes more accurately and stably. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed LO-Det can run very fast even on embedded devices with the competitive accuracy of detecting oriented objects. ",

    "abstract": "Propose-Test-Release (PTR) is a differential privacy framework that works with local sensitivity of functions, instead of their global sensitivity. This framework is typically used for releasing robust statistics such as median or trimmed mean in a differentially private manner. While PTR is a common framework introduced over a decade ago, using it in applications such as robust SGD where we need many adaptive robust queries is challenging. This is mainly due to the lack of Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) analysis, an essential ingredient underlying the moments accountant approach for differentially private deep learning. In this work, we generalize the standard PTR and derive the first RDP bound for it when the target function has bounded global sensitivity. We show that our RDP bound for PTR yields tighter DP guarantees than the directly analyzed $(\\eps, \\delta)$-DP. We also derive the algorithm-specific privacy amplification bound of PTR under subsampling. We show that our bound is much tighter than the general upper bound and close to the lower bound. Our RDP bounds enable tighter privacy loss calculation for the composition of many adaptive runs of PTR. As an application of our analysis, we show that PTR and our theoretical results can be used to design differentially private variants for byzantine robust training algorithms that use robust statistics for gradients aggregation. We conduct experiments on the settings of label, feature, and gradient corruption across different datasets and architectures. We show that PTR-based private and robust training algorithm significantly improves the utility compared with the baseline. ",

    "abstract": "A seminal work of [Ahn-Guha-McGregor, PODS'12] showed that one can compute a cut sparsifier of an unweighted undirected graph by taking a near-linear number of linear measurements on the graph. Subsequent works also studied computing other graph sparsifiers using linear sketching, and obtained near-linear upper bounds for spectral sparsifiers [Kapralov-Lee-Musco-Musco-Sidford, FOCS'14] and first non-trivial upper bounds for spanners [Filtser-Kapralov-Nouri, SODA'21]. All these linear sketching algorithms, however, only work on unweighted graphs. In this paper, we initiate the study of weighted graph sparsification by linear sketching by investigating a natural class of linear sketches that we call incidence sketches, in which each measurement is a linear combination of the weights of edges incident on a single vertex. Our results are: 1. Weighted cut sparsification: We give an algorithm that computes a $(1 + \\epsilon)$-cut sparsifier using $\\tilde{O}(n \\epsilon^{-3})$ linear measurements, which is nearly optimal. 2. Weighted spectral sparsification: We give an algorithm that computes a $(1 + \\epsilon)$-spectral sparsifier using $\\tilde{O}(n^{6/5} \\epsilon^{-4})$ linear measurements. Complementing our algorithm, we then prove a superlinear lower bound of $\\Omega(n^{21/20-o(1)})$ measurements for computing some $O(1)$-spectral sparsifier using incidence sketches. 3. Weighted spanner computation: We focus on graphs whose largest/smallest edge weights differ by an $O(1)$ factor, and prove that, for incidence sketches, the upper bounds obtained by~[Filtser-Kapralov-Nouri, SODA'21] are optimal up to an $n^{o(1)}$ factor.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of autonomous vehicles, there witnesses a booming demand for high-definition maps (HD maps) that provide reliable and robust prior information of static surroundings in autonomous driving scenarios. As one of the main high-level elements in the HD map, the road lane centerline is critical for downstream tasks, such as prediction and planning. Manually annotating lane centerline HD maps by human annotators is labor-intensive, expensive and inefficient, severely restricting the wide application and fast deployment of autonomous driving systems. Previous works seldom explore the centerline HD map mapping problem due to the complicated topology and severe overlapping issues of road centerlines. In this paper, we propose a novel method named CenterLineDet to create the lane centerline HD map automatically. CenterLineDet is trained by imitation learning and can effectively detect the graph of lane centerlines by iterations with vehicle-mounted sensors. Due to the application of the DETR-like transformer network, CenterLineDet can handle complicated graph topology, such as lane intersections. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large publicly available dataset Nuscenes, and the superiority of CenterLineDet is well demonstrated by the comparison results.

    "abstract": "Adversarial Training (AT), which is commonly accepted as one of the most effective approaches defending against adversarial examples, can largely harm the standard performance, thus has limited usefulness on industrial-scale production and applications. Surprisingly, this phenomenon is totally opposite in Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, where AT can even benefit for generalization. We notice the merit of AT in NLP tasks could derive from the discrete and symbolic input space. For borrowing the advantage from NLP-style AT, we propose Discrete Adversarial Training (DAT). DAT leverages VQGAN to reform the image data to discrete text-like inputs, i.e. visual words. Then it minimizes the maximal risk on such discrete images with symbolic adversarial perturbations. We further give an explanation from the perspective of distribution to demonstrate the effectiveness of DAT. As a plug-and-play technique for enhancing the visual representation, DAT achieves significant improvement on multiple tasks including image classification, object detection and self-supervised learning. Especially, the model pre-trained with Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) and fine-tuned by our DAT without extra data can get 31.40 mCE on ImageNet-C and 32.77% top-1 accuracy on Stylized-ImageNet, building the new state-of-the-art.

The study on NTK has been devoted to typical neural network architectures, but is incomplete for neural networks with Hadamard products (NNs-Hp), e.g., StyleGAN and polynomial neural networks. In this work, we derive the finite-width NTK formulation for a special class of NNs-Hp, i.e., polynomial neural networks. We prove their equivalence to the kernel regression predictor with the associated NTK, which expands the application scope of NTK. Based on our results, we elucidate the separation of PNNs over standard neural networks with respect to extrapolation and spectral bias. Our two key insights are that when compared to standard neural networks, PNNs are able to fit more complicated functions in the extrapolation regime and admit a slower eigenvalue decay of the respective NTK. Besides, our theoretical results can be extended to other types of NNs-Hp, which expand the scope of our work. Our empirical results validate the separations in broader classes of NNs-Hp, which provide a good justification for a deeper understanding of neural architectures. ",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) trained on code completion have been shown to be capable of synthesizing simple Python programs from docstrings [1]. We find that these code-writing LLMs can be re-purposed to write robot policy code, given natural language commands. Specifically, policy code can express functions or feedback loops that process perception outputs (e.g.,from object detectors [2], [3]) and parameterize control primitive APIs. When provided as input several example language commands (formatted as comments) followed by corresponding policy code (via few-shot prompting), LLMs can take in new commands and autonomously re-compose API calls to generate new policy code respectively. By chaining classic logic structures and referencing third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Shapely) to perform arithmetic, LLMs used in this way can write robot policies that (i) exhibit spatial-geometric reasoning, (ii) generalize to new instructions, and (iii) prescribe precise values (e.g., velocities) to ambiguous descriptions (\"faster\") depending on context (i.e., behavioral commonsense). This paper presents code as policies: a robot-centric formalization of language model generated programs (LMPs) that can represent reactive policies (e.g., impedance controllers), as well as waypoint-based policies (vision-based pick and place, trajectory-based control), demonstrated across multiple real robot platforms. Central to our approach is prompting hierarchical code-gen (recursively defining undefined functions), which can write more complex code and also improves state-of-the-art to solve 39.8% of problems on the HumanEval [1] benchmark.

The capability of graph neural partial differential equations (PDEs) in addressing common hurdles of graph neural networks (GNNs), such as the problems of over-smoothing and bottlenecks, has been investigated but not their robustness to adversarial attacks. In this work, we explore the robustness properties of graph neural PDEs. We empirically demonstrate that graph neural PDEs are intrinsically more robust against topology perturbation as compared to other GNNs. We provide insights into this phenomenon by exploiting the stability of the heat semigroup under graph topology perturbations. We discuss various graph diffusion operators and relate them to existing graph neural PDEs. Furthermore, we propose a general graph neural PDE framework based on which a new class of robust GNNs can be defined.

First, we use contrastive learning from unlabeled still image data to obtain appearance-sensitive features. Then we switch to unlabeled video data and learn motion-sensitive features by reconstructing frames. In the second step, we propose a global correlation distillation loss to retain the appearance sensitivity learned in the first step, as well as a local correlation distillation loss in a pyramid structure to combat temporal discontinuity.

Specifically, we leverage a supervised contrastive loss to facilitate the alignment and uniformity of the hypersphere features extracted by the recognition model, and design a pair of centralizing losses with the dynamic prototype guidance to avoid these features deviating from their belonging category clusters. To provide the more challenging corrupted point clouds, we adversarially train a noise generator along with the recognition model from the scratch, instead of using gradient-based attack as the inner loop like previous adversarial training methods. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed PointCAT outperforms the baseline methods and dramatically boosts the robustness of different point cloud recognition models, under a variety of corruptions including isotropic point noises, the LiDAR simulated noises, random point dropping and adversarial perturbations.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that detectors based on deep models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, even in the black-box scenario where the attacker cannot access the model information. Most existing attack methods aim to minimize the true positive rate, which often shows poor attack performance, as another sub-optimal bounding box may be detected around the attacked bounding box to be the new true positive one. To settle this challenge, we propose to minimize the true positive rate and maximize the false positive rate, which can encourage more false positive objects to block the generation of new true positive bounding boxes. It is modeled as a multi-objective optimization (MOP) problem, of which the generic algorithm can search the Pareto-optimal. However, our task has more than two million decision variables, leading to low searching efficiency. Thus, we extend the standard Genetic Algorithm with Random Subset selection and Divide-and-Conquer, called GARSDC, which significantly improves the efficiency. Moreover, to alleviate the sensitivity to population quality in generic algorithms, we generate a gradient-prior initial population, utilizing the transferability between different detectors with similar backbones. Compared with the state-of-art attack methods, GARSDC decreases by an average 12.0 in the mAP and queries by about 1000 times in extensive experiments.

    "abstract": "Many data mining tasks rely on graphs to model relational structures among individuals (nodes). Since relational data are often sensitive, there is an urgent need to evaluate the privacy risks in graph data. One famous privacy attack against data analysis models is the model inversion attack, which aims to infer sensitive data in the training dataset and leads to great privacy concerns. Despite its success in grid-like domains, directly applying model inversion attacks on non-grid domains such as graph leads to poor attack performance. This is mainly due to the failure to consider the unique properties of graphs. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study on model inversion attacks against Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), one of the state-of-the-art graph analysis tools in this paper. Firstly, in the white-box setting where the attacker has full access to the target GNN model, we present GraphMI to infer the private training graph data. Specifically, in GraphMI, a projected gradient module is proposed to tackle the discreteness of graph edges and preserve the sparsity and smoothness of graph features; a graph auto-encoder module is used to efficiently exploit graph topology, node attributes, and target model parameters for edge inference; a random sampling module can finally sample discrete edges. Furthermore, in the hard-label black-box setting where the attacker can only query the GNN API and receive the classification results, we propose two methods based on gradient estimation and reinforcement learning (RL-GraphMI). Our experimental results show that such defenses are not sufficiently effective and call for more advanced defenses against privacy attacks. ",

In this paper, we propose Structure Prototype Guided Pooling (SPGP) that utilizes prior graph structures to overcome the limitation.

    "abstract": "False medical information on social media poses harm to people's health. While the need for biomedical fact-checking has been recognized in recent years, user-generated medical content has received comparably little attention. At the same time, models for other text genres might not be reusable, because the claims they have been trained with are substantially different. For instance, claims in the SciFact dataset are short and focused: \"Side effects associated with antidepressants increases risk of stroke\". In contrast, social media holds naturally-occurring claims, often embedded in additional context: \"`If you take antidepressants like SSRIs, you could be at risk of a condition called serotonin syndrome' Serotonin syndrome nearly killed me in 2010. Had symptoms of stroke and seizure.\" This showcases the mismatch between real-world medical claims and the input that existing fact-checking systems expect. To make user-generated content checkable by existing models, we propose to reformulate the social-media input in such a way that the resulting claim mimics the claim characteristics in established datasets. To accomplish this, our method condenses the claim with the help of relational entity information and either compiles the claim out of an entity-relation-entity triple or extracts the shortest phrase that contains these elements. We show that the reformulated input improves the performance of various fact-checking models as opposed to checking the tweet text in its entirety. ",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is the key to deploying models safely in the open world. For OOD detection, collecting sufficient in-distribution (ID) labeled data is usually more time-consuming and costly than unlabeled data. When ID labeled data is limited, the previous OOD detection methods are no longer superior due to their high dependence on the amount of ID labeled data. Based on limited ID labeled data and sufficient unlabeled data, we define a new setting called Weakly-Supervised Out-of-Distribution Detection (WSOOD). To solve the new problem, we propose an effective method called Topological Structure Learning (TSL). Firstly, TSL uses a contrastive learning method to build the initial topological structure space for ID and OOD data. Secondly, TSL mines effective topological connections in the initial topological space. Finally, based on limited ID labeled data and mined topological connections, TSL reconstructs the topological structure in a new topological space to increase the separability of ID and OOD instances. Extensive studies on several representative datasets show that TSL remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art, verifying the validity and robustness of our method in the new setting of WSOOD. ",

As the proliferation of consumer Internet-connected devices increases, including EV smart charging stations, their security against cyber-attacks and the protection of private data become a growing concern.

Security must balance with other desirable qualities such as interoperability, crypto-agility and energy efficiency. Evidence suggests a gap in the current awareness of cyber security in EV charging infrastructures.

Many of these problems admit natural $2$-approximation algorithms, often through various classic techniques, whereas it remains open whether approximation factors below $2$ can be achieved. One of the most basic examples thereof is the Weighted Connectivity Augmentation Problem (WCAP). In WCAP, one is given an undirected graph together with a set of additional weighted candidate edges, and the task is to find a cheapest set of candidate edges whose addition to the graph increases its edge-connectivity. We present a $(1.5+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for WCAP, showing for the first time that factors below $2$ are achievable. On a high level, we design a well-chosen local search algorithm, inspired by recent advances for Weighted Tree Augmentation. To measure progress, we consider a directed weakening of WCAP and show that it has highly structured planar solutions. Interpreting a solution of the original problem as one of this directed weakening allows us to describe local exchange steps in a clean and algorithmically amenable way. Leveraging these insights, we show that we can efficiently search for good exchange steps within a component class for link sets that is closely related to bounded treewidth subgraphs of circle graphs. Moreover, we prove that an optimum solution can be decomposed into smaller components, at least one of which leads to a good local search step as long as we did not yet achieve the claimed approximation guarantee.

    "abstract": "Log analysis is one of the main techniques engineers use to troubleshoot faults of large-scale software systems. During the past decades, many log analysis approaches have been proposed to detect system anomalies reflected by logs. They usually take log event counts or sequential log events as inputs and utilize machine learning algorithms including deep learning models to detect system anomalies. These anomalies are often identified as violations of quantitative relational patterns or sequential patterns of log events in log sequences. However, existing methods fail to leverage the spatial structural relationships among log events, resulting in potential false alarms and unstable performance. In this study, we propose a novel graph-based log anomaly detection method, LogGD, to effectively address the issue by transforming log sequences into graphs. We exploit the powerful capability of Graph Transformer Neural Network, which combines graph structure and node semantics for log-based anomaly detection. We evaluate the proposed method on four widely-used public log datasets. Experimental results show that LogGD can outperform state-of-the-art quantitative-based and sequence-based methods and achieve stable performance under different window size settings. The results confirm that LogGD is effective in log-based anomaly detection. ",

The calculation of robustness is based on evaluating the robustness of underlying predicates. However, the robustness of predicates is usually defined in a model-free way, i.e., without including the system dynamics. Moreover, it is often nontrivial to define the robustness of complicated predicates precisely. To address these issues, we propose a notion of model predictive robustness, which provides a more systematic way of evaluating robustness compared to previous approaches by considering model-based predictions. In particular, we use Gaussian process regression to learn the robustness based on precomputed predictions so that robustness values can be efficiently computed online. We evaluate our approach for the use case of autonomous driving with predicates used in formalized traffic rules on a recorded dataset, which highlights the advantage of our approach compared to traditional approaches in terms of expressiveness. By incorporating our robustness definitions into a trajectory planner, autonomous vehicles obey traffic rules more robustly than human drivers in the dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Numerous applications require robots to operate in environments shared with other agents such as humans or other robots. However, such shared scenes are typically subject to different kinds of long-term semantic scene changes. The ability to model and predict such changes is thus crucial for robot autonomy. In this work, we formalize the task of semantic scene variability estimation and identify three main varieties of semantic scene change: changes in the position of an object, its semantic state, or the composition of a scene as a whole. To represent this variability, we propose the Variable Scene Graph (VSG), which augments existing 3D Scene Graph (SG) representations with the variability attribute, representing the likelihood of discrete long-term change events. We present a novel method, DeltaVSG, to estimate the variability of VSGs in a supervised fashion. We evaluate our method on the 3RScan long-term dataset, showing notable improvements in this novel task over existing approaches. Our method DeltaVSG achieves a precision of 72.2% and recall of 66.8%, often mimicking human intuition about how indoor scenes change over time. We further show the utility of VSG predictions in the task of active robotic change detection, speeding up task completion by 62.4% compared to a scene-change-unaware planner.

While contrastive learning has yielded continuous advancements in sampling strategy and architecture design, it still remains two persistent defects: the interference of task-irrelevant information and sample inefficiency, which are related to the recurring existence of trivial constant solutions. From the perspective of dimensional analysis, we find out that the dimensional redundancy and dimensional confounder are the intrinsic issues behind the phenomena, and provide experimental evidence to support our viewpoint. We further propose a simple yet effective approach MetaMask, short for the dimensional Mask learned by Meta-learning, to learn representations against dimensional redundancy and confounder. MetaMask adopts the redundancy-reduction technique to tackle the dimensional redundancy issue and innovatively introduces a dimensional mask to reduce the gradient effects of specific dimensions containing the confounder, which is trained by employing a meta-learning paradigm with the objective of improving the performance of masked representations on a typical self-supervised task. We provide solid theoretical analyses to prove MetaMask can obtain tighter risk bounds for downstream classification compared to typical contrastive methods.

Accident-related videos are just a minor portion of the driving video big data, and the transient pre-accident processes are highly dynamic and complex. Besides, risky and non-risky traffic agents can be similar in their appearance. These make risky object localization in the driving video particularly challenging. To this end, this paper proposes an attention-guided multistream feature fusion network (AM-Net) to localize dangerous traffic agents from dashcam videos. Two Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks use object bounding box and optical flow features extracted from consecutive video frames to capture spatio-temporal cues for distinguishing dangerous traffic agents. An attention module coupled with the GRUs learns to attend to the traffic agents relevant to an accident. Fusing the two streams of features, AM-Net predicts the riskiness scores of traffic agents in the video. In supporting this study, the paper also introduces a benchmark dataset called Risky Object Localization (ROL). The dataset contains spatial, temporal, and categorical annotations with the accident, object, and scene-level attributes. The proposed AM-Net achieves a promising performance of 85.73% AUC on the ROL dataset. Meanwhile, the AM-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art for video anomaly detection by 6.3% AUC on the DoTA dataset. A thorough ablation study further reveals AM-Net's merits by evaluating the contributions of its different components. ",

When it comes to some critical fields such as biomedicine, where making wrong decisions can have severe consequences, interpreting the inner working mechanisms of GNNs before applying them is crucial. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic model-level explanation method for different GNNs that follow the message passing scheme, GNNInterpreter, to explain the high-level decision-making process of the GNN model. More specifically, with continuous relaxation of graphs and the reparameterization trick, GNNInterpreter learns a probabilistic generative graph distribution which produces the most representative graph for the target prediction in the eye of the GNN model. Compared with the only existing work, GNNInterpreter is more computationally efficient and more flexible in generating explanation graphs with different types of node features and edge features, without introducing another blackbox to explain the GNN and without requiring domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, the experimental studies conducted on four different datasets demonstrate that the explanation graph generated by GNNInterpreter can match the desired graph pattern when the model is ideal and reveal potential model pitfalls if there exist any.

    "title": "Malicious Source Code Detection Using Transformer",
    "abstract": "Open source code is considered a common practice in modern software development. However, reusing other code allows bad actors to access a wide developers' community, hence the products that rely on it. Those attacks are categorized as supply chain attacks. Recent years saw a growing number of supply chain attacks that leverage open source during software development, relaying the download and installation procedures, whether automatic or manual. Over the years, many approaches have been invented for detecting vulnerable packages. However, it is uncommon to detect malicious code within packages. Those detection approaches can be broadly categorized as analyzes that use (dynamic) and do not use (static) code execution. Here, we introduce Malicious Source code Detection using Transformers (MSDT) algorithm. MSDT is a novel static analysis based on a deep learning method that detects real-world code injection cases to source code packages. In this study, we used MSDT and a dataset with over 600,000 different functions to embed various functions and applied a clustering algorithm to the resulting vectors, detecting the malicious functions by detecting the outliers. We evaluated MSDT's performance by conducting extensive experiments and demonstrated that our algorithm is capable of detecting functions that were injected with malicious code with precision@k values of up to 0.909.

    "title": "CurveFormer: 3D Lane Detection by Curve Propagation with Curve Queries  and Attention",
    "abstract": "3D lane detection is an integral part of autonomous driving systems. Previous CNN and Transformer-based methods usually first generate a bird's-eye-view (BEV) feature map from the front view image, and then use a sub-network with BEV feature map as input to predict 3D lanes. Such approaches require an explicit view transformation between BEV and front view, which itself is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose CurveFormer, a single-stage Transformer-based method that directly calculates 3D lane parameters and can circumvent the difficult view transformation step. Specifically, we formulate 3D lane detection as a curve propagation problem by using curve queries. A 3D lane query is represented by a dynamic and ordered anchor point set. In this way, queries with curve representation in Transformer decoder iteratively refine the 3D lane detection results. Moreover, a curve cross-attention module is introduced to compute the similarities between curve queries and image features. Additionally, a context sampling module that can capture more relative image features of a curve query is provided to further boost the 3D lane detection performance. We evaluate our method for 3D lane detection on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation studies as well. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning allows AI systems to learn effective representations from large amounts of data using tasks that do not require costly labeling. Mode collapse, i.e., the model producing identical representations for all inputs, is a central problem to many self-supervised learning approaches, making self-supervised tasks, such as matching distorted variants of the inputs, ineffective. In this article, we argue that a straightforward application of information maximization among alternative latent representations of the same input naturally solves the collapse problem and achieves competitive empirical results. We propose a self-supervised learning method, CorInfoMax, that uses a second-order statistics-based mutual information measure that reflects the level of correlation among its arguments. Maximizing this correlative information measure between alternative representations of the same input serves two purposes: (1) it avoids the collapse problem by generating feature vectors with non-degenerate covariances; (2) it establishes relevance among alternative representations by increasing the linear dependence among them. An approximation of the proposed information maximization objective simplifies to a Euclidean distance-based objective function regularized by the log-determinant of the feature covariance matrix. The regularization term acts as a natural barrier against feature space degeneracy. Consequently, beyond avoiding complete output collapse to a single point, the proposed approach also prevents dimensional collapse by encouraging the spread of information across the whole feature space. Numerical experiments demonstrate that CorInfoMax achieves better or competitive performance results relative to the state-of-the-art SSL approaches. ",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of deep learning techniques, the generation and counterfeiting of multimedia material are becoming increasingly straightforward to perform. At the same time, sharing fake content on the web has become so simple that malicious users can create unpleasant situations with minimal effort. Also, forged media are getting more and more complex, with manipulated videos that are taking the scene over still images. The multimedia forensic community has addressed the possible threats that this situation could imply by developing detectors that verify the authenticity of multimedia objects. However, the vast majority of these tools only analyze one modality at a time. This was not a problem as long as still images were considered the most widely edited media, but now, since manipulated videos are becoming customary, performing monomodal analyses could be reductive. Nonetheless, there is a lack in the literature regarding multimodal detectors, mainly due to the scarsity of datasets containing forged multimodal data to train and test the designed algorithms. In this paper we focus on the generation of an audio-visual deepfake dataset. First, we present a general pipeline for synthesizing speech deepfake content from a given real or fake video, facilitating the creation of counterfeit multimodal material. The proposed method uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Dynamic Time Warping techniques to achieve realistic speech tracks. Then, we use the pipeline to generate and release TIMIT-TTS, a synthetic speech dataset containing the most cutting-edge methods in the TTS field. This can be used as a standalone audio dataset, or combined with other state-of-the-art sets to perform multimodal research. Finally, we present numerous experiments to benchmark the proposed dataset in both mono and multimodal conditions, showing the need for multimodal forensic detectors and more suitable data. ",

We report qualitative results via embedding visualization and quantitative results in terms of downstream node classification and network reconstruction performances.

    "abstract": "Vehicular communication is an essential part of a smart city. Scalability is a major issue for vehicular communication, specially, when the number of vehicles increases at any given point. Vehicles also suffer some other problems such as broadcast problem. Clustering can solve the issues of vehicular ad hoc network (VANET); however, due to the high mobility of the vehicles, clustering in VANET suffers stability issue. Previously proposed clustering algorithms for VANET are optimized for either straight road or for intersection. Moreover, the absence of the intelligent use of a combination of the mobility parameters, such as direction, movement, position, velocity, degree of vehicle, movement at the intersection etc., results in cluster stability issues. A dynamic clustering algorithm considering the efficient use of all the mobility parameters can solve the stability problem in VANET. To achieve higher stability for VANET, a novel robust and dynamic clustering algorithm stable dynamic predictive clustering (SDPC) for VANET is proposed in this paper. In contrast to previous studies, vehicle relative velocity, vehicle position, vehicle distance, transmission range, and vehicle density are considered in the creation of a cluster, whereas relative distance, movement at the intersection, degree of vehicles are considered to select the cluster head. From the mobility parameters the future road scenario is constructed. The cluster is created, and the cluster head is selected based on the future construction of the road. The performance of SDPC is compared in terms of the average cluster head change rate, the average cluster head duration, the average cluster member duration, and the ratio of clustering overhead in terms of total packet transmission. The simulation result shows SDPC outperforms the existing algorithms and achieved better clustering stability. ",

In this paper, we deal with an analogous problem in optical diffraction tomography. Based on the Fourier diffraction theorem, we show that rigid motions, i.e., a map composed of rotations and translations, can be determined by detecting common circles in the Fourier-transformed data. We introduce two methods based on the idea of identifying common circles to reconstruct the object motion: While the first one is motivated by the common line approach for projection images and detects the relative orientation by the shape of the common circles in the two images, the second one assumes a smooth motion over time and calculates the angular velocity of the rotational motion from an infinitesimal version of the common circle method. Interestingly, using the stereographic projection, both methods can be reformulated as common line methods, but these lines are, in contrast to those used in cryo-EM, not confined to pass through the origin and allow for a full reconstruction of the relative orientation. Numerical proof-of-the-concept examples demonstrate the performance of our reconstruction methods. ",

To circumvent these resource (compute and memory) intensive algorithms, we present ViWiD, which integrates WiFi and Visual sensors in a dual-layered system. This dual-layered approach separates the tasks of local and global trajectory estimation making ViWiD resource efficient while achieving on-par or better performance to state-of-the-art Visual SLAM. We demonstrate ViWiD's performance on four datasets, covering over 1500 m of traversed path and show 4.3x and 4x reduction in compute and memory consumption respectively compared to state-of-the-art Visual and Lidar SLAM systems with on par SLAM performance.

An important step of such pathway is the degradation of the vaccine into smaller peptides by the proteasome, some of which are going to be presented to T cells by the MHC complex. While predicting MHC-peptide presentation has received a lot of attention recently, proteasomal cleavage prediction remains a relatively unexplored area in light of recent advances in high-throughput mass spectrometry-based MHC ligandomics. Moreover, as such experimental techniques do not allow to identify regions that cannot be cleaved, the latest predictors generate synthetic negative samples and treat them as true negatives when training, even though some of them could actually be positives. In this work, we thus present a new predictor trained with an expanded dataset and the solid theoretical underpinning of positive-unlabeled learning, achieving a new state-of-the-art in proteasomal cleavage prediction. The improved predictive capabilities will in turn enable more precise vaccine development improving the efficacy of epitope-based vaccines.

Most of the objects have never received a spectroscopic follow-up, which is especially crucial for transients e.g. supernovae. In such cases, observed light curves could present an affordable alternative. Time series are actively used for photometric classification and characterization, such as peak and luminosity decline estimation. However, the collected time series are multidimensional, irregularly sampled, contain outliers, and do not have well-defined systematic uncertainties. Machine learning methods help extract useful information from available data in the most efficient way. We consider several light curve approximation methods based on neural networks: Multilayer Perceptrons, Bayesian Neural Networks, and Normalizing Flows, to approximate observations of a single light curve. Tests using both the simulated PLAsTiCC and real Zwicky Transient Facility data samples demonstrate that even few observations are enough to fit networks and achieve better approximation quality than other state-of-the-art methods. We show that the methods described in this work have better computational complexity and work faster than Gaussian Processes. We analyze the performance of the approximation techniques aiming to fill the gaps in the observations of the light curves, and show that the use of appropriate technique increases the accuracy of peak finding and supernova classification. In addition, the study results are organized in a Fulu Python library available on GitHub, which can be easily used by the community. ",

We apply our approach to the computationally efficient ESM CM2Mc-LPJmL. Our method outperforms existing ones in correcting local distributions, and leads to strongly improved spatial patterns especially regarding the intermittency of daily precipitation. Notably, a double-peaked Intertropical Convergence Zone, a common problem in ESMs, is removed. Enforcing a physical constraint to preserve global precipitation sums, the GAN can generalize to future climate scenarios unseen during training. Feature attribution shows that the GAN identifies regions where the ESM exhibits strong biases. Our method constitutes a general framework for correcting ESM variables and enables realistic simulations at a fraction of the computational costs. ",

Prior work has demonstrated that deep learning models that take advantage of the data's 3D structure can outperform standard machine learning on several learning tasks. However, most prior research in this area has focused on neuroimaging data from adults. Within the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a large longitudinal development study, we examine structural MRI data to predict gender and identify gender-related changes in brain structure. Results demonstrate that gender prediction accuracy is exceptionally high (>97%) with training epochs >200 and that this accuracy increases with age. Brain regions identified as the most discriminative in the task under study include predominantly frontal areas and the temporal lobe. When evaluating gender predictive changes specific to a two-year increase in age, a broader set of visual, cingulate, and insular regions are revealed. Our findings show a robust gender-related structural brain change pattern, even over a small age range. This suggests that it might be possible to study how the brain changes during adolescence by looking at how these changes are related to different behavioral and environmental factors. ",

In PET/CT image assessment, automatic tumor segmentation is an important step, and in recent years, deep learning based methods have become the state-of-the-art. Unfortunately, existing methods tend to over-segment the tumor regions and include regions such as the normal high uptake organs, inflammation, and other infections. In this study, we introduce a false positive reduction network to overcome this limitation. We firstly introduced a self-supervised pre-trained global segmentation module to coarsely delineate the candidate tumor regions using a self-supervised pre-trained encoder. The candidate tumor regions were then refined by removing false positives via a local refinement module. Our experiments with the MICCAI 2022 Automated Lesion Segmentation in Whole-Body FDG-PET/CT (AutoPET) challenge dataset showed that our method achieved a dice score of 0.9324 with the preliminary testing data and was ranked 1st place in dice on the leaderboard.

DAGs are the common model to capture causal relationships between data and our framework is causal in that shift, convolution, and Fourier transform are computed only from predecessors in the DAG. The Fourier transform requires the transitive closure of the DAG for which several forms are possible depending on the interpretation of the edge weights. Examples include level of influence, distance, or pollution distribution. Our framework is different from prior GSP: it is specific to DAGs and leverages, and extends, the classical theory of Moebius inversion from combinatorics. For a prototypical application we consider DAGs modeling dynamic networks in which edges change over time. Specifically, we model the spread of an infection on such a DAG obtained from real-world contact tracing data and learn the infection signal from samples assuming sparsity in the Fourier domain. ",

    "abstract": "The Gaussian kernel and its traditional normalizations (e.g., row-stochastic) are popular approaches for assessing similarities between data points, commonly used for manifold learning and clustering, as well as supervised and semi-supervised learning on graphs. In many practical situations, the data can be corrupted by noise that prohibits traditional affinity matrices from correctly assessing similarities, especially if the noise magnitudes vary considerably across the data, e.g., under heteroskedasticity or outliers. An alternative approach that provides a more stable behavior under noise is the doubly stochastic normalization of the Gaussian kernel. In this work, we investigate this normalization in a setting where points are sampled from an unknown density on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional space and corrupted by possibly strong, non-identically distributed, sub-Gaussian noise. We establish the pointwise concentration of the doubly stochastic affinity matrix and its scaling factors around certain population forms. We then utilize these results to develop several tools for robust inference. First, we derive a robust density estimator that can substantially outperform the standard kernel density estimator under high-dimensional noise. Second, we provide estimators for the pointwise noise magnitudes, the pointwise signal magnitudes, and the pairwise Euclidean distances between clean data points. Lastly, we derive robust graph Laplacian normalizations that approximate popular manifold Laplacians, including the Laplace Beltrami operator, showing that the local geometry of the manifold can be recovered under high-dimensional noise. We exemplify our results in simulations and on real single-cell RNA-sequencing data. In the latter, we show that our proposed normalizations are robust to technical variability associated with different cell types. ",

    "abstract": "The quality of generalized linear models (GLMs), frequently used by insurance companies, depends on the choice of interacting variables. The search for interactions is time-consuming, especially for data sets with a large number of variables, depends much on expert judgement of actuaries, and often relies on visual performance indicators. Therefore, we present an approach to automating the process of finding interactions that should be added to GLMs to improve their predictive power. Our approach relies on neural networks and a model-specific interaction detection method, which is computationally faster than the traditionally used methods like Friedman H-Statistic or SHAP values. In numerical studies, we provide the results of our approach on different data sets: open-source data, artificial data, and proprietary data. ",
