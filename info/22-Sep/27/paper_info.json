    "abstract": "3D flash LIDAR is an alternative to the traditional scanning LIDAR systems, promising precise depth imaging in a compact form factor, and free of moving parts, for applications such as self-driving cars, robotics and augmented reality (AR). Typically implemented using single-photon, direct time-of-flight (dToF) receivers in image sensor format, the operation of the devices can be hindered by the large number of photon events needing to be processed and compressed in outdoor scenarios, limiting frame rates and scalability to larger arrays. We here present a 64x32 pixel (256x128 SPAD) dToF imager that overcomes these limitations by using pixels with embedded histogramming, which lock onto and track the return signal. This reduces the size of output data frames considerably, enabling maximum frame rates in the 10 kFPS range or 100 kFPS for direct depth readings. The sensor offers selective readout of pixels detecting surfaces, or those sensing motion, leading to reduced power consumption and off-chip processing requirements. We demonstrate the application of the sensor in mid-range LIDAR. ",

Third, we describe a novel technique for pruning unnecessary stochastic layers during the search. The optimized models resulting from the search are called PruNet and establishes a new state-of-the-art Pareto frontier for NVIDIA V100 in terms of inference latency for ImageNet Top-1 image classification accuracy.

    "abstract": "In this paper, new methods are considered to detect knee joint areas in bilateral PA fixed flexion knee X-ray images. The methods are of template matching type where the distance criterion is based on the negative normalized cross-correlation. The manual annotations are made on only one side of a single bilateral image when the templates are selected. The best matching patch search is formulated as an unconstrained continuous domain minimization problem. For the minimization problem different optimization methods are considered. The main method of the paper is a trainable optimizer where the method is taught to take zoomed and possibly rotated patches from its input images which look like the template. In the experiments, we compare the minimum values found by different optimization methods. We also look at some test images to examine the correspondence between the minimum value and how well the knee area is localized. It seems that making annotations only to a single image enables to detect knee joint areas quite precisely. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years Landmark Complexes have been successfully employed for localization-free and metric-free autonomous exploration using a group of sensing-limited and communication-limited robots in a GPS-denied environment. To ensure rapid and complete exploration, existing works make assumptions on the density and distribution of landmarks in the environment. These assumptions may be overly restrictive, especially in hazardous environments where landmarks may be destroyed or completely missing. In this paper, we first propose a deep reinforcement learning framework for multi-agent cooperative exploration in environments with sparse landmarks while reducing client-server communication. By leveraging recent development on partial observability and credit assignment, our framework can train the exploration policy efficiently for multi-robot systems. The policy receives individual rewards from actions based on a proximity sensor with limited range and resolution, which is combined with group rewards to encourage collaborative exploration and construction of the Landmark Complex through observation of 0-, 1- and 2-dimensional simplices. In addition, we employ a three-stage curriculum learning strategy to mitigate the reward sparsity by gradually adding random obstacles and destroying random landmarks. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art landmark complex exploration method in efficiency among different environments with sparse landmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks require specific layers to process point clouds, as the scattered and irregular location of points prevents us from using convolutional filters. Here we introduce the composite layer, a new convolutional operator for point clouds. The peculiarity of our composite layer is that it extracts and compresses the spatial information from the position of points before combining it with their feature vectors. Compared to well-known point-convolutional layers such as those of ConvPoint and KPConv, our composite layer provides additional regularization and guarantees greater flexibility in terms of design and number of parameters. To demonstrate the design flexibility, we also define an aggregate composite layer that combines spatial information and features in a nonlinear manner, and we use these layers to implement a convolutional and an aggregate CompositeNet. We train our CompositeNets to perform classification and, most remarkably, unsupervised anomaly detection. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that, in both tasks, our CompositeNets outperform ConvPoint and achieve similar results as KPConv despite having a much simpler architecture. Moreover, our CompositeNets substantially outperform existing solutions for anomaly detection on point clouds. ",

    "abstract": "We consider representation learning on periodic graphs encoding crystal materials. Different from regular graphs, periodic graphs consist of a minimum unit cell repeating itself on a regular lattice in 3D space. How to effectively encode these periodic structures poses unique challenges not present in regular graph representation learning. In addition to being E(3) invariant, periodic graph representations need to be periodic invariant. That is, the learned representations should be invariant to shifts of cell boundaries as they are artificially imposed. Furthermore, the periodic repeating patterns need to be captured explicitly as lattices of different sizes and orientations may correspond to different materials. In this work, we propose a transformer architecture, known as Matformer, for periodic graph representation learning. Our Matformer is designed to be invariant to periodicity and can capture repeating patterns explicitly. In particular, Matformer encodes periodic patterns by efficient use of geometric distances between the same atoms in neighboring cells. Experimental results on multiple common benchmark datasets show that our Matformer outperforms baseline methods consistently. In addition, our results demonstrate the importance of periodic invariance and explicit repeating pattern encoding for crystal representation learning. ",

Towards this end, we present a novel method for efficiently adapting behavior prediction models to new environments. Our approach leverages recent advances in meta-learning, specifically Bayesian regression, to augment existing behavior prediction models with an adaptive layer that enables efficient domain transfer via offline fine-tuning, online adaptation, or both. Experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can efficiently adapt to a variety of unseen environments. ",

Recursive techniques for reachability analysis of dynamical systems in closed-loop with a NN controller, planner or perception can over-approximate the reachable sets of the NNDS by bounding the outputs of the NN and propagating these NN output bounds forward. However, this recursive reachability analysis may suffer from compounding errors, rapidly becoming overly conservative over a longer horizon. In this work, we prove that an alternative one-shot reachability analysis framework which directly verifies the unrolled NNDS can significantly mitigate the compounding errors, enabling the use of the rolling horizon as a design parameter for verification purposes. We characterize the performance gap between the recursive and one-shot frameworks for NNDS with general computational graphs. The applicability of one-shot analysis is demonstrated through numerical examples on a cart-pole system. ",

Very few studies have been done comparing different regionalization methods, and those that do lack analysis in memory, scalability, geographic metrics, and large-scale real-world applications. This study compares state-of-the-art regionalization methods, namely, Agglomerative Clustering, SKATER, REDCAP, AZP, and Max-P-Regions using real world social determinant of health (SDOH) data. The scale of real world SDOH data, up to 1 million data points in this study, not only compares the algorithms over different data sets but provides a stress test for each individual regionalization algorithm, most of which have never been run on such scales previously. We use several new geographic metrics to compare algorithms as well as perform a comparative memory analysis. The prevailing regionalization method is then compared with unconstrained K-Means clustering on their ability to separate real health data in Virginia and Washington DC. ",

By encoding the effects of the delayed states and inputs into the feedback policy, we solve the robust optimal control problem in MPC using System Level Synthesis which results in a convex quadratic program that jointly conducts uncertainty over-approximation and robust controller synthesis. Notably, the number of variables in the quadratic program is independent of the delay horizon. The effectiveness and scalability of our proposed method are demonstrated numerically. ",

We found that while many participants reported receiving no information about what data their ESS collected, those who received some information often underestimated what was collected. Employees reported lack of communication about various data collection aspects including: the entities with access to the data and the scope of the data collected. We use the interviews to uncover several sources of misconceptions among the participants.

Classic history matching workflow is often computationally intense and geometry-dependent.

However, the analytical solution may ignore subsurface geometries and is appropriate only for specific flow regimes and otherwise may violate physics conditions resulting in degraded model prediction accuracy. Machine learning-based predictive model for time series provides non-parametric, assumption-free solutions for production forecasting, but are prone to model overfit due to training data sparsity; therefore may be accurate over short prediction time intervals. We propose a grid-free, physics-informed graph neural network (PI-GNN) for production forecasting. A customized graph convolution layer aggregates neighborhood information from historical data and has the flexibility to integrate domain expertise into the data-driven model. The proposed method relaxes the dependence on close-form solutions like CRM and honors the given physics-based constraints. Our proposed method is robust, with improved performance and model interpretability relative to the conventional CRM and GNN baseline without physics constraints. ",

This work proposes a metric that allows for the monitoring of the persons torso and its correlation to active and passive perturbations. We show that large change in the torso sway can be strongly correlated to active perturbations. We also show that by conditioning the expected path and torso sway on the past trajectory, torso motion and the surrounding scene, we can reasonably predict the future path and expected change in torso sway. This will have direct future application to fall prevention. The results demonstrated that the torso sway is strongly correlated with perturbations.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks trained for predicting cellular events from DNA sequence have become emerging tools to help elucidate the biological mechanism underlying the associations identified in genome-wide association studies. To enhance the training, multi-task learning (MTL) has been commonly exploited in previous works where trained networks were needed for multiple profiles differing in either event modality or cell type. All existing works adopted a simple MTL framework where all tasks share a single feature extraction network. Such a strategy even though effective to certain extent leads to substantial negative transfer, meaning the existence of large portion of tasks for which models obtained through MTL perform worse than those by single task learning. There have been methods developed to address such negative transfer in other domains, such as computer vision. However, these methods are generally difficult to scale up to handle large amount of tasks. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable task grouping framework to address negative transfer by only jointly training tasks that are potentially beneficial to each other. The proposed method exploits the network weights associated with task specific classification heads that can be cheaply obtained by one-time joint training of all tasks. Our results using a dataset consisting of 367 epigenetic profiles demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its superiority over baseline methods. ",

    "title": "Closing the Loop: Graph Networks to Unify Semantic Objects and Visual  Features for Multi-object Scenes",
    "abstract": "In Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is essential to minimize drift when recognizing previously visited places. Visual Bag-of-Words (vBoW) has been an LCD algorithm of choice for many state-of-the-art SLAM systems. It uses a set of visual features to provide robust place recognition but fails to perceive the semantics or spatial relationship between feature points. Previous work has mainly focused on addressing these issues by combining vBoW with semantic and spatial information from objects in the scene. However, they are unable to exploit spatial information of local visual features and lack a structure that unifies semantic objects and visual features, therefore limiting the symbiosis between the two components. This paper proposes SymbioLCD2, which creates a unified graph structure to integrate semantic objects and visual features symbiotically. Our novel graph-based LCD system utilizes the unified graph structure by applying a Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel with temporal constraints to robustly predict loop closure candidates. Evaluation of the proposed system shows that having a unified graph structure incorporating semantic objects and visual features improves LCD prediction accuracy, illustrating that the proposed graph structure provides a strong symbiosis between these two complementary components. It also outperforms other Machine Learning algorithms - such as SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network and GNN based Graph Matching Networks. Furthermore, it has shown good performance in detecting loop closure candidates earlier than state-of-the-art SLAM systems, demonstrating that extended semantic and spatial awareness from the unified graph structure significantly impacts LCD performance.

    "abstract": "Recently cloud-based graph convolutional network (GCN) has demonstrated great success and potential in many privacy-sensitive applications such as personal healthcare and financial systems. Despite its high inference accuracy and performance on cloud, maintaining data privacy in GCN inference, which is of paramount importance to these practical applications, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we take an initial attempt towards this and develop $\\textit{CryptoGCN}$--a homomorphic encryption (HE) based GCN inference framework. A key to the success of our approach is to reduce the tremendous computational overhead for HE operations, which can be orders of magnitude higher than its counterparts in the plaintext space. To this end, we develop an approach that can effectively take advantage of the sparsity of matrix operations in GCN inference to significantly reduce the computational overhead. Specifically, we propose a novel AMA data formatting method and associated spatial convolution methods, which can exploit the complex graph structure and perform efficient matrix-matrix multiplication in HE computation and thus greatly reduce the HE operations. We also develop a co-optimization framework that can explore the trade offs among the accuracy, security level, and computational overhead by judicious pruning and polynomial approximation of activation module in GCNs. Based on the NTU-XVIEW skeleton joint dataset, i.e., the largest dataset evaluated homomorphically by far as we are aware of, our experimental results demonstrate that $\\textit{CryptoGCN}$ outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of the latency and number of homomorphic operations, i.e., achieving as much as a 3.10$\\times$ speedup on latency and reduces the total Homomorphic Operation Count by 77.4\\% with a small accuracy loss of 1-1.5$\\%$.

    "abstract": "Overlapped speech detection (OSD) is critical for speech applications in scenario of multi-party conversion. Despite numerous research efforts and progresses, comparing with speech activity detection (VAD), OSD remains an open challenge and its overall performance is far from satisfactory. The majority of prior research typically formulates the OSD problem as a standard classification problem, to identify speech with binary (OSD) or three-class label (joint VAD and OSD) at frame level. In contrast to the mainstream, this study investigates the joint VAD and OSD task from a new perspective. In particular, we propose to extend traditional classification network with multi-exit architecture. Such an architecture empowers our system with unique capability to identify class using either low-level features from early exits or high-level features from last exit. In addition, two training schemes, knowledge distillation and dense connection, are adopted to further boost our system performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (AMI and DIHARD-III) validated the effectiveness and generality of our proposed system. Our ablations further reveal the complementary contribution of proposed schemes. With $F_1$ score of 0.792 on AMI and 0.625 on DIHARD-III, our proposed system outperforms several top performing models on these datasets, but also surpasses the current state-of-the-art by large margins across both datasets. Besides the performance benefit, our proposed system offers another appealing potential for quality-complexity trade-offs, which is highly preferred for efficient OSD deployment. ",

Despite the fact that several approaches for studying this issue have been proposed, the following drawbacks still persist: 1) It's difficult to learn latent representations that account for complementarity yet consistency without using label information; 2) and thus fails to take full advantage of the hidden information in incomplete data results in suboptimal clustering performance when complete data is scarce. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Incomplete Multi-View Image Clustering with Generative Adversarial Networks (CIMIC-GAN), which uses GAN to fill in incomplete data and uses double contrastive learning to learn consistency on complete and incomplete data. More specifically, considering diversity and complementary information among multiple modalities, we incorporate autoencoding representation of complete and incomplete data into double contrastive learning to achieve learning consistency. Integrating GANs into the autoencoding process can not only take full advantage of new features of incomplete data, but also better generalize the model in the presence of high data missing rates.

Due to the nonlinearity and nonlocality, the numerical study of the PEs is in general a hard task. Neural network has been shown a promising machine learning tool to tackle this challenge. In this work, we employ the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the solutions to the PEs and study the error estimates. We first establish the higher-order regularity for the global solutions to the PEs with either full viscosity and diffusivity, or with only the horizontal ones. Such higher-order regularity results are new and required in the analysis under the PINNs framework. Then we prove the existence of two layer tanh PINNs of which the corresponding training error can be arbitrarily small by taking the width of PINNs to be sufficiently wide, and the error between the true solution and the approximation can be arbitrarily small provided that the training error is small enough and the sample set is large enough. In particular, our analysis includes higher-order (in spatial Sobolev norm) error estimates, and improves existing results in PINNs' literature which concerns only the $L^2$ error. Numerical results on prototype systems are presented for further illustrating the advantage of using $H^s$ norm during the training. ",

In order to reap the full potential of PCNs, recharging and rebalancing mechanisms are required to provision channels, as well as an admission control logic to decide which transactions to reject in case capacity is insufficient. This paper presents a formal model of this optimisation problem. In particular, we consider an online algorithms perspective, where transactions arrive over time in an unpredictable manner. Our main contributions are competitive online algorithms which come with provable guarantees over time. We empirically evaluate our algorithms on randomly generated transactions to compare the average performance of our algorithms to our theoretical bounds.

Along with powerful compute resources, MP systems often rely on vast amount of open-source code to learn interesting properties about code and programming and solve problems in the areas of debugging, code recommendation, auto-completion, etc. Unfortunately, several of the existing MP systems either do not consider quality of code repositories or use atypical quality measures than those typically used in software engineering community to select them. As such, impact of quality of code repositories on the performance of these systems needs to be studied. In this preliminary paper, we evaluate impact of different quality repositories on the performance of a candidate MP system. Towards that objective, we develop a framework, named GitRank, to rank open-source repositories on quality, maintainability, and popularity by leveraging existing research on this topic. We then apply GitRank to evaluate correlation between the quality measures used by the candidate MP system and the quality measures used by our framework. Our preliminary results reveal some correlation between the quality measures used in GitRank and ControlFlag's performance, suggesting that some of the measures used in GitRank are applicable to ControlFlag. But it also raises questions around right quality measures for code repositories used in MP systems. We believe that our findings also generate interesting insights towards code quality measures that affect performance of MP systems. ",

NP-KG is a heterogeneous KG with biomedical ontologies, linked data, and full texts of the scientific literature, constructed with the Phenotype Knowledge Translator framework and the semantic relation extraction systems, SemRep and Integrated Network and Dynamic Reasoning Assembler. NP-KG was evaluated with case studies of pharmacokinetic green tea- and kratom-drug interactions through path searches and meta-path discovery to determine congruent and contradictory information compared to ground truth data. The fully integrated NP-KG consisted of 745,512 nodes and 7,249,576 edges. Evaluation of NP-KG resulted in congruent (38.98% for green tea, 50% for kratom), contradictory (15.25% for green tea, 21.43% for kratom), and both congruent and contradictory (15.25% for green tea, 21.43% for kratom) information. Potential pharmacokinetic mechanisms for several purported NPDIs, including the green tea-raloxifene, green tea-nadolol, kratom-midazolam, kratom-quetiapine, and kratom-venlafaxine interactions were congruent with the published literature.

In QKD-SIC systems, edge devices connected via quantum channels can efficiently encrypt semantic information from the semantic source, and securely transmit the encrypted semantic information to the semantic destination. In this paper, we consider an efficient resource (i.e., QKD and KM wavelengths) sharing problem to support QKD-SIC systems under the uncertainty of semantic information generated by edge devices. In such a system, QKD service providers offer QKD services with different subscription options to the edge devices. As such, to reduce the cost for the edge device users, we propose a QKD resource management framework for the edge devices communicating semantic information. The framework is based on a two-stage stochastic optimization model to achieve optimal QKD deployment. Moreover, to reduce the deployment cost of QKD service providers, QKD resources in the proposed framework can be utilized based on efficient QKD-SIC resource management, including semantic information transmission among edge devices, secret-key provisioning, and cooperation formation among QKD service providers. In detail, the formulated two-stage stochastic optimization model can achieve the optimal QKD-SIC resource deployment while meeting the secret-key requirements for semantic information transmission of edge devices. Moreover, to share the cost of the QKD resource pool among cooperative QKD service providers forming a coalition in a fair and interpretable manner, the proposed framework leverages the concept of Shapley value from cooperative game theory as a solution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can reduce the deployment cost by about 40% compared with existing non-cooperative baselines. ",

However, most OoD detection methods are evaluated on a standard set of datasets, arbitrarily different from training data. There is no clear definition of what forms a ``good\" OoD dataset. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art OoD detection methods already achieve near perfect results on these standard benchmarks. In this paper, we define 2 categories of OoD data using the subtly different concepts of perceptual/visual and semantic similarity to in-distribution (iD) data. We define Near OoD samples as perceptually similar but semantically different from iD samples, and Shifted samples as points which are visually different but semantically akin to iD data. We then propose a GAN based framework for generating OoD samples from each of these 2 categories, given an iD dataset. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, we show that a) state-of-the-art OoD detection methods which perform exceedingly well on conventional benchmarks are significantly less robust to our proposed benchmark. Moreover, b) models performing well on our setup also perform well on conventional real-world OoD detection benchmarks and vice versa, thereby indicating that one might not even need a separate OoD set, to reliably evaluate performance in OoD detection.

    "abstract": "Strong adversarial examples are the keys to evaluating and enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks. The popular adversarial attack algorithms maximize the non-concave loss function using the gradient ascent. However, the performance of each attack is usually sensitive to, for instance, minor image transformations due to insufficient information (only one input example, few white-box source models and unknown defense strategies). Hence, the crafted adversarial examples are prone to overfit the source model, which limits their transferability to unidentified architectures. In this paper, we propose Multiple Asymptotically Normal Distribution Attacks (MultiANDA), a novel method that explicitly characterizes adversarial perturbations from a learned distribution. Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution over the perturbations by taking advantage of the asymptotic normality property of stochastic gradient ascent (SGA), then apply the ensemble strategy on this procedure to estimate a Gaussian mixture model for a better exploration of the potential optimization space. Drawing perturbations from the learned distribution allow us to generate any number of adversarial examples for each input. The approximated posterior essentially describes the stationary distribution of SGA iterations, which captures the geometric information around the local optimum. Thus, the samples drawn from the distribution reliably maintain the transferability. Our proposed method outperforms nine state-of-the-art black-box attacks on deep learning models with or without defenses through extensive experiments on seven normally trained and seven defence models.

    "abstract": "Systems biology and systems neurophysiology in particular have recently emerged as powerful tools for a number of key applications in the biomedical sciences. Nevertheless, such models are often based on complex combinations of multiscale (and possibly multiphysics) strategies that require ad hoc computational strategies and pose extremely high computational demands. Recent developments in the field of deep neural networks have demonstrated the possibility of formulating nonlinear, universal approximators to estimate solutions to highly nonlinear and complex problems with significant speed and accuracy advantages in comparison with traditional models. After synthetic data validation, we use so-called physically constrained neural networks (PINN) to simultaneously solve the biologically plausible Hodgkin-Huxley model and infer its parameters and hidden time-courses from real data under both variable and constant current stimulation, demonstrating extremely low variability across spikes and faithful signal reconstruction. The parameter ranges we obtain are also compatible with prior knowledge. We demonstrate that detailed biological knowledge can be provided to a neural network, making it able to fit complex dynamics over both simulated and real data. ",

    "title": "Toward Intention Discovery for Early Malice Detection in Bitcoin",
    "abstract": "Bitcoin has been subject to illicit activities more often than probably any other financial assets, due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of its transacting entities. An ideal detection model is expected to achieve all the three properties of (I) early detection, (II) good interpretability, and (III) versatility for various illicit activities. However, existing solutions cannot meet all these requirements, as most of them heavily rely on deep learning without satisfying interpretability and are only available for retrospective analysis of a specific illicit type. First, we present asset transfer paths, which aim to describe addresses' early characteristics. Next, with a decision tree based strategy for feature selection and segmentation, we split the entire observation period into different segments and encode each as a segment vector. After clustering all these segment vectors, we get the global status vectors, essentially the basic unit to describe the whole intention. Finally, a hierarchical self-attention predictor predicts the label for the given address in real time. A survival module tells the predictor when to stop and proposes the status sequence, namely intention. % With the type-dependent selection strategy and global status vectors, our model can be applied to detect various illicit activities with strong interpretability. The well-designed predictor and particular loss functions strengthen the model's prediction speed and interpretability one step further. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Besides, additional case studies justify our model can not only explain existing illicit patterns but can also find new suspicious characters. ",

While the training of deep SNN is still an open problem, which limits the real-world applications of deep SNN. Here we propose a deep SNN architecture named Spiking SiamFC++ for object tracking with end-to-end direct training. Specifically, the AlexNet network is extended in the time domain to extract the feature, and the surrogate gradient function is adopted to realize direct supervised training of the deep SNN. To examine the performance of the Spiking SiamFC++, several tracking benchmarks including OTB2013, OTB2015, VOT2015, VOT2016, and UAV123 are considered. It is found that, the precision loss is small compared with the original SiamFC++. Compared with the existing SNN-based target tracker, e.g., the SiamSNN, the precision (succession) of the proposed Spiking SiamFC++ reaches 85.24% (64.37%), which is much higher than that of 52.78% (44.32%) achieved by the SiamSNN. To our best knowledge, the performance of the Spiking SiamFC++ outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches in SNN-based object tracking, which provides a novel path for SNN application in the field of target tracking.

This necessitates a long-term planning of the joint power-NG system under representative demand and supply patterns, operational constraints, and policy considerations. Our work is motivated by the computational and practical challenges associated with solving the generation and transmission expansion problem (GTEP) for joint planning of power-NG systems. Specifically, we focus on efficiently extracting a set of representative days from power and NG data in respective networks and using this set to reduce the computational burden required to solve the GTEP. We propose a Graph Autoencoder for Multiple time resolution Energy Systems (GAMES) to capture the spatio-temporal demand patterns in interdependent networks and account for differences in the temporal resolution of available data. The resulting embeddings are used in a clustering algorithm to select representative days. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in solving a GTEP formulation calibrated for the joint power-NG system in New England. This formulation accounts for the physical interdependencies between power and NG systems, including the joint emissions constraint. Our results show that the set of representative days obtained from GAMES not only allows us to tractably solve the GTEP formulation, but also achieves a lower cost of implementing the joint planning decisions.

For humans, matching the emotiveness in a musical composition or performance with the subjective perception of an audience can be quite challenging.

Usually, it takes a data-set, from which audio features are extracted to present this information to a data-driven model, that will, in turn, train to predict what is the probability that a given song matches a target emotion. In this paper, we studied the most common features and models used in recent publications to tackle this problem, revealing which ones are best suited for recognizing emotion in a cappella songs. ",

We use the model-agnostic meta-learning framework to adapt the anonymization model trained via federated learning to each user's data distribution. We evaluate Blinder under different settings and show that it provides end-to-end privacy protection at the cost of increasing privacy loss by up to 4.00% and decreasing data utility by up to 4.24%, compared to the state-of-the-art anonymization model trained on centralized data. Our experiments confirm that Blinder can obscure multiple private attributes at once, and has sufficiently low power consumption and computational overhead for it to be deployed on edge devices and smartphones to perform real-time anonymization of sensor data.

    "abstract": "Although manipulating facial attributes by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has been remarkably successful recently, there are still some challenges in explicit control of features such as pose, expression, lighting, etc. Recent methods achieve explicit control over 2D images by combining 2D generative model and 3DMM. However, due to the lack of realism and clarity in texture reconstruction by 3DMM, there is a domain gap between the synthetic image and the rendered image of 3DMM. Since rendered 3DMM images contain facial region only without the background, directly computing the loss between these two domains is not ideal and the resultant trained model will be biased. In this study, we propose to explicitly edit the latent space of the pretrained StyleGAN by controlling the parameters of the 3DMM. To address the domain gap problem, we propose a noval network called 'Map and edit' and a simple but effective attribute editing method to avoid direct loss computation between rendered and synthesized images. Furthermore, since our model can accurately generate multi-view face images while the identity remains unchanged. As a by-product, combined with visibility masks, our proposed model can also generate texture-rich and high-resolution UV facial textures. Our model relies on pretrained StyleGAN, and the proposed model is trained in a self-supervised manner without any manual annotations or datasets. ",

Efficient compression methods have been proposed in the literature, especially for web graphs. In most cases, they are combined with a vertex reordering pre-processing step which significantly improves the compression rate. However, these techniques are not as efficient when considering other kinds of graphs. In this paper, we focus on the class of bipartite graphs and adapt the vertex reordering phase to their specific structure by proposing a dual reordering scheme. By reordering each group of vertices in the purpose of minimizing a specific score, we show that we can reach better compression rates. We also suggest that this approach can be further refined to make the node orderings more adapted to the compression phase that follows the ordering phase. ",

Concretely, we design a pair of paralleled transformer encoder branches, namely the coarse stream and the fine stream, to encode both the context and details of target objects. The encoded features are then fused together with attention layers to alleviate ambiguities for accurate object localization. We have compared our method with the conventional transformer-based method and our method achieves better performance. In addition, we also present the first NeRF samples-based object localization benchmark NeRFLocBench. ",

While videos of unintentional or failed actions can be found in the Internet in abundance, high annotation costs are a major bottleneck for learning networks for these tasks. In this work, we thus study the problem of self-supervised representation learning for unintentional action prediction. While previous works learn the representation based on a local temporal neighborhood, we show that the global context of a video is needed to learn a good representation for the three downstream tasks: unintentional action classification, localization and anticipation. In the supplementary material, we show that the learned representation can be used for detecting anomalies in videos as well. ",

This work introduces a Bayesian framework to calibrate the spatial distribution of the parameters within a tumor growth model to quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and demonstrates its implementation in a pre-clinical model of glioma. The framework leverages an atlas-based brain segmentation of grey and white matter to establish subject-specific priors and tunable spatial dependencies of the model parameters in each region. Using this framework, the tumor-specific parameters are calibrated from quantitative MRI measurements early in the course of tumor development in four rats and used to predict the spatial development of the tumor at later times. The results suggest that the tumor model, calibrated by animal-specific imaging data at one time point, can accurately predict tumor shapes with a Dice coefficient > 0.89. However, the reliability of the predicted volume and shape of tumors strongly relies on the number of earlier imaging time points used for calibrating the model. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the ability to determine the uncertainty in the inferred tissue heterogeneity and the model predicted tumor shape. ",

To counter these shortcomings, we propose an Information-aware Graph Block Network (I-GBNet), an AIA adaptation of Graph Neural Networks, that aggregates information over the graph representation and provides sequential-decision making in a distributed manner. The I-GBNet, trained via imitation learning with a centralized sampling-based expert solver, exhibits permutation equivariance and time invariance, while harnessing the superior scalability, robustness and generalizability to previously unseen environments and robot configurations. Experiments on significantly larger graphs and dimensionality of the hidden state and more complex environments than those seen in training validate the properties of the proposed architecture and its efficacy in the application of localization and tracking of dynamic targets.

However, order-sensitive problem is the major drawback of RNN, which heavily affects the stability of proposed CoSOD (CoSEG) model. In this paper, inspired by RNN-based model, we first propose a multi-path stable recurrent unit (MSRU), containing dummy orders mechanisms (DOM) and recurrent unit (RU).

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection has recently gained increasing attention in the field of computer vision, likely due to its broad set of applications ranging from product fault detection on industrial production lines and impending event detection in video surveillance to finding lesions in medical scans. Regardless of the domain, anomaly detection is typically framed as a one-class classification task, where the learning is conducted on normal examples only. An entire family of successful anomaly detection methods is based on learning to reconstruct masked normal inputs (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and exerting the magnitude of the reconstruction error as an indicator for the abnormality level. Unlike other reconstruction-based methods, we present a novel self-supervised masked convolutional transformer block (SSMCTB) that comprises the reconstruction-based functionality at a core architectural level. The proposed self-supervised block is extremely flexible, enabling information masking at any layer of a neural network and being compatible with a wide range of neural architectures. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised predictive convolutional attentive block (SSPCAB) with a 3D masked convolutional layer, as well as a transformer for channel-wise attention. Furthermore, we show that our block is applicable to a wider variety of tasks, adding anomaly detection in medical images and thermal videos to the previously considered tasks based on RGB images and surveillance videos. We exhibit the generality and flexibility of SSMCTB by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art neural models for anomaly detection, bringing forth empirical results that confirm considerable performance improvements on five benchmarks: MVTec AD, BRATS, Avenue, ShanghaiTech, and Thermal Rare Event.

While standard cameras can provide rich perception information in most scenarios, especially in good lighting conditions. These two cameras are exactly complementary.

    "abstract": "Advertisement video editing aims to automatically edit advertising videos into shorter videos while retaining coherent content and crucial information conveyed by advertisers. It mainly contains two stages: video segmentation and segment assemblage. The existing method performs well at video segmentation stages but suffers from the problems of dependencies on extra cumbersome models and poor performance at the segment assemblage stage. To address these problems, we propose M-SAN (Multi-modal Segment Assemblage Network) which can perform efficient and coherent segment assemblage task end-to-end. It utilizes multi-modal representation extracted from the segments and follows the Encoder-Decoder Ptr-Net framework with the Attention mechanism. Importance-coherence reward is designed for training M-SAN. We experiment on the Ads-1k dataset with 1000+ videos under rich ad scenarios collected from advertisers. To evaluate the methods, we propose a unified metric, Imp-Coh@Time, which comprehensively assesses the importance, coherence, and duration of the outputs at the same time. Experimental results show that our method achieves better performance than random selection and the previous method on the metric. Ablation experiments further verify that multi-modal representation and importance-coherence reward significantly improve the performance.

However, these tools often report a large number of warnings with a high false-positive rate, which causes many difficulties for developers. In this paper, we introduce VulRG, a novel approach to address this problem. Specifically, VulRG predicts and ranks the warnings based on their likelihoods to be true positive.To predict that likelihood, VulRG combines two deep learning models CNN and BiGRU to capture the context of each warning in terms of program syntax, control flow, and program dependence. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset of 6,620 warnings show that VulRG's Recall at Top-50% is 90.9%. This means that using VulRG, 90% of the vulnerabilities can be found by examining only 50% of the warnings. Moreover, at Top-5%, VulRG can improve the state-of-the-art approach by +30% in both Precision and Recall. ",

He formulated a sound proof system for bisimilarity of process interpretations of regular expressions, and asked whether this system is complete. We report conceptually on a proof that shows that Milner's system is complete, by motivating, illustrating, and describing all of its main steps. We substantially refine the completeness proof by Grabmayer and Fokkink (2020) for the restriction of Milner's system to `1-free' regular expressions. As a crucial complication we recognize that process graphs with empty-step transitions that satisfy the layered loop-existence/elimination property LLEE are not closed under bisimulation collapse (unlike process graphs with LLEE that only have proper-step transitions). We circumnavigate this obstacle by defining a LLEE-preserving `crystallization procedure' for such process graphs. By that we obtain `near-collapsed' process graphs with LLEE whose strongly connected components are either collapsed or of `twin-crystal' shape. Such near-collapsed process graphs guarantee provable solutions for bisimulation collapses of process interpretations of regular expressions. ",

However, the underlying fragility of CNN structures poses major security problems, making them inappropriate for use in security-oriented applications including such computer networks. Protecting these architectures from adversarial attacks necessitates using security-wise architectures that are challenging to attack. In this study, we present a novel architecture based on an ensemble classifier that combines the enhanced security of 1-Class classification (known as 1C) with the high performance of conventional 2-Class classification (known as 2C) in the absence of attacks.Our architecture is referred to as the 1.5-Class (SPRITZ-1.5C) classifier and constructed using a final dense classifier, one 2C classifier (i.e., CNNs), and two parallel 1C classifiers (i.e., auto-encoders). In our experiments, we evaluated the robustness of our proposed architecture by considering eight possible adversarial attacks in various scenarios. We performed these attacks on the 2C and SPRITZ-1.5C architectures separately. The experimental results of our study showed that the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of the I-FGSM attack against a 2C classifier trained with the N-BaIoT dataset is 0.9900.

    "abstract": "The technology of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to fingerprint imaging opens up a new research potential for fingerprint recognition owing to its ability to capture depth information of the skin layers. Developing robust and high security Automated Fingerprint Recognition Systems (AFRSs) are possible if the depth information can be fully utilized. However, in existing studies, Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) and subsurface fingerprint reconstruction based on depth information are treated as two independent branches, resulting in high computation and complexity of AFRS building.Thus, this paper proposes a uniform representation model for OCT-based fingerprint PAD and subsurface fingerprint reconstruction. Firstly, we design a novel semantic segmentation network which only trained by real finger slices of OCT-based fingerprints to extract multiple subsurface structures from those slices (also known as B-scans). The latent codes derived from the network are directly used to effectively detect the PA since they contain abundant subsurface biological information, which is independent with PA materials and has strong robustness for unknown PAs. Meanwhile, the segmented subsurface structures are adopted to reconstruct multiple subsurface 2D fingerprints. Recognition can be easily achieved by using existing mature technologies based on traditional 2D fingerprints. Extensive experiments are carried on our own established database, which is the largest public OCT-based fingerprint database with 2449 volumes. In PAD task, our method can improve 0.33% Acc from the state-of-the-art method. For reconstruction performance, our method achieves the best performance with 0.834 mIOU and 0.937 PA. By comparing with the recognition performance on surface 2D fingerprints, the effectiveness of our proposed method on high quality subsurface fingerprint reconstruction is further proved. ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies on Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction has reached new levels by modeling longer user behavior sequences. Among others, the two-stage methods stand out as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solution for industrial applications. The two-stage methods first train a retrieval model to truncate the long behavior sequence beforehand and then use the truncated sequences to train a CTR model. However, the retrieval model and the CTR model are trained separately. So the retrieved subsequences in the CTR model is inaccurate, which degrades the final performance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end paradigm to model long behavior sequences, which is able to achieve superior performance along with remarkable cost-efficiency compared to existing models. Our contribution is three-fold: First, we propose a hashing-based efficient target attention (TA) network named ETA-Net to enable end-to-end user behavior retrieval based on low-cost bit-wise operations. The proposed ETA-Net can reduce the complexity of standard TA by orders of magnitude for sequential data modeling. Second, we propose a general system architecture as one viable solution to deploy ETA-Net on industrial systems. Particularly, ETA-Net has been deployed on the recommender system of Taobao, and brought 1.8% lift on CTR and 3.1% lift on Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) compared to the SOTA two-stage methods. Third, we conduct extensive experiments on both offline datasets and online A/B test. The results verify that the proposed model outperforms existing CTR models considerably, in terms of both CTR prediction performance and online cost-efficiency. ETA-Net now serves the main traffic of Taobao, delivering services to hundreds of millions of users towards billions of items every day. ",

State-of-the-art solutions rely on training hybrid models for both cold-start and existing users/items, based on the auxiliary information. Such a hybrid model would compromise the performance of existing users/items, which might make these solutions not applicable in real-worlds recommender systems where the experience of existing users/items must be guaranteed. Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated to perform effectively warm (non-cold-start) recommendations. However, they have never been applied to handle the cold-start problem in a user-item bipartite graph. This is a challenging but rewarding task since cold-start users/items do not have links. Besides, it is nontrivial to design an appropriate GNN to conduct cold-start recommendations while maintaining the performance for existing users/items. To bridge the gap, we propose a tailored GNN-based framework (GPatch) that contains two separate but correlated components. First, an efficient GNN architecture -- GWarmer, is designed to model the warm users/items. Second, we construct correlated Patching Networks to simulate and patch GWarmer by conducting cold-start recommendations. Experiments on benchmark and large-scale commercial datasets demonstrate that GPatch is significantly superior in providing recommendations for both existing and cold-start users/items. ",

To counter this, we introduce SGANv2: an improved safety-compliant SGAN architecture equipped with spatio-temporal interaction modelling and a transformer-based discriminator. The spatio-temporal modelling ability helps to learn the human social interactions better while the transformer-based discriminator design improves temporal sequence modelling. Additionally, SGANv2 utilizes the learned discriminator even at test-time via a collaborative sampling strategy that not only refines the colliding trajectories but also prevents mode collapse, a common phenomenon in GAN training. Through extensive experimentation on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of SGANv2 to provide socially-compliant multimodal trajectories. ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies utilizing multi-modal data aimed at building a robust model for facial Action Unit (AU) detection. However, due to the heterogeneity of multi-modal data, multi-modal representation learning becomes one of the main challenges. On one hand, it is difficult to extract the relevant features from multi-modalities by only one feature extractor, on the other hand, previous studies have not fully explored the potential of multi-modal fusion strategies. For example, early fusion usually required all modalities to be present during inference, while late fusion and middle fusion increased the network size for feature learning. In contrast to a large amount of work on late fusion, there are few works on early fusion to explore the channel information. This paper presents a novel multi-modal network called Multi-modal Channel-Mixing (MCM), as a pre-trained model to learn a robust representation in order to facilitate the multi-modal fusion. We evaluate the learned representation on a downstream task of automatic facial action units detection. Specifically, it is a single stream encoder network that uses a channel-mixing module in early fusion, requiring only one modality in the downstream detection task. We also utilize the masked ViT encoder to learn features from the fusion image and reconstruct back two modalities with two ViT decoders. We have conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets, known as BP4D and DISFA, to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed multimodal framework. The results show our approach is comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art baseline methods. ",

In this paper, the duplicate detection is newly and precisely defined as occlusion misreporting on the same athlete by multiple detection boxes in one frame. To address this problem, we meticulously design a novel transformer-based Duplicate Detection Decontaminator (D$^3$) for training, and a specific algorithm Rally-Hungarian (RH) for matching. Once duplicate detection occurs, D$^3$ immediately modifies the procedure by generating enhanced boxes losses. RH, triggered by the team sports substitution rules, is exceedingly suitable for sports videos. Moreover, to complement the tracking dataset that without shot changes, we release a new dataset based on sports video named RallyTrack. Extensive experiments on RallyTrack show that combining D$^3$ and RH can dramatically improve the tracking performance with 9.2 in MOTA and 4.5 in HOTA. Meanwhile, experiments on MOT-series and DanceTrack discover that D$^3$ can accelerate convergence during training, especially save up to 80 percent of the original training time on MOT17. Finally, our model, which is trained only with volleyball videos, can be applied directly to basketball and soccer videos for MAT, which shows priority of our method.

LiDAR point clouds have accurate spatial and geometry information, while RGB images provide textural and color data for context reasoning. To exploit LiDAR and cameras jointly, existing fusion methods tend to align each 3D point to only one projected image pixel based on calibration, namely one-to-one mapping. However, the performance of these approaches highly relies on the calibration quality, which is sensitive to the temporal and spatial synchronization of sensors. Therefore, we propose a Dynamic Cross Attention (DCA) module with a novel one-to-many cross-modality mapping that learns multiple offsets from the initial projection towards the neighborhood and thus develops tolerance to calibration error. Moreover, a \\textit{dynamic query enhancement} is proposed to perceive the model-independent calibration, which further strengthens DCA's tolerance to the initial misalignment. The whole fusion architecture named Dynamic Cross Attention Network (DCAN) exploits multi-level image features and adapts to multiple representations of point clouds, which allows DCA to serve as a plug-in fusion module. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI prove DCA's effectiveness. The proposed DCAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes detection challenge. ",

This paper makes the first attempt to quantitatively measure the quality of VCPS by designing a new metric called Age of View (AoV). Specifically, a vehicular edge computing (VEC) architecture is presented, in which heterogeneous information can be cooperatively sensed and uploaded via Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications. Logical views can be constructed by fusing the heterogeneous information at edge nodes. Further, we derive a cooperative sensing model based on the multi-class M/G/1 priority queue. On this basis, we define the AoV by modeling the timeliness, completeness, and consistency of the logical views. Then, we formulate the problem, which aims at maximizing the quality of VCPS. Further, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solution is proposed. The system state includes vehicle sensed information, edge cached information, and view requirements. The vehicle action space consists of the sensing frequencies and uploading priorities of information, and the edge action space is the V2I bandwidth allocation. The system reward is defined as the achieved VCPS quality. In particular, a difference-reward-based credit assignment is designed to divide the system reward into the difference reward for vehicles, reflecting their individual contributions. Finally, we build the simulation model and give a comprehensive performance evaluation, which conclusively demonstrates the superiority of the proposed solution. ",

However, relying on high-dimensional image data to make control decisions raises important questions; particularly, how might we prove the safety of a visual-feedback controller? Control barrier functions (CBFs) are powerful tools for certifying the safety of feedback controllers in the state-feedback setting, but CBFs have traditionally been poorly-suited to visual feedback control due to the need to predict future observations in order to evaluate the barrier function. In this work, we solve this issue by leveraging recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs), which learn implicit representations of 3D scenes and can render images from previously-unseen camera perspectives, to provide single-step visual foresight for a CBF-based controller. This novel combination is able to filter out unsafe actions and intervene to preserve safety.

A vertex pair $(s,t)$ is $(p,q)$-flex-connected if $s$ and $t$ have $p$ edge-connectivity even after the removal of any $q$ unsafe edges. Given a graph $G$, the goal is to choose a min-cost subgraph $H$ of $G$ that has desired flex-connectivity for a given set of vertex pairs. This model generalizes the well-studied edge-connectivity based network design, however, even special cases are provably much harder to approximate. The approximability of network design in this model has been mainly studied for two settings of interest: (i) single pair setting under the names FTP and FTF (fault tolerant path and fault tolerant flow), (ii) spanning setting under the name FGC (flexible graph connectivity). There have been several positive results in these papers. However, despite similarity to the well-known network design problems, this new model has been challenging to design approximation algorithms for, especially when $p,q \\ge 2$. We obtain two results that advance our understanding of algorithm design in this model. 1. We obtain a $5$-approximation for the $(2,2)$-flex-connectivity for a single pair $(s,t)$. Previously no non-trivial approximation was known for this setting. 2. We obtain $O(p)$ approximation for $(p,2)$ and $(p,3)$-FGC for any $p \\ge 1$, and for $(p,4)$-FGC for any even $p$. We obtain an $O(q)$-approximation for $(2,q)$-FGC for any $q \\ge 1$. Previously only a $O(q \\log n)$-approximation was known for these settings. Our results are obtained via the augmentation framework where we identify a structured way to use the well-known $2$-approximation for covering uncrossable families of cuts. Our analysis also proves corresponding integrality gap bounds on an LP relaxation that we formulate. ",

    "abstract": "In medicine, curated image datasets often employ discrete labels to describe what is known to be a continuous spectrum of healthy to pathological conditions, such as e.g. the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum or other areas where the image plays a pivotal point in diagnosis. We propose an architecture for image stratification based on a conditional variational autoencoder. Our framework, VAESim, leverages a continuous latent space to represent the continuum of disorders and finds clusters during training, which can then be used for image/patient stratification. The core of the method learns a set of prototypical vectors, each associated with a cluster. First, we perform a soft assignment of each data sample to the clusters. Then, we reconstruct the sample based on a similarity measure between the sample embedding and the prototypical vectors of the clusters. To update the prototypical embeddings, we use an exponential moving average of the most similar representations between actual prototypes and samples in the batch size. We test our approach on the MNIST-handwritten digit dataset and on a medical benchmark dataset called PneumoniaMNIST. We demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in terms of kNN accuracy measured on a classification task against a standard VAE (up to 15% improvement in performance) in both datasets, and also performs at par with classification models trained in a fully supervised way. We also demonstrate how our model outperforms current, end-to-end models for unsupervised stratification. ",

    "abstract": "Learning to optimize is a rapidly growing area that aims to solve optimization problems or improve existing optimization algorithms using machine learning (ML). In particular, the graph neural network (GNN) is considered a suitable ML model for optimization problems whose variables and constraints are permutation--invariant, for example, the linear program (LP). While the literature has reported encouraging numerical results, this paper establishes the theoretical foundation of applying GNNs to solving LPs. Given any size limit of LPs, we construct a GNN that maps different LPs to different outputs. We show that properly built GNNs can reliably predict feasibility, boundedness, and an optimal solution for each LP in a broad class. Our proofs are based upon the recently--discovered connections between the Weisfeiler--Lehman isomorphism test and the GNN. To validate our results, we train a simple GNN and present its accuracy in mapping LPs to their feasibilities and solutions. ",

This necessitates either reacquisition as a new user that can take up to 1.28 sec in 5G New Radio, disrupting high-performance applications, or handover to a different base station (BS), which however requires very costly dense deployments to ensure multiple base stations are always visible to a mobile outdoors. We have found that there typically exists a strong ground reflection from concrete and gravel surfaces, within 4-6 dB of received signal strength (RSS) of LoS paths. The mobile can switch to such a Non-Line Sight (NLoS) beam to sustain the link for use as a control channel during a blockage event. This allows the mobile to maintain time-synchronization with the base station, allowing it to revert to the LoS path when the temporary blockage disappears. We present a protocol, Terra, to quickly discover, cache, and employ ground reflections. It can be used in most outdoor built environments since pedestrian blockages typically last only a few hundred milliseconds. ",

This paper first formalizes NLC using the potential outcomes framework, providing a comparison with the related phenomenon of causal interference. Then, it proposes a broadly applicable framework, termed \"weather2vec\", that uses the theory of balancing scores to learn representations of non-local information into a scalar or vector defined for each observational unit, which is subsequently used to adjust for confounding in conjunction with causal inference methods. The framework is evaluated in a simulation study and two case studies on air pollution where the weather is an (inherently regional) known confounder. ",

Further on, we perform an analysis exploring the effect of cross-domain and cross-regional transfer, i.e., train a model across domains (legal areas), or regions. We find that in both settings (legal areas, origin regions), models trained across all groups perform overall better, while they also have improved results in the worst-case scenarios.

With the advancement of deep learning, neural networks are applied to numerically solve partial differential equations by learning the mapping between the inputs and the solution of the equation, the wave equation in particular, since traditional methods can be time consuming if numerous instances are to be solved. Previous works that concentrate on solving the wave equation by neural networks consider either a single velocity model or multiple simple velocity models, which is restricted in practice. Therefore, inspired by the idea of operator learning, this work leverages the Fourier neural operator (FNO) to effectively learn the frequency domain seismic wavefields under the context of variable velocity models. Moreover, we propose a new framework paralleled Fourier neural operator (PFNO) for efficiently training the FNO-based solver given multiple source locations and frequencies. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy of both FNO and PFNO with complicated velocity models in the OpenFWI datasets. Furthermore, the cross-dataset generalization test verifies that PFNO adapts to out-of-distribution velocity models. Also, PFNO has robust performance in the presence of random noise in the labels. Finally, PFNO admits higher computational efficiency on large-scale testing datasets, compared with the traditional finite-difference method. The aforementioned advantages endow the FNO-based solver with the potential to build powerful models for research on seismic waves. ",

Based on such features, we develop a set of multi-scale temporal representations that force the motion context to be richly described at various levels of temporal resolution. Furthermore, a correction block is devised to eliminate the segmentation noise of silhouettes for getting more precise gait information. Subsequently, the temporal feature set and the spatial features are combined to comprehensively characterize gait processes.

Numerous data-driven classification techniques have demonstrated promising results for predicting user intent, but the performance of these intent prediction models on novel subjects remains undesirable. In other domains (e.g., image classification), transfer learning has improved classification accuracy by using previously learned features from a large dataset (i.e., pre-trained models) and then transferring this learned model to a new task where a smaller dataset is available. In this paper, we develop a deep convolutional neural network with intra-subject (subject-dependent) and inter-subject (subject-independent) validations based on a human locomotion dataset. We then apply transfer learning for the subject-independent model using a small portion (10%) of the data from the left-out subject. We compare the performance of these three models. Our results indicate that the transfer learning (TL) model outperforms the subject-independent (IND) model and is comparable to the subject-dependent (DEP) model (DEP Error: 0.74 $\\pm$ 0.002%, IND Error: 11.59 $\\pm$ 0.076%, TL Error: 3.57 $\\pm$ 0.02% with 10% data). Moreover, as expected, transfer learning accuracy increases with the availability of more data from the left-out subject. We also evaluate the performance of the intent prediction system in various sensor configurations that may be available in a prosthetic leg application. Our results suggest that a thigh IMU on the the prosthesis is sufficient to predict locomotion intent in practice. ",

Most previous studies on efficient analysis and prediction of traffic accidents, however, have used small-scale datasets with limited coverage, which limits their effect and applicability. Existing datasets in traffic accidents are either small-scale, not from surveillance cameras, not open-sourced, or not built for freeway scenes. Since accidents happened in freeways tend to cause serious damage and are too fast to catch the spot. An open-sourced datasets targeting on freeway traffic accidents collected from surveillance cameras is in great need and of practical importance. In order to help the vision community address these shortcomings, we endeavor to collect video data of real traffic accidents that covered abundant scenes. After integration and annotation by various dimensions, a large-scale traffic accidents dataset named TAD is proposed in this work. Various experiments on image classification, object detection, and video classification tasks, using public mainstream vision algorithms or frameworks are conducted in this work to demonstrate performance of different methods.

Such local activities however can signify important abnormal events in physiological systems, such as an extra foci triggering an abnormal propagation of electrical waves in the heart. We discuss a novel technique for reconstructing such local activity that, while small in signal strength, is the cause of subsequent global activities that have larger signal strength. Our central innovation is to approach this by explicitly modeling and disentangling how the latent state of a system is influenced by potential hidden internal interventions. In a novel neural formulation of state-space models (SSMs), we first introduce causal-effect modeling of the latent dynamics via a system of interacting neural ODEs that separately describes 1) the continuous-time dynamics of the internal intervention, and 2) its effect on the trajectory of the system's native state. Because the intervention can not be directly observed but have to be disentangled from the observed subsequent effect, we integrate knowledge of the native intervention-free dynamics of a system, and infer the hidden intervention by assuming it to be responsible for differences observed between the actual and hypothetical intervention-free dynamics. We demonstrated a proof-of-concept of the presented framework on reconstructing ectopic foci disrupting the course of normal cardiac electrical propagation from remote observations. ",

In smart monitoring, object detection from point cloud data acquired by 3D image sensors is implemented for detecting moving objects such as vehicles and pedestrians to ensure safety on the road.

Although a variety of deep learning (DL) models for object detection from point cloud data have been studied to date, no research has considered how to use multiple DL models in accordance with the features of the point cloud data. In this work, we propose a feature-based model selection framework that creates various DL models by using multiple DL methods and by utilizing training data with pseudo incompleteness generated by two artificial techniques: sampling and noise adding. It selects the most suitable DL model for the object detection task in accordance with the features of the point cloud data acquired in the real environment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compare the performance of multiple DL models using benchmark datasets created from the KITTI dataset and present example results of object detection obtained through a real outdoor experiment. Depending on the situation, the detection accuracy varies up to 32% between DL models, which confirms the importance of selecting an appropriate DL model according to the situation. ",

In this paper, a novel Self-Supervised Guided Segmentation Framework (SGSF) is proposed by jointly exploring effective generation method of forged anomalous samples and the normal sample features as the guidance information of segmentation for anomaly detection. Specifically, to ensure that the generated forged anomaly samples are conducive to model training, the Saliency Augmentation Module (SAM) is proposed. SAM introduces a saliency map to generate saliency Perlin noise map, and develops an adaptive segmentation strategy to generate irregular masks in the saliency region. Then, the masks are utilized to generate forged anomalous samples as negative samples for training. Unfortunately, the distribution gap between forged and real anomaly samples makes it difficult for models trained based on forged samples to effectively locate real anomalies. Towards this end, the Self-supervised Guidance Network (SGN) is proposed. It leverages the self-supervised module to extract features that are noise-free and contain normal semantic information as the prior knowledge of the segmentation module. The segmentation module with the knowledge of normal patterns segments out the abnormal regions that are different from the guidance features. To evaluate the effectiveness of SGSF for anomaly detection, extensive experiments are conducted on three anomaly detection datasets. The experimental results show that SGSF achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection results. ",

Unfortunately, the existing memory module is not fully applicable to the anomaly detection task, and the reconstruction error of the anomaly samples remains small. Towards this end, this work proposes a new unsupervised visual anomaly detection method to jointly learn effective normal features and eliminate unfavorable reconstruction errors. Specifically, a novel Partition Memory Bank (PMB) module is proposed to effectively learn and store detailed features with semantic integrity of normal samples. It develops a new partition mechanism and a unique query generation method to preserve the context information and then improves the learning ability of the memory module. The proposed PMB and the skip connection are alternatively explored to make the reconstruction of abnormal samples worse. To obtain more precise anomaly localization results and solve the problem of cumulative reconstruction error, a novel Histogram Error Estimation module is proposed to adaptively eliminate the unfavorable errors by the histogram of the difference image. It improves the anomaly localization performance without increasing the cost. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for anomaly detection and localization, extensive experiments are conducted on three widely-used anomaly detection datasets. The encouraging performance of the proposed method compared to the recent approaches based on the memory module demonstrates its superiority. ",

These improvements become even more sound due to new capabilities provided by deep learning. However, usage of deep learning is limited to areas where researchers possess large amounts of high-quality data. We present an approach that provides universal data representations suitable for solutions to different problems for different oil fields with little additional data. Our approach relies on the self-supervised methodology for sequential logging data for intervals from well, so it also doesn't require labelled data from the start. For validation purposes of the received representations, we consider classification and clusterization problems. We as well consider the transfer learning scenario. We found out that using the variational autoencoder leads to the most reliable and accurate models. approach We also found that a researcher only needs a tiny separate data set for the target oil field to solve a specific problem on top of universal representations.

Recent studies have explored several models in object detection; however, most have failed to meet the demand for objectiveness and predictive accuracy, especially in developing and under-developed countries. Consequently, several global security threats have necessitated the development of efficient approaches to tackle these issues. This paper proposes an object detection model for cyber-physical systems known as Smart Surveillance Systems (3s). This research proposes a 2-phase approach, highlighting the advantages of YOLO v3 deep learning architecture in real-time and visual object detection. A transfer learning approach was implemented for this research to reduce training time and computing resources. The dataset utilized for training the model is the MS COCO dataset which contains 328,000 annotated image instances. Deep learning techniques such as Pre-processing, Data pipelining, and detection was implemented to improve efficiency. Compared to other novel research models, the proposed model's results performed exceedingly well in detecting WILD objects in surveillance footages.

The detection scheme uses linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) as constraints with $\\mathcal{H}_{-}/\\mathcal{H}_{\\infty}$ optimization to achieve sensitiveness to faults and robustness against disturbances or parametric uncertainties. We explore a nonlinear inverter model formulation based on the less-restrictive one-sided Lipschitz and quadratic inner-boundedness conditions instead of a formulation based on the Lipschitz condition. In this sense, we aim to overcome the sensitivity of observer-based schemes to the Lipschitz constant. The relation between these two formulations for fault detection is analyzed theoretically. We find the deterministic matrix expressions of different faults, such as three-phase, actuator, inverter bridge, and sensor faults. The performance of the proposed detection scheme is assessed in an islanded AC microgrid with four grid-forming inverters. ",

    "abstract": "Estimating the similarity between two legal case documents is an important and challenging problem, having various downstream applications such as prior-case retrieval and citation recommendation. There are two broad approaches for the task -- citation network-based and text-based. Prior citation network-based approaches consider citations only to prior-cases (also called precedents) (PCNet). This approach misses important signals inherent in Statutes (written laws of a jurisdiction). In this work, we propose Hier-SPCNet that augments PCNet with a heterogeneous network of Statutes. We incorporate domain knowledge for legal document similarity into Hier-SPCNet, thereby obtaining state-of-the-art results for network-based legal document similarity. Both textual and network similarity provide important signals for legal case similarity; but till now, only trivial attempts have been made to unify the two signals. In this work, we apply several methods for combining textual and network information for estimating legal case similarity. We perform extensive experiments over legal case documents from the Indian judiciary, where the gold standard similarity between document-pairs is judged by law experts from two reputed Law institutes in India. Our experiments establish that our proposed network-based methods significantly improve the correlation with domain experts' opinion when compared to the existing methods for network-based legal document similarity. Our best-performing combination method (that combines network-based and text-based similarity) improves the correlation with domain experts' opinion by 11.8% over the best text-based method and 20.6\\% over the best network-based method. We also establish that our best-performing method can be used to recommend / retrieve citable and similar cases for a source (query) case, which are well appreciated by legal experts. ",

We formulate the model as an evolutionary rate independent system (ERIS). In an earlier work we derived a homogenized continuum model, which has the form of linearized elastoplasticity, as evolutionary $\\Gamma$-limit as the lattice parameter tends to zero. In the present paper we introduce a periodic representative volume element approximation (RVE) for the homogenized system. As a main result we prove convergence of the RVE approximation as the size of the RVE tends to infinity. We also show that the hysteretic stress-strain relation of the effective system can be described with help of a generalized Prandt-Ishlinskii operator, and we prove convergence of a periodic RVE approximation for that operator. We combine the RVE approximation with a numerical scheme for rate-independent systems and obtain a computational scheme that we use to numerically investigate the homogenized system in the specific case when the original network is given by a two-dimensional lattice model. We simulate the response of the system to cyclic and uniaxial, monotonic loading, and numerically investigate the convergence rate of the periodic RVE approximation. In particular, our simulations show that the RVE error decays with the same rate as the RVE error in the static case of linear elasticity. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is increasingly deployed among multiple clients (e.g., mobile devices) to train a shared model over decentralized data. To address the privacy concerns, FL systems need to protect the clients' data from being revealed during training and also control the data leakage through trained models when exposed to untrusted domains. Distributed differential privacy (DP) offers an appealing solution in this regard as it achieves an informed tradeoff between privacy and utility without a trusted server. However, existing distributed DP mechanisms work impractically in real world. For instance, to handle realistic scenarios with \\emph{client dropout}, these existing mechanisms often make strong assumptions about client participation yet still result in either poor privacy guarantees or unsatisfactory training accuracy. We present Hyades, a distributed differentially private FL framework that is highly efficient and resilient to client dropout. First, we develop a new privacy accounting technique under the notion of Renyi DP that tightly bounds the privacy loss in the presence of dropout before client sampling in FL. This enables Hyades to set a minimum target noise level in each training round. Second, we propose a novel 'add-then-remove' masking scheme to enforce this target noise level, even though some sampled clients may still drop out in the end. Third, we design an efficient secure aggregation mechanism that optimally pipelines communication and computation for faster execution. Evaluation through large-scale cloud deployment shows that Hyades can efficiently handle client dropout in various realistic scenarios, attaining the optimal privacy-utility tradeoff and accelerating the training by up to 2.1$\\times$ compared to existing solutions.

Methods: From October 2019 to March 2022, we examined binocular uncorrected visual acuity, axial length, corneal curvature, and axial of 75,172 eyes from 37,586 adolescents aged 6-20 years in Chengdu, China. 80\\% samples consist of the training set and the remaining 20\\% form the testing set. Time-Aware Long Short-Term Memory was used to quantitatively predict the adolescents' spherical equivalent within two and a half years. Result: The mean absolute prediction error on the testing set was 0.273-0.257 for spherical equivalent, ranging from 0.189-0.160 to 0.596-0.473 if we consider different lengths of historical records and different prediction durations. Conclusions: Time-Aware Long Short-Term Memory was applied to captured the temporal features in irregularly sampled time series, which is more in line with the characteristics of real data and thus has higher applicability, and helps to identify the progression of myopia earlier. The overall error 0.273 is much smaller than the criterion for clinically acceptable prediction, say 0.75. ",

A conventional generative adversarial network (GAN)-based training algorithm significantly improves the quality of synthetic speech by reducing the statistical difference between natural and synthetic speech. However, the algorithm does not guarantee the generalization performance of the trained TTS model in synthesizing voices of unseen speakers who are not included in the training data. Our algorithm alternatively trains two deep neural networks: multi-task discriminator and multi-speaker neural TTS model (i.e., generator of GANs). The discriminator is trained not only to distinguish between natural and synthetic speech but also to verify the speaker of input speech is existent or non-existent (i.e., newly generated by interpolating seen speakers' embedding vectors). Meanwhile, the generator is trained to minimize the weighted sum of the speech reconstruction loss and adversarial loss for fooling the discriminator, which achieves high-quality multi-speaker TTS even if the target speaker is unseen. Experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm improves the quality of synthetic speech better than a conventional GANSpeech algorithm. ",

However, training sequence VAEs is challenging: autoregressive decoders can often explain the data without utilizing the latent space, known as posterior collapse. To mitigate this, state-of-the-art models weaken the powerful decoder by applying uniformly random dropout to the decoder input. We show theoretically that this removes pointwise mutual information provided by the decoder input, which is compensated for by utilizing the latent space. We then propose an adversarial training strategy to achieve information-based stochastic dropout. Compared to uniform dropout on standard text benchmark datasets, our targeted approach increases both sequence modeling performance and the information captured in the latent space. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting mechanical properties in metal additive manufacturing (MAM) is vital to ensure the printed parts' performance, reliability, and whether they can fulfill requirements for a specific application. Conducting experiments to estimate mechanical properties in MAM processes, however, is a laborious and expensive task. Also, they can solely be designed for a particular material in a certain MAM process. Nonetheless, Machine learning (ML) methods, which are more flexible and cost-effective solutions, can be utilized to predict mechanical properties based on the processing parameters and material properties. To this end, in this work, a comprehensive framework for benchmarking ML for mechanical properties is introduced. An extensive experimental dataset is collected from more than 90 MAM articles and 140 MAM companies' data sheets containing MAM processing conditions, machines, materials, and resultant mechanical properties, including yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus, elongation, hardness as well as surface roughness. Physics-aware MAM featurization, adjustable ML models, and evaluation metrics are proposed to construct a comprehensive learning framework for mechanical properties prediction. Additionally, the Explainable AI method, i.e., SHAP analysis was studied to explain and interpret the ML models' predicted values for mechanical properties. Moreover, data-driven explicit models have been identified to estimate mechanical properties based on the processing parameters and material properties with more interpretability as compared to the employed ML models.

    "title": "Power System Anomaly Detection and Classification Utilizing WLS-EKF  State Estimation and Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "Power system state estimation is being faced with different types of anomalies. These might include bad data caused by gross measurement errors or communication system failures. Sudden changes in load or generation can be considered as anomaly depending on the implemented state estimation method. Additionally, considering power grid as a cyber physical system, state estimation becomes vulnerable to false data injection attacks. The existing methods for anomaly classification cannot accurately classify (discriminate between) the above-mentioned three types of anomalies, especially when it comes to discrimination between sudden load changes and false data injection attacks. This paper presents a new algorithm for detecting anomaly presence, classifying the anomaly type and identifying the origin of the anomaly, i.e., measurements that contain gross errors in case of bad data, or bus(es) associated with load(s) experiencing a sudden change, or state variables targeted by false data injection attack. The algorithm combines analytical and machine learning (ML) approaches. The first stage exploits an analytical approach to detect anomaly presence by combining $\\chi^2$-test and anomaly detection index. The second stage utilizes ML for the classification of anomaly type and identification of its origin, with particular reference to discrimination between sudden load changes and false data injection attacks. The proposed ML based method is trained to be independent of the network configuration which eliminates retraining of the algorithm after network topology changes. The results obtained by implementing the proposed algorithm on IEEE 14 bus test system demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ",

Safe robot navigation around obstacles is an essential skill for such unicycle robots to perform diverse useful tasks in complex cluttered environments, especially around people and other robots. In this paper, as a more accurate alternative to the standard circular Lyapunov level sets, we introduce novel conic feedback motion prediction methods for bounding the close-loop motion trajectory of the kinematic unicycle robot model under a standard unicycle motion control approach. We present an application of unicycle feedback motion prediction for safe robot navigation using a reference governor, where the safety of the unicycle motion is continuously monitored based on the predicted robot motion. We investigate the role of motion prediction on robot behaviour in numerical simulations and conclude that accurate feedback motion prediction is key for safe and fast robot navigation. ",

    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, extensive use of information and communication technologies has been the main driver of the digitalization of power systems. Proper and secure monitoring of the critical grid infrastructure became an integral part of the modern power system. Using phasor measurement units (PMUs) to surveil the power system is one of the technologies that have a promising future. Increased frequency of measurements and smarter methods for data handling can improve the ability to reliably operate power grids. The increased cyber-physical interaction offers both benefits and drawbacks, where one of the drawbacks comes in the form of anomalies in the measurement data. The anomalies can be caused by both physical faults on the power grid, as well as disturbances, errors, and cyber attacks in the cyber layer. This paper aims to develop a hybrid AI-based model that is based on various methods such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and other relevant hybrid algorithms for anomaly detection in phasor measurement unit data. The dataset used within this research was acquired by the University of Texas, which consists of real data from grid measurements. In addition to the real data, false data that has been injected to produce anomalies has been analyzed. The impacts and mitigating methods to prevent such kind of anomalies are discussed. ",

For a vehicle-borne sensor network with time-varying transmission delays, the problem of coordinate fusion of vehicle state is the focus of this paper. By the ingeniously designed low-complexity integration with a consensus strategy and buffer technology, an anti-delay distributed Kalman filter (DKF) with finite-time convergence is proposed.By introducing the matrix weight to assess local estimates, the optimal fusion state result is available in the sense of linear minimum variance. In addition, to accommodate practical engineering in intelligent vehicles, the communication weight coefficient and directed topology with unidirectional transmission are also considered. From a theoretical perspective, the proof of error covariances upper bounds with different communication topologies with delays are presented. Furthermore, the maximum allowable delays of vehicle-borne sensor network is derived backwards. Simulations verify that while considering various non-ideal factors above, the proposed DFK algorithm produces more accurate and robust fusion estimation state results than existing algorithms, making it more valuable in practical applications. Simultaneously, a mobile car trajectory tracking experiment is carried out, which further verifies the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "The design of a safe and reliable Autonomous Driving stack (ADS) is one of the most challenging tasks of our era. These ADS are expected to be driven in highly dynamic environments with full autonomy, and a reliability greater than human beings. In that sense, to efficiently and safely navigate through arbitrarily complex traffic scenarios, ADS must have the ability to forecast the future trajectories of surrounding actors. Current state-of-the-art models are typically based on Recurrent, Graph and Convolutional networks, achieving noticeable results in the context of vehicle prediction. In this paper we explore the influence of attention in generative models for motion prediction, considering both physical and social context to compute the most plausible trajectories. We first encode the past trajectories using a LSTM network, which serves as input to a Multi-Head Self-Attention module that computes the social context. On the other hand, we formulate a weighted interpolation to calculate the velocity and orientation in the last observation frame in order to calculate acceptable target points, extracted from the driveable of the HDMap information, which represents our physical context. Finally, the input of our generator is a white noise vector sampled from a multivariate normal distribution while the social and physical context are its conditions, in order to predict plausible trajectories. We validate our method using the Argoverse Motion Forecasting Benchmark 1.1, achieving competitive unimodal results. ",

In recent decades, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used for image denoising. Most DNN-based image denoising methods require a large-scale dataset or focus on supervised settings, in which single/pairs of clean images or a set of noisy images are required. This poses a significant burden on the image acquisition process. Moreover, denoisers trained on datasets of limited scale may incur over-fitting. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a new self-supervised framework for image denoising based on the Tucker low-rank tensor approximation. With the proposed design, we are able to characterize our denoiser with fewer parameters and train it based on a single image, which considerably improves the model generalizability and reduces the cost of data acquisition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy images have been conducted. Empirical results show that our proposed method outperforms existing non-learning-based methods (e.g., low-pass filter, non-local mean), single-image unsupervised denoisers (e.g., DIP, NN+BM3D) evaluated on both in-sample and out-sample datasets.

In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a new Simple Graph Metric Learning - SGML - model with few trainable parameters based on Simple Graph Convolutional Neural Networks - SGCN - and elements of Optimal Transport theory. This model allows us to build an appropriate distance from a database of labeled (attributed) graphs to improve the performance of simple classification algorithms such as $k$-NN.

The latter is encoded via a tractable mixed-integer linear program into the set of constraints. In addition, our proposed framework is capable of considering bidirectionality without having recourse to complex and potentially inaccurate convexification approaches.

    "abstract": "3D point clouds have attracted increasing attention in architecture, engineering, and construction due to their high-quality object representation and efficient acquisition methods. Consequently, many point cloud feature detection methods have been proposed in the literature to automate some workflows, such as their classification or part segmentation. Nevertheless, the performance of point cloud automated systems significantly lags behind their image counterparts. While part of this failure stems from the irregularity, unstructuredness, and disorder of point clouds, which makes the task of point cloud feature detection significantly more challenging than the image one, we argue that a lack of inspiration from the image domain might be the primary cause of such a gap. Indeed, given the overwhelming success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image feature detection, it seems reasonable to design their point cloud counterparts, but none of the proposed approaches closely resembles them. Specifically, even though many approaches generalise the convolution operation in point clouds, they fail to emulate the CNNs multiple-feature detection and pooling operations. For this reason, we propose a graph convolution-based unit, dubbed Shrinking unit, that can be stacked vertically and horizontally for the design of CNN-like 3D point cloud feature extractors. Given that self, local and global correlations between points in a point cloud convey crucial spatial geometric information, we also leverage them during the feature extraction process. We evaluate our proposal by designing a feature extractor model for the ModelNet-10 benchmark dataset and achieve 90.64% classification accuracy, demonstrating that our innovative idea is effective.

Observations show that deep neural network classifiers usually tend to incorrectly classify out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs into in-distribution classes with high confidence. Existing works attempt to solve the problem by explicitly imposing uncertainty on classifiers when OOD inputs are exposed to the classifier during training. In this paper, we propose an alternative probabilistic paradigm that is both practically useful and theoretically viable for the OOD detection tasks. Particularly, we impose statistical independence between inlier and outlier data during training, in order to ensure that inlier data reveals little information about OOD data to the deep estimator during training. Specifically, we estimate the statistical dependence between inlier and outlier data through the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), and we penalize such metric during training. We also associate our approach with a novel statistical test during the inference time coupled with our principled motivation. Empirical results show that our method is effective and robust for OOD detection on various benchmarks.

The images comprise different scenarios with complex wounds caused by pressure, vascular ulcers, diabetes, burn, and complications after surgical interventions.

    "abstract": "When dealing with clinical text classification on a small dataset recent studies have confirmed that a well-tuned multilayer perceptron outperforms other generative classifiers, including deep learning ones. To increase the performance of the neural network classifier, feature selection for the learning representation can effectively be used. However, most feature selection methods only estimate the degree of linear dependency between variables and select the best features based on univariate statistical tests. Furthermore, the sparsity of the feature space involved in the learning representation is ignored. Goal: Our aim is therefore to access an alternative approach to tackle the sparsity by compressing the clinical representation feature space, where limited French clinical notes can also be dealt with effectively. Methods: This study proposed an autoencoder learning algorithm to take advantage of sparsity reduction in clinical note representation. The motivation was to determine how to compress sparse, high-dimensional data by reducing the dimension of the clinical note representation feature space. The classification performance of the classifiers was then evaluated in the trained and compressed feature space. Results: The proposed approach provided overall performance gains of up to 3% for each evaluation. Finally, the classifier achieved a 92% accuracy, 91% recall, 91% precision, and 91% f1-score in detecting the patient's condition. Furthermore, the compression working mechanism and the autoencoder prediction process were demonstrated by applying the theoretic information bottleneck framework. ",

We show that AirTrack outperforms state-of-the art baselines on the Amazon Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) Dataset. Multiple real world flight tests with a Cessna 172 interacting with general aviation traffic and additional near-collision flight tests with a Bell helicopter flying towards a UAS in a controlled setting showcase that the proposed approach satisfies the newly introduced ASTM F3442/F3442M standard for DAA. Empirical evaluations show that our system has a probability of track of more than 95% up to a range of 700m. Video available at https://youtu.be/H3lL_Wjxjpw . ",

    "abstract": "A geometric graph is a combinatorial graph, endowed with a geometry that is inherited from its embedding in a Euclidean space. Formulation of a meaningful measure of (dis-)similarity in both the combinatorial and geometric structures of two such geometric graphs is a challenging problem in pattern recognition. We study two notions of distance measures for geometric graphs, called the geometric edit distance (GED) and geometric graph distance (GGD). While the former is based on the idea of editing one graph to transform it into the other graph, the latter is inspired by inexact matching of the graphs. For decades, both notions have been lending themselves well as measures of similarity between attributed graphs. If used without any modification, however, they fail to provide a meaningful distance measure for geometric graphs -- even cease to be a metric. We have curated their associated cost functions for the context of geometric graphs. Alongside studying the metric properties of GED and GGD, we investigate how the two notions compare. We further our understanding of the computational aspects of GGD by showing that the distance is $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard to compute, even if the graphs are planar and arbitrary cost coefficients are allowed.

It helps network engineers improve test suites and thus increase network reliability. A key challenge in its development is that many network tests test the data plane instead of testing the configurations (control plane) directly. We must be able to efficiently infer which configuration elements contribute to tested data plane elements, even when such contributions are non-local (on remote devices) or non-deterministic. NetCov uses an information flow graph based model that precisely captures various forms of contributions and a scalable method to lazily infer contributions. Using it, we show that an existing test suite for Internet2 (a nation-wide backbone network in the USA) covers only 26% of the configuration lines. The feedback from NetCov makes it easy to define new tests that improve coverage. For Internet2, adding just three such tests covers an additional 17% of the lines. ",

    "abstract": "Operator networks have emerged as promising deep learning tools for approximating the solution to partial differential equations (PDEs). These networks map input functions that describe material properties, forcing functions and boundary data to the solution of a PDE. This work describes a new architecture for operator networks that mimics the form of the numerical solution obtained from an approximation of the variational or weak formulation of the problem. The application of these ideas to a generic elliptic PDE leads to a variationally mimetic operator network (VarMiON). Like the conventional Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) the VarMiON is also composed of a sub-network that constructs the basis functions for the output and another that constructs the coefficients for these basis functions. However, in contrast to the DeepONet, in the VarMiON the architecture of these networks is precisely determined. An analysis of the error in the VarMiON solution reveals that it contains contributions from the error in the training data, the training error, quadrature error in sampling input and output functions, and a \"covering error\" that measures the distance between the test input functions and the nearest functions in the training dataset. It also depends on the stability constants for the exact network and its VarMiON approximation. The application of the VarMiON to a canonical elliptic PDE reveals that for approximately the same number of network parameters, on average the VarMiON incurs smaller errors than a standard DeepONet. Further, its performance is more robust to variations in input functions, the techniques used to sample the input and output functions, the techniques used to construct the basis functions, and the number of input functions.

One of the most important methods used to achieve this success is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It has many application areas such as; virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), super resolution, image enhancement. Despite the recent advances in hair synthesis and style transfer using deep learning and generative modelling, due to the complex nature of hair still contains unsolved challenges. The methods proposed in the literature to solve this problem generally focus on making high-quality hair edits on images. In this thesis, a generative adversarial network method is proposed to solve the hair synthesis problem. While developing this method, it is aimed to achieve real-time hair synthesis while achieving visual outputs that compete with the best methods in the literature. The proposed method was trained with the FFHQ dataset and then its results in hair style transfer and hair reconstruction tasks were evaluated. The results obtained in these tasks and the operating time of the method were compared with MichiGAN, one of the best methods in the literature. The comparison was made at a resolution of 128x128. As a result of the comparison, it has been shown that the proposed method achieves competitive results with MichiGAN in terms of realistic hair synthesis, and performs better in terms of operating time.

In this regard, simulators provide a cheap and abundant source. For successful sim-to-real transfer, exhaustively engineered approaches such as system identification, dynamics randomization, and domain adaptation are generally employed. As an alternative, we investigate a simple strategy of random force injection (RFI) to perturb system dynamics during training. We show that the application of random forces enables us to emulate dynamics randomization.This allows us to obtain locomotion policies that are robust to variations in system dynamics. We further extend RFI, referred to as extended random force injection (ERFI), by introducing an episodic actuation offset. We demonstrate that ERFI provides additional robustness for variations in system mass offering on average a 61% improved performance over RFI. We also show that ERFI is sufficient to perform a successful sim-to-real transfer on two different quadrupedal platforms, ANYmal C and Unitree A1, even for perceptive locomotion over uneven terrain in outdoor environments.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a discrete-time multi-agent system involving $N$ cost-coupled networked rational agents solving a consensus problem and a central Base Station (BS), scheduling agent communications over a network. Due to a hard bandwidth constraint on the number of transmissions through the network, at most $R_d < N$ agents can concurrently access their state information through the network. Under standard assumptions on the information structure of the agents and the BS, we first show that the control actions of the agents are free of any dual effect, allowing for separation between estimation and control problems at each agent. Next, we propose a weighted age of information (WAoI) metric for the scheduling problem of the BS, where the weights depend on the estimation error of the agents. The BS aims to find the optimum scheduling policy that minimizes the WAoI, subject to the hard bandwidth constraint. Since this problem is NP hard, we first relax the hard constraint to a soft update rate constraint, and then compute an optimal policy for the relaxed problem by reformulating it into a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This then inspires a sub-optimal policy for the bandwidth constrained problem, which is shown to approach the optimal policy as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$. Next, we solve the consensus problem using the mean-field game framework wherein we first design decentralized control policies for a limiting case of the $N$-agent system (as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$). By explicitly constructing the mean-field system, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the mean-field equilibrium. Consequently, we show that the obtained equilibrium policies constitute an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the finite agent system. Finally, we validate the performance of both the scheduling and the control policies through numerical simulations. ",

Towards to ultimate usage of DNN, we present here a shallow neural network that uses mainly two convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, with relatively few parameters and fast to learn spectral-temporal features from EEG. We compared this models to three other neural network models with different depths applied to a mental arithmetic task using eye-closed state adapted for patients suffering from motor disorders and a decline in visual functions. Experimental results showed that the shallow CNN model outperformed all the other models and achieved the highest classification accuracy of 90.68%.

We study the identifiability of latent causal factors with and without interventional data, under minimal distributional assumptions on the latents. We prove that, if the true latent variables map to the observed high-dimensional data via a polynomial function, then representation learning via minimizing the standard reconstruction loss of autoencoders identifies the true latents up to affine transformation. If we further have access to interventional data generated by hard $do$ interventions on some of the latents, then we can identify these intervened latents up to permutation, shift and scaling. ",

Most tensor methods rely on the fact that we can eventually contract the tensor network to obtain the final result. While the contraction operation itself is trivial, its execution time is highly dependent on the order in which the contractions are performed. To this end, one tries to find beforehand an optimal order in which the contractions should be performed. However, there is a drawback: the general problem of finding the optimal contraction order is NP-complete. Therefore, one must settle for a mixture of exponential algorithms for small problems, e.g., $n \\leq 20$, and otherwise hope for good contraction orders. For this reason, previous research has focused on the latter part, trying to find better heuristics. In this work, we take a more conservative approach and show that tree tensor networks accept optimal linear contraction orders. Beyond the optimality results, we adapt two join ordering techniques that can build on our work to guarantee near-optimal orders for arbitrary tensor networks. ",

To further improve the prediction accuracy, in this paper, we focus on the ISAC in vehicle networks and propose a convolutional long-short term (CLSTM) recurrent neural network (CLRNet) to predict the angle of vehicles for the design of predictive beamforming. In the developed CLRNet, both the convolutional neural network (CNN) module and the LSTM module are adopted to exploit the spatial features and the temporal dependency from the estimated historical angles of vehicles to facilitate the angle prediction. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the developed CLRNet-based method is robust to the estimation error and can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving an excellent sum-rate performance for ISAC systems.

    "abstract": "With the beginning of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum neural network (QNN) has recently emerged as a solution for the problems that classical neural networks cannot solve. Moreover, QCNN is attracting attention as the next generation of QNN because it can process high-dimensional vector input. However, due to the nature of quantum computing, it is difficult for the classical QCNN to extract a sufficient number of features. Motivated by this, we propose a new version of QCNN, named scalable quantum convolutional neural network (sQCNN). In addition, using the fidelity of QC, we propose an sQCNN training algorithm named reverse fidelity training (RF-Train) that maximizes the performance of sQCNN. ",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have obtained remarkable performance via deep architectures. However, these CNNs often achieve poor robustness for image super-resolution (SR) under complex scenes. In this paper, we present a heterogeneous group SR CNN (HGSRCNN) via leveraging structure information of different types to obtain a high-quality image. Specifically, each heterogeneous group block (HGB) of HGSRCNN uses a heterogeneous architecture containing a symmetric group convolutional block and a complementary convolutional block in a parallel way to enhance internal and external relations of different channels for facilitating richer low-frequency structure information of different types. To prevent appearance of obtained redundant features, a refinement block with signal enhancements in a serial way is designed to filter useless information. To prevent loss of original information, a multi-level enhancement mechanism guides a CNN to achieve a symmetric architecture for promoting expressive ability of HGSRCNN. Besides, a parallel up-sampling mechanism is developed to train a blind SR model. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed HGSRCNN has obtained excellent SR performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) helps ophthalmologists assess macular edema, accumulation of fluids, and lesions at microscopic resolution. Quantification of retinal fluids is necessary for OCT-guided treatment management, which relies on a precise image segmentation step. As manual analysis of retinal fluids is a time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone task, there is increasing demand for fast and robust automatic solutions. In this study, a new convolutional neural architecture named RetiFluidNet is proposed for multi-class retinal fluid segmentation. The model benefits from hierarchical representation learning of textural, contextual, and edge features using a new self-adaptive dual-attention (SDA) module, multiple self-adaptive attention-based skip connections (SASC), and a novel multi-scale deep self supervision learning (DSL) scheme. The attention mechanism in the proposed SDA module enables the model to automatically extract deformation-aware representations at different levels, and the introduced SASC paths further consider spatial-channel interdependencies for concatenation of counterpart encoder and decoder units, which improve representational capability. RetiFluidNet is also optimized using a joint loss function comprising a weighted version of dice overlap and edge-preserved connectivity-based losses, where several hierarchical stages of multi-scale local losses are integrated into the optimization process. The model is validated based on three publicly available datasets: RETOUCH, OPTIMA, and DUKE, with comparisons against several baselines. Experimental results on the datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed model in retinal OCT fluid segmentation and reveal that the suggested method is more effective than existing state-of-the-art fluid segmentation algorithms in adapting to retinal OCT scans recorded by various image scanning instruments.

It is derived by measurements from four ground magnetometers in the geomagnetic equatorial regions. We present a new model for predicting $Dst$ with a lead time between 1 and 6 hours. The model is first developed using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network that is trained using solar wind parameters. The uncertainty of the $Dst$ model is then estimated by using the ACCRUE method [Camporeale et al. 2021]. Finally, a multi-fidelity boosting method is developed in order to enhance the accuracy of the model and reduce its associated uncertainty. It is shown that the developed model can predict $Dst$ 6 hours ahead with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 13.54 $\\mathrm{nT}$. This is significantly better than the persistence model and a simple GRU model. ",

    "abstract": "It is common for data structures such as images and shapes of 2D objects to be represented as points on a manifold. The utility of a mechanism to produce sanitized differentially private estimates from such data is intimately linked to how compatible it is with the underlying structure and geometry of the space. In particular, as recently shown, utility of the Laplace mechanism on a positively curved manifold, such as Kendall's 2D shape space, is significantly influences by the curvature. Focusing on the problem of sanitizing the Fr\\'echet mean of a sample of points on a manifold, we exploit the characterisation of the mean as the minimizer of an objective function comprised of the sum of squared distances and develop a K-norm gradient mechanism on Riemannian manifolds that favors values that produce gradients close to the the zero of the objective function. For the case of positively curved manifolds, we describe how using the gradient of the squared distance function offers better control over sensitivity than the Laplace mechanism, and demonstrate this numerically on a dataset of shapes of corpus callosa. Further illustrations of the mechanism's utility on a sphere and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices are also presented. ",

Early detection of this disease helps in better treatment and survival rate of the patient. Many deep learning algorithms are being used for the detection of cervical cancer these days. A special category of deep learning techniques known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are catching up with speed in the screening, detection, and classification of cervical cancer.

We evaluate four upstream SSL models based on their training method (masked reconstruction, masked prediction, autoregressive reconstruction, contrastive model). After applying the SSL model, the best performance improved by 5.23% for the dev set and 2.4% for the test set compared with the previous state-of-art baseline system even without a language model trained by a large corpus. Moreover, we study the generalization ability of the SSL features considering that those models were not trained on music datasets. ",

We start with a simple single-layer neural network (NN) but refrain from choosing the activation functions yet. Under certain conditions and in the infinite-width limit, we may apply the central limit theorem, upon which the NN output becomes Gaussian. We may then investigate and manipulate the limit network by falling back on Gaussian process (GP) theory. It is observed that linear operators acting upon a GP again yield a GP. This also holds true for differential operators defining differential equations and describing physical laws. If we demand the GP, or equivalently the limit network, to obey the physical law, then this yields an equation for the covariance function or kernel of the GP, whose solution equivalently constrains the model to obey the physical law. The central limit theorem then suggests that NNs can be constructed to obey a physical law by choosing the activation functions such that they match a particular kernel in the infinite-width limit. The activation functions constructed in this way guarantee the NN to a priori obey the physics, up to the approximation error of non-infinite network width. Simple examples of the homogeneous 1D-Helmholtz equation are discussed and compared to naive kernels and activations. ",
