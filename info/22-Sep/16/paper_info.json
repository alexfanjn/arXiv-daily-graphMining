    "abstract": "Images obtained under low-light conditions will seriously affect the quality of the images. Solving the problem of poor low-light image quality can effectively improve the visual quality of images and better improve the usability of computer vision. In addition, it has very important applications in many fields. This paper proposes a DEANet based on Retinex for low-light image enhancement. It combines the frequency information and content information of the image into three sub-networks: decomposition network, enhancement network and adjustment network. These three sub-networks are respectively used for decomposition, denoising, contrast enhancement and detail preservation, adjustment, and image generation. Our model has good robust results for all low-light images. The model is trained on the public data set LOL, and the experimental results show that our method is better than the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of vision and quality. ",

    "abstract": "A modern vehicle fitted with sensors, actuators, and Electronic Control Units (ECUs) can be divided into several operational subsystems called Functional Working Groups (FWGs). Examples of these FWGs include the engine system, transmission, fuel system, brakes, etc. Each FWG has associated sensor-channels that gauge vehicular operating conditions. This data rich environment is conducive to the development of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) technologies. Undercutting various PdM technologies is the need for robust anomaly detection models that can identify events or observations which deviate significantly from the majority of the data and do not conform to a well defined notion of normal vehicular operational behavior. In this paper, we introduce the Vehicle Performance, Reliability, and Operations (VePRO) dataset and use it to create a multi-phased approach to anomaly detection. Utilizing Temporal Convolution Networks (TCN), our anomaly detection system can achieve 96% detection accuracy and accurately predicts 91% of true anomalies. The performance of our anomaly detection system improves when sensor channels from multiple FWGs are utilized. ",

In practice, when processing large (RDF) graphs on top of relational BD systems, several design decisions emerge and cannot be decided automatically, e.g., the choice of the schema, the partitioning technique, and the storage formats. PPA, and in particular ranking functions, helps enable actionable insights on performance data, leading practitioners to an easier choice of the best way to deploy BD frameworks, especially for graph processing. However, the amount of experimental work required to implement PPA is still huge. In this paper, we present PAPyA 1, a library for implementing PPA that allows (1) preparing RDF graphs data for a processing pipeline over relational BD systems, (2) enables automatic ranking of the performance in a user-defined solution space of experimental dimensions; (3) allows user-defined flexible extensions in terms of systems to test and ranking methods. We showcase PAPyA on a set of experiments based on the SparkSQL framework. PAPyA simplifies the performance analytics of BD systems for processing large (RDF) graphs.We provide PAPyA as a public open-source library under an MIT license that will be a catalyst for designing new research prescriptive analytical techniques for BD applications.

    "abstract": "Humans leverage multiple sensor modalities when interacting with objects and discovering their intrinsic properties. Using the visual modality alone is insufficient for deriving intuition behind object properties (e.g., which of two boxes is heavier), making it essential to consider non-visual modalities as well, such as the tactile and auditory. Whereas robots may leverage various modalities to obtain object property understanding via learned exploratory interactions with objects (e.g., grasping, lifting, and shaking behaviors), challenges remain: the implicit knowledge acquired by one robot via object exploration cannot be directly leveraged by another robot with different morphology, because the sensor models, observed data distributions, and interaction capabilities are different across these different robot configurations. To avoid the costly process of learning interactive object perception tasks from scratch, we propose a multi-stage projection framework for each new robot for transferring implicit knowledge of object properties across heterogeneous robot morphologies. We evaluate our approach on the object-property recognition and object-identity recognition tasks, using a dataset containing two heterogeneous robots that perform 7,600 object interactions. Results indicate that knowledge can be transferred across robots, such that a newly-deployed robot can bootstrap its recognition models without exhaustively exploring all objects. We also propose a data augmentation technique and show that this technique improves the generalization of models.

The major challenge is that uncertainty results in difficulty in finding a feasible safe control in real-time. Existing methods usually simplify the problem such as restricting uncertainty type, ignoring control limits, or forgoing feasibility guarantees. In this work, we overcome these issues by proposing a robust safe control framework for bounded state-dependent uncertainties. We first guarantee the feasibility of safe control for uncertain dynamics by learning a control-limits-aware, uncertainty-robust safety index. Then we show that robust safe control can be formulated as convex problems (Convex Semi-Infinite Programming or Second-Order Cone Programming) and propose corresponding optimal solvers that can run in real-time. In addition, we analyze when and how safety can be preserved under unmodeled uncertainties. Experiment results show that our method successfully finds robust safe control in real-time for different uncertainties and is much less conservative than a strong baseline algorithm. ",

Network node deployment has been considered as an effective approach for throughput enhancement which, however, often leads to highly non-trivial non-convex optimizations. Although convex approximation based solutions are considered in the literature, their approximation to the actual throughput may be loose and sometimes lead to unsatisfactory performance. With this consideration, in this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) method for the network node deployment problem. Specifically, we fit a GNN to the network throughput and use the gradients of this GNN to iteratively update the locations of the network nodes. Besides, we show that an expressive GNN has the capacity to approximate both the function value and the gradients of a multivariate permutation-invariant function, as a theoretic support to the proposed method. To further improve the throughput, we also study a hybrid node deployment method based on this approach. To train the desired GNN, we adopt a policy gradient algorithm to create datasets containing good training samples. Numerical experiments show that the proposed methods produce competitive results compared to the baselines. ",

Existing research has shown that maliciously perturbed inputs specifically tailored for a given model (i.e., adversarial examples) can be successfully transferred to another independently trained model to induce prediction errors. Moreover, this property of adversarial examples has been attributed to features derived from predictive patterns in the data distribution. Thus, we are motivated to investigate the following question: Can adversarial defenses, like adversarial examples, be successfully transferred to other independently trained models? To this end, we propose a deep learning-based pre-processing mechanism, which we refer to as a robust transferable feature extractor (RTFE). After examining theoretical motivation and implications, we experimentally show that our method can provide adversarial robustness to multiple independently pre-trained classifiers that are otherwise ineffective against an adaptive white box adversary. Furthermore, we show that RTFEs can even provide one-shot adversarial robustness to models independently trained on different datasets. ",

However, network connectivity also plays a significant role on the learning curves of shallow networks, such as the classic Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). A fundamental problem is efficiently finding connectivity patterns that improve the learning curve. Recent principled approaches explicitly include network connections as parameters that must be optimized in the model, but often rely on continuous functions to represent connections and on explicit penalization. This work presents a method to find optimal connectivity patterns for RBMs based on the idea of network gradients: computing the gradient of every possible connection, given a specific connection pattern, and using the gradient to drive a continuous connection strength parameter that in turn is used to determine the connection pattern. Thus, learning RBM parameters and learning network connections is truly jointly performed, albeit with different learning rates, and without changes to the objective function. The method is applied to the MNIST data set showing that better RBM models are found for the benchmark tasks of sample generation and input classification. ",

    "abstract": "In the well-known complexity class NP, many combinatorial problems can be found, whose optimization counterpart are important for many practical settings. Those problems usually consider full knowledge about the input and optimize on this specific input. In a practical setting, however, uncertainty in the input data is a usual phenomenon, whereby this is normally not covered in optimization versions of NP problems. One concept to model the uncertainty in the input data, is \\textit{recoverable robustness}. In this setting, a solution on the input is calculated, whereby a possible recovery to a good solution should be guaranteed, whenever uncertainty manifests itself. That is, a solution $\\texttt{s}_0$ for the base scenario $\\textsf{S}_0$ as well as a solution \\texttt{s} for every possible scenario of scenario set \\textsf{S} has to be calculated. In other words, not only solution $\\texttt{s}_0$ for instance $\\textsf{S}_0$ is calculated but solutions \\texttt{s} for all scenarios from \\textsf{S} are prepared to correct possible errors through uncertainty. This paper introduces a specific concept of recoverable robust problems: Hamming Distance Recoverable Robust Problems. In this setting, solutions $\\texttt{s}_0$ and \\texttt{s} have to be calculated, such that $\\texttt{s}_0$ and \\texttt{s} may only differ in at most $\\kappa$ elements. That is, one can recover from a harmful scenario by choosing a different solution, which is not too far away from the first solution. This paper surveys the complexity of Hamming distance recoverable robust version of optimization problems, typically found in NP for different types of scenarios. The complexity is primarily situated in the lower levels of the polynomial hierarchy. The main contribution of the paper is that recoverable robust problems with compression-encoded scenarios and $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ recoveries are $\\Sigma^P_{2m+1}$-complete. ",

The proposed cascade deep learning model is composed of an attention network, a mask region-based convolutional neural network (mask R-CNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The attention network learns a mapping from a US image to a suspected area of landmark motion in order to reduce the search region. The mask R-CNN then produces multiple region-of-interest (ROI) proposals in the reduced region and identifies the proposed landmark via three network heads: bounding box regression, proposal classification, and landmark segmentation. The LSTM network models the temporal relationship among the successive image frames for bounding box regression and proposal classification. To consolidate the final proposal, a selection method is designed according to the similarities between sequential frames. The proposed method was tested on the liver US tracking datasets used in the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) 2015 challenges, where the landmarks were annotated by three experienced observers to obtain their mean positions. Five-fold cross-validation on the 24 given US sequences with ground truths shows that the mean tracking error for all landmarks is 0.65+/-0.56 mm, and the errors of all landmarks are within 2 mm. We further tested the proposed model on 69 landmarks from the testing dataset that has a similar image pattern to the training pattern, resulting in a mean tracking error of 0.94+/-0.83 mm. Our experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of our proposed method in tracking liver anatomic landmarks using US images, providing a potential solution for real-time liver tracking for active motion management during radiation therapy.

    "title": "Finetuning Pretrained Vision-Language Models with Correlation  Information Bottleneck for Robust Visual Question Answering",
    "abstract": "Benefiting from large-scale Pretrained Vision-Language Models (VL-PMs), the performance of Visual Question Answering (VQA) has started to approach human oracle performance. However, finetuning large-scale VL-PMs with limited data for VQA usually faces overfitting and poor generalization issues, leading to a lack of robustness. In this paper, we aim to improve the robustness of VQA systems (ie, the ability of the systems to defend against input variations and human-adversarial attacks) from the perspective of Information Bottleneck when finetuning VL-PMs for VQA. Generally, internal representations obtained by VL-PMs inevitably contain irrelevant and redundant information for the downstream VQA task, resulting in statistically spurious correlations and insensitivity to input variations. To encourage representations to converge to a minimal sufficient statistic in vision-language learning, we propose the Correlation Information Bottleneck (CIB) principle, which seeks a tradeoff between representation compression and redundancy by minimizing the mutual information (MI) between the inputs and internal representations while maximizing the MI between the outputs and the representations. Meanwhile, CIB measures the internal correlations among visual and linguistic inputs and representations by a symmetrized joint MI estimation. Extensive experiments on five VQA benchmarks of input robustness and two VQA benchmarks of human-adversarial robustness demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CIB in improving the robustness of VQA systems.

AMQ-PDS are increasingly being deployed in environments where adversaries can gain benefit from carefully selecting inputs, for example to increase the false positive rate of an AMQ-PDS. They are also being used in settings where the inputs are sensitive and should remain private in the face of adversaries who can access an AMQ-PDS through an API or who can learn its internal state by compromising the system running the AMQ-PDS. We develop simulation-based security definitions that speak to correctness and privacy of AMQ-PDS. Our definitions are general and apply to a broad range of adversarial settings. We use our definitions to analyse the behaviour of both Bloom filters and insertion-only Cuckoo filters. We show that these AMQ-PDS can be provably protected through replacement or composition of hash functions with keyed pseudorandom functions in their construction. We also examine the practical impact on storage size and computation of providing secure instances of Bloom and insertion-only Cuckoo filters. ",

    "abstract": "Despite recent success of self-supervised based contrastive learning model for 3D point clouds representation, the adversarial robustness of such pre-trained models raised concerns. Adversarial contrastive learning (ACL) is considered an effective way to improve the robustness of pre-trained models. In contrastive learning, the projector is considered an effective component for removing unnecessary feature information during contrastive pretraining and most ACL works also use contrastive loss with projected feature representations to generate adversarial examples in pretraining, while \"unprojected \" feature representations are used in generating adversarial inputs during inference.Because of the distribution gap between projected and \"unprojected\" features, their models are constrained of obtaining robust feature representations for downstream tasks. We introduce a new method to generate high-quality 3D adversarial examples for adversarial training by utilizing virtual adversarial loss with \"unprojected\" feature representations in contrastive learning framework. We present our robust aware loss function to train self-supervised contrastive learning framework adversarially. Furthermore, we find selecting high difference points with the Difference of Normal (DoN) operator as additional input for adversarial self-supervised contrastive learning can significantly improve the adversarial robustness of the pre-trained model. We validate our method, PointACL on downstream tasks, including 3D classification and 3D segmentation with multiple datasets. It obtains comparable robust accuracy over state-of-the-art contrastive adversarial learning methods. ",

In this paper, we demonstrate that voice conversion can be used as a data augmentation technique to improve ASR performance, even on LibriSpeech, which contains 2,456 speakers. For ASR augmentation, it is necessary that the VC model be robust to a wide range of input speech. This motivates the use of a non-autoregressive, non-parallel VC model, and the use of a pretrained ASR encoder within the VC model. This work suggests that despite including many speakers, speaker diversity may remain a limitation to ASR quality. Finally, interrogation of our VC performance has provided useful metrics for objective evaluation of VC quality. ",

It holds noticeable advantage of high dynamic range, high speed response, and low power budget that enable it to best capture local motions in uncontrolled environments. This motivates us to unlock the potential of event cameras for human pose estimation, as the human pose estimation with event cameras is rarely explored. Due to the novel paradigm shift from conventional frame-based cameras, however, event signals in a time interval contain very limited information, as event cameras can only capture the moving body parts and ignores those static body parts, resulting in some parts to be incomplete or even disappeared in the time interval. This paper proposes a novel densely connected recurrent architecture to address the problem of incomplete information. By this recurrent architecture, we can explicitly model not only the sequential but also non-sequential geometric consistency across time steps to accumulate information from previous frames to recover the entire human bodies, achieving a stable and accurate human pose estimation from event data. Moreover, to better evaluate our model, we collect a large scale multimodal event-based dataset that comes with human pose annotations, which is by far the most challenging one to the best of our knowledge. The experimental results on two public datasets and our own dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and strength of our approach. Code can be available online for facilitating the future research. ",

Since this is the first work to automatically update code in Android apps, we collect a history of 209,346 updated method pairs from 3,195 real-world Android applications available on Google Play stores that span 14 years (2008-2022). Through an extensive experiment on our curated datasets, the results show that AutoUpdate(1) achieves a perfect prediction of 25% based on the realistic time-wise evaluation scenario, which outperforms the two baseline approaches; (2) gains benefits at least 17% of improvement by using both Abs and BPE; (3) is able to recommend code updates for various purposes (e.g., fixing bugs, adding new feature, refactoring methods). On the other hand, the models (4) could produce optimistically high accuracy due to the unrealistic evaluation scenario (i.e., random splits), suggesting that researchers should consider time-wise evaluation scenarios in the future; (5) are less accurate for a larger size of methods with a larger number of changed tokens, providing a research opportunity for future work.

By introducing semantic information, SLAM can own higher stability and robustness rather than purely hand-crafted features. However, the high uncertainty of semantic detection networks prohibits the practical functionality of high-level information. To solve the uncertainty property introduced by semantics, this paper proposed a novel probability map based on the Gaussian distribution assumption. This map transforms the semantic binary object detection into probability results, which help establish a probabilistic data association between artificial features and semantic info. Through our algorithm, the higher confidence will be given higher weights in each update step while the edge of the detection area will be endowed with lower confidence. Then the uncertainty is undermined and has less effect on nonlinear optimization. The experiments are carried out in the TUM RGBD dataset, results show that our system improves ORB-SLAM2 by about 15% in indoor environments' errors.

Recently, autoregressive latent video models have proved to be a powerful video prediction tool, by separating the video prediction into two sub-problems: pre-training an image generator model, followed by learning an autoregressive prediction model in the latent space of the image generator. However, successfully generating high-fidelity and high-resolution videos has yet to be seen. In this work, we investigate how to train an autoregressive latent video prediction model capable of predicting high-fidelity future frames with minimal modification to existing models, and produce high-resolution (256x256) videos. Specifically, we scale up prior models by employing a high-fidelity image generator (VQ-GAN) with a causal transformer model, and introduce additional techniques of top-k sampling and data augmentation to further improve video prediction quality. Despite the simplicity, the proposed method achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches on standard video prediction benchmarks with fewer parameters, and enables high-resolution video prediction on complex and large-scale datasets.

    "abstract": "The variational auto-encoder has become a leading framework for symbolic music generation, and a popular research direction is to study how to effectively control the generation process. A straightforward way is to control a model using different conditions during inference. However, in music practice, conditions are usually sequential (rather than simple categorical labels), involving rich information that overlaps with the learned representation. Consequently, the decoder gets confused about whether to \"listen to\" the latent representation or the condition, and sometimes just ignores the condition. To solve this problem, we leverage domain adversarial training to disentangle the representation from condition cues for better control. Specifically, we propose a condition corruption objective that uses the representation to denoise a corrupted condition. Minimized by a discriminator and maximized by the VAE encoder, this objective adversarially induces a condition-invariant representation. In this paper, we focus on the task of melody harmonization to illustrate our idea, while our methodology can be generalized to other controllable generative tasks. Demos and experiments show that our methodology facilitates not only condition-invariant representation learning but also higher-quality controllability compared to baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Counterfactual risk minimization is a framework for offline policy optimization with logged data which consists of context, action, propensity score, and reward for each sample point. In this work, we build on this framework and propose a learning method for settings where the rewards for some samples are not observed, and so the logged data consists of a subset of samples with unknown rewards and a subset of samples with known rewards. This setting arises in many application domains, including advertising and healthcare. While reward feedback is missing for some samples, it is possible to leverage the unknown-reward samples in order to minimize the risk, and we refer to this setting as semi-counterfactual risk minimization. To approach this kind of learning problem, we derive new upper bounds on the true risk under the inverse propensity score estimator. We then build upon these bounds to propose a regularized counterfactual risk minimization method, where the regularization term is based on the logged unknown-rewards dataset only; hence it is reward-independent. We also propose another algorithm based on generating pseudo-rewards for the logged unknown-rewards dataset. Experimental results with neural networks and benchmark datasets indicate that these algorithms can leverage the logged unknown-rewards dataset besides the logged known-reward dataset. ",

Multiple categories of fairness improving methods have been proposed for neural networks, including pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing. Our empirical study however shows that these methods are not always effective (e.g., they may improve fairness by paying the price of huge accuracy drop) or even not helpful (e.g., they may even worsen both fairness and accuracy). In this work, we propose an approach which adaptively chooses the fairness improving method based on causality analysis. That is, we choose the method based on how the neurons and attributes responsible for unfairness are distributed among the input attributes and the hidden neurons. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach is effective (i.e., always identify the best fairness improving method) and efficient (i.e., with an average time overhead of 5 minutes). ",

Concerningly, there is evidence that some of these methods have already been adopted to produce fake social media profiles and content. We hypothesize that these advances have made detecting generated fake social media content in the feed extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the average user of social media. This paper presents the results of an experiment where 375 participants attempted to label real and generated profiles and posts in a simulated social media feed.

To evaluate whether this commitment is justified, the influence of computing precision (single and double precision) on the optimization performance of the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method (a second-order optimization algorithm) and RMSprop (a first-order algorithm) has been investigated. Tests of neural networks with one to five fully connected hidden layers and moderate or strong nonlinearity with up to 4 million network parameters have been optimized for Mean Square Error (MSE). The training tasks have been set up so that their MSE minimum was known to be zero. Computing experiments have disclosed that single-precision can keep up (with superlinear convergence) with double-precision as long as line search finds an improvement. First-order methods such as RMSprop do not benefit from double precision. However, for moderately nonlinear tasks, CG is clearly superior. For strongly nonlinear tasks, both algorithm classes find only solutions fairly poor in terms of mean square error as related to the output variance. CG with double floating-point precision is superior whenever the solutions have the potential to be useful for the application goal. ",

    "abstract": "For the past decades, face recognition (FR) has been actively studied in computer vision and pattern recognition society. Recently, due to the advances in deep learning, the FR technology shows high performance for most of the benchmark datasets. However, when the FR algorithm is applied to a real-world scenario, the performance has been known to be still unsatisfactory. This is mainly attributed to the mismatch between training and testing sets. Among such mismatches, face misalignment between training and testing faces is one of the factors that hinder successful FR. To address this limitation, we propose a face shape-guided deep feature alignment framework for FR robust to the face misalignment. Based on a face shape prior (e.g., face keypoints), we train the proposed deep network by introducing alignment processes, i.e., pixel and feature alignments, between well-aligned and misaligned face images. Through the pixel alignment process that decodes the aggregated feature extracted from a face image and face shape prior, we add the auxiliary task to reconstruct the well-aligned face image. Since the aggregated features are linked to the face feature extraction network as a guide via the feature alignment process, we train the robust face feature to the face misalignment. Even if the face shape estimation is required in the training stage, the additional face alignment process, which is usually incorporated in the conventional FR pipeline, is not necessarily needed in the testing phase. Through the comparative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the face misalignment with the FR datasets. ",

In this direction, and since WNoC implies close integration of multiple antennas on a chip anyway, in this paper we present a feasibility study of compact monopole antenna arrays in a flip-chip environment at millimeter-wave and sub-terahertz frequencies. By means of a full-wave solver, we evaluate the feasibility to create, at will, concentrations of field in different spots of the chip. This way, we set the steps towards spatial multiplexing that enables concurrent multicast communications and also increases the aggregate bandwidth of the wireless network. Our results at 60 GHz show two clearly separable parallel channels that radiate simultaneously from two opposite corners of the chip, achieving a Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) of around 40 dB, which proves that the channels are independent of each other even in such an enclosed environment. Further, we see potential to expand our approach to three or more concurrent channels, and to frequencies beyond 100 GHz. ",

This enables sound and complete PN verification with empirical validation on MNIST, CIFAR10 and STL10 datasets. We believe our method has its own interest to NN verification. ",

In this study, XCA image sequence O is regarded as a three-dimensional tensor input, vessel layer H is a sparse tensor, and background layer B is a low-rank tensor. Using tensor nuclear norm(TNN) minimization, a novel method for vessel layer extraction based on tensor robust principal component analysis(TRPCA) is proposed. Furthermore, considering the irregular movement of vessels and the dynamic interference of surrounding irrelevant tissues, the total variation(TV) regularized spatial-temporal constraint is introduced to separate the dynamic background E. Subsequently, for the vessel images with uneven contrast distribution, a two-stage region growth(TSRG) method is utilized for vessel enhancement and segmentation. A global threshold segmentation is used as the pre-processing to obtain the main branch, and the Radon-Like features(RLF) filter is used to enhance and connect broken minor segments, the final vessel mask is constructed by combining the two intermediate results. We evaluated the visibility of TV-TRPCA algorithm for foreground extraction and the accuracy of TSRG algorithm for vessel segmentation on real clinical XCA image sequences and third-party database. Both qualitative and quantitative results verify the superiority of the proposed methods over the existing state-of-the-art approaches. ",

This naturally and urgently calls for developing efficient neural control policies for stabilizing not only the deterministic equations but the stochastic systems as well. Here, in order to meet this paramount call, we propose two types of controllers, viz., the exponential stabilizer (ES) based on the stochastic Lyapunov theory and the asymptotic stabilizer (AS) based on the stochastic asymptotic stability theory. The ES can render the controlled systems exponentially convergent but it requires a long computational time; conversely, the AS makes the training much faster but it can only assure the asymptotic (not the exponential) attractiveness of the control targets. These two stochastic controllers thus are complementary in applications. We also investigate rigorously the linear controller and the proposed neural stochastic controllers in both convergence time and energy cost and numerically compare them in these two indexes. More significantly, we use several representative physical systems to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed controllers in stabilization of dynamical systems. ",

At optimality, further optimizing one objective will necessarily harm at least another objective, and decision-makers need to comprehensively explore multiple optima (called Pareto front) to pinpoint one final solution. We address the efficiency of finding the Pareto front. First, finding the front from scratch using stochastic multi-gradient descent (SMGD) is expensive with large neural networks and datasets. We propose to explore the Pareto front as a manifold from a few initial optima, based on a predictor-corrector method. Second, for each exploration step, the predictor solves a large-scale linear system that scales quadratically in the number of model parameters and requires one backpropagation to evaluate a second-order Hessian-vector product per iteration of the solver. We propose a Gauss-Newton approximation that only scales linearly, and that requires only first-order inner-product per iteration. This also allows for a choice between the MINRES and conjugate gradient methods when approximately solving the linear system. The innovations make predictor-corrector possible for large networks. Experiments on multi-objective (fairness and accuracy) misinformation detection tasks show that 1) the predictor-corrector method can find Pareto fronts better than or similar to SMGD with less time; and 2) the proposed first-order method does not harm the quality of the Pareto front identified by the second-order method, while further reduce running time.

The effect of depth closely depends on the initialization and the training mode. In particular, when initialized with LeCun initialization, depth helps robustness with lazy training regime. In contrast, when initialized with Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and He-initialization, depth hurts the robustness. Moreover, under non-lazy training regime, we demonstrate how the width of a two-layer ReLU network benefits robustness. Our theoretical developments improve the results by Huang et al.

    "abstract": "Driven by the need to accelerate numerical simulations, the use of machine learning techniques is rapidly growing in the field of computational solid mechanics. Their application is especially advantageous in concurrent multiscale finite element analysis (FE$^2$) due to the exceedingly high computational costs often associated with it and the high number of similar micromechanical analyses involved. To tackle the issue, using surrogate models to approximate the microscopic behavior and accelerate the simulations is a promising and increasingly popular strategy. However, several challenges related to their data-driven nature compromise the reliability of surrogate models in material modeling. The alternative explored in this work is to reintroduce some of the physics-based knowledge of classical constitutive modeling into a neural network by employing the actual material models used in the full-order micromodel to introduce non-linearity. Thus, path-dependency arises naturally since every material model in the layer keeps track of its own internal variables. For the numerical examples, a composite Representative Volume Element with elastic fibers and elasto-plastic matrix material is used as the microscopic model. The network is tested in a series of challenging scenarios and its performance is compared to that of a state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A remarkable outcome of the novel framework is the ability to naturally predict unloading/reloading behavior without ever seeing it during training, a stark contrast with popular but data-hungry models such as RNNs. Finally, the proposed network is applied to FE$^2$ examples to assess its robustness for application in nonlinear finite element analysis. ",

The classification problem asks to discriminate dissemination processes of different origins or parameters, e.g., infectious diseases with different infection probabilities. Our new kernel represents labeled temporal graphs in the feature space of temporal graphlets, i.e., small subgraphs distinguished by their structure, time-dependent node labels, and chronological order of edges. We introduce variants of our kernel based on classes of graphlets that are efficiently countable. For the case of temporal wedges, we propose a highly efficient approximative kernel with low error in expectation.

    "abstract": "As deep learning is now used in many real-world applications, research has focused increasingly on the privacy of deep learning models and how to prevent attackers from obtaining sensitive information about the training data. However, image-text models like CLIP have not yet been looked at in the context of privacy attacks. While membership inference attacks aim to tell whether a specific data point was used for training, we introduce a new type of privacy attack, named identity inference attack (IDIA), designed for multi-modal image-text models like CLIP. Using IDIAs, an attacker can reveal whether a particular person, was part of the training data by querying the model in a black-box fashion with different images of the same person. Letting the model choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the attacker can probe the model whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training. Through several experiments on CLIP, we show that the attacker can identify individuals used for training with very high accuracy and that the model learns to connect the names with the depicted people. Our experiments show that a multi-modal image-text model indeed leaks sensitive information about its training data and, therefore, should be handled with care. ",

In the proposed game-theoretic setting, individuals choose whether to adopt protection or not based on the trade-off between the cost of adopting protection and the risk of infection; the latter depends on the current prevalence of the epidemic and the fraction of individuals who adopt protection in the entire population. We define the coupled epidemic-behavioral dynamics by modeling the evolution of individual protection adoption behavior according to the replicator dynamics. For the SIS epidemic, we fully characterize the equilibria and their stability properties. We further analyze the coupled dynamics under timescale separation when individual behavior evolves faster than the epidemic, and characterize the equilibria of the resulting discontinuous hybrid dynamical system for both SIS and SIRI models. Numerical results illustrate how the coupled dynamics exhibits oscillatory behavior and convergence to sliding mode solutions under suitable parameter regimes. ",

In this work, we present a facial 3D Morphable Model, which exploits both of the above, and can accurately model a subject's identity, pose and expression and render it in arbitrary illumination. This is achieved by utilizing a powerful deep style-based generator to overcome two main weaknesses of neural radiance fields, their rigidity and rendering speed. We introduce a style-based generative network that synthesizes in one pass all and only the required rendering samples of a neural radiance field. We create a vast labelled synthetic dataset of facial renders, and train the network on these data, so that it can accurately model and generalize on facial identity, pose and appearance. Finally, we show that this model can accurately be fit to \"in-the-wild\" facial images of arbitrary pose and illumination, extract the facial characteristics, and be used to re-render the face in controllable conditions.

Surveying a large area requires performing a lot of image classification tasks within a specific period of time in order to prevent damage to the farm in case of an incident, such as fire or flood. UAVs have limited energy and computing power, and may not be able to perform all of the intense image classification tasks locally and within an appropriate amount of time. Hence, it is assumed that the UAVs are able to partially offload their workload to nearby multi-access edge computing devices. The UAVs need a decision-making algorithm that will decide where the tasks will be performed, while also considering the time constraints and energy level of the other UAVs in the network. In this paper, we introduce a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) approach to solve this multi-objective problem. The proposed method is compared with Q-Learning and three heuristic baselines, and the simulation results show that our proposed DQL-based method achieves comparable results when it comes to the UAVs' remaining battery levels and percentage of deadline violations. In addition, our method is able to reach convergence 13 times faster than Q-Learning. ",

For their control issues, the challenge is to guarantee accuracy, robustness, and generalization in such bloated and troubled environments. Fortunately, a complex system can be divided into multiple modular structures that human cognition appears to exploit. Inspired by this cognition, a novel control method, Causal Coupled Mechanisms (CCMs), is proposed that explores the cooperation in division and competition in combination. Our method employs the theory of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), in which 1) the high-level policy with competitive awareness divides the whole complex system into multiple functional mechanisms, and 2) the low-level policy finishes the control task of each mechanism. Specifically for cooperation, a cascade control module helps the series operation of CCMs, and a forward coupled reasoning module is used to recover the coupling information lost in the division process. On both synthetic systems and a real-world biological regulatory system, the CCM method achieves robust and state-of-the-art control results even with unpredictable random noise. Moreover, generalization results show that reusing prepared specialized CCMs helps to perform well in environments with different confounders and dynamics. ",

In particular, we show, in a strong negative sense, the suboptimality of the robust learner proposed by Montasser, Hanneke, and Srebro (2019) and a broader family of learners we identify as local learners. Our results are enabled by adopting a global perspective, specifically, through a key technical contribution: the global one-inclusion graph, which may be of independent interest, that generalizes the classical one-inclusion graph due to Haussler, Littlestone, and Warmuth (1994). Finally, as a byproduct, we identify a dimension characterizing qualitatively and quantitatively what classes of predictors $\\mathcal{H}$ are robustly learnable. This resolves an open problem due to Montasser et al.

    "abstract": "This paper provides a theoretical study of deep neural function approximation in reinforcement learning (RL) with the $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration under the online setting. This problem setting is motivated by the successful deep Q-networks (DQN) framework that falls in this regime. In this work, we provide an initial attempt on theoretical understanding deep RL from the perspective of function class and neural networks architectures (e.g., width and depth) beyond the \"linear\" regime. To be specific, we focus on the value based algorithm with the $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration via deep (and two-layer) neural networks endowed by Besov (and Barron) function spaces, respectively, which aims at approximating an $\\alpha$-smooth Q-function in a $d$-dimensional feature space. We prove that, with $T$ episodes, scaling the width $m = \\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{\\frac{d}{2\\alpha + d}})$ and the depth $L=\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ of the neural network for deep RL is sufficient for learning with sublinear regret in Besov spaces. Moreover, for a two layer neural network endowed by the Barron space, scaling the width $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ is sufficient. To achieve this, the key issue in our analysis is how to estimate the temporal difference error under deep neural function approximation as the $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration is not enough to ensure \"optimism\". Our analysis reformulates the temporal difference error in an $L^2(\\mathrm{d}\\mu)$-integrable space over a certain averaged measure $\\mu$, and transforms it to a generalization problem under the non-iid setting. This might have its own interest in RL theory for better understanding $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration in deep RL. ",

    "abstract": "Treatment decisions in cancer care are guided by treatment effect estimates from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs estimate the average effect of one treatment versus another in a certain population. However, treatments may not be equally effective for every patient in a population. Knowing the effectiveness of treatments tailored to specific patient and tumor characteristics would enable individualized treatment decisions. Getting tailored treatment effects by averaging outcomes in different patient subgroups in RCTs requires an unfeasible number of patients to have sufficient statistical power in all relevant subgroups for all possible treatments. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) recommends that researchers develop outcome prediction models (OPMs) in an effort to individualize treatment decisions. OPMs sometimes called risk models or prognosis models, use patient and tumor characteristics to predict a patient outcome such as overall survival. The assumption is that the predictions are useful for treatment decisions using rules such as \"prescribe chemotherapy only if the OPM predicts the patient has a high risk of recurrence\". Recognizing the importance of reliable predictions, the AJCC published a checklist for OPMs to ensure dependable OPM prediction accuracy in the patient population for which the OPM was designed. However, accurate outcome predictions do not imply that these predictions yield good treatment decisions. In this perspective, we show that OPM rely on a fixed treatment policy which implies that OPM that were found to accurately predict outcomes in validation studies can still lead to patient harm when used to inform treatment decisions. We then give guidance on how to develop models that are useful for individualized treatment decisions and how to evaluate whether a model has value for decision-making. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we ask whether Vision Transformers (ViTs) can serve as an underlying architecture for improving the adversarial robustness of machine learning models against evasion attacks. While earlier works have focused on improving Convolutional Neural Networks, we show that also ViTs are highly suitable for adversarial training to achieve competitive performance. We achieve this objective using a custom adversarial training recipe, discovered using rigorous ablation studies on a subset of the ImageNet dataset. The canonical training recipe for ViTs recommends strong data augmentation, in part to compensate for the lack of vision inductive bias of attention modules, when compared to convolutions. We show that this recipe achieves suboptimal performance when used for adversarial training. In contrast, we find that omitting all heavy data augmentation, and adding some additional bag-of-tricks ($\\varepsilon$-warmup and larger weight decay), significantly boosts the performance of robust ViTs. We show that our recipe generalizes to different classes of ViT architectures and large-scale models on full ImageNet-1k. Additionally, investigating the reasons for the robustness of our models, we show that it is easier to generate strong attacks during training when using our recipe and that this leads to better robustness at test time. Finally, we further study one consequence of adversarial training by proposing a way to quantify the semantic nature of adversarial perturbations and highlight its correlation with the robustness of the model. Overall, we recommend that the community should avoid translating the canonical training recipes in ViTs to robust training and rethink common training choices in the context of adversarial training.

As NAS typically evaluates multiple models by training them partially or completely, the improved productivity comes at the cost of significant carbon footprint. To alleviate this expensive training routine, zero-shot/cost proxies analyze an NN at initialization to generate a score, which correlates highly with its true accuracy. Zero-cost proxies are currently designed by experts conducting multiple cycles of empirical testing on possible algorithms, data-sets, and neural architecture design spaces. This lowers productivity and is an unsustainable approach towards zero-cost proxy design as deep learning use-cases diversify in nature. Additionally, existing zero-cost proxies fail to generalize across neural architecture design spaces. In this paper, we propose a genetic programming framework to automate the discovery of zero-cost proxies for neural architecture scoring. Our methodology efficiently discovers an interpretable and generalizable zero-cost proxy that gives state of the art score-accuracy correlation on all data-sets and search spaces of NASBench-201 and Network Design Spaces (NDS). We believe that this research indicates a promising direction towards automatically discovering zero-cost proxies that can work across network architecture design spaces, data-sets, and tasks. ",

Further, the corresponding indexes between different sensor signals are established in advance in the data preprocessing, which enables faster cross-modal feature fusion. To address LiDAR points and image pixels misalignment problems, two new plug-and-play fusion modules, LiCamFuse and BiLiCamFuse, are proposed. In LiCamFuse, soft query weights with perceiving the Euclidean distance of bimodal features are proposed. In BiLiCamFuse, the fusion module with dual attention is proposed to deeply correlate the geometric and textural features of the scene.

To address these issues, we revisit the design paradigm of CNN for robotic perception tasks. We demonstrate that using parallel branches as opposed to serial stacked convolutional layers will be a more powerful design for robotic visual grasping tasks. In particular, guidelines of neural network design are provided for robotic perception tasks, e.g., high-resolution representation and lightweight design, which respond to the challenges in different manipulation scenarios. We then develop a novel grasping visual architecture referred to as HRG-Net, a parallel-branch structure that always maintains a high-resolution representation and repeatedly exchanges information across resolutions. Extensive experiments validate that these two designs can effectively enhance the accuracy of visual-based grasping and accelerate network training.

    "title": "Neural Networks Reduction via Lumping",
    "abstract": "The increasing size of recently proposed Neural Networks makes it hard to implement them on embedded devices, where memory, battery and computational power are a non-trivial bottleneck. For this reason during the last years network compression literature has been thriving and a large number of solutions has been been published to reduce both the number of operations and the parameters involved with the models. Unfortunately, most of these reducing techniques are actually heuristic methods and usually require at least one re-training step to recover the accuracy. The need of procedures for model reduction is well-known also in the fields of Verification and Performances Evaluation, where large efforts have been devoted to the definition of quotients that preserve the observable underlying behaviour. In this paper we try to bridge the gap between the most popular and very effective network reduction strategies and formal notions, such as lumpability, introduced for verification and evaluation of Markov Chains. Elaborating on lumpability we propose a pruning approach that reduces the number of neurons in a network without using any data or fine-tuning, while completely preserving the exact behaviour. Relaxing the constraints on the exact definition of the quotienting method we can give a formal explanation of some of the most common reduction techniques. ",

We close this gap by presenting Gollum -- a gold standard for large-scale multi source knowledge graph matching with over 275,000 correspondences between 4,149 different KGs. They originate from knowledge graphs derived by applying the DBpedia extraction framework to a large wiki farm. Three variations of the gold standard are made available: (1) a version with all correspondences for evaluating unsupervised matching approaches, and two versions for evaluating supervised matching: (2) one where each KG is contained both in the train and test set, and (3) one where each KG is exclusively contained in the train or the test set.

    "abstract": "Automatic depression detection on Twitter can help individuals privately and conveniently understand their mental health status in the early stages before seeing mental health professionals. Most existing black-box-like deep learning methods for depression detection largely focused on improving classification performance. However, explaining model decisions is imperative in health research because decision-making can often be high-stakes and life-and-death. Reliable automatic diagnosis of mental health problems including depression should be supported by credible explanations justifying models' predictions. In this work, we propose a novel explainable model for depression detection on Twitter. It comprises a novel encoder combining hierarchical attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. To support psycholinguistic studies, our model leverages metaphorical concept mappings as input. Thus, it not only detects depressed individuals, but also identifies features of such users' tweets and associated metaphor concept mappings. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) pre-training methods have been proposed to enhance the power of GNNs. Specifically, a GNN is first pre-trained on a large-scale unlabeled graph and then fine-tuned on a separate small labeled graph for downstream applications, such as node classification. One popular pre-training method is to mask out a proportion of the edges, and a GNN is trained to recover them. However, such a generative method suffers from graph mismatch. That is, the masked graph inputted to the GNN deviates from the original graph. To alleviate this issue, we propose DiP-GNN (Discriminative Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks). Specifically, we train a generator to recover identities of the masked edges, and simultaneously, we train a discriminator to distinguish the generated edges from the original graph's edges. In our framework, the graph seen by the discriminator better matches the original graph because the generator can recover a proportion of the masked edges. Extensive experiments on large-scale homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. ",

Of increasing interest is the autonomy for dynamic robots, such as multirotors, motor vehicles, and legged platforms. Here, disturbances and environmental conditions can have significant impact on the successful performance of the individual dynamic behaviors, referred to as \"motion primitives\". Despite this, robustness can be achieved by switching to and transitioning through suitable motion primitives. This paper contributes such a method by presenting an abstraction of the motion primitive dynamics and a corresponding \"motion primitive transfer function\". From this, a mixed discrete and continuous \"motion primitive graph\" is constructed, and an algorithm capable of online search of this graph is detailed. The result is a framework capable of realizing holistic robustness on dynamic systems. This is experimentally demonstrated for a set of motion primitives on a quadrupedal robot, subject to various environmental and intentional disturbances. ",

    "abstract": "We present new results for online contention resolution schemes for the matching polytope of graphs, in the random-order (RCRS) and adversarial (OCRS) arrival models. Our results include improved selectability guarantees (i.e., lower bounds), as well as new impossibility results (i.e., upper bounds). By well-known reductions to the prophet (secretary) matching problem, a $c$-selectable OCRS (RCRS) implies a $c$-competitive algorithm for adversarial (random order) edge arrivals. Similar reductions are also known for the query-commit matching problem. For the adversarial arrival model, we present a new analysis of the OCRS of Ezra et al.~(EC, 2020). We show that this scheme is $0.344$-selectable for general graphs and $0.349$-selectable for bipartite graphs, improving on the previous $0.337$ selectability result for this algorithm. We also show that the selectability of this scheme cannot be greater than $0.361$ for general graphs and $0.382$ for bipartite graphs. We further show that no OCRS can achieve a selectability greater than $0.4$ for general graphs, and $0.433$ for bipartite graphs. For random-order arrivals, we present two attenuation-based schemes which use new attenuation functions. Our first RCRS is $0.474$-selectable for general graphs, and our second is $0.476$-selectable for bipartite graphs. These results improve upon the recent $0.45$ (and $0.456$) selectability results for general graphs (respectively, bipartite graphs) due to Pollner et al.~(EC, 2022). On general graphs, our 0.474-selectable RCRS provides the best known positive result even for offline contention resolution, and also for the correlation gap. We conclude by proving a fundamental upper bound of 0.5 on the selectability of RCRS, using bipartite graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Scroll wave chaos is thought to underlie life-threatening ventricular fibrillation. However, currently there is no direct way to measure action potential wave patterns transmurally throughout the thick ventricular heart muscle. Consequently, direct observation of three-dimensional electrical scroll wave chaos remains elusive. Here, we study whether it is possible to reconstruct simulated three-dimensional scroll wave chaos inside a bulk-shaped excitable medium from two-dimensional observations of the wave dynamics on the bulk's surface using deep learning. We trained encoding-decoding convolutional neural networks to predict three-dimensional scroll wave chaos inside opaque and transparent as well as isotropic and anisotropic excitable media from two-dimensional projections or observations of the wave dynamics on the surface. We tested whether observations from one or two opposing surfaces would be sufficient, whether incorporating measurements of the surface deformation improves the reconstruction, and tested the feasibility of predicting the bulk's thickness. We demonstrate that it is possible to fully reconstruct three-dimensional scroll wave chaos in transparent excitable media with anisotropy and to obtain partial reconstructions in opaque excitable media when analyzing two opposing layers of the bulk. We found that anisotropy provides crucial information for neural networks to decode depth, which facilitates the reconstructions. In the future, deep neural networks could be used to visualize transmural action potential wave patterns during ventricular fibrillation from epi- or endocardial recordings. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we lay out a novel model of neuroplasticity in the form of a horizontal-vertical integration model of neural processing. We believe a new approach to neural modeling will benefit the 3rd wave of AI. The horizontal plane consists of an adaptive network of neurons connected by transmission links which generates spatio-temporal spike patterns. This fits with standard computational neuroscience approaches. Additionally for each individual neuron there is a vertical part consisting of internal adaptive parameters steering the external membrane-expressed parameters which are involved in neural transmission. Each neuron has a vertical modular system of parameters corresponding to (a) external parameters at the membrane layer, divided into compartments (spines, boutons) (b) internal parameters in the submembrane zone and the cytoplasm with its protein signaling network and (c) core parameters in the nucleus for genetic and epigenetic information. In such models, each node (=neuron) in the horizontal network has its own internal memory. Neural transmission and information storage are systematically separated, an important conceptual advance over synaptic weight models. We discuss the membrane-based (external) filtering and selection of outside signals for processing vs. signal loss by fast fluctuations and the neuron-internal computing strategies from intracellular protein signaling to the nucleus as the core system. We want to show that the individual neuron has an important role in the computation of signals and that many assumptions derived from the synaptic weight adjustment hypothesis of memory may not hold in a real brain. Not every transmission event leaves a trace and the neuron is a self-programming device, rather than passively determined by current input. Ultimately we strive to build a flexible memory system that processes facts and events automatically. ",

    "abstract": "In biomechanics, geometries representing complicated organic structures are consistently segmented from sparse volumetric data or morphed from template geometries resulting in initial overclosure between adjacent geometries. In FEA, these overclosures result in numerical instability and inaccuracy as part of contact analysis. Several techniques exist to fix overclosures, but most suffer from several drawbacks. This work introduces a novel automated algorithm in an iterative process to remove overclosure and create a desired minimum gap for 2D and 3D finite element models. The RBF Network algorithm was introduced by its four major steps to remove the initial overclosure. Additionally, the algorithm was validated using two test cases against conventional nodal adjustment. The first case compared the ability of each algorithm to remove differing levels of overclosure between two deformable muscles and the effects on mesh quality. The second case used a non-deformable femur and deformable distal femoral cartilage geometry with initial overclosure to test both algorithms and observe the effects on the resulting contact FEA. The RBF Network in the first case study was successfully able to remove all overclosures. In the second case, the nodal adjustment method failed to create a usable FEA model, while the RBF Network had no such issue. This work proposed an algorithm to remove initial overclosures prior to FEA that has improved performance over conventional nodal adjustment, especially in complicated situations and those involving 3D elements. The work can be included in existing FEA modeling workflows to improve FEA results in situations involving sparse volumetric segmentation and mesh morphing. This algorithm has been implemented in MATLAB, and the source code is publicly available to download at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/thor-andreassen/femors ",

In several practical cases where $\\phi=O(d)$, our result is the first regret bound for generalized linear model (GLM) bandits with the order $\\sqrt{d}$ without relying on the approach of Auer [2002]. We achieve this bound using a novel estimator called double doubly-robust (DDR) estimator, a subclass of doubly-robust (DR) estimator but with a tighter error bound. The approach of Auer [2002] achieves independence by discarding the observed rewards, whereas our algorithm achieves independence considering all contexts using our DDR estimator. We also provide an $O(\\kappa^{-1} \\phi \\log (NT) \\log T)$ regret bound for $N$ arms under a probabilistic margin condition. Regret bounds under the margin condition are given by Bastani and Bayati [2020] and Bastani et al. [2021] under the setting that contexts are common to all arms but coefficients are arm-specific. When contexts are different for all arms but coefficients are common, ours is the first regret bound under the margin condition for linear models or GLMs. We conduct empirical studies using synthetic data and real examples, demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Despite the significant advances, most existing super-resolution (SR) reconstruction network for medical images has two flaws: 1) All of them are designed in a black-box principle, thus lacking sufficient interpretability and further limiting their practical applications. Interpretable neural network models are of significant interest since they enhance the trustworthiness required in clinical practice when dealing with medical images. 2) most existing SR reconstruction approaches only use a single contrast or use a simple multi-contrast fusion mechanism, neglecting the complex relationships between different contrasts that are critical for SR improvement. To deal with these issues, in this paper, a novel Model-Guided interpretable Deep Unfolding Network (MGDUN) for medical image SR reconstruction is proposed. The Model-Guided image SR reconstruction approach solves manually designed objective functions to reconstruct HR MRI. We show how to unfold an iterative MGDUN algorithm into a novel model-guided deep unfolding network by taking the MRI observation matrix and explicit multi-contrast relationship matrix into account during the end-to-end optimization.

Effective association must determine the number of discrete events, their location and origin times, and it must differentiate real arrivals from measurement artifacts. The advent of deep learning pickers, which provide high rates of picks from closely overlapping small magnitude earthquakes, motivates revisiting the phase association problem and approaching it using the methods of deep learning. We have developed a Graph Neural Network associator that simultaneously predicts both source space-time localization, and discrete source-arrival association likelihoods. The method is applicable to arbitrary geometry, time-varying seismic networks of hundreds of stations, and is robust to high rates of sources and input picks with variable noise and quality. Our Graph Earthquake Neural Interpretation Engine (GENIE) uses one graph to represent the station set and another to represent the spatial source region. GENIE learns relationships from data in this combined representation that enable it to determine robust source and source-arrival associations. We train on synthetic data, and test our method on real data from the Northern California (NC) seismic network using input generated by the PhaseNet deep learning phase picker. We successfully re-detect ~96% of all events M>1 reported by the USGS during 500 random days between 2000$\\unicode{x2013}$2022. Over a 100-day continuous interval of processing in 2017$\\unicode{x2013}$2018, we detect ~4.2x the number of events reported by the USGS. Our new events have small magnitude estimates below the magnitude of completeness of the USGS catalog, and are located close to the active faults and quarries in the region. Our results demonstrate that GENIE can effectively solve the association problem under complex seismic monitoring conditions. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the rapid development of autonomous driving, the Internet of Things and streaming services, modern communication systems have to cope with varying channel conditions and a steadily rising number of users and devices. This, and the still rising bandwidth demands, can only be met by intelligent network automation, which requires highly flexible and blind transceiver algorithms. To tackle those challenges, we propose a novel adaptive equalization scheme, which exploits the prosperous advances in deep learning by training an equalizer with an adversarial network. The learning is only based on the statistics of the transmit signal, so it is blind regarding the actual transmit symbols and agnostic to the channel model. The proposed approach is independent of the equalizer topology and enables the application of powerful neural network based equalizers. In this work, we prove this concept in simulations of different -- both linear and nonlinear -- transmission channels and demonstrate the capability of the proposed blind learning scheme to approach the performance of non-blind equalizers. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical perspective and highlight the challenges of the approach. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have drawn more and more attention from material scientists and demonstrated a high capacity to establish connections between the structure and properties. However, with only unrelaxed structures provided as input, few GNN models can predict the thermodynamic properties of relaxed configurations with an acceptable level of error. In this work, we develop a multi-task (MT) architecture based on DimeNet++ and mixture density networks to improve the performance of such task. Taking CO adsorption on Cu-based single-atom alloy catalysts as an illustration, we show that our method can reliably estimate CO adsorption energy with a mean absolute error of 0.087 eV from the initial CO adsorption structures without costly first-principles calculations. Further, compared to other state-of-the-art GNN methods, our model exhibits improved generalization ability when predicting catalytic performance of out-of-domain configurations, built with either unseen substrate surfaces or doping species. We show that the proposed MT GNN strategy can facilitate catalyst discovery. ",

    "abstract": "We present a neural network architecture for medical image segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers and colonoscopy polyps. Diabetic foot ulcers are caused by neuropathic and vascular complications of diabetes mellitus. In order to provide a proper diagnosis and treatment, wound care professionals need to extract accurate morphological features from the foot wounds. Using computer-aided systems is a promising approach to extract related morphological features and segment the lesions. We propose a convolution neural network called HarDNet-DFUS by enhancing the backbone and replacing the decoder of HarDNet-MSEG, which was SOTA for colonoscopy polyp segmentation in 2021. For the MICCAI 2022 Diabetic Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (DFUC2022), we train HarDNet-DFUS using the DFUC2022 dataset and increase its robustness by means of five-fold cross validation, Test Time Augmentation, etc. In the validation phase of DFUC2022, HarDNet-DFUS achieved 0.7063 mean dice and was ranked third among all participants. In the final testing phase of DFUC2022, it achieved 0.7287 mean dice and was the first place winner. HarDNet-DFUS also deliver excellent performance for the colonoscopy polyp segmentation task. It achieves 0.924 mean Dice on the famous Kvasir dataset, an improvement of 1.2\\% over the original HarDNet-MSEG. The codes are available on https://github.com/kytimmylai/DFUC2022 (for Diabetic Foot Ulcers Segmentation) and https://github.com/YuWenLo/HarDNet-DFUS (for Colonoscopy Polyp Segmentation). ",

To illustrate the applicability of this combinatorial structure I calculate the components size statistics and identify the transition to a giant component. To this end I introduce a vectorization technique that tackles the multi-level nature of chygraphs. I conclude that chygraphs are a unifying representation of complex systems allowing for analytical insight. ",

    "abstract": "Solar flare prediction is a central problem in space weather forecasting and has captivated the attention of a wide spectrum of researchers due to recent advances in both remote sensing as well as machine learning and deep learning approaches. The experimental findings based on both machine and deep learning models reveal significant performance improvements for task specific datasets. Along with building models, the practice of deploying such models to production environments under operational settings is a more complex and often time-consuming process which is often not addressed directly in research settings. We present a set of new heuristic approaches to train and deploy an operational solar flare prediction system for $\\geq$M1.0-class flares with two prediction modes: full-disk and active region-based. In full-disk mode, predictions are performed on full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms using deep learning models whereas in active region-based models, predictions are issued for each active region individually using multivariate time series data instances. The outputs from individual active region forecasts and full-disk predictors are combined to a final full-disk prediction result with a meta-model. We utilized an equal weighted average ensemble of two base learners' flare probabilities as our baseline meta learner and improved the capabilities of our two base learners by training a logistic regression model. The major findings of this study are: (i) We successfully coupled two heterogeneous flare prediction models trained with different datasets and model architecture to predict a full-disk flare probability for next 24 hours, (ii) Our proposed ensembling model, i.e., logistic regression, improves on the predictive performance of two base learners and the baseline meta learner measured in terms of two widely used metrics True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Heidke Skill core (HSS), and (iii) Our result analysis suggests that the logistic regression-based ensemble (Meta-FP) improves on the full-disk model (base learner) by $\\sim9\\%$ in terms TSS and $\\sim10\\%$ in terms of HSS. Similarly, it improves on the AR-based model (base learner) by $\\sim17\\%$ and $\\sim20\\%$ in terms of TSS and HSS respectively. Finally, when compared to the baseline meta model, it improves on TSS by $\\sim10\\%$ and HSS by $\\sim15\\%$. ",

    "abstract": "Most models of complex systems have been homogeneous, i.e., all elements have the same properties (spatial, temporal, structural, functional). However, most natural systems are heterogeneous: few elements are more relevant, larger, stronger, or faster than others. In homogeneous systems, criticality -- a balance between change and stability, order and chaos -- is usually found for a very narrow region in the parameter space, close to a phase transition. Using random Boolean networks -- a general model of discrete dynamical systems -- we show that heterogeneity -- in time, structure, and function -- can broaden additively the parameter region where criticality is found. Moreover, parameter regions where antifragility is found are also increased with heterogeneity. However, maximum antifragility is found for particular parameters in homogeneous networks. Our work suggests that the \"optimal\" balance between homogeneity and heterogeneity is non-trivial, context-dependent, and in some cases, dynamic. ",

    "abstract": "Beam management is a challenging task for millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz communication systems, especially in scenarios with highly-mobile users. Leveraging external sensing modalities such as vision, LiDAR, radar, position, or a combination of them, to address this beam management challenge has recently attracted increasing interest from both academia and industry. This is mainly motivated by the dependency of the beam direction decision on the user location and the geometry of the surrounding environment -- information that can be acquired from the sensory data. To realize the promised beam management gains, such as the significant reduction in beam alignment overhead, in practice, however, these solutions need to account for important aspects. For example, these multi-modal sensing aided beam selection approaches should be able to generalize their learning to unseen scenarios and should be able to operate in realistic dense deployments. The \"Multi-Modal Beam Prediction Challenge 2022: Towards Generalization\" competition is offered to provide a platform for investigating these critical questions. In order to facilitate the generalizability study, the competition offers a large-scale multi-modal dataset with co-existing communication and sensing data collected across multiple real-world locations and different times of the day. In this paper, along with the detailed descriptions of the problem statement and the development dataset, we provide a baseline solution that utilizes the user position data to predict the optimal beam indices. The objective of this challenge is to go beyond a simple feasibility study and enable necessary research in this direction, paving the way towards generalizable multi-modal sensing-aided beam management for real-world future communication systems.
