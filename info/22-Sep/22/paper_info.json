    "title": "Collaborative Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "In recommendation systems, items are likely to be exposed to various users and we would like to learn about the familiarity of a new user with an existing item. This can be formulated as an anomaly detection (AD) problem distinguishing between \"common users\" (nominal) and \"fresh users\" (anomalous). Considering the sheer volume of items and the sparsity of user-item paired data, independently applying conventional single-task detection methods on each item quickly becomes difficult, while correlations between items are ignored. To address this multi-task anomaly detection problem, we propose collaborative anomaly detection (CAD) to jointly learn all tasks with an embedding encoding correlations among tasks. We explore CAD with conditional density estimation and conditional likelihood ratio estimation. We found that: $i$) estimating a likelihood ratio enjoys more efficient learning and yields better results than density estimation. $ii$) It is beneficial to select a small number of tasks in advance to learn a task embedding model, and then use it to warm-start all task embeddings. Consequently, these embeddings can capture correlations between tasks and generalize to new correlated tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer the knowledge of a well-labeled source domain to facilitate unlabeled target learning. When turning to specific tasks such as indoor (Wi-Fi) localization, it is essential to learn a cross-domain regressor to mitigate the domain shift. This paper proposes a novel method Adversarial Bi-Regressor Network (ABRNet) to seek more effective cross-domain regression model. Specifically, a discrepant bi-regressor architecture is developed to maximize the difference of bi-regressor to discover uncertain target instances far from the source distribution, and then an adversarial training mechanism is adopted between feature extractor and dual regressors to produce domain-invariant representations. To further bridge the large domain gap, a domain-specific augmentation module is designed to synthesize two source-similar and target-similar intermediate domains to gradually eliminate the original domain mismatch. The empirical studies on two cross-domain regressive benchmarks illustrate the power of our method on solving the domain adaptive regression (DAR) problem. ",

    "abstract": "This work investigates the challenge of learning and reasoning for Commonsense Question Answering given an external source of knowledge in the form of a knowledge graph (KG). We propose a novel graph neural network architecture, called Dynamic Relevance Graph Network (DRGN). DRGN operates on a given KG subgraph based on the question and answers entities and uses the relevance scores between the nodes to establish new edges dynamically for learning node representations in the graph network. This explicit usage of relevance as graph edges has the following advantages, a) the model can exploit the existing relationships, re-scale the node weights, and influence the way the neighborhood nodes' representations are aggregated in the KG subgraph, b) It potentially recovers the missing edges in KG that are needed for reasoning. Moreover, as a byproduct, our model improves handling the negative questions due to considering the relevance between the question node and the graph entities. Our proposed approach shows competitive performance on two QA benchmarks, CommonsenseQA and OpenbookQA, compared to the state-of-the-art published results. ",

We aim to characterize the dominant themes and sources present in the victim's posts along with identifying the role of the platform in handling deadly narratives. Our analysis reveals the overwhelming politicization of Covid-19 through the prevalence of anti-government themes propagated by right-wing political and media ecosystem. Furthermore, we highlight the failures of Facebook's implementation and completeness of soft moderation actions intended to warn users of misinformation. Results from this study bring insights into the responsibility of political elites in shaping public discourse and the platform's role in dampening the reach of harmful misinformation. ",

Rendering this data for visualization at high quality and interactive rates for demanding applications such as virtual reality is still not easily achievable even using professional-grade hardware. We introduce FoVolNet -- a method to significantly increase the performance of volume data visualization. We develop a cost-effective foveated rendering pipeline that sparsely samples a volume around a focal point and reconstructs the full-frame using a deep neural network. Foveated rendering is a technique that prioritizes rendering computations around the user's focal point. This approach leverages properties of the human visual system, thereby saving computational resources when rendering data in the periphery of the user's field of vision. Our reconstruction network combines direct and kernel prediction methods to produce fast, stable, and perceptually convincing output. With a slim design and the use of quantization, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural reconstruction techniques in both end-to-end frame times and visual quality. We conduct extensive evaluations of the system's rendering performance, inference speed, and perceptual properties, and we provide comparisons to competing neural image reconstruction techniques. Our test results show that FoVolNet consistently achieves significant time saving over conventional rendering while preserving perceptual quality. ",

In spite of the increasing accuracy, current data-driven approaches could easily learn biases from the imbalanced data distributions originating from humans. The deployment of biased models could further enhance the existing social biases. But unlike handling tabular data, defining and mitigating biases in text classifiers, which deal with unstructured data, are more challenging. A popular solution for improving machine learning fairness in NLP is to conduct the debiasing process with a list of potentially discriminated words given by human annotators. In addition to suffering from the risks of overlooking the biased terms, exhaustively identifying bias with human annotators are unsustainable since discrimination is variable among different datasets and may evolve over time. To this end, we propose an automatic misuse detector (MiD) relying on an explanation method for detecting potential bias. And built upon that, an end-to-end debiasing framework with the proposed staged correction is designed for text classifiers without any external resources required. ",

Our findings suggest that existing methods produce highly non-convex loss landscapes that are difficult to navigate. Furthermore, high-order PDEs contaminate the backpropagated gradients that may impede or prevent convergence. We then propose a novel method that bypasses the calculation of high-order PDE operators and mitigates the contamination of backpropagating gradients. In doing so, we reduce the dimension of the search space of our solution and facilitate learning problems with non-smooth solutions. Our formulation also provides a feedback mechanism that helps our model adaptively focus on complex regions of the domain that are difficult to learn. We then formulate an unconstrained dual problem by adapting the Lagrange multiplier method. We apply our method to solve several challenging benchmark problems governed by linear and non-linear PDEs.

Compared with regular neural networks deployed for machine-learning-as-a-service, PNet requires additional encoding, e.g., quantized-precision numbers, and polynomial activation. Encrypted input also introduces novel challenges such as adversarial robustness and security. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study questions including (i) Whether PNet is more robust against adversarial inputs than regular neural networks? (ii) How to design a robust PNet given the encrypted input without decryption? We propose PNet-Attack to generate black-box adversarial examples that can successfully attack PNet in both target and untarget manners. The attack results show that PNet robustness against adversarial inputs needs to be improved. This is not a trivial task because the PNet model owner does not have access to the plaintext of the input values, which prevents the application of existing detection and defense methods such as input tuning, model normalization, and adversarial training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new fast and accurate noise insertion method, called RPNet, to design Robust and Private Neural Networks. Our comprehensive experiments show that PNet-Attack reduces at least $2.5\\times$ queries than prior works. We theoretically analyze our RPNet methods and demonstrate that RPNet can decrease $\\sim 91.88\\%$ attack success rate. ",

To achieve this, and in contrast to traditional cellular networks, Magma adopts an approach that extensively leverages Internet design patterns, terminating access network-specific protocols at the edge and abstracting the access network from the core architecture. This decision allows Magma to refactor the wireless core using SDN (software-defined networking) principles and leverage other techniques from modern distributed systems. In doing so, Magma lowers cost and operational complexity for network operators while achieving resilience, scalability, and rich policy support. ",

The concept of layering is introduced to harmonize regular CF schemes with the framework of flow decomposition in the decode-forward setting. Layerings correspond to regular decoding schemes. Any desired compression rate-vector in the outerbound is achievable by some layering, which is found using the same \"shift\" operation in flow decomposition.

    "abstract": "The forecasting of credit default risk has been an active research field for several decades. Historically, logistic regression has been used as a major tool due to its compliance with regulatory requirements: transparency, explainability, and fairness. In recent years, researchers have increasingly used complex and advanced machine learning methods to improve prediction accuracy. Even though a machine learning method could potentially improve the model accuracy, it complicates simple logistic regression, deteriorates explainability, and often violates fairness. In the absence of compliance with regulatory requirements, even highly accurate machine learning methods are unlikely to be accepted by companies for credit scoring. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of monotonic neural additive models, which meet regulatory requirements by simplifying neural network architecture and enforcing monotonicity. By utilizing the special architectural features of the neural additive model, the monotonic neural additive model penalizes monotonicity violations effectively. Consequently, the computational cost of training a monotonic neural additive model is similar to that of training a neural additive model, as a free lunch. We demonstrate through empirical results that our new model is as accurate as black-box fully-connected neural networks, providing a highly accurate and regulated machine learning method. ",

To further improve the sample efficiency, meta-learning-based one-shot learning solutions were developed for skeleton-based action recognition.

However, such measurement holds unstable representativity due to inadequate generalized learning on local invariant and noisy features, while intuitively, more fine-grained recognition usually relies on determining key local body movements. To address this limitation, we present the Adaptive Local-Component-aware Graph Convolutional Network, which replaces the comparison metric with a focused sum of similarity measurements on aligned local embedding of action-critical spatial/temporal segments. Comprehensive one-shot experiments on the public benchmark of NTU-RGB+D 120 indicate that our method provides a stronger representation than the global embedding and helps our model reach state-of-the-art.

While machine learning methods have significantly improved model performance over traditional methods, their black-box structure makes it difficult for researchers to interpret results. For highly regulated financial industries, transparency, explainability, and fairness are equally, if not more, important than accuracy. Without meeting regulated requirements, even highly accurate machine learning methods are unlikely to be accepted. We address this issue by introducing a novel class of transparent and interpretable machine learning algorithms known as generalized gloves of neural additive models. The generalized gloves of neural additive models separate features into three categories: linear features, individual nonlinear features, and interacted nonlinear features. Additionally, interactions in the last category are only local. The linear and nonlinear components are distinguished by a stepwise selection algorithm, and interacted groups are carefully verified by applying additive separation criteria. Empirical results demonstrate that generalized gloves of neural additive models provide optimal accuracy with the simplest architecture, allowing for a highly accurate, transparent, and explainable approach to machine learning.

We develop a novel variational inference algorithm to approximate this posterior, optimizing a distribution of the neural network weights and of the truncation depth L, and without any upper limit on L. To this end, the variational family has a special structure: it models neural network weights of arbitrary depth, and it dynamically creates or removes free variational parameters as its distribution of the truncation is optimized. (Unlike heuristic approaches to model search, it is solely through gradient-based optimization that this algorithm explores the space of truncations.) We study the UDN on real and synthetic data.

    "abstract": "Optical computing is an emerging technology for next-generation efficient artificial intelligence (AI) due to its ultra-high speed and efficiency. Electromagnetic field simulation is critical to the design, optimization, and validation of photonic devices and circuits. However, costly numerical simulation significantly hinders the scalability and turn-around time in the photonic circuit design loop. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been proposed to predict the optical field solution of a single instance of a partial differential equation (PDE) with predefined parameters. Their complicated PDE formulation and lack of efficient parametrization mechanisms limit their flexibility and generalization in practical simulation scenarios. In this work, for the first time, a physics-agnostic neural operator-based framework, dubbed NeurOLight, is proposed to learn a family of frequency-domain Maxwell PDEs for ultra-fast parametric photonic device simulation. We balance the efficiency and generalization of NeurOLight via several novel techniques. Specifically, we discretize different devices into a unified domain, represent parametric PDEs with a compact wave prior, and encode the incident light via masked source modeling. We design our model with parameter-efficient cross-shaped NeurOLight blocks and adopt superposition-based augmentation for data-efficient learning. With these synergistic approaches, NeurOLight generalizes to a large space of unseen simulation settings, demonstrates 2-orders-of-magnitude faster simulation speed than numerical solvers, and outperforms prior neural network models by ~54% lower prediction error with ~44% fewer parameters.

    "abstract": "Link prediction (LP) has been recognized as an important task in graph learning with its board practical applications. A typical application of LP is to retrieve the top scoring neighbors for a given source node, such as the friend recommendation. These services desire the high inference scalability to find the top scoring neighbors from many candidate nodes at low latencies. There are two popular decoders that the recent LP models mainly use to compute the edge scores from node embeddings: the \\textbf{HadamardMLP} and \\textbf{Dot Product} decoders. After theoretical and empirical analysis, we find that the HadamardMLP decoders are generally more effective for LP. However, HadamardMLP lacks the scalability for retrieving top scoring neighbors on large graphs, since to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist an algorithm to retrieve the top scoring neighbors for HadamardMLP decoders in sublinear complexity. To make HadamardMLP scalable, we propose the \\textit{Flashlight} algorithm to accelerate the top scoring neighbor retrievals for HadamardMLP: a sublinear algorithm that progressively applies approximate maximum inner product search (MIPS) techniques with adaptively adjusted query embeddings. Empirical results show that Flashlight improves the inference speed of LP by more than 100 times on the large OGBL-CITATION2 dataset without sacrificing effectiveness. Our work paves the way for large-scale LP applications with the effective HadamardMLP decoders by greatly accelerating their inference. ",

However, such a model splitting imposes privacy concerns, because the activation flowing through the split layer may leak information about the clients' private input data. There is currently no good way to quantify how much private information is being leaked through the split layer, nor a good way to improve privacy up to the desired level. In this work, we propose to use Fisher information as a privacy metric to measure and control the information leakage. We show that Fisher information can provide an intuitive understanding of how much private information is leaking through the split layer, in the form of an error bound for an unbiased reconstruction attacker. We then propose a privacy-enhancing technique, ReFIL, that can enforce a user-desired level of Fisher information leakage at the split layer to achieve high privacy, while maintaining reasonable utility.

This is particularly important as pipelines are the most common way of transporting natural gas. This research aims to study the ability of data-driven intelligent models to detect small leaks for a natural gas pipeline using basic operational parameters and then compare the intelligent models among themselves using existing performance metrics. This project applies the observer design technique to detect leaks in natural gas pipelines using a regressoclassification hierarchical model where an intelligent model acts as a regressor and a modified logistic regression model acts as a classifier. Five intelligent models (gradient boosting, decision trees, random forest, support vector machine and artificial neural network) are studied in this project using a pipeline data stream of four weeks. The results shows that while support vector machine and artificial neural networks are better regressors than the others, they do not provide the best results in leak detection due to their internal complexities and the volume of data used. The random forest and decision tree models are the most sensitive as they can detect a leak of 0.1% of nominal flow in about 2 hours. All the intelligent models had high reliability with zero false alarm rate in testing phase. The average time to leak detection for all the intelligent models was compared to a real time transient model in literature. The results show that intelligent models perform relatively well in the problem of leak detection. This result suggests that intelligent models could be used alongside a real time transient model to significantly improve leak detection results. ",

In this work we explore the use of MDETR in a new task, action detection, without any previous training. We obtain quantitative results using the Atomic Visual Actions dataset. Although the model does not report the best performance in the task, we believe that it is an interesting finding. We show that it is possible to use a multi-modal model to tackle a task that it was not designed for.

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) can learn policies without explicitly defining the reward function from demonstrations. GAIL has the potential to learn policies with high-dimensional observations as input, e.g., images. By applying GAIL to a real robot, perhaps robot policies can be obtained for daily activities like washing, folding clothes, cooking, and cleaning. However, human demonstration data are often imperfect due to mistakes, which degrade the performance of the resulting policies. We address this issue by focusing on the following features: 1) many robotic tasks are goal-reaching tasks, and 2) labeling such goal states in demonstration data is relatively easy. With these in mind, this paper proposes Goal-Aware Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GA-GAIL), which trains a policy by introducing a second discriminator to distinguish the goal state in parallel with the first discriminator that indicates the demonstration data. This extends a standard GAIL framework to more robustly learn desirable policies even from imperfect demonstrations through a goal-state discriminator that promotes achieving the goal state. Furthermore, GA-GAIL employs the Entropy-maximizing Deep P-Network (EDPN) as a generator, which considers both the smoothness and causal entropy in the policy update, to achieve stable policy learning from two discriminators. Our proposed method was successfully applied to two real-robotic cloth-manipulation tasks: turning a handkerchief over and folding clothes. We confirmed that it learns cloth-manipulation policies without task-specific reward function design. Video of the real experiments are available at https://youtu.be/h_nII2ooUrE. ",

In the past, the road network graph is usually manually annotated by human experts, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Previous works either post-process semantic segmentation maps or propose graph-based algorithms to directly predict the road network graph. However, previous works suffer from hard-coded heuristic processing algorithms and inferior final performance. To enhance the previous SOTA (State-of-the-Art) approach RNGDet, we add an instance segmentation head to better supervise the model training, and enable the model to leverage multi-scale features of the backbone network. Since the new proposed approach is improved from RNGDet, it is named RNGDet++. All approaches are evaluated on a large publicly available dataset. RNGDet++ outperforms baseline models on almost all metrics scores. It improves the topology correctness APLS (Average Path Length Similarity) by around 3\\%.

Most existing methods use boundary maps to learn the sharp boundary.

To address this problem,we propose a position-aware relation learning network (PRLNet) for RGB-T SOD based on swin transformer. PRLNet explores the distance and direction relationships between pixels to strengthen intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, generating salient object masks with clear boundaries and homogeneous regions. Specifically, we develop a novel signed distance map auxiliary module (SDMAM) to improve encoder feature representation, which takes into account the distance relation of different pixels in boundary neighborhoods. Then, we design a feature refinement approach with directional field (FRDF), which rectifies features of boundary neighborhood by exploiting the features inside salient objects. FRDF utilizes the directional information between object pixels to effectively enhance the intra-class compactness of salient regions. In addition, we constitute a pure transformer encoder-decoder network to enhance multispectral feature representation for RGB-T SOD.

However, the short interaction sequences limit the performance of existing SR. To solve this problem, we focus on Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) in this paper, which aims to leverage information from other domains to improve the sequential recommendation performance of a single domain. Solving CDSR is challenging. On the one hand, how to retain single domain preferences as well as integrate cross-domain influence remains an essential problem. On the other hand, the data sparsity problem cannot be totally solved by simply utilizing knowledge from other domains, due to the limited length of the merged sequences. To address the challenges, we propose DDGHM, a novel framework for the CDSR problem, which includes two main modules, i.e., dual dynamic graph modeling and hybrid metric training. The former captures intra-domain and inter-domain sequential transitions through dynamically constructing two-level graphs, i.e., the local graphs and the global graph, and incorporating them with a fuse attentive gating mechanism. The latter enhances user and item representations by employing hybrid metric learning, including collaborative metric for achieving alignment and contrastive metric for preserving uniformity, to further alleviate data sparsity issue and improve prediction accuracy.

    "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a vital task since even a few anomalies can pose huge threats to benign users. Recent semi-supervised GAD methods, which can effectively leverage the available labels as prior knowledge, have achieved superior performances than unsupervised methods. In practice, people usually need to identify anomalies on new (sub)graphs to secure their business, but they may lack labels to train an effective detection model. One natural idea is to directly adopt a trained GAD model to the new (sub)graph for testing. However, we find that existing semi-supervised GAD methods suffer from poor generalization issue, i.e., well-trained models could not perform well on an unseen area (i.e., not accessible in training) of the same graph. It may cause great troubles. In this paper, we base on the phenomenon and propose a general and novel research problem of generalized graph anomaly detection that aims to effectively identify anomalies on both the training-domain graph and unseen testing graph to eliminate potential dangers. Nevertheless, it is a challenging task since only limited labels are available, and the normal background may differ between training and testing data. Accordingly, we propose a data augmentation method named \\textit{AugAN} (\\uline{Aug}mentation for \\uline{A}nomaly and \\uline{N}ormal distributions) to enrich training data and boost the generalizability of GAD models.

Response graphs, and particularly their sink strongly connected components, play an important role in modern techniques in evolutionary game theory and multi-agent learning. We show that the response graph is a simple and well-motivated model of strategic interaction which captures many non-trivial properties of a game, despite not depending on cardinal payoffs. We characterise the games which share a response graph with a zero-sum or potential game respectively, and demonstrate a duality between these sets. This allows us to understand the influence of these properties on the response graph. The response graphs of Matching Pennies and Coordination are shown to play a key role in all two-player games: every non-iteratively-dominated strategy takes part in a subgame with these graph structures. As a corollary, any game sharing a response graph with both a zero-sum game and potential game must be dominance-solvable. Finally, we classify the response graphs of small games, and show how our taxonomy can be used to understand games which appear in well-known textbooks. ",

In the proposed bitwidth FL scheme, edge devices train and transmit quantized versions of their local FL model parameters to a coordinating server, which, in turn, aggregates them into a quantized global model and synchronizes the devices. The goal is to jointly determine the bitwidths employed for local FL model quantization and the set of devices participating in FL training at each iteration. This problem is posed as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the training loss of quantized FL under a per-iteration device sampling budget and delay requirement. To derive the solution, an analytical characterization is performed in order to show how the limited wireless resources and induced quantization errors affect the performance of the proposed FL method. The analytical results show that the improvement of FL training loss between two consecutive iterations depends on the device selection and quantization scheme as well as on several parameters inherent to the model being learned. Given linear regression-based estimates of these model properties, it is shown that the FL training process can be described as a Markov decision process (MDP), and, then, a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) method is proposed to optimize action selection over iterations. Compared to model-free RL, this model-based RL approach leverages the derived mathematical characterization of the FL training process to discover an effective device selection and quantization scheme without imposing additional device communication overhead. Simulation results show that the proposed FL algorithm can reduce 29% and 63% convergence time compared to a model free RL method and the standard FL method, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Most automatic emotion recognition systems exploit time-continuous annotations of emotion to provide fine-grained descriptions of spontaneous expressions as observed in real-life interactions. As emotion is rather subjective, its annotation is usually performed by several annotators who provide a trace for a given dimension, i.e. a time-continuous series describing a dimension such as arousal or valence. However, annotations of the same expression are rarely consistent between annotators, either in time or in value, which adds bias and delay in the trace that is used to learn predictive models of emotion. We therefore propose a method that can dynamically compensate inconsistencies across annotations and synchronise the traces with the corresponding acoustic features using Recurrent Neural Networks. Experimental evaluations were carried on several emotion data sets that include Chinese, French, German, and Hungarian participants who interacted remotely in either noise-free conditions or in-the-wild. The results show that our method can significantly increase inter-annotator agreement, as well as correlation between traces and audio features, for both arousal and valence. In addition, improvements are obtained in the automatic prediction of these dimensions using simple light-weight models, especially for valence in noise-free conditions, and arousal for recordings captured in-the-wild.

Our results produce useful insights, for instance by highlighting (i) emerging technologies with a growing mean patent value and cluster size, (ii) the most influential companies in the field and (iii) attractive startups with few but impactful patents.

    "abstract": "Network motifs are patterns of interactions occurring among a small set of nodes in a graph. They highlight fundamental aspects of the interplay between the topology and the dynamics of complex networks and have a wide range of real-world applications. Motif analysis has been extended to a variety of network models that allow for a richer description of the interactions of a system, including weighted, temporal, multilayer, and, more recently, higher-order networks. Generalizing network motifs to capture patterns of group interactions is not only interesting from the fundamental perspective of understanding complex systems, but also proposes unprecedented computational challenges. In this work, we focus on the problem of counting occurrences of sub-hypergraph patterns in very large higher-order networks. We show that, by directly exploiting higher-order structures, we speed up the counting process compared to applying traditional data mining techniques for network motifs. Moreover, by including hyperedge sampling techniques, computational complexity is further reduced at the cost of small errors in the estimation of motif frequency. We evaluate our algorithms on several real-world datasets describing face-to-face interactions, co-authorship and human communication. We show that our approximated algorithm not only allows to speed up the performance, but also to extract larger higher-order motifs beyond the computational limits of an exact approach. ",

Intuitively, leveraging temporal multi-view stereo (MVS) technology is the natural knowledge for tackling this ambiguity. However, traditional attempts of MVS are flawed in two aspects when applying to 3D object detection scenes: 1) The affinity measurement among all views suffers expensive computation cost; 2) It is difficult to deal with outdoor scenarios where objects are often mobile. To this end, we introduce an effective temporal stereo method to dynamically select the scale of matching candidates, enable to significantly reduce computation overhead. Going one step further, we design an iterative algorithm to update more valuable candidates, making it adaptive to moving candidates. We instantiate our proposed method to multi-view 3D detector, namely BEVStereo. BEVStereo achieves the new state-of-the-art performance (i.e., 52.5% mAP and 61.0% NDS) on the camera-only track of nuScenes dataset.

    "abstract": "Open-source journalism emerged as a new phenomenon in the media ecosystem, which uses crowdsourcing to fact-check and generate investigative reports for world events using open sources (e.g., social media). A particularly prominent example is Bellingcat. Bellingcat is known for its investigations on the illegal use of chemical weapons during the Syrian war, the Russian responsibility for downing flight MH17, the identification of the perpetrators in the attempted murder of Alexei Navalny, and war crimes in the Russo-Ukraine war. Crucial for this is social media in order to disseminate findings and crowdsource fact-checks. In this work, we characterize the social media activities at Bellingcat on Twitter. For this, we built a comprehensive dataset of all N = 24,682 tweets posted by Bellingcat on Twitter since its inception in January 2014. Our analysis is three-fold: (1) We analyze how Bellingcat uses Twitter to disseminate information and collect information from its follower base. Here, we find a steady increase in both posts and replies over time, particularly during the Russo-Ukrainian war, which is in line with the growing importance of Bellingcat for the traditional media ecosystem. (2) We identify characteristics of posts that are successful in eliciting user engagement. User engagement is particularly large for posts embedding additional media items and with a more negative sentiment. (3) We examine how the follower base has responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here, we find that the sentiment has become more polarized and negative. We attribute this to a ~13-fold increase in bots interacting with the Bellingcat account. Overall, our findings provide recommendations for how open-source journalism such as Bellingcat can successfully operate on social media. ",

We find that periodic and \"snake\" activation functions consistently fail at periodic extrapolation, regardless of the trainability of their periodicity parameters.

Under such a constraint, we study the problem of influence maximization in a closed social network. It aims to recommend users (not just the seed users) a limited number of existing friends who will help propagate the information, such that the seed users' influence spread can be maximized. We first prove that this problem is NP-hard. Then, we propose a highly effective yet efficient method to augment the diffusion network, which initially consists of seed users only. The augmentation is done by iteratively and intelligently selecting and inserting a limited number of edges from the original network. Through extensive experiments on real-world social networks including deployment into a real-world application, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. ",

The caveat here is that only influential people can make such an online polling and reach out at a mass scale. Further, in such cases, the distribution of voters is not controllable and may be, in fact, biased. On the other hand,if we can interpret the publicly available data over social media to probe the political inclination of users, we will be able to have controllable insights about the survey population, keep the cost of survey low and also collect publicly available data without involving the concerned persons. Hence we introduce a self-attentive semi-supervised framework for political inclination detection to further that objective. The advantage of our model is that it neither needs huge training data nor does it need to store social network parameters. Nevertheless, it achieves an accuracy of 93.7\\% with no annotated data; further, with only a few annotated examples per class it achieves competitive performance. We found that the model is highly efficient even in resource-constrained settings, and insights drawn from its predictions match the manual survey outcomes when applied to diverse real-life scenarios.

By establishing channels off the blockchain to form payment channel networks (PCNs), users can make instant payments without interacting with the blockchain, avoiding the problems of long transaction consensus delays and high transaction fees.

However, the transaction's atomicity comes at a non-trivial cost for transaction completion latency that affects user experience in deadline-sensitive applications of PCNs, which is ignored by previous work. For the first time, we propose a new framework DPCN to consider the deadlines of transactions for payment channel networks while improving the success ratio of transactions. DPCN is enabled via a synergy of three components: (1) deadline-based dynamic transaction split mechanism that splits the transaction according to current network status and the transaction's deadline; (2)deadline-aware transaction scheduling that prioritizes near-deadline transactions; (3) deadline-aware transaction congestion avoidance algorithm, which uses a path window to balance transactions with different deadlines. Our extensive experiments show that compared with existing methods, DPCN can well meet the needs of transactions with different deadlines and ensure a higher success ratio for transactions in the payment channel networks.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a model-driven deep neural network, called KXNet, for blind SISR. Specifically, to solve the classical SISR model, we propose a simple-yet-effective iterative algorithm. Then by unfolding the involved iterative steps into the corresponding network module, we naturally construct the KXNet. The main specificity of the proposed KXNet is that the entire learning process is fully and explicitly integrated with the inherent physical mechanism underlying this SISR task. Thus, the learned blur kernel has clear physical patterns and the mutually iterative process between blur kernel and HR image can soundly guide the KXNet to be evolved in the right direction. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data finely demonstrate the superior accuracy and generality of our method beyond the current representative state-of-the-art blind SISR methods.

Its probabilistic approximatively correct (PAC) version substitutes an equivalence query by a large enough set of random membership queries to get a high level confidence to the answer. Thus it can be applied to any kind of (also non-regular) device and may be viewed as an algorithm for synthesizing an automaton abstracting the behavior of the device based on observations. Here we are interested on how Angluin's PAC learning algorithm behaves for devices which are obtained from a DFA by introducing some noise. More precisely we study whether Angluin's algorithm reduces the noise and produces a DFA closer to the original one than the noisy device. We propose several ways to introduce the noise: (1) the noisy device inverts the classification of words w.r.t. the DFA with a small probability, (2) the noisy device modifies with a small probability the letters of the word before asking its classification w.r.t. the DFA, and (3) the noisy device combines the classification of a word w.r.t. the DFA and its classification w.r.t. a counter automaton. Our experiments were performed on several hundred DFAs. Our main contributions, bluntly stated, consist in showing that: (1) Angluin's algorithm behaves well whenever the noisy device is produced by a random process, (2) but poorly with a structured noise, and, that (3) almost surely randomness yields systems with non-recursively enumerable languages.

Attack-defense trees have since been the subject of many theoretical works addressing different formal approaches. In 2017, M.

    "abstract": "Existing multi-scale solutions lead to a risk of just increasing the receptive field sizes while neglecting small receptive fields. Thus, it is a challenging problem to effectively construct adaptive neural networks for recognizing various spatial-scale objects. To tackle this issue, we first introduce a new attention dimension, i.e., depth, in addition to existing attention dimensions such as channel, spatial, and branch, and present a novel selective depth attention network to symmetrically handle multi-scale objects in various vision tasks. Specifically, the blocks within each stage of a given neural network, i.e., ResNet, output hierarchical feature maps sharing the same resolution but with different receptive field sizes. Based on this structural property, we design a stage-wise building module, namely SDA, which includes a trunk branch and a SE-like attention branch. The block outputs of the trunk branch are fused to globally guide their depth attention allocation through the attention branch. According to the proposed attention mechanism, we can dynamically select different depth features, which contributes to adaptively adjusting the receptive field sizes for the variable-sized input objects. In this way, the cross-block information interaction leads to a long-range dependency along the depth direction. Compared with other multi-scale approaches, our SDA method combines multiple receptive fields from previous blocks into the stage output, thus offering a wider and richer range of effective receptive fields. Moreover, our method can be served as a pluggable module to other multi-scale networks as well as attention networks, coined as SDA-$x$Net. Their combination further extends the range of the effective receptive fields towards small receptive fields, enabling interpretable neural networks.

    "title": "Momentum Adversarial Distillation: Handling Large Distribution Shifts in  Data-Free Knowledge Distillation",
    "abstract": "Data-free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) has attracted attention recently thanks to its appealing capability of transferring knowledge from a teacher network to a student network without using training data. The main idea is to use a generator to synthesize data for training the student. As the generator gets updated, the distribution of synthetic data will change. Such distribution shift could be large if the generator and the student are trained adversarially, causing the student to forget the knowledge it acquired at previous steps. To alleviate this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method called Momentum Adversarial Distillation (MAD) which maintains an exponential moving average (EMA) copy of the generator and uses synthetic samples from both the generator and the EMA generator to train the student. Since the EMA generator can be considered as an ensemble of the generator's old versions and often undergoes a smaller change in updates compared to the generator, training on its synthetic samples can help the student recall the past knowledge and prevent the student from adapting too quickly to new updates of the generator. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets including big datasets like ImageNet and Places365 demonstrate the superior performance of MAD over competing methods for handling the large distribution shift problem. Our method also compares favorably to existing DFKD methods and even achieves state-of-the-art results in some cases. ",

    "abstract": "Online social networks are actively involved in the removal of malicious social bots due to their role in the spread of low quality information. However, most of the existing bot detectors are supervised classifiers incapable of capturing the evolving behavior of sophisticated bots. Here we propose MulBot, an unsupervised bot detector based on multivariate time series (MTS). For the first time, we exploit multidimensional temporal features extracted from user timelines. We manage the multidimensionality with an LSTM autoencoder, which projects the MTS in a suitable latent space. Then, we perform a clustering step on this encoded representation to identify dense groups of very similar users -- a known sign of automation. Finally, we perform a binary classification task achieving f1-score $= 0.99$, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (f1-score $\\le 0.97$). Not only does MulBot achieve excellent results in the binary classification task, but we also demonstrate its strengths in a novel and practically-relevant task: detecting and separating different botnets. In this multi-class classification task we achieve f1-score $= 0.96$. We conclude by estimating the importance of the different features used in our model and by evaluating MulBot's capability to generalize to new unseen bots, thus proposing a solution to the generalization deficiencies of supervised bot detectors.

In this paper, we consider a safety property of 3D object detectors in the context of Autonomous Driving (AD). In particular, we propose an essential safety requirement for object detectors in AD and formulate it into a specification. During the formulation, we find that abstracting 3D objects with projected 2D bounding boxes on the image and bird's-eye-view planes allows for a necessary and sufficient condition to the proposed safety requirement. We then leverage the analysis and derive qualitative and quantitative safety metrics based on the Intersection-over-Ground-Truth measure and a distance ratio between predictions and ground truths. Finally, for continual improvement, we formulate safety losses that can be used to optimize object detectors towards higher safety scores. Our experiments with public models on the MMDetection3D library and the nuScenes datasets demonstrate the validity of our consideration and proposals. ",

    "abstract": "Network architecture search (NAS), in particular the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) method, has shown a great power to learn excellent model architectures on the specific dataset of interest. In contrast to using a fixed dataset, in this work, we focus on a different but important scenario for NAS: how to refine a deployed network's model architecture to enhance its robustness with the guidance of a few collected and misclassified examples that are degraded by some real-world unknown corruptions having a specific pattern (e.g., noise, blur, etc.). To this end, we first conduct an empirical study to validate that the model architectures can be definitely related to the corruption patterns. Surprisingly, by just adding a few corrupted and misclassified examples (e.g., $10^3$ examples) to the clean training dataset (e.g., $5.0 \\times 10^4$ examples), we can refine the model architecture and enhance the robustness significantly. To make it more practical, the key problem, i.e., how to select the proper failure examples for the effective NAS guidance, should be carefully investigated. Then, we propose a novel core-failure-set guided DARTS that embeds a K-center-greedy algorithm for DARTS to select suitable corrupted failure examples to refine the model architecture. We use our method for DARTS-refined DNNs on the clean as well as 15 corruptions with the guidance of four specific real-world corruptions. Compared with the state-of-the-art NAS as well as data-augmentation-based enhancement methods, our final method can achieve higher accuracy on both corrupted datasets and the original clean dataset. On some of the corruption patterns, we can achieve as high as over 45% absolute accuracy improvements. ",

    "abstract": "Task-oriented communications, mostly using learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC), aim to design a communication-efficient edge inference system by transmitting task-relevant information to the receiver. However, only transmitting task-relevant information without introducing any redundancy may cause robustness issues in learning due to the channel variations, and the JSCC which directly maps the source data into continuous channel input symbols poses compatibility issues on existing digital communication systems. In this paper, we address these two issues by first investigating the inherent tradeoff between the informativeness of the encoded representations and the robustness to information distortion in the received representations, and then propose a task-oriented communication scheme with digital modulation, named discrete task-oriented JSCC (DT-JSCC), where the transmitter encodes the features into a discrete representation and transmits it to the receiver with the digital modulation scheme. In the DT-JSCC scheme, we develop a robust encoding framework, named robust information bottleneck (RIB), to improve the communication robustness to the channel variations, and derive a tractable variational upper bound of the RIB objective function using the variational approximation to overcome the computational intractability of mutual information. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DT-JSCC achieves better inference performance than the baseline methods with low communication latency, and exhibits robustness to channel variations due to the applied RIB framework.

    "abstract": "Without densely tiled anchor boxes or grid points in the image, sparse R-CNN achieves promising results through a set of object queries and proposal boxes updated in the cascaded training manner. However, due to the sparse nature and the one-to-one relation between the query and its attending region, it heavily depends on the self attention, which is usually inaccurate in the early training stage. Moreover, in a scene of dense objects, the object query interacts with many irrelevant ones, reducing its uniqueness and harming the performance. This paper proposes to use IoU between different boxes as a prior for the value routing in self attention. The original attention matrix multiplies the same size matrix computed from the IoU of proposal boxes, and they determine the routing scheme so that the irrelevant features can be suppressed. Furthermore, to accurately extract features for both classification and regression, we add two lightweight projection heads to provide the dynamic channel masks based on object query, and they multiply with the output from dynamic convs, making the results suitable for the two different tasks. We validate the proposed scheme on different datasets, including MS-COCO and CrowdHuman, showing that it significantly improves the performance and increases the model convergence speed. ",

Many machine learning-based approaches have been proposed to solve the software vulnerability detection (SVD) problem. However, there are still two open and significant issues for SVD in terms of i) learning automatic representations to improve the predictive performance of SVD, and ii) tackling the scarcity of labeled vulnerabilities datasets that conventionally need laborious labeling effort by experts. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end approach to tackle these two crucial issues. We first exploit the automatic representation learning with deep domain adaptation for software vulnerability detection. We then propose a novel cross-domain kernel classifier leveraging the max-margin principle to significantly improve the transfer learning process of software vulnerabilities from labeled projects into unlabeled ones. The experimental results on real-world software datasets show the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

While many attempts have been made on shape descriptors and coupling schemes, how to simulate the particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions with a balance between accuracy and efficiency is still a challenge, especially when complex-shaped particles are considered. This study presents a Metaball-Imaging (MI) based Discrete Element Lattice Boltzmann Method (DELBM) for fluid simulations with irregular shaped particles. The major innovation is the MI algorithm to capture the real grain shape for DELBM simulations,where the Metaball function is utilized as the mathematical representation due to its versatile and efficient expressiveness of complex shapes.The contact detection is tackled robustly by gradient calculation of the closest point with a Newton-Raphson based scheme. And the coupling with LBM is accomplished by a classic sharp-interface scheme. As for refiling, a local refiling algorithm based on the bounce back rule is implemented. Validations on three settling experiments of irregular-shaped natural cobblestones indicate the proposed model to be effective and powerful in probing micromechanics of irregular-shaped granular media immersed in fluid systems. The potential of this model on studies of shape-induced physical processes is further investigated with numerical examples on the \"drafting, kissing and tumbling\" phenomenon of pair particles in various shapes.

Typically, in a program or function consisting of hundreds or thousands of source code statements, there are only few statements causing the corresponding vulnerabilities. Vulnerability labeling is currently done on a function or program level by experts with the assistance of machine learning tools. Extending this approach to the code statement level is much more costly and time-consuming and remains an open problem. In this paper we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning-based approach to identify the vulnerability-relevant code statements of a specific function. Inspired by the specific structures observed in real world vulnerable code, we first leverage mutual information for learning a set of latent variables representing the relevance of the source code statements to the corresponding function's vulnerability. We then propose novel clustered spatial contrastive learning in order to further improve the representation learning and the robust selection process of vulnerability-relevant code statements. Experimental results on real-world datasets of 200k+ C/C++ functions show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art baselines.

To address these problems, we propose a SAR ship detection method based on Swin Transformer and Feature Enhancement Feature Pyramid Network (FEFPN). Swin Transformer serves as backbone to model long-range dependencies and generates hierarchical features maps.

However, the specific way in which the information is distributed among the individual neurons is not well understood: While parts of it may only be obtainable from specific single neurons, other parts are carried redundantly or synergistically by multiple neurons. We show how Partial Information Decomposition (PID), a recent extension of information theory, can disentangle these contributions. From this, we introduce the measure of \"Representational Complexity\", which quantifies the difficulty of accessing information spread across multiple neurons. We show how this complexity is directly computable for smaller layers. For larger layers, we propose subsampling and coarse-graining procedures and prove corresponding bounds on the latter. Empirically, for quantized deep neural networks solving the MNIST task, we observe that representational complexity decreases both through successive hidden layers and over training. Overall, we propose representational complexity as a principled and interpretable summary statistic for analyzing the structure of neural representations. ",

By jointly minimizing the norm of the extended saltation matrix and the torque of the robot directly in the gait generation process, we show that the synthesized gaits are more robust than gaits generated with either term alone; these results are shown in simulation and on hardware for both the AMBER-3M planar biped and the Atalante lower-body exoskeleton (both with and without a human subject).

Supervised approaches typically require the annotation of large training sets; there has thus been great interest in leveraging weakly, semi- or self-supervised methods to avoid this, with much success. Whilst weakly and semi-supervised methods require some annotation, self-supervised methods have used cues such as motion to relieve the need for annotation altogether. However, a complete absence of annotation typically degrades their performance, and ambiguities that arise during motion grouping can inhibit their ability to find accurate object boundaries. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised mobile object detection approach called SCT. This uses both motion cues and expected object sizes to improve detection performance, and predicts a dense grid of 3D oriented bounding boxes to improve object discovery. We significantly outperform the state-of-the-art self-supervised mobile object detection method TCR on the KITTI tracking benchmark, and achieve performance that is within 30% of the fully supervised PV-RCNN++ method for IoUs <= 0.5.

With the proposed benchmark, we implement and analyze the effectiveness of a variety of multilingual BERT-based models (mBERT, XLM-R, and DistilmBERT) and monolingual BERT-based models (PhoBERT, viBERT, vELECTRA, and viBERT4news) for tasks in the SMTCE benchmark. Monolingual models outperform multilingual models and achieve state-of-the-art results on all text classification tasks. It provides an objective assessment of multilingual and monolingual BERT-based models on the benchmark, which will benefit future studies about BERTology in the Vietnamese language. ",

    "abstract": "Current abstractive summarization models either suffer from a lack of clear interpretability or provide incomplete rationales by only highlighting parts of the source document. To this end, we propose the Summarization Program (SP), an interpretable modular framework consisting of an (ordered) list of binary trees, each encoding the step-by-step generative process of an abstractive summary sentence from the source document. A Summarization Program contains one root node per summary sentence, and a distinct tree connects each summary sentence (root node) to the document sentences (leaf nodes) from which it is derived, with the connecting nodes containing intermediate generated sentences. Edges represent different modular operations involved in summarization such as sentence fusion, compression, and paraphrasing. We first propose an efficient best-first search method over neural modules, SP-Search that identifies SPs for human summaries by directly optimizing for ROUGE scores. Next, using these programs as automatic supervision, we propose seq2seq models that generate Summarization Programs, which are then executed to obtain final summaries. We demonstrate that SP-Search effectively represents the generative process behind human summaries using modules that are typically faithful to their intended behavior. We also conduct a simulation study to show that Summarization Programs improve the interpretability of summarization models by allowing humans to better simulate model reasoning. Summarization Programs constitute a promising step toward interpretable and modular abstractive summarization, a complex task previously addressed primarily through blackbox end-to-end neural systems.

In this paper, we introduce such a new problem with formal formulations and present a generic framework for addressing decision-making tasks in social contagion management. On the theory side, we present a generalization analysis for justifying the learning performance of our framework. In empirical studies, we perform a sanity check and compare the presented method with other possible learning-based and graph-based methods. We have acquired promising experimental results, confirming for the first time that it is possible to solve one decision-making task by using the solutions associated with another one. ",

Our attacks faithfully reconstruct private texts included in training data with access to the target model.

Recently, several neural alternatives have been proposed that reconstruct talking head videos at very low bitrates using sparse representations of each frame such as facial landmark information. However, these approaches produce poor reconstructions in scenarios with major movement or occlusions over the course of a call, and do not scale to higher resolutions. We design Gemino, a new neural compression system for video conferencing based on a novel high-frequency-conditional super-resolution pipeline. Gemino upsamples a very low-resolution version of each target frame while enhancing high-frequency details (e.g., skin texture, hair, etc.) based on information extracted from a single high-resolution reference image. We use a multi-scale architecture that runs different components of the model at different resolutions, allowing it to scale to resolutions comparable to 720p, and we personalize the model to learn specific details of each person, achieving much better fidelity at low bitrates. We implement Gemino atop aiortc, an open-source Python implementation of WebRTC, and show that it operates on 1024x1024 videos in real-time on a A100 GPU, and achieves 2.9x lower bitrate than traditional video codecs for the same perceptual quality.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) seeks to distribute model training across local clients without collecting data in a centralized data-center, hence removing data-privacy concerns. A major challenge for FL is data heterogeneity (where each client's data distribution can differ) as it can lead to weight divergence among local clients and slow global convergence. The current SOTA FL methods designed for data heterogeneity typically impose regularization to limit the impact of non-IID data and are stateful algorithms, i.e., they maintain local statistics over time. While effective, these approaches can only be used for a special case of FL involving only a small number of reliable clients. For the more typical applications of FL where the number of clients is large (e.g., edge-device and mobile applications), these methods cannot be applied, motivating the need for a stateless approach to heterogeneous FL which can be used for any number of clients. We derive a first-order gradient regularization to penalize inconsistent local updates due to local data heterogeneity. Specifically, to mitigate weight divergence, we introduce a first-order approximation of the global data distribution into local objectives, which intuitively penalizes updates in the opposite direction of the global update. The end result is a stateless FL algorithm that achieves 1) significantly faster convergence (i.e., fewer communication rounds) and 2) higher overall converged performance than SOTA methods under non-IID data distribution. Importantly, our approach does not impose unrealistic limits on the client size, enabling learning from a large number of clients as is typical in most FL applications. ",

    "abstract": "At the moment, quantum circuits are created mainly by manually placing logic elements on lines that symbolize quantum bits. The purpose of creating Quantum Circuit Synthesizer \"Naginata\" was due to the fact that even with a slight increase in the number of operations in a quantum algorithm, leads to the significant increase in size of the corresponding quantum circuit. This causes serious difficulties both in creating and debugging these quantum circuits. The purpose of our quantum synthesizer is enabling users an opportunity to implement quantum algorithms using higher-level commands. This is achieved by creating generic blocks for frequently used operations such as: the adder, multiplier, digital comparator (comparison operator), etc. Thus, the user could implement a quantum algorithm by using these generic blocks, and the quantum synthesizer would create a suitable circuit for this algorithm, in a format that is supported by the chosen quantum computation environment. This approach greatly simplifies the processes of development and debugging a quantum algorithm. The proposed approach for implementing quantum algorithms has a potential application in the field of machine learning, in this regard, we provided an example of creating a circuit for training a simple neural network. Neural networks have a significant impact on the technological development of the transport and road complex, and there is a potential for improving the reliability and efficiency of their learning process by utilizing quantum computation, through the introduction of quantum computing.

    "abstract": "Latent representations of drugs and their targets produced by contemporary graph autoencoder-based models have proved useful in predicting many types of node-pair interactions on large networks, including drug-drug, drug-target, and target-target interactions. However, most existing approaches model the node's latent spaces in which node distributions are rigid and disjoint; these limitations hinder the methods from generating new links among pairs of nodes. In this paper, we present the effectiveness of variational graph autoencoders (VGAE) in modeling latent node representations on multimodal networks. Our approach can produce flexible latent spaces for each node type of the multimodal graph; the embeddings are used later for predicting links among node pairs under different edge types. To further enhance the models' performance, we suggest a new method that concatenates Morgan fingerprints, which capture the molecular structures of each drug, with their latent embeddings before preceding them to the decoding stage for link prediction. Our proposed model shows competitive results on two multimodal networks: (1) a multi-graph consisting of drug and protein nodes, and (2) a multi-graph consisting of drug and cell line nodes.

Many existing set-valued classification methods do not consider the possibility that a new class that never appeared in the training data appears in the test data. Moreover, they are computationally expensive when the number of classes is large. We propose a Generalized Prediction Set (GPS) approach to estimate the acceptance regions while considering the possibility of a new class in the test data. The proposed classifier minimizes the expected size of the prediction set while guaranteeing that the class-specific accuracy is at least a pre-specified value. Unlike previous methods, the proposed method achieves a good balance between accuracy, efficiency, and anomaly detection rate. Moreover, our method can be applied in parallel to all the classes to alleviate the computational burden. Both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

Using a truncated sum of this expansion and (possibly random) neural networks for the integrands, whose parameters are learned in a machine learning setting, we show that every financial derivative can be approximated arbitrarily well in the $L^p$-sense.

Many of the main properties and algorithms of MDPs, such as value iteration and policy iteration, extend directly to RMDPs.

This work describes the first convex optimization formulation of RMDPs under the classical sa-rectangularity and s-rectangularity assumptions. We derive a convex formulation with a linear number of variables and constraints but large coefficients in the constraints by using entropic regularization and exponential change of variables. Our formulation can be combined with efficient methods from convex optimization to obtain new algorithms for solving RMDPs with uncertain probabilities. We further simplify the formulation for RMDPs with polyhedral uncertainty sets. Our work opens a new research direction for RMDPs and can serve as a first step toward obtaining a tractable convex formulation of RMDPs. ",

    "abstract": "Medical image classification has developed rapidly under the impetus of the convolutional neural network (CNN). Due to the fixed size of the receptive field of the convolution kernel, it is difficult to capture the global features of medical images. Although the self-attention-based Transformer can model long-range dependencies, it has high computational complexity and lacks local inductive bias. Much research has demonstrated that global and local features are crucial for image classification. However, medical images have a lot of noisy, scattered features, intra-class variation, and inter-class similarities. This paper proposes a three-branch hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion network structure termed as HiFuse for medical image classification as a new method. It can fuse the advantages of Transformer and CNN from multi-scale hierarchies without destroying the respective modeling so as to improve the classification accuracy of various medical images. A parallel hierarchy of local and global feature blocks is designed to efficiently extract local features and global representations at various semantic scales, with the flexibility to model at different scales and linear computational complexity relevant to image size. Moreover, an adaptive hierarchical feature fusion block (HFF block) is designed to utilize the features obtained at different hierarchical levels comprehensively. The HFF block contains spatial attention, channel attention, residual inverted MLP, and shortcut to adaptively fuse semantic information between various scale features of each branch. The accuracy of our proposed model on the ISIC2018 dataset is 7.6% higher than baseline, 21.5% on the Covid-19 dataset, and 10.4% on the Kvasir dataset. Compared with other advanced models, the HiFuse model performs the best. Our code is open-source and available from https://github.com/huoxiangzuo/HiFuse. ",

Suitable models can be used to randomize an observed network while preserving some of its features, or to generate synthetic graphs whose properties may be tuned upon the characteristics of a given population. In the present paper, we introduce the Fitness-Corrected Block Model, an adjustable-density variation of the well-known Degree-Corrected Block Model, and we show that the proposed construction yields a maximum entropy model. When the network is sparse, we derive an analytical expression for the degree distribution of the model that depends on just the constraints and the chosen fitness-distribution. Our model is perfectly suited to define maximum-entropy data-driven spatial social networks, where each block identifies vertices having similar position (e.g., residence) and age, and where the expected block-to-block adjacency matrix can be inferred from the available data. In this case, the sparse-regime approximation coincides with a phenomenological model where the probability of a link binding two individuals is directly proportional to their sociability and to the typical cohesion of their age-groups, whereas it decays as an inverse-power of their geographic distance. We support our analytical findings through simulations of a stylized urban area. ",
