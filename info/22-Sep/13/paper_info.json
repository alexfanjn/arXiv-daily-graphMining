    "abstract": "Co-occurrent visual pattern makes context aggregation become an essential paradigm for semantic segmentation.The existing studies focus on modeling the contexts within image while neglecting the valuable semantics of the corresponding category beyond image. To this end, we propose a novel soft mining contextual information beyond image paradigm named MCIBI++ to further boost the pixel-level representations. Specifically, we first set up a dynamically updated memory module to store the dataset-level distribution information of various categories and then leverage the information to yield the dataset-level category representations during network forward. After that, we generate a class probability distribution for each pixel representation and conduct the dataset-level context aggregation with the class probability distribution as weights. Finally, the original pixel representations are augmented with the aggregated dataset-level and the conventional image-level contextual information. Moreover, in the inference phase, we additionally design a coarse-to-fine iterative inference strategy to further boost the segmentation results. MCIBI++ can be effortlessly incorporated into the existing segmentation frameworks and bring consistent performance improvements. Also, MCIBI++ can be extended into the video semantic segmentation framework with considerable improvements over the baseline. Equipped with MCIBI++, we achieved the state-of-the-art performance on seven challenging image or video semantic segmentation benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "The number of login options on websites has increased since the introduction of web single sign-on (SSO) protocols. SSO services allow users to grant websites or relying parties (RPs) access to their personal profile information from identity provider (IdP) accounts. When prompting users to select an SSO login option, many websites do not provide any privacy information that could help users make informed choices. Moreover, privacy differences in permission requests across available login options are largely hidden from users and are time consuming to manually extract and compare. In this paper, we present an empirical study of popular RP implementations supporting three major IdP login options (Facebook, Google, and Apple) and categorize RPs in the top 300 sites into four client-side code patterns. Our findings suggest a relatively uniform distribution in three code patterns. We select RPs in one of these patterns as target sites for the design and implementation of SSOPrivateEye (SPEye), a browser extension prototype that extracts comparative data on SSO login options in RPs covering the three IdPs. Our evaluation of SPEye demonstrates the viability of extracting privacy information that can inform SSO login choices in the majority of our target sites. ",

    "abstract": "Coupled nonlinear system of reaction-diffusion equations describing multi-component (species) interactions with heterogeneous coefficients is considered. Finite volume method based approximation for the space is used to construct semi-discrete form for the computation of numerical solutions. Two techniques for time approximations, namely, a fully implicit (FI) and a semi-implicit (SI) schemes are examined. The fully implicit scheme is constructed using Newton's method and leads to the coupled system of equations on each nonlinear and time iterations which is computationally rather expensive. In order to minimize the latter hurdle, an efficient and fast multiscale solver is proposed for reaction-diffusion systems in heterogeneous media. To construct fast solver, we apply a semi-implicit scheme that leads to an uncoupled system for each individual component. To reduce the size of the discrete system, we present a multiscale model reduction technique. Multiscale solver is based on the uncoupled operator of the problem and constructed by the use of Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). In GMsFEM we use a diffusion part of the operator and construct multiscale basis functions. We collect multiscale basis functions to construct a projection/prolongation matrix and generate reduced order model on the coarse grid for fast solution. Moreover, the prolongation operator is used to reconstruct a fine-scale solution and accurate approximation of the reaction part of the problem which then leads to a very accurate and computationally effective multiscale solver. We provide numerical results for two species competition test problems in two-dimensional domain with heterogeneous inclusions. We investigate the influence of number of the multiscale basis functions to the method accuracy and ability to work with different values of the diffusion coefficients. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples, inputs designed to induce worst-case behavior in machine learning models, have been extensively studied over the past decade. Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon stems from a rather fragmented pool of knowledge; at present, there are a handful of attacks, each with disparate assumptions in threat models and incomparable definitions of optimality. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to characterize worst-case (i.e., optimal) adversaries. We first introduce an extensible decomposition of attacks in adversarial machine learning by atomizing attack components into surfaces and travelers. With our decomposition, we enumerate over components to create 576 attacks (568 of which were previously unexplored). Next, we propose the Pareto Ensemble Attack (PEA): a theoretical attack that upper-bounds attack performance. With our new attacks, we measure performance relative to the PEA on: both robust and non-robust models, seven datasets, and three extended lp-based threat models incorporating compute costs, formalizing the Space of Adversarial Strategies. From our evaluation we find that attack performance to be highly contextual: the domain, model robustness, and threat model can have a profound influence on attack efficacy. Our investigation suggests that future studies measuring the security of machine learning should: (1) be contextualized to the domain & threat models, and (2) go beyond the handful of known attacks used today.

The drawings produced by this framework are compared to drawings produced by the well known Sugiyama framework in terms of area, number of bends, number of crossings, and execution time. The new algorithm runs very fast and produces drawings that are readable and efficient. Since there are advantages (and disadvantages) to both frameworks, we performed a user study and the results show that the drawings produced by the new framework are well received in terms of clarity, readability, and usability. Hence, the new technique offers an interesting alternative to drawing hierarchical graphs, and is especially useful in applications where user defined paths are important and need to be highlighted.

Our framework implements a block-based programming model. This allows a user to express a graph algorithm using kernels that operate on subgraphs. PGAbB support graph computations that fit in host DRAM but not in GPU device memory, and provides simple but effective scheduling techniques to schedule computations to all available resources in a heterogeneous architecture. We have demonstrated that one can easily implement a diverse set of graph algorithms in our framework by developing five algorithms. Our experimental results show that PGAbB implementations achieve better or competitive performance compared to hand-optimized implementations. Based on our experiments on five graph algorithms and forty-four graphs, in the median, PGAbB achieves 1.6, 1.6, 5.7, 3.4, 4.5, and 2.4 times better performance than GAPBS, Galois, Ligra, LAGraph Galois-GPU, and Gunrock graph processing systems, respectively.

Compared to traditional passwords, \"vocal passwords\" are much more convenient as they relieve people from memorizing different passwords. However, new machine learning attacks are putting these voice authentication systems at risk. Without a strong security guarantee, attackers could access legitimate users' web accounts by fooling the deep neural network (DNN) based voice recognition models. In this paper, we demonstrate an easy-to-implement data poisoning attack to the voice authentication system, which can hardly be captured by existing defense mechanisms. Thus, we propose a more robust defense method, called Guardian, which is a convolutional neural network-based discriminator. The Guardian discriminator integrates a series of novel techniques including bias reduction, input augmentation, and ensemble learning. Our approach is able to distinguish about 95% of attacked accounts from normal accounts, which is much more effective than existing approaches with only 60% accuracy. ",

We present a compression-driven network design for frame interpolation that leverages model pruning through sparsity-inducing optimization to greatly reduce the model size while attaining higher performance. Concretely, we begin by compressing the recently proposed AdaCoF model and demonstrating that a 10 times compressed AdaCoF performs similarly to its original counterpart, where different strategies for using layerwise sparsity information as a guide are comprehensively investigated under a variety of hyperparameter settings. We then enhance this compressed model by introducing a multi-resolution warping module, which improves visual consistency with multi-level details. As a result, we achieve a considerable performance gain with a quarter of the size of the original AdaCoF. In addition, our model performs favorably against other state-of-the-art approaches on a wide variety of datasets. We note that the suggested compression-driven framework is generic and can be easily transferred to other DNN-based frame interpolation algorithms.

Physical attacks on sensors such as sensor tampering or spoofing can feed erroneous values to RVs through physical channels, which results in mission failures. In this paper, we present DeLorean, a comprehensive diagnosis and recovery framework for securing autonomous RVs from physical attacks. We consider a strong form of physical attack called sensor deception attacks (SDAs), in which the adversary targets multiple sensors of different types simultaneously (even including all sensors). Under SDAs, DeLorean inspects the attack induced errors, identifies the targeted sensors, and prevents the erroneous sensor inputs from being used in RV's feedback control loop. DeLorean replays historic state information in the feedback control loop and recovers the RV from attacks. Our evaluation on four real and two simulated RVs shows that DeLorean can recover RVs from different attacks, and ensure mission success in 94% of the cases (on average), without any crashes. DeLorean incurs low performance, memory and battery overheads. ",

    "abstract": "Community detection is a classic problem in network science with extensive applications in various fields. The most commonly used methods are the algorithms designed to maximize a utility function, modularity, across different ways that a network can be partitioned into communities. Despite their name and design philosophy, current modularity maximization algorithms generally fail to maximize modularity or guarantee any proximity to an optimal solution. We propose the Bayan algorithm which, unlike the existing methods, returns network partitions with a guarantee of either optimality or proximity to an optimal solution. At the core of the Bayan algorithm is a branch-and-cut scheme that solves a sparse integer programming formulation of the modularity maximization problem to optimality or approximate it within a factor. We analyze the performance of Bayan against 22 existing algorithms using synthetic and real networks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate Bayan's distinctive capabilities not only in maximizing modularity, but more importantly in accurate retrieval of ground-truth communities. Bayan's comparative level of performance remains stable over variations in the amount of noise in the data (graph) generation process. The performance of Bayan as an exact modularity maximization algorithm also reveals the theoretical capability limits of maximum-modularity partitions in accurate retrieval of communities. Overall our analysis points to Bayan as a suitable choice for a methodologically grounded detection of communities through exact (approximate) maximization of modularity in networks with up to $\\sim10^3$ edges (and larger networks). Prospective advances in graph optimization and integer programming can push these limits further. ",

A single lesion image is a source of multiple features. Therefore, It is crucial to select the appropriate features from the image of the lesion in order to increase the accuracy of AMDS. For melanoma detection, all extracted features are not important. Some of the extracted features are complex and require more computation tasks, which impacts the classification accuracy of AMDS. The feature extraction phase of AMDS exhibits more variability, therefore it is important to study the behaviour of AMDS using individual and extended feature extraction approaches. A novel algorithm ExtFvAMDS is proposed for the calculation of Extended Feature Vector Space.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems usually learn user interests from various user behaviors, including clicks and post-click behaviors (e.g., like and favorite). However, these behaviors inevitably exhibit popularity bias, leading to some unfairness issues: 1) for items with similar quality, more popular ones get more exposure; and 2) even worse the popular items with lower popularity might receive more exposure. Existing work on mitigating popularity bias blindly eliminates the bias and usually ignores the effect of item quality. We argue that the relationships between different user behaviors (e.g., conversion rate) actually reflect the item quality. Therefore, to handle the unfairness issues, we propose to mitigate the popularity bias by considering multiple user behaviors. In this work, we examine causal relationships behind the interaction generation procedure in multi-behavior recommendation. Specifically, we find that: 1) item popularity is a confounder between the exposed items and users' post-click interactions, leading to the first unfairness; and 2) some hidden confounders (e.g., the reputation of item producers) affect both item popularity and quality, resulting in the second unfairness. To alleviate these confounding issues, we propose a causal framework to estimate the causal effect, which leverages backdoor adjustment to block the backdoor paths caused by the confounders. In the inference stage, we remove the negative effect of popularity and utilize the good effect of quality for recommendation. Experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which enhances fairness without sacrificing recommendation accuracy. ",

Recent progress in self-supervised human mesh recovery has been made using synthetic-data-driven training paradigms where the model is trained from synthetic paired 2D representation (e.g., 2D keypoints and segmentation masks) and 3D mesh. However, on synthetic dense correspondence maps (i.e., IUV) few have been explored since the domain gap between synthetic training data and real testing data is hard to address for 2D dense representation. To alleviate this domain gap on IUV, we propose cross-representation alignment utilizing the complementary information from the robust but sparse representation (2D keypoints). Specifically, the alignment errors between initial mesh estimation and both 2D representations are forwarded into regressor and dynamically corrected in the following mesh regression. This adaptive cross-representation alignment explicitly learns from the deviations and captures complementary information: robustness from sparse representation and richness from dense representation. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets and demonstrate competitive results, helping take a step towards reducing the annotation effort needed to produce state-of-the-art models in human mesh estimation.

To achieve a fast and accurate estimation of voltage sensitivities, we propose a data-driven method based on deep neural network (DNN), together with a rule-based bus-selection process using the bidirectional search method. Our method only uses the operating statuses of selected buses as inputs to DNN, thus significantly improving the training efficiency and reducing information redundancy. Finally, a distributed consensus-based solution, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), for the AARVVC is applied to decide the inverter reactive power adjustment rule with respect to its active power. Only limited information exchange is required between each local agent and the central agent to obtain the slope of the reactive power adjustment rule, and there is no need for the central agent to solve any (sub)optimization problems. Numerical results on the modified IEEE-123 bus system validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed data-driven AARVVC method. ",

    "abstract": "Manual code reviews and static code analyzers are the traditional mechanisms to verify if source code complies with coding policies. However, these mechanisms are hard to scale. We formulate code compliance assessment as a machine learning (ML) problem, to take as input a natural language policy and code, and generate a prediction on the code's compliance, non-compliance, or irrelevance. This can help scale compliance classification and search for policies not covered by traditional mechanisms. We explore key research questions on ML model formulation, training data, and evaluation setup. The core idea is to obtain a joint code-text embedding space which preserves compliance relationships via the vector distance of code and policy embeddings. As there is no task-specific data, we re-interpret and filter commonly available software datasets with additional pre-training and pre-finetuning tasks that reduce the semantic gap. We benchmarked our approach on two listings of coding policies (CWE and CBP). This is a zero-shot evaluation as none of the policies occur in the training set. On CWE and CBP respectively, our tool Policy2Code achieves classification accuracies of (59%, 71%) and search MRR of (0.05, 0.21) compared to CodeBERT with classification accuracies of (37%, 54%) and MRR of (0.02, 0.02).

    "abstract": "Cache side-channel attacks exhibit severe threats to software security and privacy, especially for cryptosystems. In this paper, we propose CaType, a novel refinement type-based tool for detecting cache side channels in crypto software. Compared to previous works, CaType provides the following advantages: (1) For the first time CaType analyzes cache side channels using refinement type over x86 assembly code. It reveals several significant and effective enhancements with refined types, including bit-level granularity tracking, distinguishing different effects of variables, precise type inferences, and high scalability. (2) CaType is the first static analyzer for crypto libraries in consideration of blinding-based defenses. (3) From the perspective of implementation, CaType uses cache layouts of potential vulnerable control-flow branches rather than cache states to suppress false positives. We evaluate CaType in identifying side channel vulnerabilities in real-world crypto software, including RSA, ElGamal, and (EC)DSA from OpenSSL and Libgcrypt. CaType captures all known defects, detects previously-unknown vulnerabilities, and reveals several false positives of previous tools. In terms of performance, CaType is 16X faster than CacheD and 131X faster than CacheS when analyzing the same libraries. These evaluation results confirm the capability of CaType in identifying side channel defects with great precision, efficiency, and scalability. ",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms have become new battlegrounds for anti-social elements, with misinformation being the weapon of choice. Fact-checking organizations try to debunk as many claims as possible while staying true to their journalistic processes but cannot cope with its rapid dissemination. We believe that the solution lies in partial automation of the fact-checking life cycle, saving human time for tasks which require high cognition. We propose a new workflow for efficiently detecting previously fact-checked claims that uses abstractive summarization to generate crisp queries. These queries can then be executed on a general-purpose retrieval system associated with a collection of previously fact-checked claims. We curate an abstractive text summarization dataset comprising noisy claims from Twitter and their gold summaries. It is shown that retrieval performance improves 2x by using popular out-of-the-box summarization models and 3x by fine-tuning them on the accompanying dataset compared to verbatim querying. Our approach achieves Recall@5 and MRR of 35% and 0.3, compared to baseline values of 10% and 0.1, respectively.

The utility of resource consumption, along with the income from resource exchange, forms each agent's payoff which is aimed to be maximized. Each utility function is parameterized by individual preferences which can be designed by agents independently. By shaping these preferences and proposing a set of utility functions, we can guarantee that the optimal resource price at the competitive equilibrium always remains socially acceptable, i.e., it never violates a given threshold that indicates affordability. First, we show this problem is solvable at the conceptual level under some convexity assumptions. Then, as a benchmark case, we consider quadratic MAS and formulate the associated social shaping problem as a multi-agent LQR problem which enables us to propose explicit utility sets using quadratic programming and dynamic programming. Finally, a numerical algorithm is presented for calculating the range of the preference function parameters which guarantee a socially accepted price. Some illustrative examples are given to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methods. ",

The move to sub-THz frequencies will require attention to sustainability and reduction of power whenever possible to reduce the carbon footprint while maintaining adequate battery life for the massive number of resource-constrained devices to be deployed. This article analyzes power consumption of future wireless networks using a new metric, the power waste factor ($ W $), which shows promise for the study and development of \"green G\" - green technology for future wireless networks. Using $ W $, power efficiency can be considered by quantifying the power wasted by all devices on a signal path in a cascade. We then show that the consumption efficiency factor ($CEF$), defined as the ratio of the maximum data rate achieved to the total power consumed, is a novel and powerful measure of power efficiency that shows less energy per bit is expended as the cell size shrinks and carrier frequency and channel bandwidth increase. Our findings offer a standard approach to calculating and comparing power consumption and energy efficiency. ",

To contain the spread of virus and further alleviate the crisis, various health policies (e.g., stay-at-home orders) have been issued which spark heat discussion as users turn to share their attitudes on social media. In this paper, we consider a more realistic scenario on stance detection (i.e., cross-target and zero-shot settings) for the pandemic and propose an adversarial learning-based stance classifier to automatically identify the public attitudes toward COVID-19-related health policies. Specifically, we adopt adversarial learning which allows the model to train on a large amount of labeled data and capture transferable knowledge from source topics, so as to enable generalize to the emerging health policy with sparse labeled data. Meanwhile, a GeoEncoder is designed which encourages model to learn unobserved contextual factors specified by each region and represents them as non-text information to enhance model's deeper understanding. We evaluate the performance of a broad range of baselines in stance detection task for COVID-19-related policies, and experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both cross-target and zero-shot settings.

To address this shortcoming, we introduce taxonomies for data, methods, and evaluation strategies, provide a comprehensive overview of unsupervised time series anomaly detection using the taxonomies, and systematically evaluate and compare state-of-the-art traditional as well as deep learning techniques. In the empirical study using nine publicly available datasets, we apply the most commonly-used performance evaluation metrics to typical methods under a fair implementation standard. Based on the structuring offered by the taxonomies, we report on empirical studies and provide guidelines, in the form of comparative tables, for choosing the methods most suitable for particular application settings.

However, sensing the presence of glass is not straightforward. The key challenge is that arbitrary objects/scenes can appear behind the glass. In this paper, we propose an important problem of detecting glass surfaces from a single RGB image. To address this problem, we construct the first large-scale glass detection dataset (GDD) and propose a novel glass detection network, called GDNet-B, which explores abundant contextual cues in a large field-of-view via a novel large-field contextual feature integration (LCFI) module and integrates both high-level and low-level boundary features with a boundary feature enhancement (BFE) module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GDNet-B achieves satisfying glass detection results on the images within and beyond the GDD testing set. We further validate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our proposed GDNet-B by applying it to other vision tasks, including mirror segmentation and salient object detection. Finally, we show the potential applications of glass detection and discuss possible future research directions. ",

Especially after the proliferation of smart devices and diverse IoT requirements, we observe the dominance of cutting-edge applications with ever-increased user expectations in terms of mobility, pervasiveness, and real-time response. Over the years, to meet the requirements of those applications, cloud computing provides the necessary capacity for computation, while edge computing ensures low latency. However, these two essential solutions would be insufficient for the next-generation applications since computational and communicational bottlenecks are inevitable due to the highly dynamic load. Therefore, a 3D networking structure using different air layers including Low Altitude Platforms, High Altitude Platforms, and Low Earth Orbits in a harmonized manner for both urban and rural areas should be applied to satisfy the requirements of the dynamic environment. In this perspective, we put forward a novel, next-generation paradigm called Air Computing that presents a dynamic, responsive, and high-resolution computation and communication environment for all spectrum of applications using the 6G Wireless Networks as the fundamental communication system. In this survey, we define the components of air computing, investigate its architecture in detail, and discuss its essential use cases and the advantages it brings for next-generation application scenarios. We provide a detailed and technical overview of the benefits and challenges of air computing as a novel paradigm and spot the important future research directions. ",

Unfortunately, these methods utilize deep, heavy networks and are slower than traditional model-based detectors. In this paper we build an accurate yet fast CNN- based detector, LSDNet, by incorporating a lightweight CNN into a classical LSD detector. Specifically, we replace the first step of the original LSD algorithm - construction of line segments heatmap and tangent field from raw image gradients - with a lightweight CNN, which is able to calculate more complex and rich features. The second part of the LSD algorithm is used with only minor modifications. Compared with several modern line segment detectors on standard Wireframe dataset, the proposed LSDNet provides the highest speed (among CNN-based detectors) of 214 FPS with a competitive accuracy of 78 Fh . Although the best-reported accuracy is 83 Fh at 33 FPS, we speculate that the observed accuracy gap is caused by errors in annotations and the actual gap is significantly lower. We point out systematic inconsistencies in the annotations of popular line detection benchmarks - Wireframe and York Urban, carefully reannotate a subset of images and show that (i) existing detectors have improved quality on updated annotations without retraining, suggesting that new annotations correlate better with the notion of correct line segment detection; (ii) the gap between accuracies of our detector and others diminishes to negligible 0.2 Fh , with our method being the fastest.

Detecting, measuring and quantifying cracks for distress analysis in challenging background scenarios is a difficult task as there is no clear boundary that separates cracks from the background. Developed algorithms should handle the inherent challenges associated with data. Some of the perceptually noted challenges are color, intensity, depth, blur, motion-blur, orientation, different region of interest (ROI) for the defect, scale, illumination, complex and challenging background, etc. These variations occur across (crack inter class) and within images (crack intra-class variabilities). Overall, there is significant background (inter) and foreground (intra-class) variability. In this work, we have attempted to reduce the effect of these variations in challenging background scenarios. We have proposed a stochastic width (SW) approach to reduce the effect of these variations. Our proposed approach improves detectability and significantly reduces false positives and negatives.

With the proposed approach, edge devices (EDs) transmit the signs of local stochastic gradients, i.e., votes, by activating one of two orthogonal resources. The MVs at the edge server (ES) are obtained with non-coherent detectors by exploiting the accumulations on the resources. Hence, the proposed scheme eliminates the need for channel state information (CSI) at the EDs and ES. In this study, we analyze various gradient-encoding strategies through the weight functions and waveform configurations over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). We show that specific weight functions that enable absentee EDs (i.e., hard-coded participation with absentees (HPA)) or weighted votes (i.e., soft-coded participation (SP)) can substantially reduce the probability of detecting the incorrect MV. By taking path loss, power control, cell size, and fading channel into account, we prove the convergence of the distributed learning for a non-convex function for HPA. Through simulations, we show that the proposed scheme with HPA and SP can provide high test accuracy even when the time-synchronization and the power control are not ideal under heterogeneous data distribution scenarios.

It has resulted in an ongoing pandemic that caused infected cases including some deaths. Coronavirus is primarily spread between people during close contact.

By exploiting YOLOv2 (you look at once), a deep learning detection technique is developed for detecting and tracking people in indoor and outdoor scenarios. An algorithm is also implemented for measuring and classifying the distance between persons and automatically check if social distancing rules are respected or not. Hence, this work aims at minimizing the spread of the COVID-19 virus by evaluating if and how persons comply with social distancing rules. The proposed approach is applied to images acquired through thermal cameras, to establish a complete AI system for people tracking, social distancing classification, and body temperature monitoring. The training phase is done with two datasets captured from different thermal cameras. Ground Truth Labeler app is used for labeling the persons in the images. The achieved results show that the proposed method is suitable for the creation of a smart surveillance system in smart cities for people detection, social distancing classification, and body temperature analysis.

When the space of possible interventions is large, making an exhaustive search infeasible, experimental design strategies are needed. In this context, encoding the causal relationships between the variables, and thus the effect of interventions on the system, is critical in order to identify desirable interventions efficiently. We develop an iterative causal method to identify optimal interventions, as measured by the discrepancy between the post-interventional mean of the distribution and a desired target mean. We formulate an active learning strategy that uses the samples obtained so far from different interventions to update the belief about the underlying causal model, as well as to identify samples that are most informative about optimal interventions and thus should be acquired in the next batch. The approach employs a Bayesian update for the causal model and prioritizes interventions using a carefully designed, causally informed acquisition function. This acquisition function is evaluated in closed form, allowing for efficient optimization. The resulting algorithms are theoretically grounded with information-theoretic bounds and provable consistency results. We illustrate the method on both synthetic data and real-world biological data, namely gene expression data from Perturb-CITE-seq experiments, to identify optimal perturbations that induce a specific cell state transition; the proposed causal approach is observed to achieve better sample efficiency compared to several baselines. In both cases we observe that the causally informed acquisition function notably outperforms existing criteria allowing for optimal intervention design with significantly less experiments. ",

High parameter count in such models makes training and inference on graphs expensive and challenging. To reduce the computational and memory costs of GNNs, optimization methods such as pruning the redundant nodes and edges in input graphs have been commonly adopted. However, model compression, which directly targets the sparsification of model layers, has been mostly limited to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for tasks such as image classification and object detection. In this paper, we utilize two state-of-the-art model compression methods (1) train and prune and (2) sparse training for the sparsification of weight layers in GNNs. We evaluate and compare the efficiency of both methods in terms of accuracy, training sparsity, and training FLOPs on real-world graphs. Our experimental results show that on the ia-email, wiki-talk, and stackoverflow datasets for link prediction, sparse training with much lower training FLOPs achieves a comparable accuracy with the train and prune method. On the brain dataset for node classification, sparse training uses a lower number FLOPs (less than 1/7 FLOPs of train and prune method) and preserves a much better accuracy performance under extreme model sparsity.

However, the increases in the size and variety of KG datasets as well as the growing diversity of KG queries pose efficiency challenges for the current generation of DMSs to the extent that the performance of representative DMSs tends to vary significantly across diverse query types and no single platform dominates performance. We present our extensible prototype, SymphonyDB, as an approach to addressing this problem based on a polyglot model of query processing as part of a multi-database system supported by a unified access layer that can analyze/translate individual queries just-in-time and match each to the likely best-performing DMS among Virtuoso, Blazegraph, RDF-3X, and MongoDB as representative DMSs that are included in our prototype at this time.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems have shown to be highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that are deliberately designed yet almost imperceptible but can bias DNN inference when added to targeted objects. This leads to serious safety concerns when applying DNNs to high-stake SAR ATR applications. Therefore, enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNNs is essential for implementing DNNs to modern real-world SAR ATR systems. Toward building more robust DNN-based SAR ATR models, this article explores the domain knowledge of SAR imaging process and proposes a novel Scattering Model Guided Adversarial Attack (SMGAA) algorithm which can generate adversarial perturbations in the form of electromagnetic scattering response (called adversarial scatterers). The proposed SMGAA consists of two parts: 1) a parametric scattering model and corresponding imaging method and 2) a customized gradient-based optimization algorithm. First, we introduce the effective Attributed Scattering Center Model (ASCM) and a general imaging method to describe the scattering behavior of typical geometric structures in the SAR imaging process. By further devising several strategies to take the domain knowledge of SAR target images into account and relax the greedy search procedure, the proposed method does not need to be prudentially finetuned, but can efficiently to find the effective ASCM parameters to fool the SAR classifiers and facilitate the robust model training. Comprehensive evaluations on the MSTAR dataset show that the adversarial scatterers generated by SMGAA are more robust to perturbations and transformations in the SAR processing chain than the currently studied attacks, and are effective to construct a defensive model against the malicious scatterers.

In this paper, we propose a compound approach for end-to-end discriminative deep feature learning for person Re-Id based on both body and hand images. We carefully design the Local-Aware Global Attention Network (LAGA-Net), a multi-branch deep network architecture consisting of one branch for spatial attention, one branch for channel attention, one branch for global feature representations and another branch for local feature representations. The attention branches focus on the relevant features of the image while suppressing the irrelevant backgrounds. In order to overcome the weakness of the attention mechanisms, equivariant to pixel shuffling, we integrate relative positional encodings into the spatial attention module to capture the spatial positions of pixels. The global branch intends to preserve the global context or structural information. For the the local branch, which intends to capture the fine-grained information, we perform uniform partitioning to generate stripes on the conv-layer horizontally. We retrieve the parts by conducting a soft partition without explicitly partitioning the images or requiring external cues such as pose estimation. A set of ablation study shows that each component contributes to the increased performance of the LAGA-Net. Extensive evaluations on four popular body-based person Re-Id benchmarks and two publicly available hand datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, the energy-efficiency maximization is achieved for the considered AmBSC-enabled multi-cluster cooperative IoT NOMA system by optimizing the active-beamforming vector and power-allocation coefficients (PAC) of IoT NOMA users at the transmitter, as well as passive-beamforming vector at the multi-antenna assisted backscatter node. Usually, increasing the number of IoT NOMA users in each cluster results in inter-cluster interference (ICI) (among different clusters) and intra-cluster interference (among IoT NOMA users). To combat the impact of ICI, we exploit a zero-forcing (ZF) based active-beamforming, as well as an efficient clustering technique at the source node. Further, the effect of intra-cluster interference is mitigated by exploiting an efficient power-allocation policy that determines the PAC of IoT NOMA users under the quality-of-service (QoS), cooperation, SIC decoding, and power-budget constraints. Moreover, the considered non-convex passive-beamforming problem is transformed into a standard semi-definite programming (SDP) problem by exploiting the successive-convex approximation (SCA) approximation, as well as the difference of convex (DC) programming, where Rank-1 solution of passive-beamforming is obtained based on the penalty-based method. Furthermore, the numerical analysis of simulation results demonstrates that the proposed energy-efficiency maximization algorithm exhibits an efficient performance by achieving convergence within only a few iterations.

Based on such an array structure at the base station, this paper investigates a joint active user detection (AUD) and channel estimation (CE) scheme based on compressive sensing (CS) for application to the massive Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, by exploiting the structured sparsity of mmWave/THz massive IoT access channels, we firstly formulate the multi-panel massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO)-based joint AUD and CE problem as a multiple measurement vector (MMV)-CS problem. Then, we harness the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the prior parameters (i.e., the noise variance and the sparsity ratio) and an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP)-EM-MMV algorithm is developed to solve this problem. Our simulation results verify the improved AUD and CE performance of the proposed scheme compared to conventional CS-based algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Graph embedding methods aim at finding useful graph representations by mapping nodes to a low-dimensional vector space. It is a task with important downstream applications, such as link prediction, graph reconstruction, data visualization, node classification, and language modeling. In recent years, the field of graph embedding has witnessed a shift from linear algebraic approaches towards local, gradient-based optimization methods combined with random walks and deep neural networks to tackle the problem of embedding large graphs. However, despite this improvement in the optimization tools, graph embedding methods are still generically designed in a way that is oblivious to the particularities of real-life networks. Indeed, there has been significant progress in understanding and modeling complex real-life networks in recent years. However, the obtained results have had a minor influence on the development of graph embedding algorithms. This paper aims to remedy this by designing a graph embedding method that takes advantage of recent valuable insights from the field of network science. More precisely, we present a novel graph embedding approach based on the popularity-similarity and local attraction paradigms. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on the link prediction task on a large number of real-life networks. We show, using extensive experimental analysis, that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art graph embedding algorithms. We also demonstrate its robustness to data scarcity and the choice of embedding dimensionality. ",

The classic paper of Shapley and Shubik \\cite{Shapley1971assignment} introduced the \"right\" way of exploiting the power of this theory, namely picking problems whose LP-relaxations support polyhedra having integral vertices. So far, the latter fact was established by showing that the constraint matrix of the underlying linear system is {\\em totally unimodular}. We attempt to take this methodology to its logical next step -- {\\em using total dual integrality} -- thereby addressing new classes of games which have their origins in two major theories within combinatorial optimization, namely perfect graphs and polymatroids. In the former, we address the stable set and clique games and in the latter, we address the matroid independent set game. For each of these games, we prove that the set of core imputations is precisely the set of optimal solutions to the dual LPs. Another novelty is the way the worth of the game is allocated among sub-coalitions. Previous works follow the {\\em bottom-up process} of allocating to individual agents; the allocation to a sub-coalition is simply the sum of the allocations to its agents. The {\\em natural process for our games is top-down}. The optimal dual allocates to \"objects\" in the grand coalition; a sub-coalition inherits the allocation of each object with which it has non-empty intersection. ",

To this end, we first collect a dataset of 4.9K videos of participants watching some sentimental and non-sentimental ads, and then we label the moments evoking sentimentality in the ads. Second, we use the ad-level labels and the facial Action Units (AUs) activation across different frames for defining some weak frame-level sentimentality labels. Third, we train a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using the AUs activation for sentimentality detection. Finally, we define two new ad-level metrics for evaluating our model performance. Quantitative and qualitative results show promising results for sentimentality detection. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to address the problem of sentimentality detection. ",

Indeed, it is very challenging problem in practice due to the limitations of abstracted information from the engine. We therefore introduce a new method named Attention-based Bijective Generative Adversarial Networks in a Distillation framework (DAB-GAN) to synthesize faces of a subject given his/her extracted face recognition features. Given any unconstrained unseen facial features of a subject, the DAB-GAN can reconstruct his/her faces in high definition. The DAB-GAN method includes a novel attention-based generative structure with the new defined Bijective Metrics Learning approach. The framework starts by introducing a bijective metric so that the distance measurement and metric learning process can be directly adopted in image domain for an image reconstruction task. The information from the blackbox face recognition engine will be optimally exploited using the global distillation process. Then an attention-based generator is presented for a highly robust generator to synthesize realistic faces with ID preservation. We have evaluated our method on the challenging face recognition databases, i.e. CelebA, LFW, AgeDB, CFP-FP, and consistently achieved the state-of-the-art results. The advancement of DAB-GAN is also proven on both image realism and ID preservation properties. ",

In this paper, we initiate the study of Compound Cyber-Physical Threats and develop a two-stage framework for the analysis of operational disruptions in electric power networks and economy-wide impacts under three scenarios: a Heatwave, a Cyberattack, and a Compound scenario when the Cyberattack is timed with the Heatwave. In the first stage, we use a bilevel optimization problem to represent the adversarial rationale of a cyberattacker in the upper level. In the lower level, we model disruptions in the electric power network using an optimal power flow model. In the second stage, we couple the disruption of electricity supply with a Computable General Equilibrium model to elucidate the impacts on all economic sectors. For the New York Independent System Operator, we find that a 9% demand increase in a Heatwave may not lead to unserved load. The Cyberattack can lead to 4% of unserved electric load in Long Island, while the Compound scenario can increase unserved electric load in Long Island to 13% and affect almost 600,000 customers. Our results show that the activity of state and local government enterprises can decrease by 30% in the Compound scenario. We conclude that the vulnerability of federal, state, and local government enterprises to electricity disruptions can affect a broad range of populations. ",

However, these applications might not be reliable if not secured against adversarial attacks. In addition, recent works demonstrated that some adversarial examples are transferable across different models. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid such transferability via robust models that resist adversarial manipulations. In this paper, we propose a feature randomization-based approach that resists eight adversarial attacks targeting deep learning models in the testing phase. Our novel approach consists of changing the training strategy in the target network classifier and selecting random feature samples. We consider the attacker with a Limited-Knowledge and Semi-Knowledge conditions to undertake the most prevalent types of adversarial attacks. We evaluate the robustness of our approach using the well-known UNSW-NB15 datasets that include realistic and synthetic attacks. Afterward, we demonstrate that our strategy outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach, such as the Most Powerful Attack, which consists of fine-tuning the network model against specific adversarial attacks. Finally, our experimental results show that our methodology can secure the target network and resists adversarial attack transferability by over 60%. ",

Due to the computationally expensive nature of their standard solution methods, neural PDE surrogates have become an active research topic to accelerate these simulations. However, current methods do not explicitly take into account the relationship between different fields and their internal components, which are often correlated. Viewing the time evolution of such correlated fields through the lens of multivector fields allows us to overcome these limitations. Multivector fields consist of scalar, vector, as well as higher-order components, such as bivectors and trivectors. Their algebraic properties, such as multiplication, addition and other arithmetic operations can be described by Clifford algebras. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first usage of such multivector representations together with Clifford convolutions and Clifford Fourier transforms in the context of deep learning. The resulting Clifford neural layers are universally applicable and will find direct use in the areas of fluid dynamics, weather forecasting, and the modeling of physical systems in general. We empirically evaluate the benefit of Clifford neural layers by replacing convolution and Fourier operations in common neural PDE surrogates by their Clifford counterparts on two-dimensional Navier-Stokes and weather modeling tasks, as well as three-dimensional Maxwell equations. Clifford neural layers consistently improve generalization capabilities of the tested neural PDE surrogates. ",

In view of the non-cooperative nature of the underlying decision-making process, it is imperative to protect the privacy of individual players in networked games when sensitive information is involved. We propose an approach that can achieve both accurate convergence and rigorous differential privacy with finite cumulative privacy budget in distributed Nash equilibrium seeking, which is in sharp contrast to existing differential-privacy solutions for networked games that have to trade convergence accuracy for differential privacy. The approach is applicable even when the communication graph is unbalanced and it does not require individual players to have any global structure information of the communication graph. Since the approach utilizes independent noises for privacy protection, it can combat adversaries having access to all shared messages in the network. It is also encryption-free, ensuring high efficiency in communication and computation. Numerical comparison results with existing counterparts confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "Modern autonomous vehicles rely heavily on mechanical LiDARs for perception. Current perception methods generally require 360{\\deg} point clouds, collected sequentially as the LiDAR scans the azimuth and acquires consecutive wedge-shaped slices. The acquisition latency of a full scan (~ 100ms) may lead to outdated perception which is detrimental to safe operation. Recent streaming perception works proposed directly processing LiDAR slices and compensating for the narrow field of view (FOV) of a slice by reusing features from preceding slices. These works, however, are all based on a single modality and require past information which may be outdated. Meanwhile, images from high-frequency cameras can support streaming models as they provide a larger FoV compared to a LiDAR slice. However, this difference in FoV complicates sensor fusion. To address this research gap, we propose an innovative camera-LiDAR streaming 3D object detection framework that uses camera images instead of past LiDAR slices to provide an up-to-date, dense, and wide context for streaming perception. The proposed method outperforms prior streaming models on the challenging NuScenes benchmark. It also outperforms powerful full-scan detectors while being much faster. Our method is shown to be robust to missing camera images, narrow LiDAR slices, and small camera-LiDAR miscalibration. ",

    "abstract": "Online health communities (OHCs) offer the promise of connecting with supportive peers. Forming these connections first requires finding relevant peers - a process that can be time-consuming. Peer recommendation systems are a computational approach to make finding peers easier during a health journey. By encouraging OHC users to alter their online social networks, peer recommendations could increase available support. But these benefits are hypothetical and based on mixed, observational evidence. To experimentally evaluate the effect of peer recommendations, we conceptualize these systems as health interventions designed to increase specific beneficial connection behaviors. In this paper, we designed a peer recommendation intervention to increase two behaviors: reading about peer experiences and interacting with peers. We conducted an initial feasibility assessment of this intervention by conducting a 12-week field study in which 79 users of CaringBridge received weekly peer recommendations via email. Our results support the usefulness and demand for peer recommendation and suggest benefits to evaluating larger peer recommendation interventions. Our contributions include practical guidance on the development and evaluation of peer recommendation interventions for OHCs. ",

Accurate state observing for complicated nonlinear system is the basis for fantastic energy managing in FCEVs. Aiming at releasing the energy-saving potential of FCEVs, a novel learning-based robust model predictive control (LRMPC) strategy is proposed for a 4WD FCEV, contributing to suitable power distribution among multiple energy sources. The well-designed strategy based on machine learning (ML) translates the knowledge of the nonlinear system to the explicit controlling scheme with superior robust performance. To start with, ML methods with high regression accuracy and superior generalization ability are trained offline to establish the precise state observer for SOC. Then, explicit data tables for SOC generated by state observer are used for grabbing accurate state changing, whose input features include the vehicle status and the states of vehicle components. To be specific, the vehicle velocity estimation for providing future speed reference is constructed by deep forest. Next, the components including explicit data tables and vehicle velocity estimation are combined with model predictive control (MPC) to release the state-of-the-art energy-saving ability for the multi-freedom system in FCEVs, whose name is LRMPC. At last, the detailed assessment is performed in simulation test to validate the advancing performance of LRMPC.

Therefore, we consider the following methods to overcome this difficulty. For the merged fully nonlinear PDEs and 2BSDEs system, combined with the time forward discretization and ReLU function, we use multi-scale deep learning fusion and convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques to obtain two numerical approximation schemes, respectively. In numerical experiments, involving Allen-Cahn equations, Black-Scholes-Barentblatt equations, and Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman equations, the first proposed method exhibits higher efficiency and accuracy than the existing method; the second proposed method can extend the dimensionality of the completely non-linear PDEs-2BSDEs system over $400$ dimensions, from which the numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of proposed methods.

To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient anomaly detection framework using hyperbolic self-supervised contrastive learning.

    "abstract": "Despite great recent advances achieved by deep neural networks (DNNs), they are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Intensive research efforts have been made to improve the robustness of DNNs; however, most empirical defenses can be adaptively attacked again, and the theoretically certified robustness is limited, especially on large-scale datasets. One potential root cause of such vulnerabilities for DNNs is that although they have demonstrated powerful expressiveness, they lack the reasoning ability to make robust and reliable predictions. In this paper, we aim to integrate domain knowledge to enable robust learning with the reasoning paradigm. In particular, we propose a certifiably robust learning with reasoning pipeline (CARE), which consists of a learning component and a reasoning component. Concretely, we use a set of standard DNNs to serve as the learning component to make semantic predictions, and we leverage the probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov logic networks (MLN), to serve as the reasoning component to enable knowledge/logic reasoning. However, it is known that the exact inference of MLN (reasoning) is #P-complete, which limits the scalability of the pipeline. To this end, we propose to approximate the MLN inference via variational inference based on an efficient expectation maximization algorithm. In particular, we leverage graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to encode the posterior distribution during variational inference and update the parameters of GCNs (E-step) and the weights of knowledge rules in MLN (M-step) iteratively. We conduct extensive experiments on different datasets and show that CARE achieves significantly higher certified robustness compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. We additionally conducted different ablation studies to demonstrate the empirical robustness of CARE and the effectiveness of different knowledge integration. ",

    "abstract": "Neural ranking models (NRMs) have become one of the most important techniques in information retrieval (IR). Due to the limitation of relevance labels, the training of NRMs heavily relies on negative sampling over unlabeled data. In general machine learning scenarios, it has shown that training with hard negatives (i.e., samples that are close to positives) could lead to better performance. Surprisingly, we find opposite results from our empirical studies in IR. When sampling top-ranked results (excluding the labeled positives) as negatives from a stronger retriever, the performance of the learned NRM becomes even worse. Based on our investigation, the superficial reason is that there are more false negatives (i.e., unlabeled positives) in the top-ranked results with a stronger retriever, which may hurt the training process; The root is the existence of pooling bias in the dataset constructing process, where annotators only judge and label very few samples selected by some basic retrievers. Therefore, in principle, we can formulate the false negative issue in training NRMs as learning from labeled datasets with pooling bias. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Coupled Estimation Technique (CET) that learns both a relevance model and a selection model simultaneously to correct the pooling bias for training NRMs. Empirical results on three retrieval benchmarks show that NRMs trained with our technique can achieve significant gains on ranking effectiveness against other baseline strategies.

Unlike the saturation effects, the temperature variations are difficult to predict, thus it is essential to track temperature-dependent parameters online. In this paper, a unified framework is developed for online parameter identification of rotating electric machines, premised on the Recursive Prediction Error Method (RPEM). Secondly, the prediction gradient ($\\mathbf{\\Psi}^T$)-based RPEM is adopted for identification of the temperature-sensitive parameters, i.e., the permanent magnet flux linkage ($\\Psi_m$) and stator-winding resistance ($R_s$) of the Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (IPMSM). Three algorithms, namely, Stochastic Gradient (SGA), Gauss-Newton (GNA), and physically interpretative method (PhyInt) are investigated for the estimation gains computation. A speed-dependent gain-scheduling scheme is used to decouple the inter-dependency of $\\Psi_m$ and $R_s$. With the aid of offline simulation methods, the main elements of RPEM such as $\\mathbf{\\Psi}^T$ are analyzed. The concept validation and the choice of the optimal algorithm is made with the use of System-on-Chip (SoC) based Embedded Real-Time Simulator (ERTS). Subsequently, the selected algorithms are validated with the aid of a 3-kW, IPMSM drive where the control and estimation routines are implemented in the SoC-based industrial embedded control system. The experimental results reveal that $\\mathbf{\\Psi}^T$-based RPEM, in general, can be a versatile technique in temperature-sensitive parameter adaptation both online and offline. ",

Developments of 3-D shape perception and control technologies are crucial for continuum robots to perform the tasks autonomously in surgical interventions. However, owing to the nonlinear properties of continuum robots, one main difficulty lies in the modeling of them, especially for soft robots with variable stiffness. To address this problem, we propose a new robust adaptive controller by leveraging FBG shape feedback and neural networks (NNs) that can online estimate the unknown model of continuum robot and accounts for unexpected disturbances together with NN approximation errors, which exhibits an adaptive behavior to the unmodeled system without priori data exploration. Based on a new composite adaptation algorithm, the asymptotic convergences of the closed-loop system with NNs learning parameters have been proven by Lyapunov theory. To validate the proposed method, we present a comprehensive experimental study by using two continuum robots both integrated with multi-core FBGs, including a robotic-assisted colonoscope and multi-section extensible soft manipulators. The results demonstrate the feasibility, adaptability, and superiority of our controller in various unstructured environments as well as phantom experiments. ",

In this study, we propose a data augmentation method that calculates the distance between classes based on class probabilities and can select data from suitable classes to be mixed in the training process. Mixture data is dynamically adjusted according to the training trend of each class to facilitate training.

    "abstract": "Based on the tremendous success of pre-trained language models (PrLMs) for source code comprehension tasks, current literature studies either ways to further improve the performance (generalization) of PrLMs, or their robustness against adversarial attacks. However, they have to compromise on the trade-off between the two aspects and none of them consider improving both sides in an effective and practical way. To fill this gap, we propose Semantic-Preserving Adversarial Code Embeddings (SPACE) to find the worst-case semantic-preserving attacks while forcing the model to predict the correct labels under these worst cases. Experiments and analysis demonstrate that SPACE can stay robust against state-of-the-art attacks while boosting the performance of PrLMs for code. ",

Our approach is in contrast with the analysis of pointer manipulation programs using separation logic, shape analysis, etc. in that (i) we do not consider destructive operations but pattern matchings over graphs provided by the new higher-level language that abstract pointers and heaps away and that (ii) we pursue what properties can be established automatically using a rather simple typing framework.

    "abstract": "Internet censorship is a phenomenon of societal importance and attracts investigation from multiple disciplines. Several research groups, such as Censored Planet, have deployed large scale Internet measurement platforms to collect network reachability data. However, existing studies generally rely on manually designed rules (i.e., using censorship fingerprints) to detect network-based Internet censorship from the data. While this rule-based approach yields a high true positive detection rate, it suffers from several challenges: it requires human expertise, is laborious, and cannot detect any censorship not captured by the rules. Seeking to overcome these challenges, we design and evaluate a classification model based on latent feature representation learning and an image-based classification model to detect network-based Internet censorship. To infer latent feature representations from network reachability data, we propose a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder to capture the structure and the order of data elements in the data. To estimate the probability of censorship events from the inferred latent features, we rely on a densely connected multi-layer neural network model. Our image-based classification model encodes a network reachability data record as a gray-scale image and classifies the image as censored or not using a dense convolutional neural network. We compare and evaluate both approaches using data sets from Censored Planet via a hold-out evaluation. Both classification models are capable of detecting network-based Internet censorship as we were able to identify instances of censorship not detected by the known fingerprints. Latent feature representations likely encode more nuances in the data since the latent feature learning approach discovers a greater quantity, and a more diverse set, of new censorship instances. ",

Alongside, we present a well annotated and costly dataset termed \\emph{ByteFood}, including more than 5.1k gourmet videos belongs to four different domains which are \\emph{cooking}, \\emph{eating}, \\emph{food material}, and \\emph{presentation} respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the incremental learning settings are introduced to video highlights detection, which in turn relieves the burden of training video inputs and promotes the scalability of conventional neural networks in proportion to both the size of the dataset and the quantity of domains. Moreover, the proposed GPE surpasses current incremental learning methods on \\emph{ByteFood}, reporting an improvement of 1.57\\% mAP at least. The code and dataset will be made available sooner. ",

    "abstract": "Network flow problems, which involve distributing traffic over a network such that the underlying infrastructure is used effectively, are ubiquitous in transportation and logistics. Due to the appeal of data-driven optimization, these problems have increasingly been approached using graph learning methods. Among them, the Multi-Commodity Network Flow (MCNF) problem is of particular interest given its generality, since it concerns the distribution of multiple flows (also called demands) of different sizes between several sources and sinks. The widely-used objective that we focus on is the maximum utilization of any link in the network, given traffic demands and a routing strategy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the MCNF problem which uses distinctly parametrized message functions along each link, akin to a relational model where all edge types are unique. We show that our proposed method yields substantial gains over existing graph learning methods that constrain the routing unnecessarily. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach by means of an Internet routing case study using 17 Service Provider topologies and two flow routing schemes. We find that, in many networks, an MLP is competitive with a generic GNN that does not use our mechanism. Furthermore, we shed some light on the relationship between graph structure and the difficulty of data-driven routing of flows, an aspect that has not been considered in the existing work in the area.

    "abstract": "Deploying machine learning models on mobile devices has gained increasing attention. To tackle the model generalization problem with the limitations of hardware resources on the device, the device model needs to be lightweight by techniques such as model compression from the cloud model. However, the major obstacle to improve the device model generalization is the distribution shift between the data of cloud and device models, since the data distribution on device model often changes over time (e.g., users might have different preferences in recommendation system). Although real-time fine-tuning and distillation method take this situation into account, these methods require on-device training, which are practically infeasible due to the low computational power and a lack of real-time labeled samples on the device. In this paper, we propose a novel task-agnostic framework, named MetaNetwork, for generating adaptive device model parameters from cloud without on-device training. Specifically, our MetaNetwork is deployed on cloud and consists of MetaGenerator and MetaStabilizer modules. The MetaGenerator is designed to learn a mapping function from samples to model parameters, and it can generate and deliver the adaptive parameters to the device based on samples uploaded from the device to the cloud. The MetaStabilizer aims to reduce the oscillation of the MetaGenerator, accelerate the convergence and improve the model performance during both training and inference. We evaluate our method on two tasks with three datasets. Extensive experiments show that MetaNetwork can achieve competitive performances in different modalities. ",

Existing backdoor detection methods are typically tailored for backdoor attacks with individual specific types (e.g., patch-based or perturbation-based). However, adversaries are likely to generate multiple types of backdoor attacks in practice, which challenges the current detection strategies. Based on the fact that adversarial perturbations are highly correlated with trigger patterns, this paper proposes the Adaptive Perturbation Generation (APG) framework to detect multiple types of backdoor attacks by adaptively injecting adversarial perturbations. Since different trigger patterns turn out to show highly diverse behaviors under the same adversarial perturbations, we first design the global-to-local strategy to fit the multiple types of backdoor triggers via adjusting the region and budget of attacks. To further increase the efficiency of perturbation injection, we introduce a gradient-guided mask generation strategy to search for the optimal regions for adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, Tiny-ImageNet) demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by large margins(+12%). ",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of West Nile Virus (WNV) represents one of the most common mosquito-borne zoonosis viral infections. Its circulation is usually associated with climatic and environmental conditions suitable for vector proliferation and virus replication. On top of that, several statistical models have been developed to shape and forecast WNV circulation: in particular, the recent massive availability of Earth Observation (EO) data, coupled with the continuous advances in the field of Artificial Intelligence, offer valuable opportunities. In this paper, we seek to predict WNV circulation by feeding Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with satellite images, which have been extensively shown to hold environmental and climatic features. Notably, while previous approaches analyze each geographical site independently, we propose a spatial-aware approach that considers also the characteristics of close sites. Specifically, we build upon Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to aggregate features from neighbouring places, and further extend these modules to consider multiple relations, such as the difference in temperature and soil moisture between two sites, as well as the geographical distance. Moreover, we inject time-related information directly into the model to take into account the seasonality of virus spread. We design an experimental setting that combines satellite images - from Landsat and Sentinel missions - with ground truth observations of WNV circulation in Italy. We show that our proposed Multi-Adjacency Graph Attention Network (MAGAT) consistently leads to higher performance when paired with an appropriate pre-training stage. Finally, we assess the importance of each component of MAGAT in our ablation studies. ",

This paper presents a prediction method for SOH based on Vision Transformer (ViT) model. First, discrete charging data of a predefined voltage range is used as an input data matrix. Then, the cycle features of the battery are captured by the ViT which can obtain the global features, and the SOH is obtained by combining the cycle features with the full connection (FC) layer. At the same time, transfer learning (TL) is introduced, and the prediction model based on source task battery training is further fine-tuned according to the early cycle data of the target task battery to provide an accurate prediction. Experiments show that our method can obtain better feature expression compared with existing deep learning methods so that better prediction effect and transfer effect can be achieved. ",

The previously reported machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for detecting (classification) and predicting (regression) VR cybersickness use black-box models; thus, they lack explainability. Moreover, VR sensors generate a massive amount of data, resulting in complex and large models. Therefore, having inherent explainability in cybersickness detection models can significantly improve the model's trustworthiness and provide insight into why and how the ML/DL model arrived at a specific decision. To address this issue, we present three explainable machine learning (xML) models to detect and predict cybersickness: 1) explainable boosting machine (EBM), 2) decision tree (DT), and 3) logistic regression (LR). We evaluate xML-based models with publicly available physiological and gameplay datasets for cybersickness. The results show that the EBM can detect cybersickness with an accuracy of 99.75% and 94.10% for the physiological and gameplay datasets, respectively. On the other hand, while predicting the cybersickness, EBM resulted in a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.071 for the physiological dataset and 0.27 for the gameplay dataset. Furthermore, the EBM-based global explanation reveals exposure length, rotation, and acceleration as key features causing cybersickness in the gameplay dataset. In contrast, galvanic skin responses and heart rate are most significant in the physiological dataset. Our results also suggest that EBM-based local explanation can identify cybersickness-causing factors for individual samples. We believe the proposed xML-based cybersickness detection method can help future researchers understand, analyze, and design simpler cybersickness detection and reduction models. ",

Through the dense self-supervised depth constraints, our method improves both the geometry and the view synthesis performance of NeRF without any additional training on external data.

    "title": "DoubleMix: Simple Interpolation-Based Data Augmentation for Text  Classification",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a simple yet effective interpolation-based data augmentation approach termed DoubleMix, to improve the robustness of models in text classification. DoubleMix first leverages a couple of simple augmentation operations to generate several perturbed samples for each training data, and then uses the perturbed data and original data to carry out a two-step interpolation in the hidden space of neural models. Concretely, it first mixes up the perturbed data to a synthetic sample and then mixes up the original data and the synthetic perturbed data. DoubleMix enhances models' robustness by learning the \"shifted\" features in hidden space. On six text classification benchmark datasets, our approach outperforms several popular text augmentation methods including token-level, sentence-level, and hidden-level data augmentation techniques. Also, experiments in low-resource settings show our approach consistently improves models' performance when the training data is scarce. Extensive ablation studies and case studies confirm that each component of our approach contributes to the final performance and show that our approach exhibits superior performance on challenging counterexamples. Additionally, visual analysis shows that text features generated by our approach are highly interpretable. Our code for this paper can be found at https://github.com/declare-lab/DoubleMix.git. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, Deepfake has drawn considerable public attention due to security and privacy concerns in social media digital forensics. As the wildly spreading Deepfake videos on the Internet become more realistic, traditional detection techniques have failed in distinguishing between the real and fake. Most existing deep learning methods mainly focus on local features and relations within the face image using convolutional neural networks as a backbone. However, local features and relations are insufficient for model training to learn enough general information for Deepfake detection. Therefore, the existing Deepfake detection methods have reached a bottleneck to further improving the detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a deep convolutional Transformer to incorporate the decisive image features both locally and globally. Specifically, we apply convolutional pooling and re-attention to enrich the extracted features and enhance the efficacy. Moreover, we employ the barely discussed image keyframes in model training for performance improvement and visualize the feature quantity gap between the key and normal image frames caused by video compression. We finally illustrate the transferability with extensive experiments on several Deepfake benchmark datasets. The proposed solution consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on both within- and cross-dataset experiments. ",

Traditional insurance risk models employ statistical analyses that are inaccurate and are becoming increasingly flawed as climate change renders weather more erratic and extreme. Data-driven parametric insurance could provide necessary protection to supplement traditional insurance. We use a technique referred to as the deep sigma point process, which is one of the Bayesian neural network approaches, for the data analysis portion of parametric insurance using residential internet connectivity dropout in US as a case study. We show that our model has significantly improved accuracy compared to traditional statistical models. We further demonstrate that each state in US has a unique weather factor that primarily influences dropout rates and that by combining multiple weather factors we can build highly accurate risk models for parametric insurance. We expect that our method can be applied to many types of risk to build parametric insurance options, particularly as climate change makes risk modeling more challenging. ",

To efficiently seek such an optimal weight distribution is not a simple task and most existing methods choose the adaptive weights based on approximating the full distribution or the maximum of residuals. In this paper, we show that the bottleneck in the adaptive choice of samples for training efficiency is the behavior of the tail distribution of the numerical residual. Thus, we propose the Residual-Quantile Adjustment (RQA) method for a better weight choice for each training sample. After initially setting the weights proportional to the $p$-th power of the residual, our RQA method reassign all weights above $q$-quantile ($90\\%$ for example) to the median value, so that the weight follows a quantile-adjusted distribution derived from the residuals. With the iterative reweighting technique, RQA is also very easy to implement. Experiment results show that the proposed method can outperform several adaptive methods on various partial differential equation (PDE) problems. ",

A MAC address, a physical network address that is used as basis for this study, has a copy of its value in the system software that can be spoofed and altered rendering the address not unique, not secure and unreliable. On the contrary, a computers serial number is hard-coded in the system hardware only and therefore cannot be spoofed and altered making it unique, secure and reliable. The research, therefore, was aimed at designing a model that demonstrates how a computers serial number can be used for authenticating a computer in a wireless local area network. In order to achieve the research objective, the study examined the inbuilt access and use of a computers serial number prototype model as an alternative method of authenticating devices in a network. Design science research methodology that involved design and development, demonstration and model evaluation was employed. A Serial Number Based Authentication Prototype or SNAP was therefore designed using state chart and flow chart diagrams based on dynamic programming, developed over evolutionary prototyping and test run on a static experimental design using Java Development Kit and MySQL platforms to demonstrate, as proof of concept, that a computers serial number can be used to authenticate a computer in a wireless local area network. From the test runs whose outcomes were the binary values yes or no, it was found out that SNAP can actually allow or deny, enable or disable a computer in a network based on the computers serial number. The researcher therefore, recommends that the prototype be scaled up, then adopted as a network device authentication method. ",

Recent works based on state-visitation counts, curiosity and entropy-maximization generate intrinsic reward signals to motivate the agent to visit novel states for exploration. However, the agent can get distracted by perturbations to sensor inputs that contain novel but task-irrelevant information, e.g. due to sensor noise or changing background. In this work, we introduce the sequential information bottleneck objective for learning compressed and temporally coherent representations by modelling and compressing sequential predictive information in time-series observations. For efficient exploration in noisy environments, we further construct intrinsic rewards that capture task-relevant state novelty based on the learned representations. We derive a variational upper bound of our sequential information bottleneck objective for practical optimization and provide an information-theoretic interpretation of the derived upper bound. Our experiments on a set of challenging image-based simulated control tasks show that our method achieves better sample efficiency, and robustness to both white noise and natural video backgrounds compared to state-of-art methods based on curiosity, entropy maximization and information-gain.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of face forgery technology, deepfake videos have attracted widespread attention in digital media. Perpetrators heavily utilize these videos to spread disinformation and make misleading statements. Most existing methods for deepfake detection mainly focus on texture features, which are likely to be impacted by external fluctuations, such as illumination and noise. Besides, detection methods based on facial landmarks are more robust against external variables but lack sufficient detail. Thus, how to effectively mine distinctive features in the spatial, temporal, and frequency domains and fuse them with facial landmarks for forgery video detection is still an open question. To this end, we propose a Landmark Enhanced Multimodal Graph Neural Network (LEM-GNN) based on multiple modalities' information and geometric features of facial landmarks. Specifically, at the frame level, we have designed a fusion mechanism to mine a joint representation of the spatial and frequency domain elements while introducing geometric facial features to enhance the robustness of the model. At the video level, we first regard each frame in a video as a node in a graph and encode temporal information into the edges of the graph. Then, by applying the message passing mechanism of the graph neural network (GNN), the multimodal feature will be effectively combined to obtain a comprehensive representation of the video forgery. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on widely-used benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "One of the challenging input settings for visual servoing is when the initial and goal camera views are far apart. Such settings are difficult because the wide baseline can cause drastic changes in object appearance and cause occlusions. This paper presents a novel self-supervised visual servoing method for wide baseline images which does not require 3D ground truth supervision. Existing approaches that regress absolute camera pose with respect to an object require 3D ground truth data of the object in the forms of 3D bounding boxes or meshes. We learn a coherent visual representation by leveraging a geometric property called 3D equivariance-the representation is transformed in a predictable way as a function of 3D transformation. To ensure that the feature-space is faithful to the underlying geodesic space, a geodesic preserving constraint is applied in conjunction with the equivariance. We design a Siamese network that can effectively enforce these two geometric properties without requiring 3D supervision. With the learned model, the relative transformation can be inferred simply by following the gradient in the learned space and used as feedback for closed-loop visual servoing. Our method is evaluated on objects from the YCB dataset, showing meaningful outperformance on a visual servoing task, or object alignment task with respect to state-of-the-art approaches that use 3D supervision. Ours yields more than 35% average distance error reduction and more than 90% success rate with 3cm error tolerance. ",

In this work, we introduce VeeP, an active learning approach that splits the verification process into a series of smaller verification steps, each is submitted to an existing robustness analyzer. The key idea is to build on prior steps to predict the next optimal step. The optimal step is predicted by estimating the certification velocity and sensitivity via parametric regression. We evaluate VeeP on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and show that it can analyze neighborhoods of various features: brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and lightness. We show that, on average, given a 90 minute timeout, VeeP verifies 96% of the maximally certifiable neighborhoods within 29 minutes, while existing splitting approaches verify, on average, 73% of the maximally certifiable neighborhoods within 58 minutes.

The introduction of novel technologies for energy production and storing, the insurgence of climate change and the attention for the introduction of low impact technologies in some countries are main factors leading this transformation. Here we focus in particular on the introduction of relatively small community energy systems based on solar energy that aim to re-organize local energy systems to integrate distributed energy resources and engage local communities. In each community, there is a set of producers and a set of consumers (and a set of producers/consumers called prosumers). One of the key aspects of the energetic communities is to maximise the energy that is shared within the user. Thus, it is crucial to select the best consumers/prosumers on the basis of their profile of consumption, in order to minimize subsequent management of the energy once the community is built. Here we describe the design of a recommender sysstem that is able to profile users on the basis of their past profile for subsequent admission into the energetic community.

    "abstract": "We study the practical setting in which regular- and reserve-crew schedules are dynamically maintained up to the day of executing the schedule. At each day preceding the execution of the schedule, disruptions occur due to sudden unavailability of personnel, making the planned regular and reserve-crew schedules infeasible for its execution day. This paper studies the fundamental question how to repair the schedules' infeasibility in the days preceding the execution, taking into account labor regulations. We propose a robust repair strategy that maintains flexibility in order to cope with additional future disruptions. The flexibility in reserve-crew usage is explicitly considered through evaluating the expected shortfall of the reserve-crew schedule based on a Markov chain formulation. The core of our approach relies on iteratively solving a set-covering formulation, which we call the Robust Crew Recovery Problem, which encapsulates this flexibility notion for reserve crew usage. A tailored branch-and-price algorithm is developed for solving the Robust Crew Recovery Problem to optimality. The corresponding pricing problem is efficiently solved by a newly developed pulse algorithm. Based on actual data from a medium-sized hub-and-spoke airline, we show that embracing our approach leads to fewer flight cancellations and fewer last-minute alterations, compared to repairing disrupted schedules without considering our robust measure.

    "abstract": "Expressing head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) in spherical harmonic (SH) domain has been thoroughly studied as a method of obtaining continuity over space. However, HRTFs are functions not only of direction but also of frequency. This paper presents an extension of the SH-based method, utilizing hyperspherical harmonics (HSHs) to obtain an HRTF representation that is continuous over both space and frequency. The application of the HSH approximation results in a relatively small set of coefficients which can be decoded into HRTF values at any direction and frequency. The paper discusses results obtained by applying the method to magnitude spectra extracted from exemplary HRTF measurements. The HRTF representations based on SHs and HSHs exhibit similar reproduction accuracy, with the latter one featuring continuity over both space and frequency and requiring much lower number of coefficients. The developed HSH-based continuous functional model can serve multiple purposes, such as interpolation, compression or parametrization for machine-learning applications. ",

By viewing the SNLSE as a stochastic Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow on density manifold, we show the global existence of a unique strong solution for SNLSE with a linear drift control or a linear diffusion control on graph. Furthermore, we provide the gradient formula, the existence of the optimal control and a description on the optimal condition via the forward and backward stochastic differential equations. ",
