    "abstract": "In modern highly interconnected power grids, automatic generation control (AGC) is crucial in maintaining the stability of the power grid. The dependence of the AGC system on the information and communications technology (ICT) system makes it vulnerable to various types of cyber-attacks. Thus, information flow (IF) analysis and anomaly detection became paramount for preventing cyber attackers from driving the cyber-physical power system (CPPS) to instability. In this paper, the ICT network traffic rules in CPPSs are explored and the frequency domain features of the ICT network traffic are extracted, basically for developing a robust learning algorithm that can learn the normal traffic pattern based on the ResNeSt convolutional neural network (CNN). Furthermore, to overcome the problem of insufficient abnormal traffic labeled samples, transfer learning approach is used. In the proposed data-driven-based method the deep learning model is trained by traffic frequency features, which makes our model robust against AGC's parameters uncertainties and modeling nonlinearities.

Moreover, recent morph detection methods are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

To this aim, we develop an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer models to benefit from their capabilities simultaneously. To improve the robust accuracy of the ensemble model, we employ multi-perturbation adversarial training and generate adversarial examples with high transferability for several single models. Our exhaustive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed robust ensemble model generalizes to several morphing attacks and face datasets. In addition, we validate that our robust ensemble model gain better robustness against several adversarial attacks while outperforming the state-of-the-art studies. ",

    "abstract": "Sharing information between connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) fundamentally improves the performance of collaborative object detection for self-driving. However, CAVs still have uncertainties on object detection due to practical challenges, which will affect the later modules in self-driving such as planning and control. Hence, uncertainty quantification is crucial for safety-critical systems such as CAVs. Our work is the first to estimate the uncertainty of collaborative object detection. We propose a novel uncertainty quantification method, called Double-M Quantification, which tailors a moving block bootstrap (MBB) algorithm with direct modeling of the multivariant Gaussian distribution of each corner of the bounding box. Our method captures both the epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty with one inference pass based on the offline Double-M training process. And it can be used with different collaborative object detectors. Through experiments on the comprehensive collaborative perception dataset, we show that our Double-M method achieves more than 4X improvement on uncertainty score and more than 3% accuracy improvement, compared with the state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods.

    "abstract": "Code comments are important artifacts in software systems and play a paramount role in many software engineering (SE) tasks related to maintenance and program comprehension. However, while it is widely accepted that high quality matters in code comments just as it matters in source code, assessing comment quality in practice is still an open problem. First and foremost, there is no unique definition of quality when it comes to evaluating code comments. The few existing studies on this topic rather focus on specific attributes of quality that can be easily quantified and measured. Existing techniques and corresponding tools may also focus on comments bound to a specific programming language, and may only deal with comments with specific scopes and clear goals (e.g., Javadoc comments at the method level, or in-body comments describing TODOs to be addressed). In this paper, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the last decade of research in SE to answer the following research questions: (i) What types of comments do researchers focus on when assessing comment quality? (ii) What quality attributes (QAs) do they consider? (iii) Which tools and techniques do they use to assess comment quality?, and (iv) How do they evaluate their studies on comment quality assessment in general? Our evaluation, based on the analysis of 2353 papers and the actual review of 47 relevant ones, shows that (i) most studies and techniques focus on comments in Java code, thus may not be generalizable to other languages, and (ii) the analyzed studies focus on four main QAs of a total of 21 QAs identified in the literature, with a clear predominance of checking consistency between comments and the code. We observe that researchers rely on manual assessment and specific heuristics rather than the automated assessment of the comment quality attributes. ",

This is a natural generalization of the string trace reconstruction problem in theoretical computer science, which corresponds to the special case where the spider has one leg. In the regime where $d\\ge \\log_{1/q}(n)$, the problem can be reduced to the vanilla string trace reconstruction problem. We thus study the more interesting regime $d\\le \\log_{1/q}(n)$, in which entire legs of the spider are deleted with non-negligible probability.

    "abstract": "Fluid-flow devices with low dissipation, but high contact area, are of importance in many applications. A well-known strategy to design such devices is multi-scale topology optimization (MTO), where optimal microstructures are designed within each cell of a discretized domain. Unfortunately, MTO is computationally very expensive since one must perform homogenization of the evolving microstructures, during each step of the homogenization process. As an alternate, we propose here a graded multiscale topology optimization (GMTO) for designing fluid-flow devices. In the proposed method, several pre-selected but size-parameterized and orientable microstructures are used to fill the domain optimally. GMTO significantly reduces the computation while retaining many of the benefits of MTO. In particular, GMTO is implemented here using a neural-network (NN) since: (1) homogenization can be performed off-line, and used by the NN during optimization, (2) it enables continuous switching between microstructures during optimization, (3) the number of design variables and computational effort is independent of number of microstructure used, and, (4) it supports automatic differentiation, thereby eliminating manual sensitivity analysis. Several numerical results are presented to illustrate the proposed framework. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning algorithms have led to significant benefits for solving many medical image analysis problems. Training deep learning models commonly requires large datasets with expert-labeled annotations. However, acquiring expert-labeled annotation is not only expensive but also is subjective, error-prone, and inter-/intra- observer variability introduces noise to labels. This is particularly a problem when using deep learning models for segmenting medical images due to the ambiguous anatomical boundaries. Image-based medical diagnosis tools using deep learning models trained with incorrect segmentation labels can lead to false diagnoses and treatment suggestions. Multi-rater annotations might be better suited to train deep learning models with small training sets compared to single-rater annotations. The aim of this paper was to develop and evaluate a method to generate probabilistic labels based on multi-rater annotations and anatomical knowledge of the lesion features in MRI and a method to train segmentation models using probabilistic labels using normalized active-passive loss as a \"noise-tolerant loss\" function. The model was evaluated by comparing it to binary ground truth for 17 knees MRI scans for clinical segmentation and detection of bone marrow lesions (BML). The proposed method successfully improved precision 14, recall 22, and Dice score 8 percent compared to a binary cross-entropy loss function. Overall, the results of this work suggest that the proposed normalized active-passive loss using soft labels successfully mitigated the effects of noisy labels. ",

However, systems for accurate oyster detection require large datasets obtaining which is an expensive and labor-intensive task in underwater environments. To this end, we present a novel method to mathematically model oysters and render images of oysters in simulation to boost the detection performance with minimal real data. Utilizing our synthetic data along with real data for oyster detection, we obtain up to 35.1% boost in performance as compared to using only real data with our OysterNet network. We also improve the state-of-the-art by 12.7%. This shows that using underlying geometrical properties of objects can help to enhance recognition task accuracy on limited datasets successfully and we hope more researchers adopt such a strategy for hard-to-obtain datasets.

In particular, we exploit the lower and upper neighborhoods, as encoded in the cell complex, to design two independent masked self-attention mechanisms, thus generalizing the conventional graph attention strategy. The approach used in CANs is hierarchical and it incorporates the following steps: i) a lifting algorithm that learns {\\it edge features} from {\\it node features}; ii) a cell attention mechanism to find the optimal combination of edge features over both lower and upper neighbors; iii) a hierarchical {\\it edge pooling} mechanism to extract a compact meaningful set of features.

In this work, we consider the task of obtaining accurate state estimates for robotic systems by enhancing the dynamics model used in state estimation algorithms. Existing frameworks such as moving horizon estimation (MHE) and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) provide the flexibility to incorporate nonlinear dynamics and measurement models. However, this implies that the dynamics model within these algorithms has to be sufficiently accurate in order to warrant the accuracy of the state estimates. To enhance the dynamics models and improve the estimation accuracy, we utilize a deep learning framework known as knowledge-based neural ordinary differential equations (KNODEs). The KNODE framework embeds prior knowledge into the training procedure and synthesizes an accurate hybrid model by fusing a prior first-principles model with a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) model. In our proposed LEARNEST framework, we integrate the data-driven model into two novel model-based state estimation algorithms, which are denoted as KNODE-MHE and KNODE-UKF. These two algorithms are compared against their conventional counterparts across a number of robotic applications; state estimation for a cartpole system using partial measurements, localization for a ground robot, as well as state estimation for a quadrotor. Through simulations and tests using real-world experimental data, we demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of the proposed learning-enhanced state estimation framework. ",

We propose two different methods of integrating discourse relations with pretrained transformer models and evaluate them on our dataset of offensive comments from Reddit and their inoffensive counterparts. Improvements over the baseline with respect to both automatic metrics and human evaluation indicate that our discourse-aware models are better at preserving meaning in style-transferred text when compared to the state-of-the-art discourse-agnostic models.

Since there usually exists a mismatch between the training and test (true) environments, incorporating model uncertainty into system design is of critical importance in real-world applications. However, model uncertainties have not been considered explicitly in EV AMoD system rebalancing by existing literature yet and remain an urgent and challenging task. In this work, we design a robust and constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework with transition kernel uncertainty for the EV rebalancing and charging problem. We then propose a robust and constrained MARL algorithm (ROCOMA) that trains a robust EV rebalancing policy to balance the supply-demand ratio and the charging utilization rate across the whole city under state transition uncertainty. Experiments show that the ROCOMA can learn an effective and robust rebalancing policy. It outperforms non-robust MARL methods when there are model uncertainties. It increases the system fairness by 19.6% and decreases the rebalancing costs by 75.8%. ",

    "abstract": "The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication technology is regarded as an efficient and effective solution for some special application scenarios where existing terrestrial infrastructures are overloaded to provide reliable services. To maximize the utility of the UAV-enabled system while meeting the QoS and energy constraints, the UAV needs to plan its trajectory considering the dynamic characteristics of scenarios, which is formulated as the Markov Decision Process (MDP). To solve the above problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based scheme is proposed here, which predicts the trend of the dynamic scenarios to provide a long-term view for the UAV trajectory planning. Simulation results validate that our proposed scheme converges more quickly and achieves the better performance in dynamic scenarios. ",

    "title": "Understanding the Impact of Image Quality and Distance of Objects to  Object Detection Performance",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has made great strides for object detection in images. The detection accuracy and computational cost of object detection depend on the spatial resolution of an image, which may be constrained by both the camera and storage considerations. Compression is often achieved by reducing either spatial or amplitude resolution or, at times, both, both of which have well-known effects on performance. Detection accuracy also depends on the distance of the object of interest from the camera. Our work examines the impact of spatial and amplitude resolution, as well as object distance, on object detection accuracy and computational cost. We develop a resolution-adaptive variant of YOLOv5 (RA-YOLO), which varies the number of scales in the feature pyramid and detection head based on the spatial resolution of the input image. To train and evaluate this new method, we created a dataset of images with diverse spatial and amplitude resolutions by combining images from the TJU and Eurocity datasets and generating different resolutions by applying spatial resizing and compression. We first show that RA-YOLO achieves a good trade-off between detection accuracy and inference time over a large range of spatial resolutions. We then evaluate the impact of spatial and amplitude resolutions on object detection accuracy using the proposed RA-YOLO model. We demonstrate that the optimal spatial resolution that leads to the highest detection accuracy depends on the 'tolerated' image size. We further assess the impact of the distance of an object to the camera on the detection accuracy and show that higher spatial resolution enables a greater detection range. These results provide important guidelines for choosing the image spatial resolution and compression settings predicated on available bandwidth, storage, desired inference time, and/or desired detection range, in practical applications.

It is fundamental for efficient information fusion, control and decision in distributed systems. Previously, distributed data synchronization was mainly studied in the latency-tolerant distributed databases, or assuming the general model of wireless ad hoc networks. In this paper, we propose a pair of linear network coding (NC) and all-to-all broadcast based fast data synchronization algorithms for wireless ad hoc networks whose topology is under operator's control. We consider both data block selection and transmitting node selection for exploiting the benefits of NC. Instead of using the store-and-forward protocol as in the conventional uncoded approach, a compute-and-forward protocol is used in our scheme, which improves the transmission efficiency. The performance of the proposed algorithms is studied under different values of network size, network connection degree, and per-hop packet error rate. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce the times slots used for data synchronization compared with the baseline that does not use NC. ",

FNNs are observed to be better at classifying noise-intensive, single-channeled images that are just sheer noise to human vision. In our study, we have used the hand-written digits dataset, MNIST with the following architectures: FNNs with 1 and 2 hidden layers and CNNs with 3, 4, 6 and 8 convolutions and analyzed their accuracies. FNNs stand out to show that irrespective of the intensity of noise, they have a classification accuracy of more than 85%. In our analysis of CNNs with this data, the deceleration of classification accuracy of CNN with 8 convolutions was half of that of the rest of the CNNs.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are popular machine learning methods for modeling graph data. A lot of GNNs perform well on homophily graphs while having unsatisfactory performance on heterophily graphs. Recently, some researchers turn their attention to designing GNNs for heterophily graphs by adjusting the message passing mechanism or enlarging the receptive field of the message passing. Different from existing works that mitigate the issues of heterophily from model design perspective, we propose to study heterophily graphs from an orthogonal perspective by rewiring the graph structure to reduce heterophily and making the traditional GNNs perform better. Through comprehensive empirical studies and analysis, we verify the potential of the rewiring methods. To fully exploit its potential, we propose a method named Deep Heterophily Graph Rewiring (DHGR) to rewire graphs by adding homophilic edges and pruning heterophilic edges. The detailed way of rewiring is determined by comparing the similarity of label/feature-distribution of node neighbors. Besides, we design a scalable implementation for DHGR to guarantee high efficiency. DHRG can be easily used as a plug-in module, i.e., a graph pre-processing step, for any GNNs, including both GNN for homophily and heterophily, to boost their performance on the node classification task. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work studying graph rewiring for heterophily graphs. Extensive experiments on 11 public graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods. ",

In this paper, we present a topological semantic graph memory (TSGM), which consists of (1) a graph builder that takes the observed RGB-D image to construct a topological semantic graph, (2) a cross graph mixer module that takes the collected nodes to get contextual information, and (3) a memory decoder that takes the contextual memory as an input to find an action to the target. On the task of image goal navigation, TSGM significantly outperforms competitive baselines by +5.0-9.0% on the success rate and +7.0-23.5% on SPL, which means that the TSGM finds efficient paths.

Unlike explicit representation that represents light fields as Sub-Aperture Images (SAIs) based arrays or Micro-Images (MIs) based lenslet images, implicit representation treats light fields as neural networks, which is inherently a continuous representation in contrast to discrete explicit representation. However, at present almost all the implicit representations for light fields utilize SAIs to train an MLP to learn a pixel-wise mapping from 4D spatial-angular coordinate to pixel colors, which is neither compact nor of low complexity. Instead, in this paper we propose MiNL, a novel MI-wise implicit neural representation for light fields that train an MLP + CNN to learn a mapping from 2D MI coordinates to MI colors. Given the micro-image's coordinate, MiNL outputs the corresponding micro-image's RGB values. Light field encoding in MiNL is just training a neural network to regress the micro-images and the decoding process is a simple feedforward operation. Compared with common pixel-wise implicit representation, MiNL is more compact and efficient that has faster decoding speed (\\textbf{$\\times$80$\\sim$180} speed-up) as well as better visual quality (\\textbf{1$\\sim$4dB} PSNR improvement on average).

Extracting geographic information from texts is called Geoparsing, which includes two subtasks: toponym recognition and toponym disambiguation, i.e., to identify the geospatial representations of toponyms. This paper focuses on toponym disambiguation, which is usually approached by toponym resolution and entity linking. Recently, many novel approaches have been proposed, especially deep learning-based approaches, such as CamCoder, GENRE, and BLINK. In this paper, a spatial clustering-based voting approach that combines several individual approaches is proposed to improve SOTA performance in terms of robustness and generalizability. Experiments are conducted to compare a voting ensemble with 20 latest and commonly-used approaches based on 12 public datasets, including several highly ambiguous and challenging datasets (e.g., WikToR and CLDW). The datasets are of six types: tweets, historical documents, news, web pages, scientific articles, and Wikipedia articles, containing in total 98,300 places across the world. The results show that the voting ensemble performs the best on all the datasets, achieving an average Accuracy@161km of 0.86, proving the generalizability and robustness of the voting approach. Also, the voting ensemble drastically improves the performance of resolving fine-grained places, i.e., POIs, natural features, and traffic ways. ",

Due to the supervised learning schemes employed, most of these methods depend on large-scale, diverse, and labeled training data. The acquisition and preparation of such training image datasets are often laborious and costly, also leading to biased estimation and limited generalization to new types of samples. Here, we report a self-supervised learning model, termed GedankenNet, that eliminates the need for labeled or experimental training data, and demonstrate its effectiveness and superior generalization on hologram reconstruction tasks. Without prior knowledge about the sample types to be imaged, the self-supervised learning model was trained using a physics-consistency loss and artificial random images that are synthetically generated without any experiments or resemblance to real-world samples. After its self-supervised training, GedankenNet successfully generalized to experimental holograms of various unseen biological samples, reconstructing the phase and amplitude images of different types of objects using experimentally acquired test holograms. Without access to experimental data or the knowledge of real samples of interest or their spatial features, GedankenNet's self-supervised learning achieved complex-valued image reconstructions that are consistent with the Maxwell's equations, meaning that its output inference and object solutions accurately represent the wave propagation in free-space. This self-supervised learning of image reconstruction tasks opens up new opportunities for various inverse problems in holography, microscopy and computational imaging fields. ",

We use finite differences schemes in a uniform Cartesian grid in the spatially two-dimensional setting to solve the two systems, where the parabolic equation is solved by a semi-implicit scheme in time. Since the conductivity vector and tensor appear also in the Poisson equation for the pressure $p$, the elliptic equation depends implicitly on time.

    "abstract": "Early exiting is an effective paradigm for improving the inference efficiency of deep networks. By constructing classifiers with varying resource demands (the exits), such networks allow easy samples to be output at early exits, removing the need for executing deeper layers. While existing works mainly focus on the architectural design of multi-exit networks, the training strategies for such models are largely left unexplored. The current state-of-the-art models treat all samples the same during training. However, the early-exiting behavior during testing has been ignored, leading to a gap between training and testing. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by sample weighting. Intuitively, easy samples, which generally exit early in the network during inference, should contribute more to training early classifiers. The training of hard samples (mostly exit from deeper layers), however, should be emphasized by the late classifiers. Our work proposes to adopt a weight prediction network to weight the loss of different training samples at each exit. This weight prediction network and the backbone model are jointly optimized under a meta-learning framework with a novel optimization objective. By bringing the adaptive behavior during inference into the training phase, we show that the proposed weighting mechanism consistently improves the trade-off between classification accuracy and inference efficiency.

Our approach accounts for temporal-topological patterns that unfold in the causal topology of dynamic graphs, which is determined by causal walks, i.e. temporally ordered sequences of links by which nodes can influence each other over time. Our architecture builds on multiple layers of higher-order De Bruijn graphs, an iterative line graph construction where nodes in a De Bruijn graph of order k represent walks of length k-1, while edges represent walks of length k. We develop a graph neural network architecture that utilizes De Bruijn graphs to implement a message passing scheme that follows a non-Markovian dynamics, which enables us to learn patterns in the causal topology of a dynamic graph. Addressing the issue that De Bruijn graphs with different orders k can be used to model the same data set, we further apply statistical model selection to determine the optimal graph topology to be used for message passing. An evaluation in synthetic and empirical data sets suggests that DBGNNs can leverage temporal patterns in dynamic graphs, which substantially improves the performance in a supervised node classification task.

Despite plausible results of deep learning methods, most existing approaches are only frame-based and may fail to reach reasonable performance when dealing with dynamic traffic participants. Recent advances in sensor technologies, especially the Event camera, can naturally complement the conventional camera approach to better model moving objects. However, event-based works often adopt a pre-defined time window for event representation, and simply integrate it to estimate image intensities from events, neglecting much of the rich temporal information from the available asynchronous events. Therefore, from a new perspective, we propose RENet, a novel RGB-Event fusion Network, that jointly exploits the two complementary modalities to achieve more robust MOD under challenging scenarios for autonomous driving. Specifically, we first design a temporal multi-scale aggregation module to fully leverage event frames from both the RGB exposure time and larger intervals. Then we introduce a bi-directional fusion module to attentively calibrate and fuse multi-modal features. To evaluate the performance of our network, we carefully select and annotate a sub-MOD dataset from the commonly used DSEC dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art RGB-Event fusion alternatives. ",

    "abstract": "Benefiting from the vigorous development of deep learning, many CNN-based image super-resolution methods have emerged and achieved better results than traditional algorithms. However, it is difficult for most algorithms to adaptively adjust the spatial region and channel features at the same time, let alone the information exchange between them. In addition, the exchange of information between attention modules is even less visible to researchers. To solve these problems, we put forward a lightweight spatial-channel adaptive coordination of multilevel refinement enhancement networks(MREN). Specifically, we construct a space-channel adaptive coordination block, which enables the network to learn the spatial region and channel feature information of interest under different receptive fields. In addition, the information of the corresponding feature processing level between the spatial part and the channel part is exchanged with the help of jump connection to achieve the coordination between the two. We establish a communication bridge between attention modules through a simple linear combination operation, so as to more accurately and continuously guide the network to pay attention to the information of interest. Extensive experiments on several standard test sets have shown that our MREN achieves superior performance over other advanced algorithms with a very small number of parameters and very low computational complexity.

    "abstract": "During software development, developers need answers to queries about semantic aspects of code. Even though extractive question-answering using neural approaches has been studied widely in natural languages, the problem of answering semantic queries over code using neural networks has not yet been explored. This is mainly because there is no existing dataset with extractive question and answer pairs over code involving complex concepts and long chains of reasoning. We bridge this gap by building a new, curated dataset called CodeQueries, and proposing a neural question-answering methodology over code. We build upon state-of-the-art pre-trained models of code to predict answer and supporting-fact spans. Given a query and code, only some of the code may be relevant to answer the query. We first experiment under an ideal setting where only the relevant code is given to the model and show that our models do well. We then experiment under three pragmatic considerations: (1) scaling to large-size code, (2) learning from a limited number of examples and (3) robustness to minor syntax errors in code. Our results show that while a neural model can be resilient to minor syntax errors in code, increasing size of code, presence of code that is not relevant to the query, and reduced number of training examples limit the model performance. We are releasing our data and models to facilitate future work on the proposed problem of answering semantic queries over code. ",

Ship landing is a challenging task due to the small landing space, six degrees of freedom ship deck motion, limited visual references for localization, and adversarial environmental conditions such as wind gusts. We first develop a computer vision algorithm which estimates the relative position of the UAV with respect to a horizon reference bar on the landing platform using the image stream from a monocular vision camera on the UAV. Our approach is motivated by the actual ship landing procedure followed by the Navy helicopter pilots in tracking the horizon reference bar as a visual cue. We then develop a robust reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for controlling the UAV towards the landing platform even in the presence of adversarial environmental conditions such as wind gusts. We demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared to a benchmark nonlinear PID control approach, both in the simulation experiments using the Gazebo environment and in the real-world setting using a Parrot ANAFI quad-rotor and sub-scale ship platform undergoing 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) deck motion.

The proposed Causality-DeepONet considers causality (the state of the system at the current time is not affected by that of the future, but only by its current state and past history) and uses a convolution-type weight in its design. To demonstrate its effectiveness in handling the causal response of a physical system, the Causality-DeepONet is applied to learn the operator representing the response of a building due to earthquake ground accelerations. Extensive numerical tests and comparisons with some existing variants of DeepONet are carried out, and the Causality-DeepONet clearly shows its unique capability to learn the retarded dynamic responses of the seismic response operator with good accuracy.

The approximation problem seeks accurate approximations with a minimal number of weights. In most of the current literature these weights are fully or partially hand-crafted, showing the capabilities of neural networks but not necessarily their practical performance. In contrast, optimization theory for neural networks heavily relies on an abundance of weights in over-parametrized regimes. This paper balances these two demands and provides an approximation result for shallow networks in $1d$ with non-convex weight optimization by gradient descent. We consider finite width networks and infinite sample limits, which is the typical setup in approximation theory. Technically, this problem is not over-parametrized, however, some form of redundancy reappears as a loss in approximation rate compared to best possible rates. ",

    "abstract": "In multi-robot applications, inference over large state spaces can often be divided into smaller overlapping sub-problems that can then be collaboratively solved in parallel over `separate' subsets of states. To this end, the factor graph decentralized data fusion (FG-DDF) framework was developed to analyze and exploit conditional independence in heterogeneous Bayesian decentralized fusion problems, in which robots update and fuse pdfs over different locally overlapping random states. This allows robots to efficiently use smaller probabilistic models and sparse message passing to accurately and scalably fuse relevant local parts of a larger global joint state pdf, while accounting for data dependencies between robots. Whereas prior work required limiting assumptions about network connectivity and model linearity, this paper relaxes these to empirically explore the applicability and robustness of FG-DDF in more general settings. We develop a new heterogeneous fusion rule which generalizes the homogeneous covariance intersection algorithm, and test it in multi-robot tracking and localization scenarios with non-linear motion/observation models under communication dropout. Simulation and linear hardware experiments show that, in practice, the FG-DDF continues to provide consistent filtered estimates under these more practical operating conditions, while reducing computation and communication costs by more than 95%, thus enabling the design of scalable real-world multi-robot systems.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we tackle the problem of active robotic 3D reconstruction of an object. In particular, we study how a mobile robot with an arm-held camera can select a favorable number of views to recover an object's 3D shape efficiently. Contrary to the existing solution to this problem, we leverage the popular neural radiance fields-based object representation, which has recently shown impressive results for various computer vision tasks. However, it is not straightforward to directly reason about an object's explicit 3D geometric details using such a representation, making the next-best-view selection problem for dense 3D reconstruction challenging. This paper introduces a ray-based volumetric uncertainty estimator, which computes the entropy of the weight distribution of the color samples along each ray of the object's implicit neural representation. We show that it is possible to infer the uncertainty of the underlying 3D geometry given a novel view with the proposed estimator. We then present a next-best-view selection policy guided by the ray-based volumetric uncertainty in neural radiance fields-based representations. Encouraging experimental results on synthetic and real-world data suggest that the approach presented in this paper can enable a new research direction of using an implicit 3D object representation for the next-best-view problem in robot vision applications, distinguishing our approach from the existing approaches that rely on explicit 3D geometric modeling.

For example, adversaries may aim to deceive spam filters and recommendation systems trained with personalized federated learning for monetary gain. The adversarial clients have varying degrees of personalization based on the method of distributed learning, leading to a \"grey-box\" situation. We are the first to characterize the transferability of such internal evasion attacks for different learning methods and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and robustness depending on the degree of personalization and similarities in client data. We introduce a defense mechanism, pFedDef, that performs personalized federated adversarial training while respecting resource limitations at clients that inhibit adversarial training. Overall, pFedDef increases relative grey-box adversarial robustness by 62% compared to federated adversarial training and performs well even under limited system resources. ",

In this paper, we developed Spatial-Temporal Deep Embedding (STDE) model that imposes parity constraints at both pixel and instance levels to generate instance-aware embeddings for vehicle stripe segmentation on STMap. At pixel level, each pixel was encoded with its 8-neighbor pixels at different ranges, and this encoding is subsequently used to guide a neural network to learn the embedding mechanism. At the instance level, a discriminative loss function is designed to pull pixels belonging to the same instance closer and separate the mean value of different instances far apart in the embedding space. The output of the spatial-temporal affinity is then optimized by the mutex-watershed algorithm to obtain final clustering results. Based on segmentation metrics, our model outperformed five other baselines that have been used for STMap processing and shows robustness under the influence of shadows, static noises, and overlapping. The designed model is applied to process all public NGSIM US-101 videos to generate complete vehicle trajectories, indicating a good scalability and adaptability.

This method has shown superior performance on a hand pose estimation task in computer vision, but it remained unclear whether this method works as nicely for regression on tabular data, and how it competes with more recent advanced UQ methods such as NGBoost. In this paper, we propose an improved neural architecture of DISCO Nets that admits a more stable and smooth training. We benchmark this approach on miscellaneous real-world tabular datasets and confirm that it is competitive with or even superior to standard UQ baselines. We also provide a new elementary proof for the validity of using the energy score to learn predictive distributions. Further, we point out that DISCO Nets in its original form ignore epistemic uncertainty and only capture aleatoric uncertainty. We propose a simple fix to this problem. ",

While new technologies, such as image segmentation, have been paramount to improved detection and earlier diagnoses, there are still significant challenges in treating the disease. In particular, despite an increased number of curative resections, many postoperative patients still develop recurrent lesions. Consequently, there is a significant need for prognostic tools that can more accurately predict a patient's risk for recurrence. In this paper, we explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the segmentation and recurrence risk prediction of lung tumors that are present in preoperative computed tomography (CT) images. First, expanding upon recent progress in medical image segmentation, a residual U-Net is used to localize and characterize each nodule. Then, the identified tumors are passed to a second CNN for recurrence risk prediction. The system's final results are produced with a random forest classifier that synthesizes the predictions of the second network with clinical attributes. The segmentation stage uses the LIDC-IDRI dataset and achieves a dice score of 70.3%. The recurrence risk stage uses the NLST dataset from the National Cancer institute and achieves an AUC of 73.0%. Our proposed framework demonstrates that first, automated nodule segmentation methods can generalize to enable pipelines for a wide range of multitask systems and second, that deep learning and image processing have the potential to improve current prognostic tools. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first fully automated segmentation and recurrence risk prediction system. ",

Together, we term the two stages as introspective learning. We use gradients of trained neural networks as a measurement of this reflection. A simple three-layered Multi Layer Perceptron is used as the second stage that predicts based on all extracted gradient features. We perceptually visualize the post-hoc explanations from both stages to provide a visual grounding to introspection. For the application of recognition, we show that an introspective network is 4% more robust and 42% less prone to calibration errors when generalizing to noisy data. We also illustrate the value of introspective networks in downstream tasks that require generalizability and calibration including active learning, out-of-distribution detection, and uncertainty estimation.

It aims to infer the next interacted item of given user based on history item sequence. Some recent works tend to improve the sequential recommendation via randomly masking on the history item so as to generate self-supervised signals. But such approach will indeed result in sparser item sequence and unreliable signals. Besides, the existing sequential recommendation is only user-centric, i.e., based on the historical items by chronological order to predict the probability of candidate items, which ignores whether the items from a provider can be successfully recommended. The such user-centric recommendation will make it impossible for the provider to expose their new items and result in popular bias. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Contrastive Network (DCN) to generate ground-truth self-supervised signals for sequential recommendation by auxiliary user-sequence from item-centric perspective. Specifically, we propose dual representation contrastive learning to refine the representation learning by minimizing the euclidean distance between the representations of given user/item and history items/users of them. Before the second contrastive learning module, we perform next user prediction to to capture the trends of items preferred by certain types of users and provide personalized exploration opportunities for item providers. Finally, we further propose dual interest contrastive learning to self-supervise the dynamic interest from next item/user prediction and static interest of matching probability. Experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further ablation study also illustrates the boosting effect of the proposed components upon different sequential models. ",

    "abstract": "Despite recent studies on understanding deep neural networks (DNNs), there exists numerous questions on how DNNs generate their predictions. Especially, given similar predictions on different input samples, are the underlying mechanisms generating those predictions the same? In this work, we propose NeuCEPT, a method to locally discover critical neurons that play a major role in the model's predictions and identify model's mechanisms in generating those predictions. We first formulate a critical neurons identification problem as maximizing a sequence of mutual-information objectives and provide a theoretical framework to efficiently solve for critical neurons while keeping the precision under control. NeuCEPT next heuristically learns different model's mechanisms in an unsupervised manner. Our experimental results show that neurons identified by NeuCEPT not only have strong influence on the model's predictions but also hold meaningful information about model's mechanisms. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for synthesizing bipedal robotic walking that adapts to unknown environment and dynamics error via a data-driven step-to-step (S2S) dynamics model. We begin by synthesizing an S2S controller that stabilizes the walking using foot placement through nominal S2S dynamics from the hybrid linear inverted pendulum (H-LIP) model. Next, a data-driven representation of the S2S dynamics of the robot is learned online via classical adaptive control methods. The desired discrete foot placement on the robot is thereby realized by proper continuous output synthesis capturing the data-driven S2S controller coupled with a low-level tracking controller. The proposed approach is implemented in simulation on an underactuated 3D bipedal robot, Cassie, and improved reference velocity tracking is demonstrated. The proposed approach is also able to realize walking behavior that is robustly adaptive to unknown loads, inaccurate robot models, external disturbance forces, biased velocity estimation, and unknown slopes.

    "abstract": "Obstacle detection is a safety-critical problem in robot navigation, where stereo matching is a popular vision-based approach. While deep neural networks have shown impressive results in computer vision, most of the previous obstacle detection works only leverage traditional stereo matching techniques to meet the computational constraints for real-time feedback. This paper proposes a computationally efficient method that leverages a deep neural network to detect occupancy from stereo images directly. Instead of learning the point cloud correspondence from the stereo data, our approach extracts the compact obstacle distribution based on volumetric representations. In addition, we prune the computation of safety irrelevant spaces in a coarse-to-fine manner based on octrees generated by the decoder. As a result, we achieve real-time performance on the onboard computer (NVIDIA Jetson TX2). Our approach detects obstacles accurately in the range of 32 meters and achieves better IoU (Intersection over Union) and CD (Chamfer Distance) scores with only 2% of the computation cost of the state-of-the-art stereo model. Furthermore, we validate our method's robustness and real-world feasibility through autonomous navigation experiments with a real robot. Hence, our work contributes toward closing the gap between the stereo-based system in robot perception and state-of-the-art stereo models in computer vision. To counter the scarcity of high-quality real-world indoor stereo datasets, we collect a 1.36 hours stereo dataset with a Jackal robot which is used to fine-tune our model.

    "title": "Active Defense Analysis of Blockchain Forking through the  Spatial-Temporal Lens",
    "abstract": "Forking breaches the security and performance of blockchain as it is symptomatic of distributed consensus, spurring wide interest in analyzing and resolving it. The state-of-the-art works can be categorized into two kinds: experiment-based and model-based. However, the former falls short in exclusiveness since the derived observations are scenario-specific. Hence, it is problematic to abstractly reveal the crystal-clear forking laws. Besides, the models established in the latter are spatiality-free, which totally overlook the fact that forking is essentially an undesirable result under a given topology. Moreover, few of the ongoing studies have yielded to the active defense mechanisms but only recognized forking passively, which impedes forking prevention and cannot deter it at the source. In this paper, we fill the gap by carrying out the active defense analysis of blockchain forking from the spatial-temporal dimension. Our work is featured by the following two traits: 1) dual dimensions. We consider the spatiality of blockchain overlay network besides temporal characteristics, based on which, a spatial-temporal model for information propagation in blockchain is proposed; 2) active defense. We hint that shrinking the long-range link factor, which indicates the remote connection ability of a link, can cut down forking completely fundamentally. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to inspect forking from the spatial-temporal perspective, so as to present countermeasures proactively. Solid theoretical derivations and extensive simulations are conducted to justify the validity and effectiveness of our analysis. ",

Its enormous scale, high dimensionality, and inherent uncertainty make almost every aspect of machine learning difficult, from providing enough processing power to maintaining model accuracy to protecting privacy. However, perhaps the most imposing problem is that big data is often interspersed with sensitive personal data. Hence, we propose a privacy-preserving hierarchical fuzzy neural network (PP-HFNN) to address these technical challenges while also alleviating privacy concerns. The network is trained with a two-stage optimization algorithm, and the parameters at low levels of the hierarchy are learned with a scheme based on the well-known alternating direction method of multipliers, which does not reveal local data to other agents. Coordination at high levels of the hierarchy is handled by the alternating optimization method, which converges very quickly. The entire training procedure is scalable, fast and does not suffer from gradient vanishing problems like the methods based on back-propagation. Comprehensive simulations conducted on both regression and classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. ",

    "abstract": "We have recently seen tremendous progress in the neural advances for photo-real human modeling and rendering. However, it's still challenging to integrate them into an existing mesh-based pipeline for downstream applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive neural approach for high-quality reconstruction, compression, and rendering of human performances from dense multi-view videos. Our core intuition is to bridge the traditional animated mesh workflow with a new class of highly efficient neural techniques. We first introduce a neural surface reconstructor for high-quality surface generation in minutes. It marries the implicit volumetric rendering of the truncated signed distance field (TSDF) with multi-resolution hash encoding. We further propose a hybrid neural tracker to generate animated meshes, which combines explicit non-rigid tracking with implicit dynamic deformation in a self-supervised framework. The former provides the coarse warping back into the canonical space, while the latter implicit one further predicts the displacements using the 4D hash encoding as in our reconstructor. Then, we discuss the rendering schemes using the obtained animated meshes, ranging from dynamic texturing to lumigraph rendering under various bandwidth settings. To strike an intricate balance between quality and bandwidth, we propose a hierarchical solution by first rendering 6 virtual views covering the performer and then conducting occlusion-aware neural texture blending. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a variety of mesh-based applications and photo-realistic free-view experiences on various platforms, i.e., inserting virtual human performances into real environments through mobile AR or immersively watching talent shows with VR headsets.

However, most existing methods treat each part equally and neglect the data redundancy due to the high sampling rate of gait sequences. In this work, we propose a fine-grained motion representation network (GaitFM) to improve gait recognition performance in three aspects. First, a fine-grained part sequence learning (FPSL) module is designed to explore part-independent spatio-temporal representations. Secondly, a frame-wise compression strategy, called local motion aggregation (LMA), is used to enhance motion variations. Finally, a weighted generalized mean pooling (WGeM) layer works to adaptively keep more discriminative information in the spatial downsampling. Experiments on two public datasets, CASIA-B and OUMVLP, show that our approach reaches state-of-the-art performances. On the CASIA-B dataset, our method achieves rank-1 accuracies of 98.0%, 95.7% and 87.9% for normal walking, walking with a bag and walking with a coat, respectively.

    "abstract": "Despite the numerous applications and success of deep reinforcement learning in many control tasks, it still suffers from many crucial problems and limitations, including temporal credit assignment with sparse reward, absence of effective exploration, and a brittle convergence that is extremely sensitive to the hyperparameters of the problem. The problems of deep reinforcement learning in continuous control, along with the success of evolutionary algorithms in facing some of these problems, have emerged the idea of evolutionary reinforcement learning, which attracted many controversies. Despite successful results in a few studies in this field, a proper and fitting solution to these problems and their limitations is yet to be presented. The present study aims to study the efficiency of combining the two fields of deep reinforcement learning and evolutionary computations further and take a step towards improving methods and the existing challenges. The \"Evolutionary Deep Reinforcement Learning Using Elite Buffer\" algorithm introduced a novel mechanism through inspiration from interactive learning capability and hypothetical outcomes in the human brain. In this method, the utilization of the elite buffer (which is inspired by learning based on experience generalization in the human mind), along with the existence of crossover and mutation operators, and interactive learning in successive generations, have improved efficiency, convergence, and proper advancement in the field of continuous control. According to the results of experiments, the proposed method surpasses other well-known methods in environments with high complexity and dimension and is superior in resolving the mentioned problems and limitations.

To evaluate the potential performance of RIS-TW-NOMA, we derive the exact and asymptotic expressions of outage probability and ergodic rate for a pair of users.

Additionally, we analyze the system throughput and energy efficiency of RIS-TW-NOMA networks in both delay-limited and delay-tolerant transmission modes. Numerical results indicate that: 1) The outage behaviors and ergodic rate of RIS-TW-NOMA are superior to that of RIS-TW-OMA and two-way relay OMA (TWR-OMA); 2) As the number of RIS elements increases, the RIS-TW-NOMA networks are capable of achieving the enhanced outage performance; and 3) By comparing with RIS-TW-OMA and TWR-OMA networks, the energy efficiency and system throughput of RIS-TW-NOMA has obvious advantages.

Therefore, a new loss function FD-Loss is reconstructed based on the traditional algorithm-level approach to the imbalance problem.

Then, the weight coefficients are defined based on the mismeasurement distance and used in the loss function weighting term, so that the loss function focuses only on valuable samples. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our loss function can effectively solve the sample node imbalance problem and improve the classification accuracy by 4% compared to existing methods in the node classification task.

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, the robotics community witnessed the emergence of various motion representations that have been used extensively, particularly in behavorial cloning, to compactly encode and generalize skills. Among these, probabilistic approaches have earned a relevant place, owing to their encoding of variations, correlations and adaptability to new task conditions. Modulating such primitives, however, is often cumbersome due to the need for parameter re-optimization which frequently entails computationally costly operations. In this paper we derive a non-parametric movement primitive formulation that contains a null space projector. We show that such formulation allows for fast and efficient motion generation with computational complexity O(n2) without involving matrix inversions, whose complexity is O(n3). This is achieved by using the null space to track secondary targets, with a precision determined by the training dataset. Using a 2D example associated with time input we show that our non-parametric solution compares favourably with a state-of-the-art parametric approach. For demonstrated skills with high-dimensional inputs we show that it permits on-the-fly adaptation as well. ",

We extensively validate the proposed framework, named DEGNC-LAF (DEcoupled Graduated Non-Convexity with Linear Angle Formulation) in planar PGO benchmarks.

Lately, coresets (provable data summarizations) were leveraged for pruning DNNs, adding the advantage of theoretical guarantees on the trade-off between the compression rate and the approximation error. However, coresets in this domain were either data-dependent or generated under restrictive assumptions on both the model's weights and inputs. In real-world scenarios, such assumptions are rarely satisfied, limiting the applicability of coresets. To this end, we suggest a novel and robust framework for computing such coresets under mild assumptions on the model's weights and without any assumption on the training data. The idea is to compute the importance of each neuron in each layer with respect to the output of the following layer. This is achieved by a combination of L\\\"{o}wner ellipsoid and Caratheodory theorem. Our method is simultaneously data-independent, applicable to various networks and datasets (due to the simplified assumptions), and theoretically supported. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing coreset based neural pruning approaches across a wide range of networks and datasets.

Due to the high number of LEO satellites in a typical constellation, a centralized algorithm for minimum-delay packet routing would incur significant signaling and computational overhead. We can exploit the deterministic topology of the satellite constellation to calculate the minimum-delay path between any two nodes in the satellite network. But that does not take into account the traffic information at the nodes along this minimum-delay path. We propose a distributed probabilistic congestion control scheme to minimize end-to-end delay. In the proposed scheme, each satellite, while sending a packet to its neighbor, adds a header with a simple metric indicating its own congestion level. The decision to route packets is taken based on the latest traffic information received from the neighbors. We build this algorithm onto the Datagram Routing Algorithm (DRA), which provides the minimum delay path, and the decision for the next hop is taken by the congestion control algorithm. We compare the proposed congestion control mechanism with the existing congestion control used by the DRA via simulations, and show improvements over the same. ",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) frameworks for autonomous navigation rely on robust data association to identify loop closures for back-end trajectory optimization. In the case of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with multibeam echosounders (MBES), data association is particularly challenging due to the scarcity of identifiable landmarks in the seabed, the large drift in dead-reckoning navigation estimates to which AUVs are prone and the low resolution characteristic of MBES data. Deep learning solutions to loop closure detection have shown excellent performance on data from more structured environments. However, their transfer to the seabed domain is not immediate and efforts to port them are hindered by the lack of bathymetric datasets. Thus, in this paper we propose a neural network architecture aimed to showcase the potential of adapting such techniques to correspondence matching in bathymetric data. We train our framework on real bathymetry from an AUV mission and evaluate its performance on the tasks of loop closure detection and coarse point cloud alignment. Finally, we show its potential against a more traditional method and release both its implementation and the dataset used. ",

    "abstract": "Reaching a consensus in a swarm of robots is one of the fundamental problems in swarm robotics, examining the possibility of reaching an agreement within the swarm members. The recently-introduced contamination problem offers a new perspective of the problem, in which swarm members should reach a consensus in spite of the existence of adversarial members that intentionally act to divert the swarm members towards a different consensus. In this paper, we search for a consensus-reaching algorithm under the contamination problem setting by taking a top-down approach: We transform the problem to a centralized two-player game in which each player controls the behavior of a subset of the swarm, trying to force the entire swarm to converge to an agreement on its own value. We define a performance metric for each players performance, proving a correlation between this metric and the chances of the player to win the game. We then present the globally optimal solution to the game and prove that unfortunately it is unattainable in a distributed setting, due to the challenging characteristics of the swarm members. We therefore examine the problem on a simplified swarm model, and compare the performance of the globally optimal strategy with locally optimal strategies, demonstrating its superiority in rigorous simulation experiments.

    "abstract": "Experienced users often have useful knowledge and intuition in solving real-world optimization problems. User knowledge can be formulated as inter-variable relationships to assist an optimization algorithm in finding good solutions faster. Such inter-variable interactions can also be automatically learned from high-performing solutions discovered at intermediate iterations in an optimization run - a process called innovization. These relations, if vetted by the users, can be enforced among newly generated solutions to steer the optimization algorithm towards practically promising regions in the search space. Challenges arise for large-scale problems where the number of such variable relationships may be high. This paper proposes an interactive knowledge-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization (IK-EMO) framework that extracts hidden variable-wise relationships as knowledge from evolving high-performing solutions, shares them with users to receive feedback, and applies them back to the optimization process to improve its effectiveness. The knowledge extraction process uses a systematic and elegant graph analysis method which scales well with number of variables. The working of the proposed IK-EMO is demonstrated on three large-scale real-world engineering design problems. The simplicity and elegance of the proposed knowledge extraction process and achievement of high-performing solutions quickly indicate the power of the proposed framework. The results presented should motivate further such interaction-based optimization studies for their routine use in practice. ",

Towards answering such questions, we propose the first approach to explain MI attacks and their connection to generalization based on principled causal reasoning. We offer causal graphs that quantitatively explain the observed MI attack performance achieved for $6$ attack variants. We refute several prior non-quantitative hypotheses that over-simplify or over-estimate the influence of underlying causes, thereby failing to capture the complex interplay between several factors. Our causal models also show a new connection between generalization and MI attacks via their shared causal factors. Our causal models have high predictive power ($0.90$), i.e., their analytical predictions match with observations in unseen experiments often, which makes analysis via them a pragmatic alternative.

    "abstract": "Processing-in-memory (PIM), an increasingly studied neuromorphic hardware, promises orders of energy and throughput improvements for deep learning inference. Leveraging the massively parallel and efficient analog computing inside memories, PIM circumvents the bottlenecks of data movements in conventional digital hardware. However, an extra quantization step (i.e. PIM quantization), typically with limited resolution due to hardware constraints, is required to convert the analog computing results into digital domain. Meanwhile, non-ideal effects extensively exist in PIM quantization because of the imperfect analog-to-digital interface, which further compromises the inference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a method for training quantized networks to incorporate PIM quantization, which is ubiquitous to all PIM systems. Specifically, we propose a PIM quantization aware training (PIM-QAT) algorithm, and introduce rescaling techniques during backward and forward propagation by analyzing the training dynamics to facilitate training convergence. We also propose two techniques, namely batch normalization (BN) calibration and adjusted precision training, to suppress the adverse effects of non-ideal linearity and stochastic thermal noise involved in real PIM chips. Our method is validated on three mainstream PIM decomposition schemes, and physically on a prototype chip. Comparing with directly deploying conventionally trained quantized model on PIM systems, which does not take into account this extra quantization step and thus fails, our method provides significant improvement. It also achieves comparable inference accuracy on PIM systems as that of conventionally quantized models on digital hardware, across CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets using various network depths for the most popular network topology.

The recent popularity of SSL has led to the development of several models that make use of diverse training strategies, architectures, and data augmentation policies with no existing unified framework to study or assess their effectiveness in transfer learning. We propose a data-driven geometric strategy to analyze different SSL models using local neighborhoods in the feature space induced by each. Unlike existing approaches that consider mathematical approximations of the parameters, individual components, or optimization landscape, our work aims to explore the geometric properties of the representation manifolds learned by SSL models. Our proposed manifold graph metrics (MGMs) provide insights into the geometric similarities and differences between available SSL models, their invariances with respect to specific augmentations, and their performances on transfer learning tasks. Our key findings are two fold: (i) contrary to popular belief, the geometry of SSL models is not tied to its training paradigm (contrastive, non-contrastive, and cluster-based); (ii) we can predict the transfer learning capability for a specific model based on the geometric properties of its semantic and augmentation manifolds.

Thus, to resolve this problem, inspired by CycleGAN, we construct a training paradigm called \\textbf{RVSL} which integrates ReID and domain transformation techniques. The network is trained on semi-supervised fashion and does not require to employ the ID labels and the corresponding clear ground truths to learn hazy vehicle ReID mission in the real-world haze scenes. To further constrain the unsupervised learning process effectively, several losses are developed. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on hazy vehicle ReID problems.

    "abstract": "Off-policy Evaluation (OPE) methods are crucial tools for evaluating policies in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where direct deployment is often infeasible, unethical, or expensive. When deployment environments are expected to undergo changes (that is, dataset shifts), it is important for OPE methods to perform robust evaluation of the policies amidst such changes. Existing approaches consider robustness against a large class of shifts that can arbitrarily change any observable property of the environment. This often results in highly pessimistic estimates of the utilities, thereby invalidating policies that might have been useful in deployment. In this work, we address the aforementioned problem by investigating how domain knowledge can help provide more realistic estimates of the utilities of policies. We leverage human inputs on which aspects of the environments may plausibly change, and adapt the OPE methods to only consider shifts on these aspects. Specifically, we propose a novel framework, Robust OPE (ROPE), which considers shifts on a subset of covariates in the data based on user inputs, and estimates worst-case utility under these shifts. We then develop computationally efficient algorithms for OPE that are robust to the aforementioned shifts for contextual bandits and Markov decision processes. We also theoretically analyze the sample complexity of these algorithms. Extensive experimentation with synthetic and real world datasets from the healthcare domain demonstrates that our approach not only captures realistic dataset shifts accurately, but also results in less pessimistic policy evaluations.

GLARE contains 2,157 images of traffic signs with sun glare, pulled from 33 videos of dashcam footage of roads in the United States. It provides an essential enrichment to the widely used LISA Traffic Sign dataset. Our experimental study shows that although several state-of-the-art baseline methods demonstrate superior performance when trained and tested against traffic sign datasets without sun glare, they greatly suffer when tested against GLARE (e.g., ranging from 9% to 21% mean mAP, which is significantly lower than the performances on LISA dataset).

This modular approach creates a highly scalable system. However, it comes with a high-performance cost where a lack of global regularization at deployment time leads to hyperactive neurons that erroneously respond to places outside their learned region. Our second contribution introduces a regularization approach that detects and removes these problematic hyperactive neurons during the initial environmental learning phase. We evaluate this new scalable modular system on benchmark localization datasets Nordland and Oxford RobotCar, with comparisons to both standard techniques NetVLAD and SAD, and a previous spiking neural network system.

In addition, AEs have adversarial transferability, which means AEs generated for a source model can fool another black-box model (target model) with a non-trivial probability. In this paper, we investigate the property of adversarial transferability between models including ConvMixer, which is an isotropic network, for the first time. To objectively verify the property of transferability, the robustness of models is evaluated by using a benchmark attack method called AutoAttack.

    "abstract": "Predicting the traffic incident duration is a hard problem to solve due to the stochastic nature of incident occurrence in space and time, a lack of information at the beginning of a reported traffic disruption, and lack of advanced methods in transport engineering to derive insights from past accidents. This paper proposes a new fusion framework for predicting the incident duration from limited information by using an integration of machine learning with traffic flow/speed and incident description as features, encoded via several Deep Learning methods (ANN autoencoder and character-level LSTM-ANN sentiment classifier). The paper constructs a cross-disciplinary modelling approach in transport and data science. The approach improves the incident duration prediction accuracy over the top-performing ML models applied to baseline incident reports. Results show that our proposed method can improve the accuracy by $60\\%$ when compared to standard linear or support vector regression models, and a further $7\\%$ improvement with respect to the hybrid deep learning auto-encoded GBDT model which seems to outperform all other models. The application area is the city of San Francisco, rich in both traffic incident logs (Countrywide Traffic Accident Data set) and past historical traffic congestion information (5-minute precision measurements from Caltrans Performance Measurement System).

In this paper, we propose importance tempering to improve the decision boundary and achieve consistently better results for overparameterized models. Theoretically, we justify that the selection of group temperature can be different under label shift and spurious correlation setting. At the same time, we also prove that properly selected temperatures can extricate the minority collapse for imbalanced classification.

    "abstract": "Remarkable progress has been made in self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SS-MDE) by exploring cross-view consistency, e.g., photometric consistency and 3D point cloud consistency. However, they are very vulnerable to illumination variance, occlusions, texture-less regions, as well as moving objects, making them not robust enough to deal with various scenes. To address this challenge, we study two kinds of robust cross-view consistency in this paper. Firstly, the spatial offset field between adjacent frames is obtained by reconstructing the reference frame from its neighbors via deformable alignment, which is used to align the temporal depth features via a Depth Feature Alignment (DFA) loss. Secondly, the 3D point clouds of each reference frame and its nearby frames are calculated and transformed into voxel space, where the point density in each voxel is calculated and aligned via a Voxel Density Alignment (VDA) loss. In this way, we exploit the temporal coherence in both depth feature space and 3D voxel space for SS-MDE, shifting the \"point-to-point\" alignment paradigm to the \"region-to-region\" one. Compared with the photometric consistency loss as well as the rigid point cloud alignment loss, the proposed DFA and VDA losses are more robust owing to the strong representation power of deep features as well as the high tolerance of voxel density to the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results on several outdoor benchmarks show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques. Extensive ablation study and analysis validate the effectiveness of the proposed losses, especially in challenging scenes.

    "abstract": "Two-view knowledge graphs (KGs) jointly represent two components: an ontology view for abstract and commonsense concepts, and an instance view for specific entities that are instantiated from ontological concepts. As such, these KGs contain heterogeneous structures that are hierarchical, from the ontology-view, and cyclical, from the instance-view. Despite these various structures in KGs, most recent works on embedding KGs assume that the entire KG belongs to only one of the two views but not both simultaneously. For works that seek to put both views of the KG together, the instance and ontology views are assumed to belong to the same geometric space, such as all nodes embedded in the same Euclidean space or non-Euclidean product space, an assumption no longer reasonable for two-view KGs where different portions of the graph exhibit different structures. To address this issue, we define and construct a dual-geometric space embedding model (DGS) that models two-view KGs using a complex non-Euclidean geometric space, by embedding different portions of the KG in different geometric spaces. DGS utilizes the spherical space, hyperbolic space, and their intersecting space in a unified framework for learning embeddings. Furthermore, for the spherical space, we propose novel closed spherical space operators that directly operate in the spherical space without the need for mapping to an approximate tangent space. Experiments on public datasets show that DGS significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models on KG completion tasks, demonstrating its ability to better model heterogeneous structures in KGs.

The traditional KG embedding techniques (such as TransE and DistMult) estimate these embeddings via simple models developed over observed KG triplets. These approaches differ in their triplet scoring loss functions. As these models only use the observed triplets to estimate the embeddings, they are prone to suffer through data sparsity that usually occurs in the real-world knowledge graphs, i.e., the lack of enough triplets per entity. To settle this issue, we propose an efficient method to augment the number of triplets to address the problem of data sparsity. We use random walks to create additional triplets, such that the relations carried by these introduced triplets entail the metapath induced by the random walks. We also provide approaches to accurately and efficiently filter out informative metapaths from the possible set of metapaths, induced by the random walks. The proposed approaches are model-agnostic, and the augmented training dataset can be used with any KG embedding approach out of the box. Experimental results obtained on the benchmark datasets show the advantages of the proposed approach. ",

But, the lack of adequate annotated data and the high spatiospectral dimensions of HSIs usually make classification networks prone to overfit. Thus, learning a general representation which can be transferred to the downstream tasks is imperative. To our knowledge, no appropriate self-supervised pre-training method has been designed for histopathology HSIs. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and effective Self-supervised Spectral Regression (S$^3$R) method, which exploits the low rank characteristic in the spectral domain of HSI. More concretely, we propose to learn a set of linear coefficients that can be used to represent one band by the remaining bands via masking out these bands. Then, the band is restored by using the learned coefficients to reweight the remaining bands. Two pre-text tasks are designed: (1)S$^3$R-CR, which regresses the linear coefficients, so that the pre-trained model understands the inherent structures of HSIs and the pathological characteristics of different morphologies; (2)S$^3$R-BR, which regresses the missing band, making the model to learn the holistic semantics of HSIs. Compared to prior arts i.e., contrastive learning methods, which focuses on natural images, S$^3$R converges at least 3 times faster, and achieves significant improvements up to 14% in accuracy when transferring to HSI classification tasks.

However, most of the existing works for IPT detection show low efficiency for variable-length audio and provide no assurance in the generalization as they rely on a single sound bank for training and testing. In this study, we propose an end-to-end Guzheng playing technique detection system using Fully Convolutional Networks that can be applied to variable-length audio. Because each Guzheng playing technique is applied to a note, a dedicated onset detector is trained to divide an audio into several notes and its predictions are fused with frame-wise IPT predictions. During fusion, we add the IPT predictions frame by frame inside each note and get the IPT with the highest probability within each note as the final output of that note. We create a new dataset named GZ_IsoTech from multiple sound banks and real-world recordings for Guzheng performance analysis. Our approach achieves 87.97% in frame-level accuracy and 80.76% in note-level F1-score, outperforming existing works by a large margin, which indicates the effectiveness of our proposed method in IPT detection.

Object segmentation can enrich many downstream applications based on the learned radiance field. However, introducing hand-crafted segmentation to define regions of interest in a complex real-world scene are non-trivial and expensive as it acquires per view annotation. This paper carries out the exploration of self-supervised learning for object segmentation using NeRF for complex real-world scenes. Our framework, NeRF-SOS, couples object segmentation and neural radiance field to segment objects in any view within a scene. By proposing a novel collaborative contrastive loss in both appearance and geometry levels, NeRF-SOS encourages NeRF models to distill compact geometry-aware segmentation clusters from their density fields and the self-supervised pre-trained 2D visual features. The self-supervised object segmentation framework can be applied to various NeRF models that both lead to photo-realistic rendering results and convincing segmentations for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Extensive results on the LLFF, Tank and Temple datasets validate the effectiveness of NeRF-SOS.

Recent query embedding (QE) approaches to embed the entities and relations in a KG and the first-order logic (FOL) queries into a low dimensional space, answering queries by dense similarity search. However, previous works mainly concentrate on the target answers, ignoring intermediate entities' usefulness, which is essential for relieving the cascading error problem in logical query answering. In addition, these methods are usually designed with their own geometric or distributional embeddings to handle logical operators like union, intersection, and negation, with the sacrifice of the accuracy of the basic operator - projection, and they could not absorb other embedding methods to their models. In this work, we propose a Neural and Symbolic Entangled framework (ENeSy) for complex query answering, which enables the neural and symbolic reasoning to enhance each other to alleviate the cascading error and KG incompleteness. The projection operator in ENeSy could be any embedding method with the capability of link prediction, and the other FOL operators are handled without parameters.

More precisely, each agent is equipped with an offline consensus protocol, which is a priori designed, depending on its immediate neighbors' estimated states. Further, the estimation errors propagated over time due to inexact neighboring information are proved bounded under mild technical assumptions, based on which a robust DMPC strategy is deliberately designed to achieve robust consensus while satisfying input constraints. Moreover, it is shown that, with the suitably designed cost function and constraints, the feasibility of the associated optimization problem can be recursively ensured. We further provide the consensus convergence result of the constrained MAS in the presence of bounded varying delays.

Despite being widely used, we find that these datasets suffer from spurious correlations, which are ignored by existing studies and lead to severe overestimation of existing rumor detection performance. The spurious correlations stem from three causes: (1) event-based data collection and labeling schemes assign the same veracity label to multiple highly similar posts from the same underlying event; (2) merging multiple data sources spuriously relates source identities to veracity labels; and (3) labeling bias. In this paper, we closely investigate three of the most popular rumor detection benchmark datasets (i.e., Twitter15, Twitter16 and PHEME), and propose event-separated rumor detection as a solution to eliminate spurious cues. Under the event-separated setting, we observe that the accuracy of existing state-of-the-art models drops significantly by over 40%, becoming only comparable to a simple neural classifier. To better address this task, we propose Publisher Style Aggregation (PSA), a generalizable approach that aggregates publisher posting records to learn writing style and veracity stance.

    "title": "Rethinking Knowledge Graph Evaluation Under the Open-World Assumption",
    "abstract": "Most knowledge graphs (KGs) are incomplete, which motivates one important research topic on automatically complementing knowledge graphs. However, evaluation of knowledge graph completion (KGC) models often ignores the incompleteness -- facts in the test set are ranked against all unknown triplets which may contain a large number of missing facts not included in the KG yet. Treating all unknown triplets as false is called the closed-world assumption. This closed-world assumption might negatively affect the fairness and consistency of the evaluation metrics. In this paper, we study KGC evaluation under a more realistic setting, namely the open-world assumption, where unknown triplets are considered to include many missing facts not included in the training or test sets. For the currently most used metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and Hits@K, we point out that their behavior may be unexpected under the open-world assumption. Specifically, with not many missing facts, their numbers show a logarithmic trend with respect to the true strength of the model, and thus, the metric increase could be insignificant in terms of reflecting the true model improvement. Further, considering the variance, we show that the degradation in the reported numbers may result in incorrect comparisons between different models, where stronger models may have lower metric numbers. We validate the phenomenon both theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we suggest possible causes and solutions for this problem.

    "abstract": "The electricity industry is heavily implementing smart grid technologies to improve reliability, availability, security, and efficiency. This implementation needs technological advancements, the development of standards and regulations, as well as testing and planning. Smart grid load forecasting and management are critical for reducing demand volatility and improving the market mechanism that connects generators, distributors, and retailers. During policy implementations or external interventions, it is necessary to analyse the uncertainty of their impact on the electricity demand to enable a more accurate response of the system to fluctuating demand. This paper analyses the uncertainties of external intervention impacts on electricity demand. It implements a framework that combines probabilistic and global forecasting models using a deep learning approach to estimate the causal impact distribution of an intervention. The causal effect is assessed by predicting the counterfactual distribution outcome for the affected instances and then contrasting it to the real outcomes. We consider the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns on energy usage as a case study to evaluate the non-uniform effect of this intervention on the electricity demand distribution. We could show that during the initial lockdowns in Australia and some European countries, there was often a more significant decrease in the troughs than in the peaks, while the mean remained almost unaffected.

    "abstract": "Both real and fake news in various domains, such as politics, health, and entertainment are spread via online social media every day, necessitating fake news detection for multiple domains. Among them, fake news in specific domains like politics and health has more serious potential negative impacts on the real world (e.g., the infodemic led by COVID-19 misinformation). Previous studies focus on multi-domain fake news detection, by equally mining and modeling the correlation between domains. However, these multi-domain methods suffer from a seesaw problem: the performance of some domains is often improved at the cost of hurting the performance of other domains, which could lead to an unsatisfying performance in specific domains. To address this issue, we propose a Domain- and Instance-level Transfer Framework for Fake News Detection (DITFEND), which could improve the performance of specific target domains. To transfer coarse-grained domain-level knowledge, we train a general model with data of all domains from the meta-learning perspective. To transfer fine-grained instance-level knowledge and adapt the general model to a target domain, we train a language model on the target domain to evaluate the transferability of each data instance in source domains and re-weigh each instance's contribution. Offline experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DITFEND. Online experiments show that DITFEND brings additional improvements over the base models in a real-world scenario. ",

These methods allow the use of standard finite elements for the solution of the problem while simultaneously removing a spurious pressure influence in the approximation error of the velocity of the fluid, or the displacement of an incompressible solid.

Aggregate statistics and visualizations play an essential role as building blocks of data explorations and summary reports, the latter being increasingly released to third parties such as municipal administrations or in the context of citizen participation. However, such explorations already pose a threat to privacy as they reveal potentially sensitive location information, and thus should not be shared without further privacy measures. There is a substantial gap between state-of-the-art research on privacy methods and their utilization in practice. We thus conceptualize a standardized mobility report with differential privacy guarantees and implement it as open-source software to enable a privacy-preserving exploration of key aspects of mobility data in an easily accessible way. Moreover, we evaluate the benefits of limiting user contributions using three data sets relevant to research and practice. Our results show that even a strong limit on user contribution alters the original geospatial distribution only within a comparatively small range, while significantly reducing the error introduced by adding noise to achieve privacy guarantees.

    "abstract": "Discovering frequent trends in time series is a critical task in data mining. Recently, order-preserving matching was proposed to find all occurrences of a pattern in a time series, where the pattern is a relative order (regarded as a trend) and an occurrence is a sub-time series whose relative order coincides with the pattern. Inspired by the order-preserving matching, the existing order-preserving pattern (OPP) mining algorithm employs order-preserving matching to calculate the support, which leads to low efficiency. To address this deficiency, this paper proposes an algorithm called efficient frequent OPP miner (EFO-Miner) to find all frequent OPPs. EFO-Miner is composed of four parts: a pattern fusion strategy to generate candidate patterns, a matching process for the results of sub-patterns to calculate the support of super-patterns, a screening strategy to dynamically reduce the size of prefix and suffix arrays, and a pruning strategy to further dynamically prune candidate patterns. Moreover, this paper explores the order-preserving rule (OPR) mining and proposes an algorithm called OPR-Miner to discover strong rules from all frequent OPPs using EFO-Miner. Experimental results verify that OPR-Miner gives better performance than other competitive algorithms. More importantly, clustering and classification experiments further validate that OPR-Miner achieves good performance. ",

The processing-in-memory (PIM) paradigm, where computation is placed near or within memory arrays, is a viable solution to accelerate memory-bound NNs. However, PIM architectures vary in form, where different PIM approaches lead to different trade-offs. Our goal is to analyze, discuss, and contrast DRAM-based PIM architectures for NN performance and energy efficiency. To do so, we analyze three state-of-the-art PIM architectures: (1) UPMEM, which integrates processors and DRAM arrays into a single 2D chip; (2) Mensa, a 3D-stack-based PIM architecture tailored for edge devices; and (3) SIMDRAM, which uses the analog principles of DRAM to execute bit-serial operations. Our analysis reveals that PIM greatly benefits memory-bound NNs: (1) UPMEM provides 23x the performance of a high-end GPU when the GPU requires memory oversubscription for a general matrix-vector multiplication kernel; (2) Mensa improves energy efficiency and throughput by 3.0x and 3.1x over the Google Edge TPU for 24 Google edge NN models; and (3) SIMDRAM outperforms a CPU/GPU by 16.7x/1.4x for three binary NNs. We conclude that the ideal PIM architecture for NN models depends on a model's distinct attributes, due to the inherent architectural design choices. ",

Thanks to its powerful encoder, PAVER can learn the saliency from three simple relative relations among local patch features, outperforming state-of-the-art models for the Wild360 benchmark by large margins without supervision or auxiliary information like class activation. We demonstrate the utility of our saliency prediction model with the omnidirectional video quality assessment task in VQA-ODV, where we consistently improve performance without any form of supervision, including head movement.

    "abstract": "Background: Code summarization automatically generates the corresponding natural language descriptions according to the input code. Comprehensiveness of code representation is critical to code summarization task. However, most existing approaches typically use coarse-grained fusion methods to integrate multi-modal features. They generally represent different modalities of a piece of code, such as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and a token sequence, as two embeddings and then fuse the two ones at the AST/code levels. Such a coarse integration makes it difficult to learn the correlations between fine-grained code elements across modalities effectively. Aims: This study intends to improve the model's prediction performance for high-quality code summarization by accurately aligning and fully fusing semantic and syntactic structure information of source code at node/token levels. Method: This paper proposes a Multi-Modal Fine-grained Feature Fusion approach (MMF3) for neural code summarization. We introduce a novel fine-grained fusion method, which allows fine-grained fusion of multiple code modalities at the token and node levels. Specifically, we use this method to fuse information from both token and AST modalities and apply the fused features to code summarization. Results: We conduct experiments on one Java and one Python datasets, and evaluate generated summaries using four metrics. The results show that: 1) the performance of our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art models, and 2) the ablation experiments show that our proposed fine-grained fusion method can effectively improve the accuracy of generated summaries. Conclusion: MMF3 can mine the relationships between crossmodal elements and perform accurate fine-grained element-level alignment fusion accordingly. As a result, more clues can be provided to improve the accuracy of the generated code summaries. ",

However, designing the RIS phases according to the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) can be challenging in practice due to the short coherent time of the channel. In this regard, we propose a novel algorithm based on the channel statistics of massive multiple input multiple output systems rather than the CSI. The beamforming at the base station (BS), power allocation of the users, and phase shifts at the RIS elements are optimized to maximize the minimum signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR), guaranteeing fair operation among various users. In particular, we design the RIS phases by leveraging the asymptotic deterministic equivalent of the minimum SINR that depends only on the channel statistics. This significantly reduces the computational complexity and the amount of controlling data between the BS and RIS for updating the phases. This setup is also useful for electromagnetic fields (EMF)-aware systems with constraints on the maximum user's exposure to EMF. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithms achieve more than 100% gain in terms of minimum SINR, compared to a system with random RIS phase shifts, with 40 RIS elements, 20 antennas at the BS and 10 users, respectively.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised models are increasingly prevalent in machine learning (ML) since they reduce the need for expensively labeled data. Because of their versatility in downstream applications, they are increasingly used as a service exposed via public APIs. At the same time, these encoder models are particularly vulnerable to model stealing attacks due to the high dimensionality of vector representations they output. Yet, encoders remain undefended: existing mitigation strategies for stealing attacks focus on supervised learning. We introduce a new dataset inference defense, which uses the private training set of the victim encoder model to attribute its ownership in the event of stealing. The intuition is that the log-likelihood of an encoder's output representations is higher on the victim's training data than on test data if it is stolen from the victim, but not if it is independently trained. We compute this log-likelihood using density estimation models. As part of our evaluation, we also propose measuring the fidelity of stolen encoders and quantifying the effectiveness of the theft detection without involving downstream tasks; instead, we leverage mutual information and distance measurements. Our extensive empirical results in the vision domain demonstrate that dataset inference is a promising direction for defending self-supervised models against model stealing. ",

    "abstract": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a state-of-the-art (SOTA) control technique which requires solving hard constrained optimization problems iteratively. For uncertain dynamics, analytical model based robust MPC imposes additional constraints, increasing the hardness of the problem. The problem exacerbates in performance-critical applications, when more compute is required in lesser time. Data-driven regression methods such as Neural Networks have been proposed in the past to approximate system dynamics. However, such models rely on high volumes of labeled data, in the absence of symbolic analytical priors. This incurs non-trivial training overheads. Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained traction for approximating non-linear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), with reasonable accuracy. In this work, we propose a Robust Adaptive MPC framework via PINNs (RAMP-Net), which uses a neural network trained partly from simple ODEs and partly from data. A physics loss is used to learn simple ODEs representing ideal dynamics. Having access to analytical functions inside the loss function acts as a regularizer, enforcing robust behavior for parametric uncertainties. On the other hand, a regular data loss is used for adapting to residual disturbances (non-parametric uncertainties), unaccounted during mathematical modelling. Experiments are performed in a simulated environment for trajectory tracking of a quadrotor. We report 7.8% to 43.2% and 8.04% to 61.5% reduction in tracking errors for speeds ranging from 0.5 to 1.75 m/s compared to two SOTA regression based MPC methods. ",

These questionnaires provide a variety of perspectives on a patient's current state of well-being. Not only is it critical to capture the heterogeneity given by these perspectives, but there is also a growing demand for developing cost-effective technologies for clinical phenotyping. Filling out many questionnaires may be a strain for the patients and therefore costly. In this work, we propose COBALT -- a cost-based layer selector model for detecting phenotypes using a community detection approach. Our goal is to minimize the number of features used to build these phenotypes while preserving its quality. We test our model using questionnaire data from chronic tinnitus patients and represent the data in a multi-layer network structure. The model is then evaluated by predicting post-treatment data using baseline features (age, gender, and pre-treatment data) as well as the identified phenotypes as a feature. For some post-treatment variables, predictors using phenotypes from COBALT as features outperformed those using phenotypes detected by traditional clustering methods. Moreover, using phenotype data to predict post-treatment data proved beneficial in comparison with predictors that were solely trained with baseline features. ",

While effective, applying the entire ensemble to every sample is costly and often unnecessary. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a cost-effective alternative, where detectors are dynamically chosen based on the output of their predecessors, with their usefulness weighted against their computational cost. Despite their potential, DRL-based solutions are not widely used in this capacity, partly due to the difficulties in configuring the reward function for each new task, the unpredictable reactions of the DRL agent to changes in the data, and the inability to use common performance metrics (e.g., TPR/FPR) to guide the algorithm's performance. In this study we propose methods for fine-tuning and calibrating DRL-based policies so that they can meet multiple performance goals. Moreover, we present a method for transferring effective security policies from one dataset to another. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is highly robust against adversarial attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Face presentation attack detection (PAD) is critical to secure face recognition (FR) applications from presentation attacks. FR performance has been shown to be unfair to certain demographic and non-demographic groups. However, the fairness of face PAD is an understudied issue, mainly due to the lack of appropriately annotated data. To address this issue, this work first presents a Combined Attribute Annotated PAD Dataset (CAAD-PAD) by combining several well-known PAD datasets where we provide seven human-annotated attribute labels. This work then comprehensively analyses the fairness of a set of face PADs and its relation to the nature of training data and the Operational Decision Threshold Assignment (ODTA) on different data groups by studying four face PAD approaches on our CAAD-PAD. To simultaneously represent both the PAD fairness and the absolute PAD performance, we introduce a novel metric, namely the Accuracy Balanced Fairness (ABF). Extensive experiments on CAAD-PAD show that the training data and ODTA induce unfairness on gender, occlusion, and other attribute groups. Based on these analyses, we propose a data augmentation method, FairSWAP, which aims to disrupt the identity/semantic information and guide models to mine attack cues rather than attribute-related information. Detailed experimental results demonstrate that FairSWAP generally enhances both the PAD performance and the fairness of face PAD. ",

To address this, we propose Concept Embedding Models, a novel family of concept bottleneck models which goes beyond the current accuracy-vs-interpretability trade-off by learning interpretable high-dimensional concept representations. Our experiments demonstrate that Concept Embedding Models (1) attain better or competitive task accuracy w.r.t. standard neural models without concepts, (2) provide concept representations capturing meaningful semantics including and beyond their ground truth labels, (3) support test-time concept interventions whose effect in test accuracy surpasses that in standard concept bottleneck models, and (4) scale to real-world conditions where complete concept supervisions are scarce.

In this paper, we define interventional robustness (IR), a measure of how much variability is introduced into learned policies by incidental aspects of the training procedure, such as the order of training data or the particular exploratory actions taken by agents. A training procedure has high IR when the agents it produces take very similar actions under intervention, despite variation in these incidental aspects of the training procedure. We develop an intuitive, quantitative measure of IR and calculate it for eight algorithms in three Atari environments across dozens of interventions and states. From these experiments, we find that IR varies with the amount of training and type of algorithm and that high performance does not imply high IR, as one might expect. ",

In the past, mathematicians have developed several numerical techniques to approximate the values of definite integrals, but primitives or indefinite integrals are often non-elementary. Anti-derivatives are necessarily required when there are several parameters in an integrand and the integral obtained is a function of those parameters. There is no theoretical method that can do this for any given function. Some existing ways to get around this are primarily based on either curve fitting or infinite series approximation of the integrand, which is then integrated theoretically. Curve fitting approximations are inaccurate for highly non-linear functions and require a different approach for every problem. On the other hand, the infinite series approach does not give a closed-form solution, and their truncated forms are often inaccurate. We claim that using a single method for all integrals, our algorithm can approximate anti-derivatives to any required accuracy. We have used this algorithm to obtain the anti-derivatives of several functions, including non-elementary and oscillatory integrals. This paper also shows the applications of our method to get the closed-form expressions of elliptic integrals, Fermi-Dirac integrals, and cumulative distribution functions and decrease the computation time of the Galerkin method for differential equations.

    "abstract": "Wearable sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has emerged as a principal research area and is utilized in a variety of applications. Recently, deep learning-based methods have achieved significant improvement in the HAR field with the development of human-computer interaction applications. However, they are limited to operating in a local neighborhood in the process of a standard convolution neural network, and correlations between different sensors on body positions are ignored. In addition, they still face significant challenging problems with performance degradation due to large gaps in the distribution of training and test data, and behavioral differences between subjects. In this work, we propose a novel Transformer-based Adversarial learning framework for human activity recognition using wearable sensors via Self-KnowledgE Distillation (TASKED), that accounts for individual sensor orientations and spatial and temporal features. The proposed method is capable of learning cross-domain embedding feature representations from multiple subjects datasets using adversarial learning and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) regularization to align the data distribution over multiple domains. In the proposed method, we adopt the teacher-free self-knowledge distillation to improve the stability of the training procedure and the performance of human activity recognition. Experimental results show that TASKED not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the four real-world public HAR datasets (alone or combined) but also improves the subject generalization effectively.

Unlike previous approaches that rebuilt the entire scene graph, we frame SGM as a graph expansion task by introducing the incremental structure expanding (ISE). ISE constructs the target graph by incrementally expanding the source graph without changing the unmodified structure. Based on ISE, we further propose a model that iterates between nodes prediction and edges prediction, inferring more accurate and harmonious expansion decisions progressively. In addition, we construct a challenging dataset that contains more complicated queries and larger scene graphs than existing datasets.

To mitigate this problem, a new approach based on the Hadamard transformation as an alternative to the convolution operation is demonstrated using two fundamental datasets, MNIST and CIFAR10. The mathematical expression of the Hadamard method shows the clear potential to save energy consumption compared to convolutional layers, which are helpful with BigData applications. In addition, to the test accuracy of the MNIST dataset, the Hadamard method performs similarly to the convolution method. In contrast, with the CIFAR10 dataset, test data accuracy is dropped (due to complex data and multiple channels) compared to the convolution method.

Despite the recent progress in human motion prediction, most studies simplify the problem by predicting the human motion relative to a fixed joint and/or only limit their model to predict one possible future motion. While due to the complex nature of human motion, a single output cannot reflect all the possible actions one can do. Also, for any robotics application, we need the full human motion including the user trajectory not a 3d pose relative to the hip joint. In this paper, we try to address these two issues by proposing a transformer-based generative model for forecasting multiple diverse human motions. Our model generates \\textit{N} future possible motion by querying a history of human motion. Our model first predicts the pose of the body relative to the hip joint. Then the \\textit{Hip Prediction Module} predicts the trajectory of the hip movement for each predicted pose frame. To emphasize on the diverse future motions we introduce a similarity loss that penalizes the pairwise sample distance. We show that our system outperforms the state-of-the-art in human motion prediction while it can predict diverse multi-motion future trajectories with hip movements ",

    "abstract": "The next generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (xURLLC) need novel design to provide satisfactory services to the emerging mission-critical applications. To improve the spectrum efficiency and enhance the robustness of xURLLC, this paper proposes a robust beamforming and rate-splitting design in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime for downlink multi-user multi-antenna xURLLC systems. In the design, adaptive rate-splitting is introduced to flexibly handle the complex inter-user interference and thus improve the spectrum efficiency. Taking the imperfection of the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) into consideration, a max-min user rate problem is formulated to optimize the common and private beamforming vectors and the rate-splitting vector under the premise of ensuring the requirements of transmission latency and reliability of all the users. The optimization problem is intractable due to the non-convexity of the constraint set and the infinite constraints caused by CSIT uncertainties. To solve it, we convert the infinite constraints into finite ones by the S-Procedure method and transform the original problem into a difference of convex (DC) programming. A constrained concave convex procedure (CCCP) and the Gaussian randomization based iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain a local minimum. Simulation results confirm the convergence, robustness and effectiveness of the proposed robust beamforming and rate-splitting design in the FBL regime. It is also shown that the proposed robust design achieves considerable performance gain in the worst user rate compared with existing transmission schemes under various blocklength and block error rate requirements.

Our representation is based on a directional derivative of the Gauss Linking Integral and allows us to represent both planar and spatial configurations in a consistent unified way. The proposed dGLI Cloth Coordinates are shown to be more accurate in the classification of cloth states and significantly more sensitive to changes in grasping affordances than other classic shape distance methods.

However, all of these methods are prone to background noises commonly existing in general images with texts. To tackle this problem, in this work, we introduce a new masked bounding-box selection method, that incorporating the bounding box information into the system.

This work considers a setup of deployed sensors in an IoT network, where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as mobile relay nodes between the sensors and the base station. We formulate an optimization problem to jointly plan the UAVs' trajectory, while minimizing the AoI of the received messages. This ensures that the received information at the base station is as fresh as possible. The complex optimization problem is efficiently solved using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. In particular, we propose a deep Q-network, which works as a function approximation to estimate the state-action value function. The proposed scheme is quick to converge and results in a lower AoI than the random walk scheme. Our proposed algorithm reduces the average age by approximately $25\\%$ and requires down to $50\\%$ less energy when compared to the baseline scheme. ",

However, since they decompose the scene into multiple maps containing various objects, and they do not rely on any explicit supervisory signal, they cannot distinguish between the object of interest from other objects, as required in weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL). To address this issue, we propose leveraging the multiple maps generated by the different transformer heads to acquire pseudo-labels for training a WSOL model. In particular, a new Discriminative Proposals Sampling (DiPS) method is introduced that relies on a pretrained CNN classifier to identify discriminative regions. Then, foreground and background pixels are sampled from these regions in order to train a WSOL model for generating activation maps that can accurately localize objects belonging to a specific class. Empirical results on the challenging CUB, OpenImages, and ILSVRC benchmark datasets indicate that our proposed approach can outperform state-of-art methods over a wide range of threshold values. DiPS provides class activation maps with a better coverage of foreground object regions w.r.t. the background. ",

    "abstract": "When training overparameterized deep networks for classification tasks, it has been widely observed that the learned features exhibit a so-called \"neural collapse\" phenomenon. More specifically, for the output features of the penultimate layer, for each class the within-class features converge to their means, and the means of different classes exhibit a certain tight frame structure, which is also aligned with the last layer's classifier. As feature normalization in the last layer becomes a common practice in modern representation learning, in this work we theoretically justify the neural collapse phenomenon for normalized features. Based on an unconstrained feature model, we simplify the empirical loss function in a multi-class classification task into a nonconvex optimization problem over the Riemannian manifold by constraining all features and classifiers over the sphere. In this context, we analyze the nonconvex landscape of the Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres, showing a benign global landscape in the sense that the only global minimizers are the neural collapse solutions while all other critical points are strict saddles with negative curvature. Experimental results on practical deep networks corroborate our theory and demonstrate that better representations can be learned faster via feature normalization. ",

A good streaming recognition model captures both long-term dynamics and short-term changes of video. Unfortunately, in most existing methods, the computational complexity grows linearly or quadratically with the length of the considered dynamics. This issue is particularly pronounced in transformer-based architectures. To address this issue, we reformulate the cross-attention in a video transformer through the lens of kernel and apply two kinds of temporal smoothing kernel: A box kernel or a Laplace kernel. The resulting streaming attention reuses much of the computation from frame to frame, and only requires a constant time update each frame. Based on this idea, we build TeSTra, a Temporal Smoothing Transformer, that takes in arbitrarily long inputs with constant caching and computing overhead. Specifically, it runs $6\\times$ faster than equivalent sliding-window based transformers with 2,048 frames in a streaming setting. Furthermore, thanks to the increased temporal span, TeSTra achieves state-of-the-art results on THUMOS'14 and EPIC-Kitchen-100, two standard online action detection and action anticipation datasets. A real-time version of TeSTra outperforms all but one prior approaches on the THUMOS'14 dataset. ",

The versatility of graphons allows us to tackle the joint inference problem even for the cases where the graphs to be recovered contain different number of nodes and lack precise alignment across the graphs. Our solution is based on combining a maximum likelihood penalty with graphon estimation schemes and can be used to augment existing network inference methods.

We instead leverage low-cost machine learning (ML) models to predict the excited state properties of photoactive iridium complexes. We use experimental data of 1,380 iridium complexes to train and evaluate the ML models and identify the best-performing and most transferable models to be those trained on electronic structure features from low-cost density functional theory tight binding calculations. Using these models, we predict the three excited state properties considered, mean emission energy of phosphorescence, excited state lifetime, and emission spectral integral, with accuracy competitive with or superseding TDDFT. We conduct feature importance analysis to identify which iridium complex attributes govern excited state properties and we validate these trends with explicit examples. As a demonstration of how our ML models can be used for HTVS and the acceleration of chemical discovery, we curate a set of novel hypothetical iridium complexes and identify promising ligands for the design of new phosphors.

    "title": "Heterogeneous Federated Learning on a Graph",
    "abstract": "Federated learning, where algorithms are trained across multiple decentralized devices without sharing local data, is increasingly popular in distributed machine learning practice. Typically, a graph structure $G$ exists behind local devices for communication. In this work, we consider parameter estimation in federated learning with data distribution and communication heterogeneity, as well as limited computational capacity of local devices. We encode the distribution heterogeneity by parametrizing distributions on local devices with a set of distinct $p$-dimensional vectors. We then propose to jointly estimate parameters of all devices under the $M$-estimation framework with the fused Lasso regularization, encouraging an equal estimate of parameters on connected devices in $G$. We provide a general result for our estimator depending on $G$, which can be further calibrated to obtain convergence rates for various specific problem setups. Surprisingly, our estimator attains the optimal rate under certain graph fidelity condition on $G$, as if we could aggregate all samples sharing the same distribution. If the graph fidelity condition is not met, we propose an edge selection procedure via multiple testing to ensure the optimality. To ease the burden of local computation, a decentralized stochastic version of ADMM is provided, with convergence rate $O(T^{-1}\\log T)$ where $T$ denotes the number of iterations. We highlight that, our algorithm transmits only parameters along edges of $G$ at each iteration, without requiring a central machine, which preserves privacy. We further extend it to the case where devices are randomly inaccessible during the training process, with a similar algorithmic convergence guarantee. The computational and statistical efficiency of our method is evidenced by simulation experiments and the 2020 US presidential election data set. ",

    "title": "Two-stage Modeling for Prediction with Confidence",
    "abstract": "The use of neural networks has been very successful in a wide variety of applications. However, it has recently been observed that it is difficult to generalize the performance of neural networks under the condition of distributional shift. Several efforts have been made to identify potential out-of-distribution inputs. Although existing literature has made significant progress with regard to images and textual data, finance has been overlooked. The aim of this paper is to investigate the distribution shift in the credit scoring problem, one of the most important applications of finance. For the potential distribution shift problem, we propose a novel two-stage model. Using the out-of-distribution detection method, data is first separated into confident and unconfident sets. As a second step, we utilize the domain knowledge with a mean-variance optimization in order to provide reliable bounds for unconfident samples. Using empirical results, we demonstrate that our model offers reliable predictions for the vast majority of datasets. It is only a small portion of the dataset that is inherently difficult to judge, and we leave them to the judgment of human beings. Based on the two-stage model, highly confident predictions have been made and potential risks associated with the model have been significantly reduced. ",

    "abstract": "The concept of causality plays an important role in human cognition . In the past few decades, causal inference has been well developed in many fields, such as computer science, medicine, economics, and education. With the advancement of deep learning techniques, it has been increasingly used in causal inference against counterfactual data. Typically, deep causal models map the characteristics of covariates to a representation space and then design various objective optimization functions to estimate counterfactual data unbiasedly based on the different optimization methods. This paper focuses on the survey of the deep causal models, and its core contributions are as follows: 1) we provide relevant metrics under multiple treatments and continuous-dose treatment; 2) we incorporate a comprehensive overview of deep causal models from both temporal development and method classification perspectives; 3) we assist a detailed and comprehensive classification and analysis of relevant datasets and source code.

We use off-line collected data and an approximate model of the dynamics to formulate a finite-horizon optimization problem. To account for both the uncertainty related to the dynamics and the disturbance acting on the system, we resort to a distributionally robust formulation that optimizes the cost expectation while satisfying Conditional Value-at-Risk constraints with respect to the worst-case probability distributions of the uncertainties within an ambiguity set defined using the Wasserstein metric. Using results from the distributionally robust optimization literature we derive a tractable finite-dimensional convex optimization problem with finite-sample guarantees for the class of convex piecewise affine cost and constraint functions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in closed-loop simulation on a simple numerical example. ",

    "abstract": "Precise segmentation is a vital first step to analyze semantic information of cardiac cycle and capture anomaly with cardiovascular signals. However, in the field of deep semantic segmentation, inference is often unilaterally confounded by the individual attribute of data. Towards cardiovascular signals, quasi-periodicity is the essential characteristic to be learned, regarded as the synthesize of the attributes of morphology (Am) and rhythm (Ar). Our key insight is to suppress the over-dependence on Am or Ar while the generation process of deep representations. To address this issue, we establish a structural causal model as the foundation to customize the intervention approaches on Am and Ar, respectively. In this paper, we propose contrastive causal intervention (CCI) to form a novel training paradigm under a frame-level contrastive framework. The intervention can eliminate the implicit statistical bias brought by the single attribute and lead to more objective representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments with the controlled condition for QRS location and heart sound segmentation. The final results indicate that our approach can evidently improve the performance by up to 0.41% for QRS location and 2.73% for heart sound segmentation. The efficiency of the proposed method is generalized to multiple databases and noisy signals. ",

    "abstract": "Subgraph isomorphism or subgraph matching is generally considered as an NP-complete problem, made more complex in practical applications where the edge weights take real values and are subject to measurement noise and possible anomalies. To the best of our knowledge, almost all subgraph matching methods utilize node labels to perform node-node matching. In the absence of such labels (in applications such as image matching and map matching among others), these subgraph matching methods do not work. We propose a method for identifying the node correspondence between a subgraph and a full graph in the inexact case without node labels in two steps - (a) extract the minimal unique topology preserving subset from the subgraph and find its feasible matching in the full graph, and (b) implement a consensus-based algorithm to expand the matched node set by pairing unique paths based on boundary commutativity. Going beyond the existing subgraph matching approaches, the proposed method is shown to have realistically sub-linear computational efficiency, robustness to random measurement noise, and good statistical properties. Our method is also readily applicable to the exact matching case without loss of generality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a simulation and a case study is performed on the Erdos-Renyi random graphs and the image-based affine covariant features dataset respectively.

By changing the pattern or material, the mechanical properties of woven composites can be significantly changed; however, the role of woven composite architecture (pattern, material) on the mechanical properties is not well understood. In this paper, we explore the relationship between woven composite architectures (weave pattern, weave material sequence) and the corresponding modulus through our proposed Physics-Constrained Neural Network (PCNN). Furthermore, we apply statistical learning methods to optimize the woven composite architecture to improve mechanical responses. Our results show that PCNN can effectively predict woven architecture for the desired modulus with much higher accuracy than several baseline models. PCNN can be further combined with feature-based optimization to determine the optimal woven composite architecture at the initial design stage. In addition to relating woven composite architecture to its mechanical responses, our research also provides an in-depth understanding of how architectural features govern mechanical responses. We anticipate our proposed frameworks will primarily facilitate the woven composite analysis and optimization process and be a starting point to introduce Physics knowledge-guided Neural Networks into the complex structural analysis.

This study evaluates the robustness of an AI solution for the diagnosis of normal chest X-rays (CXRs) by comparing performance across multiple patient and environmental subgroups, as well as comparing AI errors with those made by human experts. Methods: A total of 4,060 CXRs were sampled to represent a diverse dataset of NHS patients and care settings. Ground-truth labels were assigned by a 3-radiologist panel. AI performance was evaluated against assigned labels and sub-groups analysis was conducted against patient age and sex, as well as CXR view, modality, device manufacturer and hospital site. Results: The AI solution was able to remove 18.5% of the dataset by classification as High Confidence Normal (HCN). This was associated with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.0%, compared to 89.1% for diagnosis of normal scans by radiologists. In all AI false negative (FN) cases, a radiologist was found to have also made the same error when compared to final ground-truth labels. Subgroup analysis showed no statistically significant variations in AI performance, whilst reduced normal classification was observed in data from some hospital sites. Conclusion: We show the AI solution could provide meaningful workload savings by diagnosis of 18.5% of scans as HCN with a superior NPV to human readers. The AI solution is shown to perform well across patient subgroups and error cases were shown to be subjective or subtle in nature. ",
