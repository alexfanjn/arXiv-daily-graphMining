    "abstract": "Imbalanced Data (ID) is a problem that deters Machine Learning (ML) models for achieving satisfactory results. ID is the occurrence of a situation where the quantity of the samples belonging to one class outnumbers that of the other by a wide margin, making such models learning process biased towards the majority class. In recent years, to address this issue, several solutions have been put forward, which opt for either synthetically generating new data for the minority class or reducing the number of majority classes for balancing the data. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), mixed with a variety of well-known imbalanced data solutions meaning oversampling and undersampling. To evaluate our methods, we have used KEEL, breast cancer, and Z-Alizadeh Sani datasets. In order to achieve reliable results, we conducted our experiments 100 times with randomly shuffled data distributions. The classification results demonstrate that the mixed Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)-Normalization-CNN outperforms different methodologies achieving 99.08% accuracy on the 24 imbalanced datasets. Therefore, the proposed mixed model can be applied to imbalanced binary classification problems on other real datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Learning Electronic Health Records (EHRs) representation is a preeminent yet under-discovered research topic. It benefits various clinical decision support applications, e.g., medication outcome prediction or patient similarity search. Current approaches focus on task-specific label supervision on vectorized sequential EHR, which is not applicable to large-scale unsupervised scenarios. Recently, contrastive learning shows great success on self-supervised representation learning problems. However, complex temporality often degrades the performance. We propose Graph Kernel Infomax, a self-supervised graph kernel learning approach on the graphical representation of EHR, to overcome the previous problems. Unlike the state-of-the-art, we do not change the graph structure to construct augmented views. Instead, we use Kernel Subspace Augmentation to embed nodes into two geometrically different manifold views. The entire framework is trained by contrasting nodes and graph representations on those two manifold views through the commonly used contrastive objectives. Empirically, using publicly available benchmark EHR datasets, our approach yields performance on clinical downstream tasks that exceeds the state-of-the-art. Theoretically, the variation on distance metrics naturally creates different views as data augmentation without changing graph structures. ",

For example, they have been proven effective for studying the increasing polarization of the votes in the two chambers of the American Congress from World War II on. To provide further insights into this particular case study, we propose the application of a framework to analyze and visualize a signed graph's configuration based on the exploitation of the corresponding Laplacian matrix' spectral properties. The overall methodology is comparable with others based on the frustration index, but it has at least two main advantages: first, it requires a much lower computational cost; second, it allows for a quantitative and visual assessment of how arbitrarily small subgraphs (even single nodes) contribute to the overall balance (or unbalance) of the network. The proposed pipeline allows to explore the polarization dynamics shown by the American Congress from 1945 to 2020 at different resolution scales. In fact, we are able to spot and to point out the influence of some (groups of) congressmen in the overall balance, as well as to observe and explore polarization's evolution of both chambers across the years.

    "abstract": "Video conferencing has become the preferred way of interacting virtually. Current video conferencing applications, like Zoom, Teams or WebEx, are centralized, cloud-based platforms whose performance crucially depends on the proximity of clients to their data centers. Clients from low-income countries are particularly affected as most data centers from major cloud providers are located in economically advanced nations. Centralized conferencing applications also suffer from occasional outages and are embattled by serious privacy violation allegations. In recent years, decentralized video conferencing applications built over p2p networks and incentivized through blockchain are becoming popular. A key characteristic of these networks is their openness: anyone can host a media server on the network and gain reward for providing service. Strong economic incentives combined with lower entry barrier to join the network, makes increasing server coverage to even remote regions of the world. These reasons, however, also lead to a security problem: a server may obfuscate its true location in order to gain an unfair business advantage. In this paper, we consider the problem of multicast tree construction for video conferencing sessions in open p2p conferencing applications. We propose DecVi, a decentralized multicast tree construction protocol that adaptively discovers efficient tree structures based on an exploration-exploitation framework. DecVi is motivated by the combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem and uses a succinct learning model to compute effective actions. Despite operating in a multi-agent setting with each server having only limited knowledge of the global network and without cooperation among servers, experimentally we show DecVi achieves similar quality-of-experience compared to a centralized globally optimal algorithm while achieving higher reliability and flexibility.

    "abstract": "The constantly evolving digital transformation imposes new requirements on our society. Aspects relating to reliance on the networking domain and the difficulty of achieving security by design pose a challenge today. As a result, data-centric and machine-learning approaches arose as feasible solutions for securing large networks. Although, in the network security domain, ML-based solutions face a challenge regarding the capability to generalize between different contexts. In other words, solutions based on specific network data usually do not perform satisfactorily on other networks. This paper describes the stacked-unsupervised federated learning (FL) approach to generalize on a cross-silo configuration for a flow-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The proposed approach we have examined comprises a deep autoencoder in conjunction with an energy flow classifier in an ensemble learning task. Our approach performs better than traditional local learning and naive cross-evaluation (training in one context and testing on another network data). Remarkably, the proposed approach demonstrates a sound performance in the case of non-iid data silos. In conjunction with an informative feature in an ensemble architecture for unsupervised learning, we advise that the proposed FL-based NIDS results in a feasible approach for generalization between heterogeneous networks. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first successful approach to applying unsupervised FL on the problem of network intrusion detection generalization using flow-based data. ",

We exhibit a NN architecture that, in polynomial time, learns as well as any efficient learning algorithm describable by a constant-sized learning algorithm. For example, on parity problems, the NN learns as well as row reduction, an efficient algorithm that can be succinctly described. Our architecture combines both recurrent weight-sharing between layers and convolutional weight-sharing to reduce the number of parameters down to a constant, even though the network itself may have trillions of nodes. While in practice the constants in our analysis are too large to be directly meaningful, our work suggests that the synergy of Recurrent and Convolutional NNs (RCNNs) may be more powerful than either alone.

In this paper we present a universal, time invariant attack for general time series data such that the attack has a frequency spectrum primarily composed of the frequencies present in the original data. The universality of the attack makes it fast and easy to implement as no computation is required to add it to an input, while time invariance is useful for real-world deployment. Additionally, the frequency constraint ensures the attack can withstand filtering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack in two different domains, speech recognition and unintended radiated emission, and show that the attack is robust against common transform-and-compare defense pipelines.

    "abstract": "Ophthalmic images and derivatives such as the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness map are crucial for detecting and monitoring ophthalmic diseases (e.g., glaucoma). For computer-aided diagnosis of eye diseases, the key technique is to automatically extract meaningful features from ophthalmic images that can reveal the biomarkers (e.g., RNFL thinning patterns) linked to functional vision loss. However, representation learning from ophthalmic images that links structural retinal damage with human vision loss is non-trivial mostly due to large anatomical variations between patients. The task becomes even more challenging in the presence of image artifacts, which are common due to issues with image acquisition and automated segmentation. In this paper, we propose an artifact-tolerant unsupervised learning framework termed EyeLearn for learning representations of ophthalmic images. EyeLearn has an artifact correction module to learn representations that can best predict artifact-free ophthalmic images. In addition, EyeLearn adopts a clustering-guided contrastive learning strategy to explicitly capture the intra- and inter-image affinities. During training, images are dynamically organized in clusters to form contrastive samples in which images in the same or different clusters are encouraged to learn similar or dissimilar representations, respectively. To evaluate EyeLearn, we use the learned representations for visual field prediction and glaucoma detection using a real-world ophthalmic image dataset of glaucoma patients. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods verified the effectiveness of EyeLearn for learning optimal feature representations from ophthalmic images. ",

    "abstract": "As an important cyber-physical system (CPS), smart grid is highly vulnerable to cyber attacks. Amongst various types of attacks, false data injection attack (FDIA) proves to be one of the top-priority cyber-related issues and has received increasing attention in recent years. However, so far little attention has been paid to privacy preservation issues in the detection of FDIAs in smart grid. Inspired by federated learning, a FDIA detection method based on secure federated deep learning is proposed in this paper by combining Transformer, federated learning and Paillier cryptosystem. The Transformer, as a detector deployed in edge nodes, delves deep into the connection between individual electrical quantities by using its multi-head self-attention mechanism. By using federated learning framework, our approach utilizes the data from all nodes to collaboratively train a detection model while preserving data privacy by keeping the data locally during training. To improve the security of federated learning, a secure federated learning scheme is designed by combing Paillier cryptosystem with federated learning. Through extensive experiments on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are verifed. ",

    "abstract": "In a two-way relay channel (TWRC), physical-layer network coding (PNC) doubles the system throughput by turning superimposed signals transmitted simultaneously by different end nodes into useful network-coded information (known as PNC decoding). Prior works indicated that the PNC decoding performance is affected by the relative phase offset between the received signals from different nodes. In particular, some \"bad\" relative phase offsets could lead to huge performance degradation. Previous solutions to mitigate the relative phase offset effect were limited to the conventional bit-oriented communication paradigm, aiming at delivering a given information stream as quickly and reliably as possible. In contrast, this paper puts forth the first semantic communication-empowered PNC-enabled TWRC to address the relative phase offset issue, referred to as SC-PNC. Despite the bad relative phase offsets, SC-PNC directly extracts the semantic meaning of transmitted messages rather than ensuring accurate bit stream transmission. We jointly design deep neural network (DNN)-based transceivers at the end nodes and propose a semantic PNC decoder at the relay. Taking image delivery as an example, experimental results show that the SC-PNC TWRC achieves high and stable reconstruction quality for images under different channel conditions and relative phase offsets, compared with the conventional bit-oriented counterparts.

Most existing methods focus on local structure and fail to fully incorporate the global topological structure. To this end, we propose a novel Structure-Preserving Graph Representation Learning (SPGRL) method, to fully capture the structure information of graphs. Specifically, to reduce the uncertainty and misinformation of the original graph, we construct a feature graph as a complementary view via k-Nearest Neighbor method. The feature graph can be used to contrast at node-level to capture the local relation. Besides, we retain the global topological structure information by maximizing the mutual information (MI) of the whole graph and feature embeddings, which is theoretically reduced to exchanging the feature embeddings of the feature and the original graphs to reconstruct themselves. Extensive experiments show that our method has quite superior performance on semi-supervised node classification task and excellent robustness under noise perturbation on graph structure or node features.

    "abstract": "Large-scale graphs are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios and can be trained by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate representation for downstream tasks. Given the abundant information and complex topology of a large-scale graph, we argue that redundancy exists in such graphs and will degrade the training efficiency. Unfortunately, the model scalability severely restricts the efficiency of training large-scale graphs via vanilla GNNs. Despite recent advances in sampling-based training methods, sampling-based GNNs generally overlook the redundancy issue. It still takes intolerable time to train these models on large-scale graphs. Thereby, we propose to drop redundancy and improve efficiency of training large-scale graphs with GNNs, by rethinking the inherent characteristics in a graph. In this paper, we pioneer to propose a once-for-all method, termed DropReef, to drop the redundancy in large-scale graphs. Specifically, we first conduct preliminary experiments to explore potential redundancy in large-scale graphs. Next, we present a metric to quantify the neighbor heterophily of all nodes in a graph. Based on both experimental and theoretical analysis, we reveal the redundancy in a large-scale graph, i.e., nodes with high neighbor heterophily and a great number of neighbors. Then, we propose DropReef to detect and drop the redundancy in large-scale graphs once and for all, helping reduce the training time while ensuring no sacrifice in the model accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DropReef, we apply it to recent state-of-the-art sampling-based GNNs for training large-scale graphs, owing to the high precision of such models. With DropReef leveraged, the training efficiency of models can be greatly promoted. DropReef is highly compatible and is offline performed, benefiting the state-of-the-art sampling-based GNNs in the present and future to a significant extent. ",

Due to the high computational complexity of deep learning models, most embedded HAR systems are based on simple and not-so-accurate classic machine learning algorithms. This work bridges the gap between on-device HAR and deep learning, proposing a set of efficient one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) deployable on general purpose microcontrollers (MCUs). Our CNNs are obtained combining hyper-parameters optimization with sub-byte and mixed-precision quantization, to find good trade-offs between classification results and memory occupation. Moreover, we also leverage adaptive inference as an orthogonal optimization to tune the inference complexity at runtime based on the processed input, hence producing a more flexible HAR system. With experiments on four datasets, and targeting an ultra-low-power RISC-V MCU, we show that (i) We are able to obtain a rich set of Pareto-optimal CNNs for HAR, spanning more than 1 order of magnitude in terms of memory, latency and energy consumption; (ii) Thanks to adaptive inference, we can derive >20 runtime operating modes starting from a single CNN, differing by up to 10% in classification scores and by more than 3x in inference complexity, with a limited memory overhead; (iii) on three of the four benchmarks, we outperform all previous deep learning methods, reducing the memory occupation by more than 100x. The few methods that obtain better performance (both shallow and deep) are not compatible with MCU deployment. (iv) All our CNNs are compatible with real-time on-device HAR with an inference latency <16ms. Their memory occupation varies in 0.05-23.17 kB, and their energy consumption in 0.005 and 61.59 uJ, allowing years of continuous operation on a small battery supply. ",

LCSD platforms promote rapid application development with a drag-and-drop interface and minimal programming by hand. As it is a relatively new paradigm, it is vital to study developers' difficulties when adopting LCSD platforms. Software engineers frequently use the online developer forum Stack Overflow (SO) to seek assistance with technical issues. We observe a growing body of LCSD-related posts in SO. This paper presents an empirical study of around 33K SO posts containing discussions of 38 popular LCSD platforms. We use Topic Modeling to determine the topics discussed in those posts. Additionally, we examine how these topics are spread across the various phases of the agile software development life cycle (SDLC) and which part of LCSD is the most popular and challenging. Our study offers several interesting findings. First, we find 40 LCSD topics that we group into five categories: Application Customization, Database, and File Management, Platform Adoption, Platform Maintenance, and Third-party API Integration. Second, while the Application Customization (30\\%) and Data Storage (25\\%) \\rev{topic} categories are the most common, inquiries relating to several other categories (e.g., the Platform Adoption \\rev{topic} category) have gained considerable attention in recent years. Third, all topic categories are evolving rapidly, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. The findings of this study have implications for all three LCSD stakeholders: LCSD platform vendors, LCSD developers/practitioners, Researchers, and Educators. Researchers and LCSD platform vendors can collaborate to improve different aspects of LCSD, such as better tutorial-based documentation, testing, and DevOps support. ",

An oracle, that knows the graph, the initial position of the agent, and the position of the treasure, places some pebbles on the nodes, at most one per node, of the graph to guide the agent towards the treasure. This paper aims to study the trade-off between the number of pebbles provided and the time required to find the treasure. To be specific, we aim to answer the following question. ``What is the minimum time for treasure hunt in a graph with maximum degree $\\Delta$ and diameter $D$ if $k$ pebbles are placed? \" We answer the above question when $k<D$ or $k=cD$ for some positive integer $c$. We design efficient algorithms for the agent for different values of $k$. We also propose an almost matching lower bound result for $k<D$. ",

    "abstract": "One of the key topics in network security research is the autonomous COA (Couse-of-Action) attack search method. Traditional COA attack search methods that passively search for attacks can be difficult, especially as the network gets bigger. To address these issues, new autonomous COA techniques are being developed, and among them, an intelligent spatial algorithm is designed in this paper for efficient operations in scalable networks. On top of the spatial search, a Monte-Carlo (MC)- based temporal approach is additionally considered for taking care of time-varying network behaviors. Therefore, we propose a spatio-temporal attack COA search algorithm for scalable and time-varying networks. ",

    "abstract": "Answering natural language questions on knowledge graphs (KGQA) remains a great challenge in terms of understanding complex questions via multi-hop reasoning. Previous efforts usually exploit large-scale entity-related text corpora or knowledge graph (KG) embeddings as auxiliary information to facilitate answer selection. However, the rich semantics implied in off-the-shelf relation paths between entities is far from well explored. This paper proposes improving multi-hop KGQA by exploiting relation paths' hybrid semantics. Specifically, we integrate explicit textual information and implicit KG structural features of relation paths based on a novel rotate-and-scale entity link prediction framework. Extensive experiments on three existing KGQA datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, especially in multi-hop scenarios. Further investigation confirms our method's systematical coordination between questions and relation paths to identify answer entities. ",

In this paper, we propose MCLEA, a Multi-modal Contrastive Learning based Entity Alignment model, to obtain effective joint representations for multi-modal entity alignment. Different from previous works, MCLEA considers task-oriented modality and models the inter-modal relationships for each entity representation. In particular, MCLEA firstly learns multiple individual representations from multiple modalities, and then performs contrastive learning to jointly model intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. Extensive experimental results show that MCLEA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on public datasets under both supervised and unsupervised settings. ",

For this the typical approach is to regularize the learned representation through prior probability distributions. However such priors are usually unavailable or ad hoc. To deal with this, we propose a dynamics-constrained representation learning framework. Instead of using predefined probabilities, we restrict the latent representation to follow specific dynamics, which is a more natural constraint for representation learning in dynamical systems. Our belief stems from a fundamental observation in physics that though different systems can have different marginalized probability distributions, they typically obey the same dynamics, such as Newton's and Schrodinger's equations. We validate our framework for different systems including a real-world fluorescent DNA movie dataset. We show that our algorithm can uniquely identify an uncorrelated, isometric and meaningful latent representation. ",

Despite its prevalence, GNN suffers from two drawbacks in the graph classification task, the neglect of graph-level relationships, and the generalization issue. Each graph is treated separately in GNN message passing/graph pooling, and existing methods to address overfitting operate on each individual graph. This makes the graph representations learnt less effective in the downstream classification. In this paper, we propose a Class-Aware Representation rEfinement (CARE) framework for the task of graph classification. CARE computes simple yet powerful class representations and injects them to steer the learning of graph representations towards better class separability. CARE is a plug-and-play framework that is highly flexible and able to incorporate arbitrary GNN backbones without significantly increasing the computational cost. We also theoretically prove that CARE has a better generalization upper bound than its GNN backbone through Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension analysis. Our extensive experiments with 10 well-known GNN backbones on 9 benchmark datasets validate the superiority and effectiveness of CARE over its GNN counterparts. ",

As such, security operations actively try to detect this type of communication in their networks. This poses a problem for legitimate pentesters that try to remain undetected, since commonly used pentesting tools, such as Metasploit, generate constant traffic patterns that are easily distinguishable from regular web traffic. In this paper we start with these identifiable patterns in Metasploit's C2 traffic and show that a machine learning-based detector is able to detect the presence of such traffic with high accuracy, even when encrypted. We then outline and implement a set of modifications to the Metasploit framework in order to decrease the detection rates of such classifier. To evaluate the performance of these modifications, we use two threat models with increasing awareness of these modifications. We look at the detection evasion performance and at the byte count and runtime overhead of the modifications. Our results show that for the second, increased-awareness threat model the framework-side traffic modifications yield a better detection avoidance rate (90%) than payload-side only modifications (50%). We also show that although the modifications use up to 3 times more TLS payload bytes than the original, the runtime does not significantly change and the total number of bytes (including TLS payload) reduces.

Historically, naive and handcrafted methods like k Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) or query ball point over xyz features have been proposed, focusing more attention on improving the network than improving the graph. In this work, we propose a more principled way of creating a graph from a 3D pointcloud. Our method is based on performing k-NN over a transformation of the input 3D pointcloud. This transformation is done by an Multi-Later Perceptron (MLP) with learnable parameters that is optimized through backpropagation jointly with the rest of the network. We also introduce a regularization method based on stress minimization, which allows to control how distant is the learnt graph from our baseline: k-NN over xyz space. This framework is tested on ModelNet40, where graphs generated by our network outperformed the baseline by 0.3 points in overall accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Image smoothing is a fundamental low-level vision task that aims to preserve salient structures of an image while removing insignificant details. Deep learning has been explored in image smoothing to deal with the complex entanglement of semantic structures and trivial details. However, current methods neglect two important facts in smoothing: 1) naive pixel-level regression supervised by the limited number of high-quality smoothing ground-truth could lead to domain shift and cause generalization problems towards real-world images; 2) texture appearance is closely related to object semantics, so that image smoothing requires awareness of semantic difference to apply adaptive smoothing strengths. To address these issues, we propose a novel Contrastive Semantic-Guided Image Smoothing Network (CSGIS-Net) that combines both contrastive prior and semantic prior to facilitate robust image smoothing. The supervision signal is augmented by leveraging undesired smoothing effects as negative teachers, and by incorporating segmentation tasks to encourage semantic distinctiveness. To realize the proposed network, we also enrich the original VOC dataset with texture enhancement and smoothing labels, namely VOC-smooth, which first bridges image smoothing and semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSGIS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/wangjie6866/CSGIS-Net. ",

We find that in terms of variance of the neural network's output and test accuracy the best choice is to choose the $\\gamma_{i}$'s to be equal to one, which is the mean-field scaling. We also find that this is particularly true for the outer layer, in that the neural network's behavior is more sensitive in the scaling of the outer layer as opposed to the scaling of the inner layers. The mechanism for the mathematical analysis is an asymptotic expansion for the neural network's output. An important practical consequence of the analysis is that it provides a systematic and mathematically informed way to choose the learning rate hyperparameters. Such a choice guarantees that the neural network behaves in a statistically robust way as the $N_i$ grow to infinity. ",

    "abstract": "In-place gesture-based virtual locomotion techniques enable users to control their viewpoint and intuitively move in the 3D virtual environment. A key research problem is to accurately and quickly recognize in-place gestures, since they can trigger specific movements of virtual viewpoints and enhance user experience. However, to achieve real-time experience, only short-term sensor sequence data (up to about 300ms, 6 to 10 frames) can be taken as input, which actually affects the classification performance due to limited spatio-temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel long-term memory augmented network for in-place gestures classification. It takes as input both short-term gesture sequence samples and their corresponding long-term sequence samples that provide extra relevant spatio-temporal information in the training phase. We store long-term sequence features with an external memory queue. In addition, we design a memory augmented loss to help cluster features of the same class and push apart features from different classes, thus enabling our memory queue to memorize more relevant long-term sequence features. In the inference phase, we input only short-term sequence samples to recall the stored features accordingly, and fuse them together to predict the gesture class. We create a large-scale in-place gestures dataset from 25 participants with 11 gestures. Our method achieves a promising accuracy of 95.1% with a latency of 192ms, and an accuracy of 97.3% with a latency of 312ms, and is demonstrated to be superior to recent in-place gesture classification techniques. User study also validates our approach. Our source code and dataset will be made available to the community. ",

    "title": "Fiducial Marker Detection in Multi-Viewpoint Point Cloud",
    "abstract": "The existing LiDAR fiducial marker systems have usage restrictions. Especially, LiDARTag requires a specific marker placement and Intensity Image-based LiDAR Fiducial Marker demands that the point cloud is sampled from one viewpoint. As a result, with point clouds sampled from multiple viewpoints, fiducial marker detection remains an unsolved problem. In this letter, we develop a novel algorithm to detect the fiducial markers in the multi-viewpoint point cloud. The proposed algorithm includes two stages. First, Regions of Interest (ROIs) detection finds point clusters that could contain fiducial markers. Specifically, a method extracting the ROIs from the intensity perspective is introduced on account of the fact that from the spatial perspective, the markers, which are sheets of paper or thin boards, are non-distinguishable from the planes to which they are attached. Second, marker detection verifies if the candidate ROIs contain fiducial markers and outputs the ID numbers and vertices locations of the markers in the valid ROIs. In particular, the ROIs are transmitted to a predefined intermediate plane for the purpose of adopting a spherical projection to generate the intensity image, and then, marker detection is completed through the intensity image. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results are provided to validate the proposed algorithm. The codes and results are available at: https://github.com/York-SDCNLab/Marker?Detection-General ",

    "title": "Neighborhood-aware Scalable Temporal Network Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Temporal networks have been widely used to model real-world complex systems such as financial systems and e-commerce systems. In a temporal network, the joint neighborhood of a set of nodes often provides crucial structural information on predicting whether they may interact at a certain time. However, recent representation learning methods for temporal networks often fail to extract such information or depend on extremely time-consuming feature construction approaches. To address the issue, this work proposes Neighborhood-Aware Temporal network model (NAT). For each node in the network, NAT abandons the commonly-used one-single-vector-based representation while adopting a novel dictionary-type neighborhood representation. Such a dictionary representation records a down-sampled set of the neighboring nodes as keys, and allows fast construction of structural features for a joint neighborhood of multiple nodes. We also design dedicated data structure termed N-cache to support parallel access and update of those dictionary representations on GPUs. NAT gets evaluated over seven real-world large-scale temporal networks. NAT not only outperforms all cutting-edge baselines by averaged 5.9% and 6.0% in transductive and inductive link prediction accuracy, respectively, but also keeps scalable by achieving a speed-up of 4.1-76.7 against the baselines that adopts joint structural features and achieves a speed-up of 1.6-4.0 against the baselines that cannot adopt those features.

    "abstract": "In the context of modern environmental and societal concerns, there is an increasing demand for methods able to identify management strategies for civil engineering systems, minimizing structural failure risks while optimally planning inspection and maintenance (I&M) processes. Most available methods simplify the I&M decision problem to the component level due to the computational complexity associated with global optimization methodologies under joint system-level state descriptions. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithmic framework for inference and decision-making under uncertainty for engineering systems exposed to deteriorating environments, providing optimal management strategies directly at the system level. In our approach, the decision problem is formulated as a factored partially observable Markov decision process, whose dynamics are encoded in Bayesian network conditional structures. The methodology can handle environments under equal or general, unequal deterioration correlations among components, through Gaussian hierarchical structures and dynamic Bayesian networks. In terms of policy optimization, we adopt a deep decentralized multi-agent actor-critic (DDMAC) reinforcement learning approach, in which the policies are approximated by actor neural networks guided by a critic network. By including deterioration dependence in the simulated environment, and by formulating the cost model at the system level, DDMAC policies intrinsically consider the underlying system-effects. This is demonstrated through numerical experiments conducted for both a 9-out-of-10 system and a steel frame under fatigue deterioration. Results demonstrate that DDMAC policies offer substantial benefits when compared to state-of-the-art heuristic approaches. The inherent consideration of system-effects by DDMAC strategies is also interpreted based on the learned policies. ",

    "abstract": "With the fast adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques, sharing of ML models is becoming popular. However, ML models are vulnerable to privacy attacks that leak information about the training data. In this work, we focus on a particular type of privacy attacks named property inference attack (PIA) which infers the sensitive properties of the training data through the access to the target ML model. In particular, we consider Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as the target model, and distribution of particular groups of nodes and links in the training graph as the target property. While the existing work has investigated PIAs that target at graph-level properties, no prior works have studied the inference of node and link properties at group level yet. In this work, we perform the first systematic study of group property inference attacks (GPIA) against GNNs. First, we consider a taxonomy of threat models under both black-box and white-box settings with various types of adversary knowledge, and design six different attacks for these settings. We evaluate the effectiveness of these attacks through extensive experiments on three representative GNN models and three real-world graphs. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks whose accuracy outperforms the baseline approaches. Second, we analyze the underlying factors that contribute to GPIA's success, and show that the target model trained on the graphs with or without the target property represents some dissimilarity in model parameters and/or model outputs, which enables the adversary to infer the existence of the property. Further, we design a set of defense mechanisms against the GPIA attacks, and demonstrate that these mechanisms can reduce attack accuracy effectively with small loss on GNN model accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "The wide variety of in-distribution and out-of-distribution data in medical imaging makes universal anomaly detection a challenging task. Recently a number of self-supervised methods have been developed that train end-to-end models on healthy data augmented with synthetic anomalies. However, it is difficult to compare these methods as it is not clear whether gains in performance are from the task itself or the training pipeline around it. It is also difficult to assess whether a task generalises well for universal anomaly detection, as they are often only tested on a limited range of anomalies. To assist with this we have developed nnOOD, a framework that adapts nnU-Net to allow for comparison of self-supervised anomaly localisation methods. By isolating the synthetic, self-supervised task from the rest of the training process we perform a more faithful comparison of the tasks, whilst also making the workflow for evaluating over a given dataset quick and easy. Using this we have implemented the current state-of-the-art tasks and evaluated them on a challenging X-ray dataset. ",

To mitigate this risk, we develop an automatic system that correctly identifies pill-prescription from mobile images. Specifically, we define a so-called pill-prescription matching task, which attempts to match the images of the pills taken with the pills' names in the prescription. We then propose PIMA, a novel approach using Graph Neural Network (GNN) and contrastive learning to address the targeted problem. In particular, GNN is used to learn the spatial correlation between the text boxes in the prescription and thereby highlight the text boxes carrying the pill names. In addition, contrastive learning is employed to facilitate the modeling of cross-modal similarity between textual representations of pill names and visual representations of pill images. We conducted extensive experiments and demonstrated that PIMA outperforms baseline models on a real-world dataset of pill and prescription images that we constructed. Specifically, PIMA improves the accuracy from 19.09% to 46.95% compared to other baselines. We believe our work can open up new opportunities to build new clinical applications and improve medication safety and patient care. ",

The mathematical model is described by Navier-Stokes equation in the free flow domain $\\Omega_f$ and nonlinear convective Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer equations in porous subdomains $\\Omega_p$. It is well-known that numerical solutions of the problems in such heterogeneous domains require a very fine computational mesh that resolve inclusions on the grid level. The size alteration of the relevant system requires model reduction techniques. Here, we present a multiscale model reduction technique based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). We discuss construction of the multiscale basis functions for the velocity fields based on the solution of the local problems with and without oversampling strategy. Three test cases are considered for a given choice of the three key model parameters, namely, the Reynolds number ($Re$), the Forchheimer coefficient ($C$) and the Darcy number ($Da$). For the test runs, the Reynolds number values are taken to be $Re = 1, 10, 100$ while the Forchheimer coefficient and Darcy number are chosen as $C= 1, 10$ and $Da = 10^{-5}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-3}$, respectively. We numerically study the convergence of the method as we increase the number of multiscale basis functions in each domain, and observe good performance of the multiscale method. ",

Attackers can exploit these prediction mechanisms simultaneously in order to trigger leaks about speculatively-accessed data. Thus, sound reasoning about such speculative leaks requires accounting for all potential mechanisms of speculation. Unfortunately, existing formal models only support reasoning about fixed, hard-coded mechanisms of speculation, with no simple support to extend said reasoning to new mechanisms. In this paper we develop a framework for reasoning about composed speculative semantics that capture speculation due to different mechanisms and implement it as part of the Spectector verification tool. We implement novel semantics for speculating over store and return instructions and combine them with the semantics for speculating over branches. Our framework yields speculative semantics for speculating over any combination of those instructions that are secure by construction, i.e., we obtain these security guarantees for free. The implementation of our novel semantics in Spectector let us verify existing codebases that are vulnerable to Spectre v1, Spectre v4, and Spectre v5 vulnerabilities as well as new snippets that are only vulnerable to their compositions.

However, the method was developed for undirected graphs. Here we expand this methodology to weighted directed graphs and study the redundancy and robustness found in nine networks ranging from social, biomedical, and technical systems. We found that similarly to undirected graphs, directed graphs in general also contain a large amount of redundancy, as measured by the size of their (directed) distance backbone. Our methodology adds an additional tool to the principled sparsification of complex networks and the measure of their robustness. ",

However, NeRFs often fail for large, unbounded scenes that are captured under very sparse views with the scene content concentrated far away from the camera, as is typical for field robotics applications. In particular, NeRF-style algorithms perform poorly: (1) when there are insufficient views with little pose diversity, (2) when scenes contain saturation and shadows, and (3) when finely sampling large unbounded scenes with fine structures becomes computationally intensive. This paper proposes CLONeR, which significantly improves upon NeRF by allowing it to model large outdoor driving scenes that are observed from sparse input sensor views. This is achieved by decoupling occupancy and color learning within the NeRF framework into separate Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained using LiDAR and camera data, respectively. In addition, this paper proposes a novel method to build differentiable 3D Occupancy Grid Maps (OGM) alongside the NeRF model, and leverage this occupancy grid for improved sampling of points along a ray for volumetric rendering in metric space. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on scenes from the KITTI dataset, this paper demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF models on both novel view synthesis and dense depth prediction tasks when trained on sparse input data.

This paper aims to analyze this choice by investigating the overlooked role of outer optimization in AT. Our exploratory evaluations reveal that AT induces higher gradient norm and variance compared to NT. This phenomenon hinders the outer optimization in AT since the convergence rate of MSGD is highly dependent on the variance of the gradients. To this end, we propose an optimization method called ENGM which regularizes the contribution of each input example to the average mini-batch gradients. We prove that the convergence rate of ENGM is independent of the variance of the gradients, and thus, it is suitable for AT. We introduce a trick to reduce the computational cost of ENGM using empirical observations on the correlation between the norm of gradients w.r.t. the network parameters and input examples. Our extensive evaluations and ablation studies on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet demonstrate that ENGM and its variants consistently improve the performance of a wide range of AT methods. Furthermore, ENGM alleviates major shortcomings of AT including robust overfitting and high sensitivity to hyperparameter settings. ",

Due to the long-tail distribution of the relations in KGs, few-shot KG completion has been proposed as a solution to alleviate incompleteness and expand the coverage of KGs. It aims to make predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a few training triplets are provided as reference. Previous methods have mostly focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to learn entity-level information and/or imposing sequential dependency assumption at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However, valuable pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method (HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. By jointly capturing three levels of relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), HiRe can effectively learn and refine the meta representation of few-shot relations, and consequently generalize very well to new unseen relations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate the superiority of HiRe against other state-of-the-art methods. ",

Recent literature reveals that deep learning models, especially one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, are promising when dealing with digital signals from nuclear detectors. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the satisfactory accuracy and additional benefits of neural networks in this area. However, specific hardware accelerating such models for online operations still needs to be studied. In this work, we introduce PulseDL-II, a system-on-chip (SoC) specially designed for applications of event feature (time, energy, etc.) extraction from pulses with deep learning. Based on the previous version, PulseDL-II incorporates a RISC CPU into the system structure for better functional flexibility and integrity. The neural network accelerator in the SoC adopts a three-level (arithmetic unit, processing element, neural network) hierarchical architecture and facilitates parameter optimization of the digital design. Furthermore, we devise a quantization scheme and associated implementation methods (rescale & bit-shift) for full compatibility with deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow) within a selected subset of layer types. With the current scheme, the quantization-aware training of neural networks is supported, and network models are automatically transformed into software of RISC CPU by dedicated scripts, with nearly no loss of accuracy. We validate PulseDL-II on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). Finally, system validation is done with an experimental setup made up of a direct digital synthesis (DDS) signal generator and an FPGA development board with analog-to-digital converters (ADC). The proposed system achieved 60 ps time resolution and 0.40% energy resolution with online neural network inference at signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 47.4 dB. ",

Our model generalizes the popular DeGroot and Friedkin-Johnsen models by allowing vertices to have attributes that may influence the opinion dynamics. We start by establishing sufficient conditions for the existence of a stationary opinion distribution on any fixed graph, and then provide an increasingly detailed characterization of its behavior by considering a sequence of directed random graphs having a local weak limit. Our most explicit results are obtained for graph sequences whose local weak limit is a marked Galton-Watson tree, in which case our model can be used to explain a variety of phenomena, e.g., conditions under which consensus can be achieved, mechanisms in which opinions can become polarized, and the effect of disruptive stubborn agents on the formation of opinions.

    "abstract": "Standard views in two-dimensional echocardiography are well established but the quality of acquired images are highly dependent on operator skills and are assessed subjectively. This study is aimed at providing an objective assessment pipeline for echocardiogram image quality by defining a new set of domain-specific quality indicators. Consequently, image quality assessment can thus be automated to enhance clinical measurements, interpretation, and real-time optimization. We have developed deep neural networks for the automated assessment of echocardiographic frame which were randomly sampled from 11,262 adult patients. The private echocardiography dataset consists of 33,784 frames, previously acquired between 2010 and 2020. Deep learning approaches were used to extract the spatiotemporal features and the image quality indicators were evaluated against the mean absolute error. Our quality indicators encapsulate both anatomical and pathological elements to provide multivariate assessment scores for anatomical visibility, clarity, depth-gain and foreshortedness, respectively.

    "title": "A lightweight hybrid CNN-LSTM model for ECG-based arrhythmia detection",
    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most frequent and routine diagnostic tool used for monitoring heart electrical signals and evaluating its functionality. The human heart can suffer from a variety of diseases, including cardiac arrhythmias. Arrhythmia is an irregular heart rhythm that in severe cases can lead to heart stroke and can be diagnosed via ECG recordings. Since early detection of cardiac arrhythmias is of great importance, computerized and automated classification and identification of these abnormal heart signals have received much attention for the past decades. Methods: This paper introduces a light deep learning approach for high accuracy detection of 8 different cardiac arrhythmias and normal rhythm. To leverage deep learning method, resampling and baseline wander removal techniques are applied to ECG signals. In this study, 500 sample ECG segments were used as model inputs. The rhythm classification was done by an 11-layer network in an end-to-end manner without the need for hand-crafted manual feature extraction. Results: In order to evaluate the proposed technique, ECG signals are chosen from the two physionet databases, the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and the long-term AF database. The proposed deep learning framework based on the combination of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) showed promising results than most of the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method reaches the mean diagnostic accuracy of 98.24%. Conclusion: A trained model for arrhythmia classification using diverse ECG signals were successfully developed and tested. Significance: Since the present work uses a light classification technique with high diagnostic accuracy compared to other notable methods, it could successfully be implemented in holter monitor devices for arrhythmia detection.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning solution for human activity recognition with smartphone accelerometer data. We aim to develop a model that learns strong representations from accelerometer signals, in order to perform robust human activity classification, while reducing the model's reliance on class labels. Specifically, we intend to enable cross-dataset transfer learning such that our network pre-trained on a particular dataset can perform effective activity classification on other datasets (successive to a small amount of fine-tuning). To tackle this problem, we design our solution with the intention of learning as much information from the accelerometer signals as possible. As a result, we design two separate pipelines, one that learns the data in time-frequency domain, and the other in time-domain alone. In order to address the issues mentioned above in regards to cross-dataset transfer learning, we use self-supervised contrastive learning to train each of these streams. Next, each stream is fine-tuned for final classification, and eventually the two are fused to provide the final results. We evaluate the performance of the proposed solution on three datasets, namely MotionSense, HAPT, and HHAR, and demonstrate that our solution outperforms prior works in this field. We further evaluate the performance of the method in learning generalized features, by using MobiAct dataset for pre-training and the remaining three datasets for the downstream classification task, and show that the proposed solution achieves better performance in comparison with other self-supervised methods in cross-dataset transfer learning.

    "abstract": "We study the computational complexity of multi-stage robust optimization problems. Such multi-stage problems are formulated with alternating min/max quantifiers and therefore naturally fall into higher stage of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite this, almost no hardness result with respect to the polynomial hierarchy are known for robust multi-stage problems. In this work, we examine the hardness of robust two-stage adjustable and robust recoverable optimization with budgeted uncertainty sets. Our main technical contribution is the introduction of a technique tailored to prove $\\Sigma^p_3$-hardness of such problems. We highlight a difference between continuous and discrete budgeted uncertainty: In the discrete case, indeed a wide range of problems becomes complete for the third stage of the polynomial hierarchy. We highlight the TSP, independent set, and vertex cover problems as examples of this behavior. However, in the continuous case this does not happen and all problems remain in the first stage of the hierarchy. Finally, if we allow the uncertainty to not only affect the objective, but also multiple constraints, then this distinction disappears and even in the continuous case we encounter hardness for the third stage of the hierarchy. This shows that even robust problems which are already NP-complete can still exhibit a significant computational difference between column-wise and row-wise uncertainty. ",

    "abstract": "Climate change increases the number of extreme weather events (wind and snowstorms, heavy rains, wildfires) that compromise power system reliability and lead to multiple equipment failures. Real-time and accurate detecting of potential line failures is the first step to mitigating the extreme weather impact and activating emergency controls. Power balance equations nonlinearity, increased uncertainty in generation during extreme events, and lack of grid observability compromise the efficiency of traditional data-driven failure detection methods. At the same time, modern problem-oblivious machine learning methods based on neural networks require a large amount of data to detect an accident, especially in a time-changing environment. This paper proposes a Physics-InformEd Line failure Detector (FIELD) that leverages grid topology information to reduce sample and time complexities and improve localization accuracy. Finally, we illustrate the superior empirical performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods over various test cases. ",

    "abstract": "Hail risk assessment is necessary to estimate and reduce damage to crops, orchards, and infrastructure. Also, it helps to estimate and reduce consequent losses for businesses and, particularly, insurance companies. But hail forecasting is challenging. Data used for designing models for this purpose are tree-dimensional geospatial time series. Hail is a very local event with respect to the resolution of available datasets. Also, hail events are rare - only 1% of targets in observations are marked as \"hail\". Models for nowcasting and short-term hail forecasts are improving. Introducing machine learning models to the meteorology field is not new. There are also various climate models reflecting possible scenarios of climate change in the future. But there are no machine learning models for data-driven forecasting of changes in hail frequency for a given area. The first possible approach for the latter task is to ignore spatial and temporal structure and develop a model capable of classifying a given vertical profile of meteorological variables as favorable to hail formation or not. Although such an approach certainly neglects important information, it is very light weighted and easily scalable because it treats observations as independent from each other. The more advanced approach is to design a neural network capable to process geospatial data. Our idea here is to combine convolutional layers responsible for the processing of spatial data with recurrent neural network blocks capable to work with temporal structure. This study compares two approaches and introduces a model suitable for the task of forecasting changes in hail frequency for ongoing decades. ",
