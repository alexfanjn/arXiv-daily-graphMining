    "abstract": "Text information including extensive prior knowledge about land cover classes has been ignored in hyperspectral image classification (HSI) tasks. It is necessary to explore the effectiveness of linguistic mode in assisting HSI classification. In addition, the large-scale pre-training image-text foundation models have demonstrated great performance in a variety of downstream applications, including zero-shot transfer. However, most domain generalization methods have never addressed mining linguistic modal knowledge to improve the generalization performance of model. To compensate for the inadequacies listed above, a Language-aware Domain Generalization Network (LDGnet) is proposed to learn cross-domain invariant representation from cross-domain shared prior knowledge. The proposed method only trains on the source domain (SD) and then transfers the model to the target domain (TD). The dual-stream architecture including image encoder and text encoder is used to extract visual and linguistic features, in which coarse-grained and fine-grained text representations are designed to extract two levels of linguistic features. Furthermore, linguistic features are used as cross-domain shared semantic space, and visual-linguistic alignment is completed by supervised contrastive learning in semantic space. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method when compared with state-of-the-art techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Modern technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming increasingly important in various domains, including Business Process Management (BPM) research. One main research area in BPM is process mining, which can be used to analyze event logs, e.g., for checking the conformance of running processes. However, there are only a few IoT-based event logs available for research purposes. Some of them are artificially generated and the problem occurs that they do not always completely reflect the actual physical properties of smart environments. In this paper, we present an IoT-enriched XES event log that is generated by a physical smart factory. For this purpose, we create the SensorStream XES extension for representing IoT-data in event logs. Finally, we present some preliminary analysis and properties of the log. ",

    "abstract": "Several techniques have recently aimed to improve the performance of deep learning models for Scene Graph Generation (SGG) by incorporating background knowledge. State-of-the-art techniques can be divided into two families: one where the background knowledge is incorporated into the model in a subsymbolic fashion, and another in which the background knowledge is maintained in symbolic form. Despite promising results, both families of techniques face several shortcomings: the first one requires ad-hoc, more complex neural architectures increasing the training or inference cost; the second one suffers from limited scalability w.r.t. the size of the background knowledge. Our work introduces a regularization technique for injecting symbolic background knowledge into neural SGG models that overcomes the limitations of prior art. Our technique is model-agnostic, does not incur any cost at inference time, and scales to previously unmanageable background knowledge sizes. We demonstrate that our technique can improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art SGG models, by up to 33%. ",

    "title": "Change Detection for Local Explainability in Evolving Data Streams",
    "abstract": "As complex machine learning models are increasingly used in sensitive applications like banking, trading or credit scoring, there is a growing demand for reliable explanation mechanisms. Local feature attribution methods have become a popular technique for post-hoc and model-agnostic explanations. However, attribution methods typically assume a stationary environment in which the predictive model has been trained and remains stable. As a result, it is often unclear how local attributions behave in realistic, constantly evolving settings such as streaming and online applications. In this paper, we discuss the impact of temporal change on local feature attributions. In particular, we show that local attributions can become obsolete each time the predictive model is updated or concept drift alters the data generating distribution. Consequently, local feature attributions in data streams provide high explanatory power only when combined with a mechanism that allows us to detect and respond to local changes over time. To this end, we present CDLEEDS, a flexible and model-agnostic framework for detecting local change and concept drift. CDLEEDS serves as an intuitive extension of attribution-based explanation techniques to identify outdated local attributions and enable more targeted recalculations. In experiments, we also show that the proposed framework can reliably detect both local and global concept drift. Accordingly, our work contributes to a more meaningful and robust explainability in online machine learning. ",

Unfortunately, there does not exist any DSD dataset that reflects both the clinical insights and the distribution of depression symptoms from the samples of self-disclosed depressed population. In our work, we describe an Active Learning (AL) framework which uses an initial supervised learning model that leverages 1) a state-of-the-art large mental health forum text pre-trained language model further fine-tuned on a clinician annotated DSD dataset, 2) a Zero-Shot learning model for DSD, and couples them together to harvest depression symptoms related samples from our large self-curated Depression Tweets Repository (DTR). Our clinician annotated dataset is the largest of its kind. Furthermore, DTR is created from the samples of tweets in self-disclosed depressed users Twitter timeline from two datasets, including one of the largest benchmark datasets for user-level depression detection from Twitter. This further helps preserve the depression symptoms distribution of self-disclosed Twitter users tweets. Subsequently, we iteratively retrain our initial DSD model with the harvested data. We discuss the stopping criteria and limitations of this AL process, and elaborate the underlying constructs which play a vital role in the overall AL process. We show that we can produce a final dataset which is the largest of its kind. Furthermore, a DSD and a Depression Post Detection (DPD) model trained on it achieves significantly better accuracy than their initial version. ",

As DNN models are generally highly proprietary, the neural network architectures become valuable targets for attacks. In IMC systems, since the whole model is mapped on chip and weight memory read can be restricted, the system acts as a \"black box\" for customers. However, the localized and stationary weight and data patterns may subject IMC systems to other attacks. In this paper, we propose a side-channel attack methodology on IMC architectures. We show that it is possible to extract model architectural information from power trace measurements without any prior knowledge of the neural network. We first developed a simulation framework that can emulate the dynamic power traces of the IMC macros. We then performed side-channel attacks to extract information such as the stored layer type, layer sequence, output channel/feature size and convolution kernel size from power traces of the IMC macros. Based on the extracted information, full networks can potentially be reconstructed without any knowledge of the neural network. Finally, we discuss potential countermeasures for building IMC systems that offer resistance to these model extraction attack. ",

In a context where the goal of precision agriculture is to minimize or even avoid the use of pesticides, weather and remote sensing data with deep learning can play a pivotal role in detecting crop diseases, allowing localized treatment of crops. However, combining heterogeneous data such as weather and images remains a hot topic and challenging task. Recent developments in transformer architectures have shown the possibility of fusion of data from different domains, for instance text-image. The current trend is to custom only one transformer to create a multimodal fusion model. Conversely, we propose a new approach to realize data fusion using three transformers. In this paper, we first solved the missing satellite images problem, by interpolating them with a ConvLSTM model. Then, proposed a multimodal fusion architecture that jointly learns to process visual and weather information. The architecture is built from three main components, a Vision Transformer and two transformer-encoders, allowing to fuse both image and weather modalities. The results of the proposed method are promising achieving 97\\% overall accuracy. ",

Accurate detection and localization of such attacks is of critical importance in limiting the damage. To this end, the paper proposes a novel technique using capsule networks (CNs) tailored to the power grid security application that uses the frequency and phase angle data monitored by phasor measurement units (PMUs). With the benefit of vector output from capsules and dynamic routing agreements between them, CNs can obtain accurate detection and localization performance. To demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested technique, we compare the developed CN with benchmark data-driven methodologies, including two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D-CNN), one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN), deep multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), and support vector machines (SVM). Simulations are performed on IEEE 14-, 39-, and 57-bus systems, considering various real-world issues such as PMU delays, noisy data, and missing data points. The results show that CNs significantly outperform other techniques, thus making them suitable for the aforementioned cyber security applications. ",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, an increasing number of users have started reporting Adverse Drug Events (ADE) on social media platforms, blogs, and health forums. Given the large volume of reports, pharmacovigilance has focused on ways to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to rapidly examine these large collections of text, detecting mentions of drug-related adverse reactions to trigger medical investigations. However, despite the growing interest in the task and the advances in NLP, the robustness of these models in face of linguistic phenomena such as negations and speculations is an open research question. Negations and speculations are pervasive phenomena in natural language, and can severely hamper the ability of an automated system to discriminate between factual and nonfactual statements in text. In this paper we take into consideration four state-of-the-art systems for ADE detection on social media texts. We introduce SNAX, a benchmark to test their performance against samples containing negated and speculated ADEs, showing their fragility against these phenomena. We then introduce two possible strategies to increase the robustness of these models, showing that both of them bring significant increases in performance, lowering the number of spurious entities predicted by the models by 60% for negation and 80% for speculations.

Distortions or perturbations on color space of input images generates out-of-distribution data, which make networks more likely to misclassify them.

The aim of our work is to study the impact of color variation on the performance of DNNs. We perform experiments on several state-of-the-art DNN architectures on the proposed dataset, and the result shows a significant correlation between color variation and loss of accuracy. Furthermore, based on the ResNet50 architecture, we demonstrate some experiments of the performance of recently proposed robust training techniques and strategies, such as Augmix, revisit, and free normalizer, on our proposed dataset.

Hence, the current Internet must cope with some limitations, including performance degradation, availability of IP addresses, and multiple security and privacy issues. Nevertheless, to unsettle the current Internet's network layer i.e., Internet Protocol with ICN is a challenging, expensive task. It also requires worldwide coordination among Internet Service Providers , backbone, and Autonomous Services. Additionally, history showed that technology changes e.g., from 3G to 4G, from IPv4 to IPv6 are not immediate, and usually, the replacement includes a long coexistence period between the old and new technology. Similarly, we believe that the process of replacement of the current Internet will surely transition through the coexistence of IP and ICN. Although the tremendous amount of security and privacy issues of the current Internet taught us the importance of securely designing the architectures, only a few of the proposed architectures place the security-by-design. Therefore, this article aims to provide the first comprehensive Security and Privacy analysis of the state-of-the-art coexistence architectures. Additionally, it yields a horizontal comparison of security and privacy among three deployment approaches of IP and ICN protocol i.e., overlay, underlay, and hybrid and a vertical comparison among ten considered security and privacy features. As a result of our analysis, emerges that most of the architectures utterly fail to provide several SP features including data and traffic flow confidentiality, availability and communication anonymity. We believe this article draws a picture of the secure combination of current and future protocol stacks during the coexistence phase that the Internet will definitely walk across. ",

Second, we present regression models that automatically characterize sensemaking activity within individual notebooks by assigning them a score representing their position within the sensemaking spectrum.

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) compression is crucial to deploying these models in edge devices with limited resources. Existing channel pruning algorithms for CNNs have achieved plenty of success on complex models. They approach the pruning problem from various perspectives and use different metrics to guide the pruning process. However, these metrics mainly focus on the model's `outputs' or `weights' and neglect its `interpretations' information. To fill in this gap, we propose to address the channel pruning problem from a novel perspective by leveraging the interpretations of a model to steer the pruning process, thereby utilizing information from both inputs and outputs of the model. However, existing interpretation methods cannot get deployed to achieve our goal as either they are inefficient for pruning or may predict non-coherent explanations. We tackle this challenge by introducing a selector model that predicts real-time smooth saliency masks for pruned models. We parameterize the distribution of explanatory masks by Radial Basis Function (RBF)-like functions to incorporate geometric prior of natural images in our selector model's inductive bias. Thus, we can obtain compact representations of explanations to reduce the computational costs of our pruning method. We leverage our selector model to steer the network pruning by maximizing the similarity of explanatory representations for the pruned and original models. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.

    "abstract": "Recent neuroimaging studies that focus on predicting brain disorders via modern machine learning approaches commonly include a single modality and rely on supervised over-parameterized models.However, a single modality provides only a limited view of the highly complex brain. Critically, supervised models in clinical settings lack accurate diagnostic labels for training. Coarse labels do not capture the long-tailed spectrum of brain disorder phenotypes, which leads to a loss of generalizability of the model that makes them less useful in diagnostic settings. This work presents a novel multi-scale coordinated framework for learning multiple representations from multimodal neuroimaging data. We propose a general taxonomy of informative inductive biases to capture unique and joint information in multimodal self-supervised fusion. The taxonomy forms a family of decoder-free models with reduced computational complexity and a propensity to capture multi-scale relationships between local and global representations of the multimodal inputs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the taxonomy using functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data across a spectrum of Alzheimer's disease phenotypes and show that self-supervised models reveal disorder-relevant brain regions and multimodal links without access to the labels during pre-training. The proposed multimodal self-supervised learning yields representations with improved classification performance for both modalities. The concomitant rich and flexible unsupervised deep learning framework captures complex multimodal relationships and provides predictive performance that meets or exceeds that of a more narrow supervised classification analysis. We present elaborate quantitative evidence of how this framework can significantly advance our search for missing links in complex brain disorders. ",

    "abstract": "Panoptic segmentation combines the advantages of semantic and instance segmentation, which can provide both pixel-level and instance-level environmental perception information for intelligent vehicles. However, it is challenged with segmenting objects of various scales, especially on extremely large and small ones. In this work, we propose two lightweight modules to mitigate this problem. First, Pixel-relation Block is designed to model global context information for large-scale things, which is based on a query-independent formulation and brings small parameter increments. Then, Convectional Network is constructed to collect extra high-resolution information for small-scale stuff, supplying more appropriate semantic features for the downstream segmentation branches. Based on these two modules, we present an end-to-end Scale-aware Unified Network (SUNet), which is more adaptable to multi-scale objects. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and COCO demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. ",

    "abstract": "Arbitrary-oriented object detection (AOOD) plays a significant role for image understanding in remote sensing scenarios. The existing AOOD methods face the challenges of ambiguity and high costs in angle representation. To this end, a multi-grained angle representation (MGAR) method, consisting of coarse-grained angle classification (CAC) and fine-grained angle regression (FAR), is proposed. Specifically, the designed CAC avoids the ambiguity of angle prediction by discrete angular encoding (DAE) and reduces complexity by coarsening the granularity of DAE. Based on CAC, FAR is developed to refine the angle prediction with much lower costs than narrowing the granularity of DAE. Furthermore, an Intersection over Union (IoU) aware FAR-Loss (IFL) is designed to improve accuracy of angle prediction using an adaptive re-weighting mechanism guided by IoU. Extensive experiments are performed on several public remote sensing datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MGAR. Moreover, experiments on embedded devices demonstrate that the proposed MGAR is also friendly for lightweight deployments. ",

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection aims to find the events in a video that do not conform to the expected behavior. The prevalent methods mainly detect anomalies by snippet reconstruction or future frame prediction error. However, the error is highly dependent on the local context of the current snippet and lacks the understanding of normality. To address this issue, we propose to detect anomalous events not only by the local context, but also according to the consistency between the testing event and the knowledge about normality from the training data. Concretely, we propose a novel two-stream framework based on context recovery and knowledge retrieval, where the two streams can complement each other. For the context recovery stream, we propose a spatiotemporal U-Net which can fully utilize the motion information to predict the future frame. Furthermore, we propose a maximum local error mechanism to alleviate the problem of large recovery errors caused by complex foreground objects. For the knowledge retrieval stream, we propose an improved learnable locality-sensitive hashing, which optimizes hash functions via a Siamese network and a mutual difference loss. The knowledge about normality is encoded and stored in hash tables, and the distance between the testing event and the knowledge representation is used to reveal the probability of anomaly. Finally, we fuse the anomaly scores from the two streams to detect anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and complementarity of the two streams, whereby the proposed two-stream framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets. ",

For graph data, current backdoor attack focus on manipulating the graph structure to inject the trigger. We find that there are apparent differences between benign samples and malicious samples in some explanatory evaluation metrics, such as fidelity and infidelity. After identifying the malicious sample, the explainability of the GNN model can help us capture the most significant subgraph which is probably the trigger in a trojan graph. We use various dataset and different attack settings to prove the effectiveness of our defense method. The attack success rate all turns out to decrease considerably. ",

To the best of our knowledge, existing studies mainly focus on network alignment at the individual user level, requiring abundant common information between shared individual users. For the networks that cannot meet such requirements, social community structures actually provide complementary and critical information at a slightly coarse-grained level, alignment of which will provide additional information for user alignment. In turn, user alignment also reveals more clues for community alignment. Hence, in this paper, we introduce the problem of joint social network alignment, which aims to align users and communities across social networks simultaneously. Key challenges lie in that 1) how to learn the representations of both users and communities, and 2) how to make user alignment and community alignment benefit from each other. To address these challenges, we first elaborate on the characteristics of real-world networks with the notion of delta-hyperbolicity, and show the superiority of hyperbolic space for representing social networks. Then, we present a novel hyperbolic embedding approach for the joint social network alignment, referred to as PERFECT, in a unified optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of PERFECT in both user alignment and community alignment. ",

We propose a new model to measure the engagement of users with topics discussed on social media based on interactions with social media posts. This model overcomes the limitations of previous volume and sentiment based approaches. We use this model to estimate engagement coefficients for 48 cryptocurrencies created between 2019 and 2021 using data from Twitter from the first month of the cryptocurrencies' existence. We find that the future returns of the cryptocurrencies are dependent on the engagement coefficients. Cryptocurrencies whose engagement coefficients are too low or too high have lower returns. Low engagement coefficients signal a lack of interest, while high engagement coefficients signal artificial activity which is likely from automated accounts known as bots. We measure the amount of bot posts for the cryptocurrencies and find that generally, cryptocurrencies with more bot posts have lower future returns. While future returns are dependent on both the bot activity and engagement coefficient, the dependence is strongest for the engagement coefficient, especially for short-term returns. We show that simple investment strategies which select cryptocurrencies with engagement coefficients exceeding a fixed threshold perform well for holding times of a few months. ",

The two experimental design methods work as a source of the training and the validation locations which is fitted using a spatiotemporal Gaussian process (STGP). The STGP is fitted using the training set to predict for the current validation set generated using GPLMK, and the sensor with the largest prediction absolute error is selected from the current validation set and added to the selected sensors. Next, a new validation set is generated and predicted using the current training set. The process continues until selecting a specific number of sensor locations. The study is conducted on a dataset of body surface potential mapping (BSPM) of 352 electrodes of four human subjects. A number of 30 sensor locations is selected using the proposed algorithm. The selected sensor locations achieved average $R^2 = 94.40 \\%$ for estimating the whole-body QRS segment.

What's more, directly accelerating traditional sampling algorithms will make the structure of the accelerator very complicated. In this work, we made two contributions: (1) Proposed a new neighbor sampler: CONCAT Sampler, which can be easily accelerated on hardware level while guaranteeing the test accuracy.

Most existing graph pooling approaches formulate the problem as a node clustering task which effectively captures the graph topology. Conventional methods ask users to specify an appropriate number of clusters as a hyperparameter, then assume that all input graphs share the same number of clusters. In inductive settings where the number of clusters can vary, however, the model should be able to represent this variation in its pooling layers in order to learn suitable clusters. Thus we propose GMPool, a novel differentiable graph pooling architecture that automatically determines the appropriate number of clusters based on the input data. The main intuition involves a grouping matrix defined as a quadratic form of the pooling operator, which induces use of binary classification probabilities of pairwise combinations of nodes. GMPool obtains the pooling operator by first computing the grouping matrix, then decomposing it. Extensive evaluations on molecular property prediction tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional methods. ",

This work must involve both software developers that understand the code and the organisation's data protection officer or legal department that understands privacy and the requirements of a Data Protection and Impact Assessment (DPIA). To help developers and non-technical people such as lawyers document the privacy and data protection behaviour of software, we have developed an automatic software analysis technique. This technique is based on static program analysis to characterise the flow of privacy-related data. The results of the analysis can be presented as a graph of privacy flows and operations -- that is understandable also for non-technical people. We argue that our technique facilitates collaboration between technical and non-technical people in documenting the privacy behaviour of the software. We explain how to use the results produced by our technique to answer a series of privacy-relevant questions needed for a DPIA. To illustrate our work, we show both detailed and abstract analysis results from applying our analysis technique to the secure messaging service Signal and to the client of the cloud service NextCloud and show how their privacy flow-graphs inform the writing of a DPIA.

Thus, state-of-the-art frameworks for monocular 360 depth estimation such as bi-projection fusion in BiFuse are proposed. To train such a framework, a large number of panoramas along with the corresponding depth ground truths captured by laser sensors are required, which highly increases the cost of data collection. Moreover, since such a data collection procedure is time-consuming, the scalability of extending these methods to different scenes becomes a challenge. To this end, self-training a network for monocular depth estimation from 360 videos is one way to alleviate this issue. However, there are no existing frameworks that incorporate bi-projection fusion into the self-training scheme, which highly limits the self-supervised performance since bi-projection fusion can leverage information from different projection types. In this paper, we propose BiFuse++ to explore the combination of bi-projection fusion and the self-training scenario. To be specific, we propose a new fusion module and Contrast-Aware Photometric Loss to improve the performance of BiFuse and increase the stability of self-training on real-world videos. We conduct both supervised and self-supervised experiments on benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance. ",

In this paper, we focus on a new weakly-supervised SOD task under hybrid labels, where the supervision labels include a large number of coarse labels generated by the traditional unsupervised method and a small number of real labels. To address the issues of label noise and quantity imbalance in this task, we design a new pipeline framework with three sophisticated training strategies. In terms of model framework, we decouple the task into label refinement sub-task and salient object detection sub-task, which cooperate with each other and train alternately. Specifically, the R-Net is designed as a two-stream encoder-decoder model equipped with Blender with Guidance and Aggregation Mechanisms (BGA), aiming to rectify the coarse labels for more reliable pseudo-labels, while the S-Net is a replaceable SOD network supervised by the pseudo labels generated by the current R-Net. Note that, we only need to use the trained S-Net for testing. Moreover, in order to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of network training, we design three training strategies, including alternate iteration mechanism, group-wise incremental mechanism, and credibility verification mechanism. Experiments on five SOD benchmarks show that our method achieves competitive performance against weakly-supervised/unsupervised methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. ",

However, building an effective text normalization solution for a real-world TTS system face two main challenges: (1) the semantic ambiguity of non-standard words (NSWs), e.g., numbers, dates, ranges, scores, abbreviations, and (2) transforming NSWs into pronounceable syllables, such as URL, email address, hashtag, and contact name. In this paper, we propose a new two-phase normalization approach to deal with these challenges. First, a model-based tagger is designed to detect NSWs. Then, depending on NSW types, a rule-based normalizer expands those NSWs into their final verbal forms. We conducted three empirical experiments for NSW detection using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), BiLSTM-CNN-CRF, and BERT-BiGRU-CRF models on a manually annotated dataset including 5819 sentences extracted from Vietnamese news articles. In the second phase, we propose a forward lexicon-based maximum matching algorithm to split down the hashtag, email, URL, and contact name. The experimental results of the tagging phase show that the average F1 scores of the BiLSTM-CNN-CRF and CRF models are above 90.00%, reaching the highest F1 of 95.00% with the BERT-BiGRU-CRF model. Overall, our approach has low sentence error rates, at 8.15% with CRF and 7.11% with BiLSTM-CNN-CRF taggers, and only 6.67% with BERT-BiGRU-CRF tagger. ",

PINNs approximate the PDE solution by minimizing physics-based loss functions over a given domain. Despite substantial progress in the application of PINNs to a range of problem classes, investigation of error estimation and convergence properties of PINNs, which is important for establishing the rationale behind their good empirical performance, has been lacking. This paper presents convergence analysis and error estimates of PINNs for a multi-physics problem of thermally coupled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Through a model problem of Beltrami flow it is shown that a small training error implies a small generalization error. \\textit{Posteriori} convergence rates of total error with respect to the training residual and collocation points are presented. This is of practical significance in determining appropriate number of training parameters and training residual thresholds to get good PINNs prediction of thermally coupled steady state laminar flows. These convergence rates are then generalized to different spatial geometries as well as to different flow parameters that lie in the laminar regime. A pressure stabilization term in the form of pressure Poisson equation is added to the PDE residuals for PINNs. This physics informed augmentation is shown to improve accuracy of the pressure field by an order of magnitude as compared to the case without augmentation. Results from PINNs are compared to the ones obtained from stabilized finite element method and good properties of PINNs are highlighted. ",

    "abstract": "Semantic Web technology has successfully facilitated many RDF models with rich data representation methods. It also has the potential ability to represent and store multimodal knowledge bases such as multimodal scene graphs. However, most existing query languages, especially SPARQL, barely explore the implicit multimodal relationships like semantic similarity, spatial relations, etc. We first explored this issue by organizing a large-scale scene graph dataset, namely Visual Genome, in the RDF graph database. Based on the proposed RDF-stored multimodal scene graph, we extended SPARQL queries to answer questions containing relational reasoning about color, spatial, etc. Further demo (i.e., VGStore) shows the effectiveness of customized queries and displaying multimodal data.

To objectively verify the property of transferability, the robustness of models is evaluated by using a benchmark attack method, called AutoAttack.

    "abstract": "Few-shot visual recognition refers to recognize novel visual concepts from a few labeled instances. Many few-shot visual recognition methods adopt the metric-based meta-learning paradigm by comparing the query representation with class representations to predict the category of query instance. However, current metric-based methods generally treat all instances equally and consequently often obtain biased class representation, considering not all instances are equally significant when summarizing the instance-level representations for the class-level representation. For example, some instances may contain unrepresentative information, such as too much background and information of unrelated concepts, which skew the results. To address the above issues, we propose a novel metric-based meta-learning framework termed instance-adaptive class representation learning network (ICRL-Net) for few-shot visual recognition. Specifically, we develop an adaptive instance revaluing network with the capability to address the biased representation issue when generating the class representation, by learning and assigning adaptive weights for different instances according to their relative significance in the support set of corresponding class. Additionally, we design an improved bilinear instance representation and incorporate two novel structural losses, i.e., intra-class instance clustering loss and inter-class representation distinguishing loss, to further regulate the instance revaluation process and refine the class representation. We conduct extensive experiments on four commonly adopted few-shot benchmarks: miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and FC100 datasets. The experimental results compared with the state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the superiority of our ICRL-Net. ",

Building accurate prediction models requires knowledge from many organizations; alas, this entails disclosing sensitive information, such as network structures, security postures, and policies, which might often be undesirable or outright impossible. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Federated Learning (FL) to predict future security events. To this end, we introduce Cerberus, a system enabling collaborative training of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models for participating organizations. The intuition is that FL could potentially offer a middle-ground between the non-private approach where the training data is pooled at a central server and the low-utility alternative of only training local models. We instantiate Cerberus on a dataset obtained from a major security company's intrusion prevention product and evaluate it vis-a-vis utility, robustness, and privacy, as well as how participants contribute to and benefit from the system. Overall, our work sheds light on both the positive aspects and the challenges of using FL for this task and paves the way for deploying federated approaches to predictive security. ",

After the advent of big data, as data gets generated at a brisk pace, it is imperative to analyze it as soon as it is generated owing to the fact that the nature of the data may change dramatically in short time intervals. This is necessitated by the fact that big data is all pervasive and throws computational challenges for data scientists. Therefore, in this paper, we built an efficient Scalable, Parallelized Wavelet Neural Network (SPWNN) which employs the parallel stochastic gradient algorithm (SGD) algorithm. SPWNN is designed and developed under both static and streaming environments in the horizontal parallelization framework. SPWNN is implemented by using Morlet and Gaussian functions as activation functions. This study is conducted on big datasets like gas sensor data which has more than 4 million samples and medical research data which has more than 10,000 features, which are high dimensional in nature. The experimental analysis indicates that in the static environment, SPWNN with Morlet activation function outperformed SPWNN with Gaussian on the classification datasets. However, in the case of regression, the opposite was observed. In contrast, in the streaming environment i.e., Gaussian outperformed Morlet on the classification and Morlet outperformed Gaussian on the regression datasets. Overall, the proposed SPWNN architecture achieved a speedup of 1.32-1.40. ",

While this dramatic shock has heavily impacted human interaction rules, novel localization techniques are emerging to help society in complying with new policies, such as social distancing. Wireless sensing and machine learning are well suited to alleviate viruses propagation in a privacy-preserving manner. However, its wide deployment requires cost-effective installation and operational solutions. In public environments, individual localization information-such as social distancing-needs to be monitored to avoid safety threats when not properly observed. To this end, the high penetration of wireless devices can be exploited to continuously analyze-and-learn the propagation environment, thereby passively detecting breaches and triggering alerts if required. In this paper, we describe a novel passive and privacy-preserving human localization solution that relies on the directive transmission properties of mmWave communications to monitor social distancing and notify people in the area in case of violations. Thus, addressing the social distancing challenge in a privacy-preserving and cost-efficient manner. Our solution provides an overall accuracy of about 99% in the tested scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Fusing LiDAR and camera information is essential for achieving accurate and reliable 3D object detection in autonomous driving systems. However, this is challenging due to the difficulty of combining multi-granularity geometric and semantic features from two drastically different modalities. Recent approaches aim at exploring the semantic densities of camera features through lifting points in 2D camera images (referred to as seeds) into 3D space for fusion, and they can be roughly divided into 1) early fusion of raw points that aims at augmenting the 3D point cloud at the early input stage, and 2) late fusion of BEV (bird-eye view) maps that merges LiDAR and camera BEV features before the detection head. While both have their merits in enhancing the representation power of the combined features, this single-level fusion strategy is a suboptimal solution to the aforementioned challenge. Their major drawbacks are the inability to interact the multi-granularity semantic features from two distinct modalities sufficiently. To this end, we propose a novel framework that focuses on the multi-scale progressive interaction of the multi-granularity LiDAR and camera features. Our proposed method, abbreviated as MDMSFusion, achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D object detection, with 69.1 mAP and 71.8 NDS on nuScenes validation set, and 70.8 mAP and 73.2 NDS on nuScenes test set, which rank 1st and 2nd respectively among single-model non-ensemble approaches by the time of submission.

With the current increasing density of seismic data collection, the efficiency of manual picking has been unable to meet the actual needs. Therefore, automatic picking methods have been greatly developed in recent decades, especially those based on deep learning. However, few of the current supervised deep learning-based method can avoid the dependence on labeled samples. Besides, since the gather data is a set of signals which are greatly different from the natural images, it is difficult for the current method to solve the FAT picking problem in case of a low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). In this paper, for hard rock seismic gather data, we propose a Multi-Stage Segmentation Pickup Network (MSSPN), which solves the generalization problem across worksites and the picking problem in the case of low SNR. In MSSPN, there are four sub-models to simulate the manually picking processing, which is assumed to four stages from coarse to fine. Experiments on seven field datasets with different qualities show that our MSSPN outperforms benchmarks by a large margin.Particularly, our method can achieve more than 90\\% accurate picking across worksites in the case of medium and high SNRs, and even fine-tuned model can achieve 88\\% accurate picking of the dataset with low SNR.

Our findings reveal that considering the size of the enormous graphs, our time-dependent queries execute efficiently.

Surprisingly, when we focus on the real-world applicable constraint of $\\leq 1\\%$ false positive rate (FPR), prior methods fail to reliably detect OOD samples as such.

We demonstrate this method improves OOD detection performance on standard data (i.e., not adversarially crafted), and improves the standardized partial AUC from near-random guessing performance to $\\geq 0.75$.

    "abstract": "The spread of COVID-19 leads to the global shutdown of many corporate offices, and encourages companies to open more opportunities that allow employees to work from a remote location. As the workplace type expands from onsite offices to remote areas, an emerging challenge for an online hiring marketplace is how these remote opportunities and user intentions to work remotely can be modeled and matched without prior information. Despite the unprecedented amount of remote jobs posted amid COVID-19, there is no existing approach that can be directly applied. Introducing a brand new workplace type naturally leads to the cold-start problem, which is particularly more common for less active job seekers. It is challenging, if not impossible, to onboard a new workplace type for any predictive model if existing information sources can provide little information related to a new category of jobs, including data from resumes and job descriptions. Hence, in this work, we aim to propose a principled approach that jointly models the remoteness of job seekers and job opportunities with limited information, which also suffices the needs of web-scale applications. Existing research on the emerging type of remote workplace mainly focuses on qualitative studies, and classic predictive modeling approaches are inapplicable considering the problem of cold-start and information scarcity. We precisely try to close this gap with a novel graph neural architecture. Extensive experiments on large-scale data from real-world applications have been conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed approach over competitive baselines. The improvement may translate to more rapid onboarding of the new workplace type that can benefit job seekers who are interested in working remotely. ",

To adapt convolutional PINN to different equations, researchers have to spend much time tuning critical hyperparameters. Furthermore, the effects of finite difference accuracy, model complexity, and mesh resolution on the prediction result of convolutional PINN are unclear. To fill the above research gaps, in this paper, (1) A Multi-Receptive-Field PINN (MRF-PINN) model is constructed to adapt different equation types and mesh resolutions without manual tuning.(2) The generality and advantages of the MRF-PINN are verified in three typical linear PDEs (elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic) and nonlinear PDEs (Navier-Stokes equations). (3) The contribution of each receptive field to the final MRF-PINN result is analyzed, and the influence of finite difference accuracy, model complexity (channel number) and mesh resolution on the MRF-PINN result is tested. This paper shows that MRF-PINN can adapt to completely different equation types and mesh resolutions without any hyperparameter tuning. Further, the solving error is significantly decreased under high-order finite difference, large channel number, and high mesh resolution, which is expected to become a general convolutional PINN scheme.

To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight deep learning architectures named FasterX based on YOLOX model for real-time object detection on edge GPU. First, we design an effective and lightweight PixSF head to replace the original head of YOLOX to better detect small objects, which can be further embedded in the depthwise separable convolution (DS Conv) to achieve a lighter head. Then, a slimmer structure in the Neck layer termed as SlimFPN is developed to reduce parameters of the network, which is a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we embed attention module in the Head layer to improve the feature extraction effect of the prediction head. Meanwhile, we also improve the label assignment strategy and loss function to alleviate category imbalance and box optimization problems of the UAV dataset. Finally, auxiliary heads are presented for online distillation to improve the ability of position embedding and feature extraction in PixSF head. The performance of our lightweight models are validated experimentally on the NVIDIA Jetson NX and Jetson Nano GPU embedded platforms.Extensive experiments show that FasterX models achieve better trade-off between accuracy and latency on VisDrone2021 dataset compared to state-of-the-art models.

    "title": "Machine Learning-based Automatic Annotation and Detection of COVID-19  Fake News",
    "abstract": "COVID-19 impacted every part of the world, although the misinformation about the outbreak traveled faster than the virus. Misinformation spread through online social networks (OSN) often misled people from following correct medical practices. In particular, OSN bots have been a primary source of disseminating false information and initiating cyber propaganda. Existing work neglects the presence of bots that act as a catalyst in the spread and focuses on fake news detection in 'articles shared in posts' rather than the post (textual) content. Most work on misinformation detection uses manually labeled datasets that are hard to scale for building their predictive models. In this research, we overcome this challenge of data scarcity by proposing an automated approach for labeling data using verified fact-checked statements on a Twitter dataset. In addition, we combine textual features with user-level features (such as followers count and friends count) and tweet-level features (such as number of mentions, hashtags and urls in a tweet) to act as additional indicators to detect misinformation. Moreover, we analyzed the presence of bots in tweets and show that bots change their behavior over time and are most active during the misinformation campaign. We collected 10.22 Million COVID-19 related tweets and used our annotation model to build an extensive and original ground truth dataset for classification purposes. We utilize various machine learning models to accurately detect misinformation and our best classification model achieves precision (82%), recall (96%), and false positive rate (3.58%). Also, our bot analysis indicates that bots generated approximately 10% of misinformation tweets. Our methodology results in substantial exposure of false information, thus improving the trustworthiness of information disseminated through social media platforms. ",

The most widely adopted method to enforce privacy guarantees of a deep learning model nowadays relies on optimization techniques enforcing differential privacy. According to the literature, this approach has proven to be a successful defence against several models' privacy attacks, but its downside is a substantial degradation of the models' performance. In this work, we compare the effectiveness of the differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) algorithm against standard optimization practices with regularization techniques. We analyze the resulting models' utility, training performance, and the effectiveness of membership inference and model inversion attacks against the learned models. Finally, we discuss differential privacy's flaws and limits and empirically demonstrate the often superior privacy-preserving properties of dropout and l2-regularization. ",

In this article we investigate how to improve the current state-of-the-art in churn prediction by combining sequential and aggregate data using different neural network architectures.

In this work, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is used in a finite element formulation to define the flow law of a metallic material as a function of plastic strain, plastic strain rate and temperature. First, we present the general structure of the neural network, its operation and focus on the ability of the network to deduce, without prior learning, the derivatives of the flow law with respect to the model inputs. In order to validate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed model, we compare and analyze the performance of several network architectures with respect to the analytical formulation of a Johnson-Cook behavior law for a 42CrMo4 steel. In a second part, after having selected an Artificial Neural Network architecture with $2$ hidden layers, we present the implementation of this model in the Abaqus Explicit computational code in the form of a VUHARD subroutine. The predictive capability of the proposed model is then demonstrated during the numerical simulation of two test cases: the necking of a circular bar and a Taylor impact test. The results obtained show a very high capability of the ANN to replace the analytical formulation of a Johnson-Cook behavior law in a finite element code, while remaining competitive in terms of numerical simulation time compared to a classical approach.

To promote human understanding, these names should describe the role and use of the code elements they represent. But the names given by developers show high variability, reflecting the tastes of each developer, with different words used for the same meaning or the same words used for different meanings. This makes comparing names hard. A precise comparison should be based on matching identical words, but also take into account possible variations on the words (including spelling and typing errors), reordering of the words, matching between synonyms, and so on. To facilitate this we developed a library of comparison functions specifically targeted to comparing names in code. The different functions calculate the similarity between names in different ways, so a researcher can choose the one appropriate for his specific needs. All of them share an attempt to reflect human perceptions of similarity, at the possible expense of lexical matching. ",

    "abstract": "Object detection neural network models need to perform reliably in highly dynamic and safety-critical environments like automated driving or robotics. Therefore, it is paramount to verify the robustness of the detection under unexpected hardware faults like soft errors that can impact a systems perception module. Standard metrics based on average precision produce model vulnerability estimates at the object level rather than at an image level. As we show in this paper, this does not provide an intuitive or representative indicator of the safety-related impact of silent data corruption caused by bit flips in the underlying memory but can lead to an over- or underestimation of typical fault-induced hazards. With an eye towards safety-related real-time applications, we propose a new metric IVMOD (Image-wise Vulnerability Metric for Object Detection) to quantify vulnerability based on an incorrect image-wise object detection due to false positive (FPs) or false negative (FNs) objects, combined with a severity analysis. The evaluation of several representative object detection models shows that even a single bit flip can lead to a severe silent data corruption event with potentially critical safety implications, with e.g., up to (much greater than) 100 FPs generated, or up to approx. 90% of true positives (TPs) are lost in an image. Furthermore, with a single stuck-at-1 fault, an entire sequence of images can be affected, causing temporally persistent ghost detections that can be mistaken for actual objects (covering up to approx. 83% of the image). Furthermore, actual objects in the scene are continuously missed (up to approx. 64% of TPs are lost). Our work establishes a detailed understanding of the safety-related vulnerability of such critical workloads against hardware faults. ",

    "abstract": "Constructing a static call graph requires trade-offs between soundness and precision. Program analysis techniques for constructing call graphs are unfortunately usually imprecise. To address this problem, researchers have recently proposed call graph pruning empowered by machine learning to post-process call graphs constructed by static analysis. A machine learning model is built to capture information from the call graph by extracting structural features for use in a random forest classifier. It then removes edges that are predicted to be false positives. Despite the improvements shown by machine learning models, they are still limited as they do not consider the source code semantics and thus often are not able to effectively distinguish true and false positives. In this paper, we present a novel call graph pruning technique, AutoPruner, for eliminating false positives in call graphs via both statistical semantic and structural analysis. Given a call graph constructed by traditional static analysis tools, AutoPruner takes a Transformer-based approach to capture the semantic relationships between the caller and callee functions associated with each edge in the call graph. To do so, AutoPruner fine-tunes a model of code that was pre-trained on a large corpus to represent source code based on descriptions of its semantics. Next, the model is used to extract semantic features from the functions related to each edge in the call graph. AutoPruner uses these semantic features together with the structural features extracted from the call graph to classify each edge via a feed-forward neural network. Our empirical evaluation on a benchmark dataset of real-world programs shows that AutoPruner outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, improving on F-measure by up to 13% in identifying false-positive edges in a static call graph.

In its current form, the protocol is brittle and intricate to reason about, as evidenced by recent attacks, patching attempts, and G\\\"orli testnet reorgs. We present Goldfish, which can be seen as a considerably simplified variant of the current protocol, and prove that it is secure and reorg resilient in synchronous networks with dynamic participation, assuming a majority of the nodes (called validators) follows the protocol honestly. Furthermore, we show that subsampling validators can improve the communication efficiency of Goldfish, and that Goldfish is composable with finality gadgets and accountability gadgets. The aforementioned properties make Goldfish a credible candidate for a future protocol upgrade of PoS Ethereum, as well as a versatile pedagogical example. Akin to traditional propose-and-vote-style consensus protocols, Goldfish is organized into slots, at the beginning of which a leader proposes a block containing new transactions, and subsequently members of a committee take a vote towards block confirmation. But instead of using quorums, Goldfish is powered by a new mechanism that carefully synchronizes the inclusion and exclusion of votes in honest validators' views. ",

Multimodal learning methods fuse multiple data modalities while leveraging cross-modal dependencies to address this challenge. Here, we survey 140 studies in graph-centric AI and realize that diverse data types are increasingly brought together using graphs and fed into sophisticated multimodal models. These models stratify into image-, language-, and knowledge-grounded multimodal learning. We put forward an algorithmic blueprint for multimodal graph learning based on this categorization. The blueprint serves as a way to group state-of-the-art architectures that treat multimodal data by choosing appropriately four different components.

However, the recent cutting-edge generation methods enable high qualities of synthesis in CG images, which makes this challenging task even trickier. To address this issue, a joint learning strategy with deep texture and high-frequency features for CG image detection is proposed. We first formulate and deeply analyze the different acquisition processes of CG and PG images. Based on the finding that multiple different modules in image acquisition will lead to different sensitivity inconsistencies to the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based rendering in images, we propose a deep texture rendering module for texture difference enhancement and discriminative texture representation. Specifically, the semantic segmentation map is generated to guide the affine transformation operation, which is used to recover the texture in different regions of the input image. Then, the combination of the original image and the high-frequency components of the original and rendered images are fed into a multi-branch neural network equipped with attention mechanisms, which refines intermediate features and facilitates trace exploration in spatial and channel dimensions respectively. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and a newly constructed dataset with more realistic and diverse images show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in the field by a clear margin. Besides, results also demonstrate the detection robustness and generalization ability of the proposed approach to postprocessing operations and generative adversarial network (GAN) generated images.

This same problem arises in a variety of application areas, such as combinatorial scientific computing, marginalization in probabilistic graphical models, and solving constraint satisfaction problems. In this paper, we reduce the computationally hard portion of this problem to one of graph linear ordering, and demonstrate how existing approaches in this area can be utilized to achieve results up to several orders of magnitude better than existing state of the art methods for the same running time. To do so, we introduce a novel polynomial time algorithm for constructing an optimal contraction tree from a given order. Furthermore, we introduce a fast and high quality linear ordering solver, and demonstrate its applicability as a heuristic for providing orderings for contraction trees. Finally, we compare our solver with competing methods for constructing contraction trees in quantum circuit simulation on a collection of randomly generated Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm Max Cut circuits and show that our method achieves superior results on a majority of tested quantum circuits.

    "title": "Graph Neural Networks for Low-Energy Event Classification &  Reconstruction in IceCube",
    "abstract": "IceCube, a cubic-kilometer array of optical sensors built to detect atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos between 1 GeV and 1 PeV, is deployed 1.45 km to 2.45 km below the surface of the ice sheet at the South Pole. The classification and reconstruction of events from the in-ice detectors play a central role in the analysis of data from IceCube. Reconstructing and classifying events is a challenge due to the irregular detector geometry, inhomogeneous scattering and absorption of light in the ice and, below 100 GeV, the relatively low number of signal photons produced per event. To address this challenge, it is possible to represent IceCube events as point cloud graphs and use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) as the classification and reconstruction method. The GNN is capable of distinguishing neutrino events from cosmic-ray backgrounds, classifying different neutrino event types, and reconstructing the deposited energy, direction and interaction vertex. Based on simulation, we provide a comparison in the 1-100 GeV energy range to the current state-of-the-art maximum likelihood techniques used in current IceCube analyses, including the effects of known systematic uncertainties. For neutrino event classification, the GNN increases the signal efficiency by 18% at a fixed false positive rate (FPR), compared to current IceCube methods. Alternatively, the GNN offers a reduction of the FPR by over a factor 8 (to below half a percent) at a fixed signal efficiency. For the reconstruction of energy, direction, and interaction vertex, the resolution improves by an average of 13%-20% compared to current maximum likelihood techniques in the energy range of 1-30 GeV. The GNN, when run on a GPU, is capable of processing IceCube events at a rate nearly double of the median IceCube trigger rate of 2.7 kHz, which opens the possibility of using low energy neutrinos in online searches for transient events.

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that criminal networks have complex organizational structures, but whether this can be used to predict static and dynamic properties of criminal networks remains little explored. Here, by combining graph representation learning and machine learning methods, we show that structural properties of political corruption, police intelligence, and money laundering networks can be used to recover missing criminal partnerships, distinguish among different types of criminal and legal associations, as well as predict the total amount of money exchanged among criminal agents, all with outstanding accuracy. We also show that our approach can anticipate future criminal associations during the dynamic growth of corruption networks with significant accuracy. Thus, similar to evidence found at crime scenes, we conclude that structural patterns of criminal networks carry crucial information about illegal activities, which allows machine learning methods to predict missing information and even anticipate future criminal behavior.

    "abstract": "Identification of the causal relationship between multivariate time series is a ubiquitous problem in data science. Granger causality measure (GCM) and conditional Granger causality measure (cGCM) are widely used statistical methods for causal inference and effective connectivity analysis in neuroimaging research. Both GCM and cGCM have frequency-domain formulations that are developed based on a heuristic algorithm for matrix decompositions. The goal of this work is to generalize GCM and cGCM measures and their frequency-domain formulations by using a theoretic framework for minimum entropy (ME) estimation. The proposed ME-estimation method extends the classical theory of minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation for stochastic processes. It provides three formulations of cGCM that include Geweke's original time-domain cGCM as a special case. But all three frequency-domain formulations of cGCM are different from previous methods. Experimental results based on simulations have shown that one of the proposed frequency-domain cGCM has enhanced sensitivity and specificity in detecting network connections compared to other methods. In an example based on in vivo functional magnetic resonance imaging, the proposed frequency-domain measure cGCM can significantly enhance the consistency between the structural and effective connectivity of human brain networks.
