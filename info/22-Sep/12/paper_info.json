    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated promise in solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations. Despite recent progress on expanding the class of problems that can be tackled by PINNs, most of existing use-cases involve simple geometric domains. To date, there is no clear way to inform PINNs about the topology of the domain where the problem is being solved. In this work, we propose a novel positional encoding mechanism for PINNs based on the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. This technique allows to create an input space for the neural network that represents the geometry of a given object. We approximate the eigenfunctions as well as the operators involved in the partial differential equations with finite elements. We extensively test and compare the proposed methodology against traditional PINNs in complex shapes, such as a coil, a heat sink and a bunny, with different physics, such as the Eikonal equation and heat transfer. We also study the sensitivity of our method to the number of eigenfunctions used, as well as the discretization used for the eigenfunctions and the underlying operators. Our results show excellent agreement with the ground truth data in cases where traditional PINNs fail to produce a meaningful solution. We envision this new technique will expand the effectiveness of PINNs to more realistic applications. ",

It allows hospitals/institutions to train models with sufficient data while the data is kept private. To make sure the FL model is robust when facing heterogeneous data among FL clients, most efforts focus on personalizing models for clients. However, the latent relationships between clients' data are ignored. In this work, we focus on a special non-iid FL problem, called Domain-mixed FL, where each client's data distribution is assumed to be a mixture of several predefined domains. Recognizing the diversity of domains and the similarity within domains, we propose a novel method, FedDAR, which learns a domain shared representation and domain-wise personalized prediction heads in a decoupled manner. For simplified linear regression settings, we have theoretically proved that FedDAR enjoys a linear convergence rate. For general settings, we have performed intensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world medical datasets which demonstrate its superiority over prior FL methods. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning have enabled its wide application in different domains, and one of the most exciting applications is autonomous vehicles (AVs), which have encouraged the development of a number of ML algorithms from perception to prediction to planning. However, training AVs usually requires a large amount of training data collected from different driving environments (e.g., cities) as well as different types of personal information (e.g., working hours and routes). Such collected large data, treated as the new oil for ML in the data-centric AI era, usually contains a large amount of privacy-sensitive information which is hard to remove or even audit. Although existing privacy protection approaches have achieved certain theoretical and empirical success, there is still a gap when applying them to real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles. For instance, when training AVs, not only can individually identifiable information reveal privacy-sensitive information, but also population-level information such as road construction within a city, and proprietary-level commercial secrets of AVs. Thus, it is critical to revisit the frontier of privacy risks and corresponding protection approaches in AVs to bridge this gap. Following this goal, in this work, we provide a new taxonomy for privacy risks and protection methods in AVs, and we categorize privacy in AVs into three levels: individual, population, and proprietary. We explicitly list out recent challenges to protect each of these levels of privacy, summarize existing solutions to these challenges, discuss the lessons and conclusions, and provide potential future directions and opportunities for both researchers and practitioners. We believe this work will help to shape the privacy research in AV and guide the privacy protection technology design. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) provides an efficient paradigm to jointly train a global model leveraging data from distributed users. As the local training data come from different users who may not be trustworthy, several studies have shown that FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Meanwhile, to protect the privacy of local users, FL is always trained in a differentially private way (DPFL). Thus, in this paper, we ask: Can we leverage the innate privacy property of DPFL to provide certified robustness against poisoning attacks? Can we further improve the privacy of FL to improve such certification? We first investigate both user-level and instance-level privacy of FL and propose novel mechanisms to achieve improved instance-level privacy. We then provide two robustness certification criteria: certified prediction and certified attack cost for DPFL on both levels. Theoretically, we prove the certified robustness of DPFL under a bounded number of adversarial users or instances. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to verify our theories under a range of attacks on different datasets. We show that DPFL with a tighter privacy guarantee always provides stronger robustness certification in terms of certified attack cost, but the optimal certified prediction is achieved under a proper balance between privacy protection and utility loss.

    "abstract": "We propose im2nerf, a learning framework that predicts a continuous neural object representation given a single input image in the wild, supervised by only segmentation output from off-the-shelf recognition methods. The standard approach to constructing neural radiance fields takes advantage of multi-view consistency and requires many calibrated views of a scene, a requirement that cannot be satisfied when learning on large-scale image data in the wild. We take a step towards addressing this shortcoming by introducing a model that encodes the input image into a disentangled object representation that contains a code for object shape, a code for object appearance, and an estimated camera pose from which the object image is captured. Our model conditions a NeRF on the predicted object representation and uses volume rendering to generate images from novel views. We train the model end-to-end on a large collection of input images. As the model is only provided with single-view images, the problem is highly under-constrained. Therefore, in addition to using a reconstruction loss on the synthesized input view, we use an auxiliary adversarial loss on the novel rendered views. Furthermore, we leverage object symmetry and cycle camera pose consistency. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the ShapeNet dataset as well as qualitative experiments on Open Images dataset. We show that in all cases, im2nerf achieves the state-of-the-art performance for novel view synthesis from a single-view unposed image in the wild. ",

Individuals of any age, race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, immigration status, cultural background, religion, socioeconomic class, and education can be a victim of human trafficking. With the advancements in technology and the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs), human traffickers will adopt new ways to transport victims, which could accelerate the growth of organized human trafficking networks, which can make the detection of trafficking in persons more challenging for law enforcement agencies. The objective of this study is to develop an innovative audio analytics-based human trafficking detection framework for autonomous vehicles. The primary contributions of this study are to: (i) define four non-trivial, feasible, and realistic human trafficking scenarios for AVs; (ii) create a new and comprehensive audio dataset related to human trafficking with five classes i.e., crying, screaming, car door banging, car noise, and conversation; and (iii) develop a deep 1-D Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architecture for audio data classification related to human trafficking. We have also conducted a case study using the new audio dataset and evaluated the audio classification performance of the deep 1-D CNN. Our analyses reveal that the deep 1-D CNN can distinguish sound coming from a human trafficking victim from a non-human trafficking sound with an accuracy of 95%, which proves the efficacy of our framework.

The quantification of the city characteristics will be beneficial to government policy planning, tourism projects, etc. In this study, we try to predict two soundscape impressions, meaning pleasantness and eventfulness, using sound data collected by the cloud-sensing method. The collected sounds comprise meta information of recording location using Global Positioning System. Furthermore, the soundscape impressions and sound-source features are separately assigned to the cloud-sensing sounds by assessments defined using Swedish Soundscape-Quality Protocol, assessing the quality of the acoustic environment. The prediction models are built using deep neural networks with multi-layer perceptron for the input of 10-second sound and the aerial photographs of its location. An acoustic feature comprises equivalent noise level and outputs of octave-band filters every second, and statistics of them in 10~s. An image feature is extracted from an aerial photograph using ResNet-50 and autoencoder architecture. We perform comparison experiments to demonstrate the benefit of each feature. As a result of the comparison, aerial photographs and sound-source features are efficient to predict impression information. Additionally, even if the sound-source features are predicted using acoustic and image features, the features also show fine results to predict the soundscape impression close to the result of oracle sound-source features.

In this article, we proposed an audio-visual network that considers aggregator from a fusion perspective. We introduced improved attentive statistics pooling for the first time in face verification. Then we find that strong correlation exists between modalities during pooling, so joint attentive pooling is proposed which contains cycle consistency to learn the implicit inter-frame weight. Finally, fuse the modality with a gated attention mechanism. All the proposed models are trained on the VoxCeleb2 dev dataset and the best system obtains 0.18\\%, 0.27\\%, and 0.49\\% EER on three official trail lists of VoxCeleb1 respectively, which is to our knowledge the best-published results for person verification.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have already achieved great success in a lot of application areas and brought profound changes to our society. However, it also raises new security problems, among which how to protect the intellectual property (IP) of DNNs against infringement is one of the most important yet very challenging topics. To deal with this problem, recent studies focus on the IP protection of DNNs by applying digital watermarking, which embeds source information and/or authentication data into DNN models by tuning network parameters directly or indirectly. However, tuning network parameters inevitably distorts the DNN and therefore surely impairs the performance of the DNN model on its original task regardless of the degree of the performance degradation. It has motivated the authors in this paper to propose a novel technique called \\emph{pooled membership inference (PMI)} so as to protect the IP of the DNN models. The proposed PMI neither alters the network parameters of the given DNN model nor fine-tunes the DNN model with a sequence of carefully crafted trigger samples. Instead, it leaves the original DNN model unchanged, but can determine the ownership of the DNN model by inferring which mini-dataset among multiple mini-datasets was once used to train the target DNN model, which differs from previous arts and has remarkable potential in practice. Experiments also have demonstrated the superiority and applicability of this work. ",

    "abstract": "Infinite width limit has shed light on generalization and optimization aspects of deep learning by establishing connections between neural networks and kernel methods. Despite their importance, the utility of these kernel methods was limited in large-scale learning settings due to their (super-)quadratic runtime and memory complexities. Moreover, most prior works on neural kernels have focused on the ReLU activation, mainly due to its popularity but also due to the difficulty of computing such kernels for general activations. In this work, we overcome such difficulties by providing methods to work with general activations. First, we compile and expand the list of activation functions admitting exact dual activation expressions to compute neural kernels. When the exact computation is unknown, we present methods to effectively approximate them. We propose a fast sketching method that approximates any multi-layered Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) matrices for a wide range of activation functions, going beyond the commonly analyzed ReLU activation. This is done by showing how to approximate the neural kernels using the truncated Hermite expansion of any desired activation functions. While most prior works require data points on the unit sphere, our methods do not suffer from such limitations and are applicable to any dataset of points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Furthermore, we provide a subspace embedding for NNGP and NTK matrices with near input-sparsity runtime and near-optimal target dimension which applies to any \\emph{homogeneous} dual activation functions with rapidly convergent Taylor expansion. Empirically, with respect to exact convolutional NTK (CNTK) computation, our method achieves $106\\times$ speedup for approximate CNTK of a 5-layer Myrtle network on CIFAR-10 dataset. ",

Our analysis shows that the performance of mobile networks varies significantly across the globe, where only a hands-full of networks manage to achieve excellent network performance across a stack of experiments.

Due to its large computational complexity, distributed processing is frequently employed. This requires graph data to be divided across nodes, and the choice of partitioning strategy has a great impact on the execution time of the task. Yet, there is no one-size-fits-all partitioning strategy that performs well on arbitrary graph data and algorithms. The performance of a strategy depends on the characteristics of the graph data and algorithms. Moreover, due to the complexity of graph data and algorithms, manually identifying the best partitioning strategy is also infeasible. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based approach to select the most appropriate partitioning strategy for a given graph and processing algorithm. Our approach enumerates viable partitioning strategies, predicts the execution time of the target algorithm for each, and selects the partitioning strategy with the fastest estimated execution time. Our machine learning model is trained on features extracted from graph data and algorithm pseudo-code. We also propose a method that augments real execution logs of graph tasks to create a large synthetic dataset. Evaluation results show that the strategies selected by our approach lead to 1.46X faster execution time on average compared with the mean execution time of the partitioning strategies and about 0.95X the performance compared to the best partitioning strategy.

To handle these limitations, we develop a joint model for treatments and outcomes, which allows for the estimation of treatment policies and effects from sequential treatment--outcome data. It can answer interventional and counterfactual queries about interventions on treatment policies, as we show with real-world data on blood glucose progression and a simulation study building on top of this.

This paper proposes a novel position-enhanced user/item representation training model for recommendation, SUPER-Rec. We first capture the rating position in the matrix using the relative positional rating encoding and store the position-enhanced rating information and its user-item relationship to the fixed dimension of embedding that is not affected by the matrix size. Then, we apply the trained position-enhanced user and item representations to the simplest traditional machine learning models to highlight the pure novelty of our representation learning model. We contribute the first formal introduction and quantitative analysis of position-enhanced item representation in the recommendation domain and produce a principled discussion about our SUPER-Rec to the outperformed performance of typical collaborative filtering recommendation tasks with both explicit and implicit feedback.

    "abstract": "Slot filling and intent detection are two fundamental tasks in the field of natural language understanding. Due to the strong correlation between these two tasks, previous studies make efforts on modeling them with multi-task learning or designing feature interaction modules to improve the performance of each task. However, none of the existing approaches consider the relevance between the structural information of sentences and the label semantics of two tasks. The intent and semantic components of a utterance are dependent on the syntactic elements of a sentence. In this paper, we investigate a multi-grained label refinement network, which utilizes dependency structures and label semantic embeddings. Considering to enhance syntactic representations, we introduce the dependency structures of sentences into our model by graph attention layer. To capture the semantic dependency between the syntactic information and task labels, we combine the task specific features with corresponding label embeddings by attention mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the competitive performance on two public datasets. ",

In this application context, we need to automatically segment the speech signal according to speakers gender, and to identify when at least two speakers speak at the same time. We propose to use WavLM model which has the advantage of being pre-trained on a huge amount of speech data, to build an overlapped speech detection (OSD) and a gender detection (GD) systems. In this study, we use two different corpora. The DIHARD III corpus which is well adapted for the OSD task but lack gender information. The ALLIES corpus fits with the project application context. Our best OSD system is a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with WavLM pre-trained features as input, which reaches a new state-of-the-art F1-score performance on DIHARD. A neural GD is trained with WavLM inputs on a gender balanced subset of the French broadcast news ALLIES data, and obtains an accuracy of 97.9%. This work opens new perspectives for human science researchers regarding the differences of representation between women and men in French media. ",

    "abstract": "Most proposals in the anomaly detection field focus exclusively on the detection stage, specially in the recent deep learning approaches. While providing highly accurate predictions, these models often lack transparency, acting as \"black boxes\". This criticism has grown to the point that explanation is now considered very relevant in terms of acceptability and reliability. In this paper, we addressed this issue by inspecting the ADMNC (Anomaly Detection on Mixed Numerical and Categorical Spaces) model, an existing very accurate although opaque anomaly detector capable to operate with both numerical and categorical inputs. This work presents the extension EADMNC (Explainable Anomaly Detection on Mixed Numerical and Categorical spaces), which adds explainability to the predictions obtained with the original model. We preserved the scalability of the original method thanks to the Apache Spark framework. EADMNC leverages the formulation of the previous ADMNC model to offer pre hoc and post hoc explainability, while maintaining the accuracy of the original architecture. We present a pre hoc model that globally explains the outputs by segmenting input data into homogeneous groups, described with only a few variables. We designed a graphical representation based on regression trees, which supervisors can inspect to understand the differences between normal and anomalous data. Our post hoc explanations consist of a text-based template method that locally provides textual arguments supporting each detection. We report experimental results on extensive real-world data, particularly in the domain of network intrusion detection. The usefulness of the explanations is assessed by theory analysis using expert knowledge in the network intrusion domain. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is proving to be one of the most promising paradigms for leveraging distributed resources, enabling a set of clients to collaboratively train a machine learning model while keeping the data decentralized. The explosive growth of interest in the topic has led to rapid advancements in several core aspects like communication efficiency, handling non-IID data, privacy, and security capabilities. However, the majority of FL works only deal with supervised tasks, assuming that clients' training sets are labeled. To leverage the enormous unlabeled data on distributed edge devices, in this paper, we aim to extend the FL paradigm to unsupervised tasks by addressing the problem of anomaly detection in decentralized settings. In particular, we propose a novel method in which, through a preprocessing phase, clients are grouped into communities, each having similar majority (i.e., inlier) patterns. Subsequently, each community of clients trains the same anomaly detection model (i.e., autoencoders) in a federated fashion. The resulting model is then shared and used to detect anomalies within the clients of the same community that joined the corresponding federated process. Experiments show that our method is robust, and it can detect communities consistent with the ideal partitioning in which groups of clients having the same inlier patterns are known. Furthermore, the performance is significantly better than those in which clients train models exclusively on local data and comparable with federated models of ideal communities' partition. ",

Yet, most methods are transductive, i.e., they are based on dimensionality reduction architectures. Hence, they require heavy retraining every time new items or users are added. Conversely, inductive methods promise to solve these issues. Nonetheless, all inductive methods rely only on interactions, making recommendations for users with few interactions sub-optimal and even impossible for new items. Therefore, we focus on inductive methods able to also exploit knowledge graphs (KGs). In this work, we propose SimpleRec, a strong baseline that uses a graph neural network and a KG to provide better recommendations than related inductive methods for new users and items. We show that it is unnecessary to create complex model architectures for user representations, but it is enough to allow users to be represented by the few ratings they provide and the indirect connections among them without any user metadata. As a result, we re-evaluate state-of-the-art methods, identify better evaluation protocols, highlight unwarranted conclusions from previous proposals, and showcase a novel, stronger baseline for this task.

    "abstract": "Although previous graph-based multi-view clustering algorithms have gained significant progress, most of them are still faced with three limitations. First, they often suffer from high computational complexity, which restricts their applications in large-scale scenarios. Second, they usually perform graph learning either at the single-view level or at the view-consensus level, but often neglect the possibility of the joint learning of single-view and consensus graphs. Third, many of them rely on the $k$-means for discretization of the spectral embeddings, which lack the ability to directly learn the graph with discrete cluster structure. In light of this, this paper presents an efficient multi-view clustering approach via unified and discrete bipartite graph learning (UDBGL). Specifically, the anchor-based subspace learning is incorporated to learn the view-specific bipartite graphs from multiple views, upon which the bipartite graph fusion is leveraged to learn a view-consensus bipartite graph with adaptive weight learning. Further, the Laplacian rank constraint is imposed to ensure that the fused bipartite graph has discrete cluster structures (with a specific number of connected components). By simultaneously formulating the view-specific bipartite graph learning, the view-consensus bipartite graph learning, and the discrete cluster structure learning into a unified objective function, an efficient minimization algorithm is then designed to tackle this optimization problem and directly achieve a discrete clustering solution without requiring additional partitioning, which notably has linear time complexity in data size. Experiments on a variety of multi-view datasets demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our UDBGL approach. ",

    "abstract": "graph neural networks (GNNs) are the dominant paradigm for modeling and handling graph structure data by learning universal node representation. The traditional way of training GNNs depends on a great many labeled data, which results in high requirements on cost and time. In some special scene, it is even unavailable and impracticable. Self-supervised representation learning, which can generate labels by graph structure data itself, is a potential approach to tackle this problem. And turning to research on self-supervised learning problem for heterogeneous graphs is more challenging than dealing with homogeneous graphs, also there are fewer studies about it. In this paper, we propose a SElfsupervised learning method for heterogeneous graph via Structure Information based on Metapath (SESIM). The proposed model can construct pretext tasks by predicting jump number between nodes in each metapath to improve the representation ability of primary task. In order to predict jump number, SESIM uses data itself to generate labels, avoiding time-consuming manual labeling. Moreover, predicting jump number in each metapath can effectively utilize graph structure information, which is the essential property between nodes. Therefore, SESIM deepens the understanding of models for graph structure. At last, we train primary task and pretext tasks jointly, and use meta-learning to balance the contribution of pretext tasks for primary task. Empirical results validate the performance of SESIM method and demonstrate that this method can improve the representation ability of traditional neural networks on link prediction task and node classification task.

Moreover, the method automatically handles the variable coupling and boundary conditions in the vanishing diffusion limit, leading to an asymptotic-preserving scheme. A detailed analysis of the singularities of the solution and the discretization error is presented, and an adaptive strategy is proposed, leading to order optimal error estimates that hold uniformly in the singular perturbation limit.

In this paper, we propose the use of Shapley values to explain the contribution of each feature towards the model's robustness, measured in terms of Receiver-operating Characteristics (ROC) curve and the Area under the ROC curve (AUC). With the help of an illustrative example, we demonstrate the proposed idea of explaining the ROC curve, and visualising the uncertainties in these curves.

Given their ability to relocate throughout their area of deployment, they hold the potential to improve customer accessibility and convenience. In this study, we formulate the Mobile Parcel Locker Problem (MPLP), a special case of the Location-Routing Problem (LRP) which determines the optimal stopover location for MPLs throughout the day and plans corresponding delivery routes. A Hybrid Q-Learning-Network-based Method (HQM) is developed to resolve the computational complexity of the resulting large problem instances while escaping local optima. In addition, the HQM is integrated with global and local search mechanisms to resolve the dilemma of exploration and exploitation faced by classic reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We examine the performance of HQM under different problem sizes (up to 200 nodes) and benchmarked it against the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Our results indicate that the average reward obtained by HQM is 1.96 times greater than GA, which demonstrates that HQM has a better optimisation ability. Finally, we identify critical factors that contribute to fleet size requirements, travel distances, and service delays. Our findings outline that the efficiency of MPLs is mainly contingent on the length of time windows and the deployment of MPL stopovers. ",

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art techniques for computing such a distance are computationally expensive and hence not suited for online applications. This work proposes a novel family of classifiers, namely Signed Distance Classifiers (SDCs), that, from a theoretical perspective, directly output the exact distance of x from the classification boundary, rather than a probability score (e.g., SoftMax). SDCs represent a family of robust-by-design classifiers. To practically address the theoretical requirements of a SDC, a novel network architecture named Unitary-Gradient Neural Network is presented. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture approximates a signed distance classifier, hence allowing an online certifiable classification of x at the cost of a single inference. ",

In this work, we found that using neighbor sentences enables capturing a more accurate semantic similarity between similar sentences.

We evaluate RankEncoder from three perspectives: 1) the semantic textual similarity performance, 2) the efficacy on similar sentence pairs, and 3) the universality of RankEncoder. Experimental results show that RankEncoder achieves 80.07\\% Spearman's correlation, a 1.1% absolute improvement compared to the previous state-of-the-art performance. The improvement is even more significant, a 1.73% improvement, on similar sentence pairs. Also, we demonstrate that RankEncoder is universally applicable to existing unsupervised sentence encoders.

However, the development, validation, and testing of data-driven countermeasures against cyber-attacks, such as machine learning-based detection approaches, lack important data from real-world cyber incidents. Unlike attack data from real-world cyber incidents, infrastructure knowledge and standards are accessible through expert and domain knowledge. Our proposed approach uses domain knowledge to define the behavior of a smart grid under non-attack conditions and detect attack patterns and anomalies. Using a graph-based specification formalism, we combine cross-domain knowledge that enables the generation of whitelisting rules not only for statically defined protocol fields but also for communication ows and technical operation boundaries. Finally, we evaluate our specification-based intrusion detection system against various attack scenarios and assess detection quality and performance. In particular, we investigate a data manipulation attack in a future-orientated use case of an IEC 60870-based SCADA system that controls distributed energy resources in the distribution grid. Our approach can detect severe data manipulation attacks with high accuracy in a timely and reliable manner. ",

Event cameras are an emerging sensor technology which imitates biological vision with asynchronously firing pixels, eschewing the concept of the image frame. To leverage modern learning techniques, many event-based algorithms are forced to accumulate events back to image frames, somewhat squandering the advantages of event cameras. We follow the opposite paradigm and develop a new type of neural network which operates closer to the original event data stream. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in angular velocity regression and competitive optical flow estimation, while avoiding difficulties related to training SNN.

W-MSR consensus is one such resilient consensus algorithm that allows for resilient consensus with only local knowledge of the communication graph and no a priori model for the data being shared. However, the verification that a given communication graph meets the strict graph connectivity requirement makes W-MSR difficult to use in practice. In this paper, we show that a commonly used communication graph structure in robotics literature, the communication graph built based on the Voronoi tessellation, automatically results in a sufficiently connected graph to reject a single non-cooperative team member. Further, we show how this graph can be enhanced to reject two non-cooperative team members and provide a roadmap for modifications for further resilience. This contribution will allow for the easy application of resilient consensus to algorithms that already rely on Voronoi-based communication such as distributed coverage and exploration algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "We present an approach for the reconstruction of textured 3D meshes of human heads from one or few views. Since such few-shot reconstruction is underconstrained, it requires prior knowledge which is hard to impose on traditional 3D reconstruction algorithms. In this work, we rely on the recently introduced 3D representation $\\unicode{x2013}$ neural implicit functions $\\unicode{x2013}$ which, being based on neural networks, allows to naturally learn priors about human heads from data, and is directly convertible to textured mesh. Namely, we extend NeuS, a state-of-the-art neural implicit function formulation, to represent multiple objects of a class (human heads in our case) simultaneously. The underlying neural net architecture is designed to learn the commonalities among these objects and to generalize to unseen ones. Our model is trained on just a hundred smartphone videos and does not require any scanned 3D data. Afterwards, the model can fit novel heads in the few-shot or one-shot modes with good results. ",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that the parameterized family of functions representable by fully-connected feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation function is precisely the class of piecewise linear functions with finitely many pieces. It is less well-known that for every fixed architecture of ReLU neural network, the parameter space admits positive-dimensional spaces of symmetries, and hence the local functional dimension near any given parameter is lower than the parametric dimension. In this work we carefully define the notion of functional dimension, show that it is inhomogeneous across the parameter space of ReLU neural network functions, and continue an investigation - initiated in [14] and [5] - into when the functional dimension achieves its theoretical maximum. We also study the quotient space and fibers of the realization map from parameter space to function space, supplying examples of fibers that are disconnected, fibers upon which functional dimension is non-constant, and fibers upon which the symmetry group acts non-transitively.

    "title": "Studying Drowsiness Detection Performance while Driving through Scalable  Machine Learning Models using Electroencephalography",
    "abstract": "Drowsiness is a major concern for drivers and one of the leading causes of traffic accidents. Advances in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computer Science have enabled the detection of drivers' drowsiness by using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Machine Learning (ML). Nevertheless, several challenges remain open and should be faced. First, a comprehensive enough evaluation of drowsiness detection performance using a heterogeneous set of ML algorithms is missing in the literature. Last, it is needed to study the detection performance of scalable ML models suitable for groups of subjects and compare it with the individual models proposed in the literature. To improve these limitations, this work presents an intelligent framework that employs BCIs and features based on electroencephalography (EEG) for detecting drowsiness in driving scenarios. The SEED-VIG dataset is used to feed different ML regressors and three-class classifiers and then evaluate, analyze, and compare the best-performing models for individual subjects and groups of them. More in detail, regarding individual models, Random Forest (RF) obtained a 78% f1-score, improving the 58% obtained by models used in the literature such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). Concerning scalable models, RF reached a 79% f1-score, demonstrating the effectiveness of these approaches. The lessons learned can be summarized as follows: i) not only SVM but also other models not sufficiently explored in the literature are relevant for drowsiness detection, and ii) scalable approaches suitable for groups of subjects are effective to detect drowsiness, even when new subjects that are not included in the models training are evaluated.

    "abstract": "This work tackles a central machine learning problem of performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets. The problem is particularly salient in medical imaging based diagnosis system that appears to be accurate but fails when tested in new hospitals/datasets. Recent studies indicate the system might learn shortcut and non-relevant features instead of generalizable features, so-called good features. We hypothesize that adversarial training can eliminate shortcut features whereas saliency guided training can filter out non-relevant features; both are nuisance features accounting for the performance degradation on OOD test sets. With that, we formulate a novel model training scheme for the deep neural network to learn good features for classification and/or detection tasks ensuring a consistent generalization performance on OOD test sets. The experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the superior performance of our method using the benchmark CXR image data sets on classification tasks. ",

We propose a native encoding of continuous variables in analog signals associated with the quadrature operators of a set of quantum optical modes. Optical coupling of the modes and noise introduced by vacuum fluctuations from external reservoirs or by weak measurements of the modes are used to optically simulate a diffusion process on a set of continuous random variables. The process is run sufficiently long for it to relax into the steady state of an energy potential defined on a continuous domain. As a first demonstration, we numerically benchmark solving box-constrained quadratic programming (BoxQP) problems using these settings. We consider delay-line and measurement-feedback variants of the experiment. Our benchmarking results demonstrate that in both cases the optical network is capable of solving BoxQP problems over three orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art classical heuristic. ",
