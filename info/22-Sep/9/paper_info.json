    "abstract": "This letter focuses on the problem of traffic state estimation for highway networks with junctions in the form of on- and off-ramps while maintaining differential privacy of traffic data. Two types of sensors are considered, fixed sensors such as inductive loop detectors and connected vehicles which provide traffic density and speed data. The celebrated nonlinear second-order Aw-Rascle- Zhang (ARZ) model is utilized to model the traffic dynamics. The model is formulated as a nonlinear state-space difference equation. Sensitivity relations are derived for the given data which are then used to formulate a differentially private mechanism which adds a Gaussian noise to the data to make it differentially private. A Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) approach is implemented for traffic state estimation using a linearized ARZ model. MHE is compared with Kalman Filter variants namely Extended Kalman Filter, Ensemble Kalman Filter and Unscented Kalman Filter. Several research and engineering questions are formulated and analysis is performed to find corresponding answers. ",

    "abstract": "ISO 14971 is the primary standard used for medical device risk management. While it specifies the requirements for medical device risk management, it does not specify a particular method for performing risk management. Hence, medical device manufacturers are free to develop or use any appropriate methods for managing the risk of medical devices. The most commonly used methods, such as Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), are unable to provide a reasonable basis for computing risk estimates when there are limited or no historical data available or where there is second-order uncertainty about the data. In this paper, we present a novel method for medical device risk management using hybrid Bayesian networks (BNs) that resolves the limitations of classical methods such as FTA and incorporates relevant factors affecting the risk of medical devices. The proposed BN method is generic but can be instantiated on a system-by-system basis, and we apply it to a Defibrillator device to demonstrate the process involved for medical device risk management during production and post-production. The example is validated against real-world data. ",

    "abstract": "Electric Vehicle (EV) charging demand and charging station availability forecasting is one of the challenges in the intelligent transportation system. With the accurate EV station situation prediction, suitable charging behaviors could be scheduled in advance to relieve range anxiety. Many existing deep learning methods are proposed to address this issue, however, due to the complex road network structure and comprehensive external factors, such as point of interests (POIs) and weather effects, many commonly used algorithms could just extract the historical usage information without considering comprehensive influence of external factors. To enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability, the Attribute-Augmented Spatial-Temporal Graph Informer (AST-GIN) structure is proposed in this study by combining the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layer and the Informer layer to extract both external and internal spatial-temporal dependence of relevant transportation data. And the external factors are modeled as dynamic attributes by the attribute-augmented encoder for training. AST-GIN model is tested on the data collected in Dundee City and experimental results show the effectiveness of our model considering external factors influence over various horizon settings compared with other baselines.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted much attention for their high energy efficiency and for recent advances in their classification performance. However, unlike traditional deep learning approaches, the analysis and study of the robustness of SNNs to adversarial examples remains relatively underdeveloped. In this work we advance the field of adversarial machine learning through experimentation and analyses of three important SNN security attributes. First, we show that successful white-box adversarial attacks on SNNs are highly dependent on the underlying surrogate gradient technique. Second, we analyze the transferability of adversarial examples generated by SNNs and other state-of-the-art architectures like Vision Transformers and Big Transfer CNNs. We demonstrate that SNNs are not often deceived by adversarial examples generated by Vision Transformers and certain types of CNNs. Lastly, we develop a novel white-box attack that generates adversarial examples capable of fooling both SNN models and non-SNN models simultaneously. Our experiments and analyses are broad and rigorous covering two datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), five different white-box attacks and twelve different classifier models. ",

    "abstract": "We study the problems of counting copies and induced copies of a small pattern graph $H$ in a large host graph $G$. Recent work fully classified the complexity of those problems according to structural restrictions on the patterns $H$. In this work, we address the more challenging task of analysing the complexity for restricted patterns and restricted hosts. Specifically we ask which families of allowed patterns and hosts imply fixed-parameter tractability, i.e., the existence of an algorithm running in time $f(H)\\cdot |G|^{O(1)}$ for some computable function $f$. Our main results present exhaustive and explicit complexity classifications for families that satisfy natural closure properties. Among others, we identify the problems of counting small matchings and independent sets in subgraph-closed graph classes $\\mathcal{G}$ as our central objects of study and establish the following crisp dichotomies as consequences of the Exponential Time Hypothesis: (1) Counting $k$-matchings in a graph $G\\in\\mathcal{G}$ is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if $\\mathcal{G}$ is nowhere dense. (2) Counting $k$-independent sets in a graph $G\\in\\mathcal{G}$ is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if $\\mathcal{G}$ is nowhere dense. Moreover, we obtain almost tight conditional lower bounds if $\\mathcal{G}$ is somewhere dense, i.e., not nowhere dense. These base cases of our classifications subsume a wide variety of previous results on the matching and independent set problem, such as counting $k$-matchings in bipartite graphs (Curticapean, Marx; FOCS 14), in $F$-colourable graphs (Roth, Wellnitz; SODA 20), and in degenerate graphs (Bressan, Roth; FOCS 21), as well as counting $k$-independent sets in bipartite graphs (Curticapean et al.; Algorithmica 19).

Here, we demonstrate that BNNs are able to discover arbitrary commutative group structure in data, with the trained models learning the irreducible representations of the groups, which allows for the recovery of the group Cayley tables.

However, this inexpensive model development also comes with new challenges regarding model trustworthiness. This work presents a novel approach, physics-guided adversarial machine learning (ML), that improves the confidence over the physics consistency of the model. The approach performs, first, a physics-guided adversarial testing phase to search for test inputs revealing behavioral system inconsistencies, while still falling within the range of foreseeable operational conditions. Then, it proceeds with physics-informed adversarial training to teach the model the system-related physics domain foreknowledge through iteratively reducing the unwanted output deviations on the previously-uncovered counterexamples. Empirical evaluation on two aircraft system performance models shows the effectiveness of our adversarial ML approach in exposing physical inconsistencies of both models and in improving their propensity to be consistent with physics domain knowledge.

    "abstract": "Aircraft industry is constantly striving for more efficient design optimization methods in terms of human efforts, computation time, and resource consumption. Hybrid surrogate optimization maintains high results quality while providing rapid design assessments when both the surrogate model and the switch mechanism for eventually transitioning to the HF model are calibrated properly. Feedforward neural networks (FNNs) can capture highly nonlinear input-output mappings, yielding efficient surrogates for aircraft performance factors. However, FNNs often fail to generalize over the out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, which hinders their adoption in critical aircraft design optimization. Through SmOOD, our smoothness-based out-of-distribution detection approach, we propose to codesign a model-dependent OOD indicator with the optimized FNN surrogate, to produce a trustworthy surrogate model with selective but credible predictions. Unlike conventional uncertainty-grounded methods, SmOOD exploits inherent smoothness properties of the HF simulations to effectively expose OODs through revealing their suspicious sensitivities, thereby avoiding over-confident uncertainty estimates on OOD samples. By using SmOOD, only high-risk OOD inputs are forwarded to the HF model for re-evaluation, leading to more accurate results at a low overhead cost. Three aircraft performance models are investigated. Results show that FNN-based surrogates outperform their Gaussian Process counterparts in terms of predictive performance. Moreover, SmOOD does cover averagely 85% of actual OODs on all the study cases. When SmOOD plus FNN surrogates are deployed in hybrid surrogate optimization settings, they result in a decrease error rate of 34.65% and a computational speed up rate of 58.36 times, respectively.

Aiming for predictors having small resources needs, the greedy approach does not need to fix in advance an architecture for the network: this one is built one layer at a time, one neuron at a time, leading to predictors that aren't needlessly wide and deep for a given task. Similarly to boosting algorithms, our approach guarantees a training loss reduction every time a neuron is added to a layer. This greatly differs from most binary activated neural networks training schemes that rely on stochastic gradient descent (circumventing the 0-almost-everywhere derivative problem of the binary activation function by surrogates such as the straight through estimator or continuous binarization). We show that our method provides compact and sparse predictors while obtaining similar performances to state-of-the-art methods for training binary activated networks. ",

To tackle this issue, we propose HoscPool, a clustering-based graph pooling operator that captures higher-order information hierarchically, leading to richer graph representations. In fact, we learn a probabilistic cluster assignment matrix end-to-end by minimising relaxed formulations of motif spectral clustering in our objective function, and we then extend it to a pooling operator. We evaluate HoscPool on graph classification tasks and its clustering component on graphs with ground-truth community structure, achieving best performance. Lastly, we provide a deep empirical analysis of pooling operators' inner functioning. ",

We specifically tackle small-scale wind turbines with permanent magnet synchronous generator, which are well-suited to local and compact production of electrical energy in small scale such as urban and rural infrastructure installations. Through this work, we formulate and implement an RL strategy using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to optimize the long-term energy output of the wind turbine. Our MCMC-based RL algorithm is a model-free and gradient-free algorithm, where the designer does not have to know the precise dynamics of the plant and their uncertainties. The method specifically overcomes the shortcomings typically associated with conventional solutions including but not limited to component aging, modeling errors and inaccuracies in the estimation of wind speed patterns. It has been observed to be especially successful in capturing power from wind transients; it modulates the generator load and hence rotor torque load so that the rotor tip speed reaches the optimum value for the anticipated wind speed. This ratio of rotor tip speed to wind speed is known to be critical in wind power applications. The wind to load energy efficiency of the proposed method is shown to be superior to the classical maximum power point tracking method. ",

On the other hand, our approach does not require any hyper-parameter tuning and, in contrast to previous methods, allows a plain analysis. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees in the case of quantizing single network layers and show that the relative error decays with the number of parameters in the network if the training data behaves well, e.g., if it is sampled from suitable random distributions. The developed method also readily allows the quantization of deep networks by consecutive application to single layers. ",

One solution to increasing the workforce supply is to increase the number of female IT professionals. This is because there is gender imbalance in information technology area. To accomplish this, it is important to suppress the influence of biases, such as the belief that men are more suited for careers in science and technology than women, and to increase the choice of careers available to female professionals. To help suppress the influence of gender bias, we analyzed the relationship between gender and code reading speed in the field of software development. Certain source codes require developers to use substantial memory to properly understand them, such as those with many variables that frequently change values. Several studies have indicated that the performance of memory differs in males and females. To test the veracity of this claim, we analyzed the influence of gender on code-reading speed through an experiment. Pursuant to this, we prepared four programs that required varied amounts of memory to properly understand them. Then, we measured the time required by each of the 17 male and 16 female subjects (33 subjects in total) to comprehend the different programs. The results suggest that there is no explicit difference between male and female subjects in this regard, even in the case of programs that require high memory capacities for proper understanding. ",

Specifically, the effects of instance complexity on pruning performance are not yet fully investigated. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective differentiable network pruning method CAP based on instance complexity-aware filter importance scores. We define instance complexity related weight for each sample by giving higher weights to hard samples, and measure the weighted sum of sample-specific soft masks to model non-uniform contribution of different inputs, which encourages hard samples to dominate the pruning process and the model performance to be well preserved. In addition, we introduce a new regularizer to encourage polarization of the masks, such that a sweet spot can be easily found to identify the filters to be pruned. Performance evaluations on various network architectures and datasets demonstrate CAP has advantages over the state-of-the-arts in pruning large networks. For instance, CAP improves the accuracy of ResNet56 on CIFAR-10 dataset by 0.33% aftering removing 65.64% FLOPs, and prunes 87.75% FLOPs of ResNet50 on ImageNet dataset with only 0.89% Top-1 accuracy loss.

We present novel attacks targeting Q-learning that exploit a vulnerability entailed by this assumption by delaying the reward signal for a limited time period. We consider two types of attack goals: targeted attacks, which aim to cause a target policy to be learned, and untargeted attacks, which simply aim to induce a policy with a low reward. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed attacks through a series of experiments. Our first observation is that reward-delay attacks are extremely effective when the goal is simply to minimize reward. Indeed, we find that even naive baseline reward-delay attacks are also highly successful in minimizing the reward. Targeted attacks, on the other hand, are more challenging, although we nevertheless demonstrate that the proposed approaches remain highly effective at achieving the attacker's targets. In addition, we introduce a second threat model that captures a minimal mitigation that ensures that rewards cannot be used out of sequence. We find that this mitigation remains insufficient to ensure robustness to attacks that delay, but preserve the order, of rewards. ",

    "abstract": "The popularity of Windows attracts the attention of hackers/cyber-attackers, making Windows devices the primary target of malware attacks in recent years. Several sophisticated malware variants and anti-detection methods have been significantly enhanced and as a result, traditional malware detection techniques have become less effective. This work presents MalBehavD-V1, a new behavioural dataset of Windows Application Programming Interface (API) calls extracted from benign and malware executable files using the dynamic analysis approach. In addition, we present MalDetConV, a new automated behaviour-based framework for detecting both existing and zero-day malware attacks. MalDetConv uses a text processing-based encoder to transform features of API calls into a suitable format supported by deep learning models. It then uses a hybrid of convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-BiGRU) automatic feature extractor to select high-level features of the API Calls which are then fed to a fully connected neural network module for malware classification. MalDetConv also uses an explainable component that reveals features that contributed to the final classification outcome, helping the decision-making process for security analysts. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using our MalBehavD-V1 dataset and other benchmark datasets. The detection results demonstrate the effectiveness of MalDetConv over the state-of-the-art techniques with detection accuracy of 96.10%, 95.73%, 98.18%, and 99.93% achieved while detecting unseen malware from MalBehavD-V1, Allan and John, Brazilian, and Ki-D datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that MalDetConv is highly accurate in detecting both known and zero-day malware attacks on Windows devices. ",

Although modern (smart) cameras are widely available and affordable, such technological solutions are impotent in most instances. Furthermore, personnel monitoring CCTV recordings frequently show a belated reaction, resulting in the potential cause of catastrophe to people and property. Thus automated detection of violence for swift actions is very crucial. The proposed solution uses a novel end-to-end deep learning-based video vision transformer (ViViT) that can proficiently discern fights, hostile movements, and violent events in video sequences. The study presents utilizing a data augmentation strategy to overcome the downside of weaker inductive biasness while training vision transformers on a smaller training datasets. The evaluated results can be subsequently sent to local concerned authority, and the captured video can be analyzed. In comparison to state-of-theart (SOTA) approaches the proposed method achieved auspicious performance on some of the challenging benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed significant success in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), which facilitates various downstream tasks. However, attackers may steal such SSL models and commercialize them for profit, making it crucial to protect their Intellectual Property (IP). Most existing IP protection solutions are designed for supervised learning models and cannot be used directly since they require that the models' downstream tasks and target labels be known and available during watermark embedding, which is not always possible in the domain of SSL. To address such a problem especially when downstream tasks are diverse and unknown during watermark embedding, we propose a novel black-box watermarking solution, named SSL-WM, for protecting the ownership of SSL models. SSL-WM maps watermarked inputs by the watermarked encoders into an invariant representation space, which causes any downstream classifiers to produce expected behavior, thus allowing the detection of embedded watermarks. We evaluate SSL-WM on numerous tasks, such as Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), using different SSL models, including contrastive-based and generative-based. Experimental results demonstrate that SSL-WM can effectively verify the ownership of stolen SSL models in various downstream tasks. Furthermore, SSL-WM is robust against model fine-tuning and pruning attacks. Lastly, SSL-WM can also evade detection from evaluated watermark detection approaches, demonstrating its promising application in protecting the IP of SSL models. ",

To tackle this challenging problem, numerous innovative methods have been successively proposed and incorporating linguistic knowledge into STR models has recently become a prominent trend. In this work, we first draw inspiration from the recent progress in Vision Transformer (ViT) to construct a conceptually simple yet powerful vision STR model, which is built upon ViT and outperforms previous state-of-the-art models for scene text recognition, including both pure vision models and language-augmented methods. To integrate linguistic knowledge, we further propose a Multi-Granularity Prediction strategy to inject information from the language modality into the model in an implicit way, i.e. , subword representations (BPE and WordPiece) widely-used in NLP are introduced into the output space, in addition to the conventional character level representation, while no independent language model (LM) is adopted. The resultant algorithm (termed MGP-STR) is able to push the performance envelop of STR to an even higher level. Specifically, it achieves an average recognition accuracy of 93.35% on standard benchmarks. Code will be released soon. ",

Most digital cameras use a nonlinear function to map irradiance, as measured by the sensor to an image intensity used to record the photograph.

In this paper, a new high-performance camera response model that uses a single latent variable and fully connected neural network is proposed. The model is produced using unsupervised learning with an autoencoder on real-world (example) camera responses. Neural architecture searching is then used to find the optimal neural network architecture. A latent distribution learning approach was introduced to constrain the latent distribution. The proposed model achieved state-of-the-art CRF representation accuracy in a number of benchmark tests, but is almost twice as fast as the best current models when performing the maximum likelihood estimation during camera response calibration due to the simple yet efficient model representation.

First, this paper verifies the effectiveness of hierarchical graph pooling methods in traffic prediction tasks. The hierarchical graph pooling methods are contrasted with the other baselines on predictive performance. Second, two mainstream hierarchical graph pooling methods, node clustering pooling and node drop pooling, are applied to analyze advantages and weaknesses in traffic prediction. Finally, for the mentioned graph neural networks, this paper compares the predictive effects of different graph network inputs on traffic prediction accuracy.

    "abstract": "Enabling secure and reliable high-bandwidth lowlatency connectivity between automated vehicles and external servers, intelligent infrastructure, and other road users is a central step in making fully automated driving possible. The availability of data interfaces, which allow this kind of connectivity, has the potential to distinguish artificial agents' capabilities in connected, cooperative, and automated mobility systems from the capabilities of human operators, who do not possess such interfaces. Connected agents can for example share data to build collective environment models, plan collective behavior, and learn collectively from the shared data that is centrally combined. This paper presents multiple solutions that allow connected entities to exchange data. In particular, we propose a new universal communication interface which uses the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to connect agents running the Robot Operating System (ROS). Our work integrates methods to assess the connection quality in the form of various key performance indicators in real-time. We compare a variety of approaches that provide the connectivity necessary for the exemplary use case of edge-cloud lidar object detection in a 5G network. We show that the mean latency between the availability of vehicle-based sensor measurements and the reception of a corresponding object list from the edge-cloud is below 87 ms.

However all the existing works focus on single file retrieval, i.e., each user requests one file, and ignore the security and privacy threats in communications. In this paper we investigate the linear function retrieval problem for hierarchical caching systems with content security and demand privacy, i.e., each user requests a linear combination of files, and meanwhile the files in the library are protected against wiretappers and users' demands are kept unknown to other users and unconnected mirror sites. First we propose a new combination structure named hierarchical placement delivery array (HPDA), which characterizes the data placement and delivery strategy of a coded caching scheme. Then we construct two classes of HPDAs. Consequently two classes of schemes with or without security and privacy are obtained respectively where the first dedicates to minimizing the transmission load for the first hop and can achieve the optimal transmission load for the first hop if ignoring the security and privacy constraints; the second has more flexible parameters on the memory sizes and a lower subpacketization compared with the first one, and achieves a tradeoff between subpacketization and transmission loads.

To deal with the scarce, strongly biased training data of existing single 360{\\deg} image saliency prediction dataset, we also propose a data augmentation method based on the spherical random data rotation. From the predicted saliency map and redundant candidate regions, we obtain the optimal set of RoIs considering both the saliency within a region and the Interaction-Over-Union (IoU) between regions.

However, the ratings are often very sparse as in the research paper domain, due to the huge number of publications growing every year. Therefore, more attention has been drawn to hybrid methods that consider both ratings and content information. Nevertheless, most of the hybrid recommendation approaches that are based on text embedding have utilized bag-of-words techniques, which ignore word order and semantic meaning. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that leverages deep semantic representation of research papers based on social tags assigned by users. The experimental evaluation is performed on CiteULike, a real and publicly available dataset.

We show that this game has specific pure Nash equilibria. In the second resource allocation problem we determine the number of packets that each eMBB user can transmit in a request-grant cycle. We propose a constrained optimization problem to minimize the variance of the number of packets granted to the eMBB users. We show that a water-filling algorithm solves this constrained optimization problem. From simulation, we show that our scheme, consisting of resource allocation according to Nash equilibria of a game, persistent random retransmission of URLLC packets and allocation of eMBB packets by a water-filling algorithm, works better than four other heuristic methods.

We consider that the adaptation from source domain to target domain can be decoupled into two parts: the transfer of global style like texture and color, and the emergence of new entities that do not belong to the source domain. While previous works mainly focus on the style transfer, we propose a novel and concise framework\\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/thevoidname/Generalized-One-shot-GAN-Adaption}} to address the \\textit{generalized one-shot adaption} task for both style and entity transfer, in which a reference image and its binary entity mask are provided. Our core objective is to constrain the gap between the internal distributions of the reference and syntheses by sliced Wasserstein distance. To better achieve it, style fixation is used at first to roughly obtain the exemplary style, and an auxiliary network is introduced to the original generator to disentangle entity and style transfer. Besides, to realize cross-domain correspondence, we propose the variational Laplacian regularization to constrain the smoothness of the adapted generator.

To this day, there is practically no other way of achieving privacy in said platforms other than renouncing their use. However, many users are reluctant in doing so because of convenience or social and professional reasons. In this work, we propose a means of balancing convenience and privacy on FB through obfuscation. We have created MetaPriv, a tool based on simulating user interaction with FB. MetaPriv allows users to add noise interactions to their account so as to lead FB's profiling algorithms astray, and make them draw inaccurate profiles in relation to their interests and habits. To prove our tool's effectiveness, we ran extensive experiments on a dummy account and two existing user accounts. Our results showed that, by using our tool, users can achieve a higher degree of privacy in just a couple of weeks. We believe that MetaPriv can be further developed to accommodate other social media platforms and help users regain their privacy, while maintaining a reasonable level of convenience. To support open science and reproducible research, our source code is publicly available online. ",

In this work, we present a thorough study of real social networks of 13 schools, with more than 3,000 students and 60,000 declared positive and negative relations, including tests for personal traits of all the students. We introduce a metric -- the `triadic influence' -- that measures the influence of nearest-neighbors in the relationships of their contacts. We use neural networks to predict the relationships and to extract the probability that two students are friends or enemies depending on their personal attributes or the triadic influence. We alternatively use a high-dimensional embedding of the network structure to also predict the relationships. Remarkably, the triadic influence (a simple one-dimensional metric) achieves the highest accuracy at predicting the relationship between two students. We postulate that the probabilities extracted from the neural networks -- functions of the triadic influence and the personalities of the students -- control the evolution of real social networks, opening a new avenue for the quantitative study of these systems.

    "abstract": "A fundamental property of deep learning normalization techniques, such as batch normalization, is making the pre-normalization parameters scale invariant. The intrinsic domain of such parameters is the unit sphere, and therefore their gradient optimization dynamics can be represented via spherical optimization with varying effective learning rate (ELR), which was studied previously. In this work, we investigate the properties of training scale-invariant neural networks directly on the sphere using a fixed ELR. We discover three regimes of such training depending on the ELR value: convergence, chaotic equilibrium, and divergence. We study these regimes in detail both on a theoretical examination of a toy example and on a thorough empirical analysis of real scale-invariant deep learning models. Each regime has unique features and reflects specific properties of the intrinsic loss landscape, some of which have strong parallels with previous research on both regular and scale-invariant neural networks training. Finally, we demonstrate how the discovered regimes are reflected in conventional training of normalized networks and how they can be leveraged to achieve better optima. ",

This challenging task requires extracting features for the most salient common objects within a video sequence. This difficulty can be solved by using motion information such as optical flow, but using only the information between adjacent frames results in poor connectivity between distant frames and poor performance. To solve this problem, we propose a novel prototype memory network architecture. The proposed model effectively extracts the RGB and motion information by extracting superpixel-based component prototypes from the input RGB images and optical flow maps. In addition, the model scores the usefulness of the component prototypes in each frame based on a self-learning algorithm and adaptively stores the most useful prototypes in memory and discards obsolete prototypes. We use the prototypes in the memory bank to predict the next query frames mask, which enhances the association between distant frames to help with accurate mask prediction. Our method is evaluated on three datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed model with various ablation studies. ",

    "abstract": "Despite that leveraging the transferability of adversarial examples can attain a fairly high attack success rate for non-targeted attacks, it does not work well in targeted attacks since the gradient directions from a source image to a targeted class are usually different in different DNNs. To increase the transferability of target attacks, recent studies make efforts in aligning the feature of the generated adversarial example with the feature distributions of the targeted class learned from an auxiliary network or a generative adversarial network. However, these works assume that the training dataset is available and require a lot of time to train networks, which makes it hard to apply to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we revisit adversarial examples with targeted transferability from the perspective of universality and find that highly universal adversarial perturbations tend to be more transferable. Based on this observation, we propose the Locality of Images (LI) attack to improve targeted transferability. Specifically, instead of using the classification loss only, LI introduces a feature similarity loss between intermediate features from adversarial perturbed original images and randomly cropped images, which makes the features from adversarial perturbations to be more dominant than that of benign images, hence improving targeted transferability. Through incorporating locality of images into optimizing perturbations, the LI attack emphasizes that targeted perturbations should be universal to diverse input patterns, even local image patches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LI can achieve high success rates for transfer-based targeted attacks. On attacking the ImageNet-compatible dataset, LI yields an improvement of 12\\% compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has affected more than 223 countries worldwide. There is a pressing need for non invasive, low costs and highly scalable solutions to detect COVID-19, especially in low-resource countries where PCR testing is not ubiquitously available. Our aim is to develop a deep learning model identifying COVID-19 using voice data recordings spontaneously provided by the general population (voice recordings and a short questionnaire) via their personal devices. The novelty of this work is in the development of a deep learning model for the identification of COVID-19 patients from voice recordings. Methods: We used the Cambridge University dataset consisting of 893 audio samples, crowd-sourced from 4352 participants that used a COVID-19 Sounds app. Voice features were extracted using a Mel-spectrogram analysis. Based on the voice data, we developed deep learning classification models to detect positive COVID-19 cases. These models included Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We compared their predictive power to baseline classification models, namely Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. Results: LSTM based on a Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features achieved the highest accuracy (89%,) with a sensitivity and specificity of respectively 89% and 89%, The results achieved with the proposed model suggest a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis compared to the results obtained in the state of the art. Conclusion: Deep learning can detect subtle changes in the voice of COVID-19 patients with promising results. As an addition to the current testing techniques this model may aid health professionals in fast diagnosis and tracing of COVID-19 cases using simple voice analysis ",

    "abstract": "Overfitting has long been considered a common issue to large neural network models in sequential recommendation. In our study, an interesting phenomenon is observed that overfitting is temporary. When the model scale is increased, the trend of the performance firstly ascends, then descends (i.e., overfitting) and finally ascends again, which is named as double ascent in this paper. We therefore raise an assumption that a considerably larger model will generalise better with a higher performance. In an extreme case to infinite-width, performance is expected to reach the limit of this specific structure. Unfortunately, it is impractical to directly build a huge model due to the limit of resources. In this paper, we propose the Overparameterised Recommender (OverRec), which utilises a recurrent neural tangent kernel (RNTK) as a similarity measurement for user sequences to successfully bypass the restriction of hardware for huge models. We further prove that the RNTK for the tied input-output embeddings in recommendation is the same as the RNTK for general untied input-output embeddings, which makes RNTK theoretically suitable for recommendation. Since the RNTK is analytically derived, OverRec does not require any training, avoiding physically building the huge model. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets, which verifies the state-of-the-art performance of OverRec. ",

However, inductive biases can be useful in settings when limited data are available or provide additional insight into the underlying data distribution. We present spatial prior attention (SPAN), a framework that takes advantage of consistent spatial and semantic structure in unlabeled image datasets to guide Vision Transformer attention. SPAN operates by regularizing attention masks from separate transformer heads to follow various priors over semantic regions. These priors can be derived from data statistics or a single labeled sample provided by a domain expert. We study SPAN through several detailed real-world scenarios, including medical image analysis and visual quality assurance. We find that the resulting attention masks are more interpretable than those derived from domain-agnostic pretraining. SPAN produces a 58.7 mAP improvement for lung and heart segmentation. We also find that our method yields a 2.2 mAUC improvement compared to domain-agnostic pretraining when transferring the pretrained model to a downstream chest disease classification task. Lastly, we show that SPAN pretraining leads to higher downstream classification performance in low-data regimes compared to domain-agnostic pretraining. ",

In this work, we provide new robust interactive learning algorithms for the Discriminative Feature Feedback model, with mistake bounds that are significantly lower than those of previous robust algorithms for this setting. In the adversarial setting, we reduce the dependence on the number of protocol exceptions from quadratic to linear. In addition, we provide an algorithm for a slightly more restricted model, which obtains an even smaller mistake bound for large models with many exceptions. In the stochastic setting, we provide the first algorithm that converges to the exception rate with a polynomial sample complexity.

    "abstract": "Mis- and disinformation are now a substantial global threat to our security and safety. To cope with the scale of online misinformation, one viable solution is to automate the fact-checking of claims by retrieving and verifying against relevant evidence. While major recent advances have been achieved in pushing forward the automatic fact-verification, a comprehensive evaluation of the possible attack vectors against such systems is still lacking. Particularly, the automated fact-verification process might be vulnerable to the exact disinformation campaigns it is trying to combat. In this work, we assume an adversary that automatically tampers with the online evidence in order to disrupt the fact-checking model via camouflaging the relevant evidence, or planting a misleading one. We first propose an exploratory taxonomy that spans these two targets and the different threat model dimensions. Guided by this, we design and propose several potential attack methods. We show that it is possible to subtly modify claim-salient snippets in the evidence, in addition to generating diverse and claim-aligned evidence. As a result, we highly degrade the fact-checking performance under many different permutations of the taxonomy's dimensions. The attacks are also robust against post-hoc modifications of the claim. Our analysis further hints at potential limitations in models' inference when faced with contradicting evidence. We emphasize that these attacks can have harmful implications on the inspectable and human-in-the-loop usage scenarios of such models, and we conclude by discussing challenges and directions for future defenses.

Thus, it can break the limitation of the fixed geometric structure of the convolution operator, and capture long-range dependencies in both spatial and channel-wise directions. Also, the proposed long-range module can highlight negative relations between pixels, working as a regularization to stabilize training. Furthermore, we propose a new generation strategy through which we introduce metadata into the image generation process to provide basic information about target images, which can stabilize and speed up the training process. Our novel long-range module only introduces few additional parameters and is easily inserted into existing models to capture long-range dependencies.

In this paper, we consider a graph recurrent network for language model pre-training, which builds a graph structure for each sequence with local token-level communications, together with a sentence-level representation decoupled from other tokens. The original model performs well in domain-specific text classification under supervised training, however, its potential in learning transfer knowledge by self-supervised way has not been fully exploited. We fill this gap by optimizing the architecture and verifying its effectiveness in more general language understanding tasks, for both English and Chinese languages. As for model efficiency, instead of the quadratic complexity in Transformer-based models, our model has linear complexity and performs more efficiently during inference. Moreover, we find that our model can generate more diverse outputs with less contextualized feature redundancy than existing attention-based models. ",

However, the high computational cost of AT prohibits the deployment of large-scale AT on resource-constrained edge devices, e.g., with limited computing power and small memory footprint, in Federated Learning (FL) applications. Very few previous studies have tried to tackle these constraints in FL at the same time. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Federated Adversarial Decoupled Learning (FADE) to enable AT on resource-constrained edge devices in FL. FADE reduces the computation and memory usage by applying Decoupled Greedy Learning (DGL) to federated adversarial training such that each client only needs to perform AT on a small module of the entire model in each communication round. In addition, we improve vanilla DGL by adding an auxiliary weight decay to alleviate objective inconsistency and achieve better performance. FADE offers a theoretical guarantee for the adversarial robustness and convergence. The experimental results also show that FADE can significantly reduce the computing resources consumed by AT while maintaining almost the same accuracy and robustness as fully joint training. ",

However, such approximations can be inaccurate under realistic conditions where, for example, the nonlinear nature of the network is captured, and the behaviour of flexible units is constrained. This letter demonstrates, using a small ADN example with four flexible units and considering only nonlinearities from the network, that reaching the full P-Q flexibility areas would require perfect coordination of units and high ramping rates. Without these requirements, the P-Q areas become nonconvex. Thus, if the effects of nonlinearities and nonconvexities are ignored, existing approaches in the literature can result in overestimation of ADN flexibility and give rise to impractical solutions, hampering coordination between transmission and distribution system operators.

This is particularly the case for traffic forecasting, where GNN models use the graph structure of road networks to account for spatial correlation between links and nodes. Recent solutions are either based on complex graph operations or avoiding predefined graphs. This paper proposes a new sequence-to-sequence architecture to extract the spatiotemporal correlation at multiple levels of abstraction using GNN-RNN cells with sparse architecture to decrease training time compared to more complex designs. Encoding the same input sequence through multiple encoders, with an incremental increase in encoder layers, enables the network to learn general and detailed information through multilevel abstraction. We further present a new benchmark dataset of street-level segment traffic data from Montreal, Canada. Unlike highways, urban road segments are cyclic and characterized by complicated spatial dependencies. Experimental results on the METR-LA benchmark highway and our MSLTD street-level segment datasets demonstrate that our model improves performance by more than 7% for one-hour prediction compared to the baseline methods while reducing computing resource requirements by more than half compared to other competing methods.

    "abstract": "The field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made considerable progress towards controlling challenging multi-agent systems by employing various learning methods. Numerous of these approaches focus on empirical and algorithmic aspects of the MARL problems and lack a rigorous theoretical foundation. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) on the other hand provide a scalable and mathematically well-founded approach to learning problems that involve a large number of connected agents. In standard GMFGs, the connections between agents are undirected, unweighted and invariant over time. Our paper introduces colored digraphon mean field games (CDMFGs) which allow for weighted and directed links between agents that are also adaptive over time. Thus, CDMFGs are able to model more complex connections than standard GMFGs. Besides a rigorous theoretical analysis including both existence and convergence guarantees, we provide a learning scheme and illustrate our findings with an epidemics model and a model of the systemic risk in financial markets.

The challenge focused on the automatic detection of all cause-effect-signal spans present in the sentence from news-media. We detect cause-effect-signal spans in a sentence using T5 -- a pre-trained autoregressive language model. We iteratively identify all cause-effect-signal span triplets, always conditioning the prediction of the next triplet on the previously predicted ones. To predict the triplet itself, we consider different causal relationships such as cause$\\rightarrow$effect$\\rightarrow$signal. Each triplet component is generated via a language model conditioned on the sentence, the previous parts of the current triplet, and previously predicted triplets. Despite training on an extremely small dataset of 160 samples, our approach achieved competitive performance, being placed second in the competition.

We address the Causal Relation Identification (CRI) task by exploiting a set of simple yet complementary techniques for fine-tuning language models (LMs) on a small number of annotated examples (i.e., a few-shot configuration). We follow a prompt-based prediction approach for fine-tuning LMs in which the CRI task is treated as a masked language modeling problem (MLM). This approach allows LMs natively pre-trained on MLM problems to directly generate textual responses to CRI-specific prompts. We compare the performance of this method against ensemble techniques trained on the entire dataset. Our best-performing submission was trained only with 256 instances per class, a small portion of the entire dataset, and yet was able to obtain the second-best precision (0.82), third-best accuracy (0.82), and an F1-score (0.85) very close to what was reported by the winner team (0.86).

    "title": "Reconstruction Attacks on Aggressive Relaxations of Differential Privacy",
    "abstract": "Differential privacy is a widely accepted formal privacy definition that allows aggregate information about a dataset to be released while controlling privacy leakage for individuals whose records appear in the data. Due to the unavoidable tension between privacy and utility, there have been many works trying to relax the requirements of differential privacy to achieve greater utility. One class of relaxation, which is starting to gain support outside the privacy community is embodied by the definitions of individual differential privacy (IDP) and bootstrap differential privacy (BDP). The original version of differential privacy defines a set of neighboring database pairs and achieves its privacy guarantees by requiring that each pair of neighbors should be nearly indistinguishable to an attacker. The privacy definitions we study, however, aggressively reduce the set of neighboring pairs that are protected. Both IDP and BDP define a measure of \"privacy loss\" that satisfies formal privacy properties such as postprocessing invariance and composition, and achieve dramatically better utility than the traditional variants of differential privacy. However, there is a significant downside - we show that they allow a significant portion of the dataset to be reconstructed using algorithms that have arbitrarily low privacy loss under their privacy accounting rules. We demonstrate these attacks using the preferred mechanisms of these privacy definitions. In particular, we design a set of queries that, when protected by these mechanisms with high noise settings (i.e., with claims of very low privacy loss), yield more precise information about the dataset than if they were not protected at all.

We find that LPCMCI performs much better than a random algorithm mimicking not knowing anything but is still far from optimal detection.

    "abstract": "In recent decades, digital image processing has gained enormous popularity. Consequently, a number of data compression strategies have been put forth, with the goal of minimizing the amount of information required to represent images. Among them, JPEG compression is one of the most popular methods that has been widely applied in multimedia and digital applications. The periodic nature of DFT makes it impossible to meet the periodic condition of an image's opposing edges without producing severe artifacts, which lowers the image's perceptual visual quality. On the other hand, deep learning has recently achieved outstanding results for applications like speech recognition, image reduction, and natural language processing. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have received more attention than most other types of deep neural networks. The use of convolution in feature extraction results in a less redundant feature map and a smaller dataset, both of which are crucial for image compression. In this work, an effective image compression method is purposed using autoencoders. The study's findings revealed a number of important trends that suggested better reconstruction along with good compression can be achieved using autoencoders. ",

In this paper, we propose the implicit full waveform inversion (IFWI) algorithm using continuously and implicitly defined deep neural representations. Compared to FWI, which is sensitive to the initial model, IFWI benefits from the increased degrees of freedom with deep learning optimization, thus allowing to start from a random initialization, which greatly reduces the risk of non-uniqueness and being trapped in local minima. Both theoretical and experimental analyses indicates that, given a random initial model, IFWI is able to converge to the global minimum and produce a high-resolution image of subsurface with fine structures. In addition, uncertainty analysis of IFWI can be easily performed by approximating Bayesian inference with various deep learning approaches, which is analyzed in this paper by adding dropout neurons. Furthermore, IFWI has a certain degree of robustness and strong generalization ability that are exemplified in the experiments of various 2D geological models. With proper setup, IFWI can also be well suited for multi-scale joint geophysical inversion. ",

The proposed approach is to linearise the dynamics around the baseline values of its arguments, and then to solve for the corrective input required to transfer the perturbed trajectory to precisely known or desired values at specific time points, i.e., the interim points. Depending on the type of decision variables to adjust, parameter correction and control function correction methods are developed. These incremental correction methods can be utilised as a means to compensate for the prediction errors of pre-trained neural networks in real-time applications where high accuracy of the prediction of dynamical systems at prescribed time points is imperative. In this regard, the online update approach can be useful for enhancing overall targeting accuracy of finite-horizon control subject to point constraints using a neural policy. Numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in an application to a powered descent problem at Mars. ",

In general, the number of states of the network grows exponentially with its size, and a master equation description suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Almost all methods widely used in practice are versions of the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), which is notoriously known for its slow convergence. In this paper we numerically solve the chemical master equation for an SIR model on a general network using recently proposed tensor product algorithms. In numerical experiments we show that tensor product algorithms converge much faster than SSA and deliver more accurate results, which becomes particularly important for uncovering the probabilities of rare events, e.g. for number of infected people to exceed a (high) threshold.

We modified the U-Net and Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) with customized loss functions as a training strategy to reduce fragmentation and other misalignments. In cGAN, the discriminator and generator trained against each other like an adversarial competition. The generator produces dense predictions. The discriminator works as a high-level consistency check, in our case, pushing the generator to predict activities with reasonable duration. The model trained with cGAN shows better or comparable performance in the cow, pig, and UCI HAPT dataset.

We evaluate all approaches on two large-scale energy consumption datasets with more than 50,000 events of 44 appliances.

Therefore, increasing the robustness of machine learning models in predicting eye-tracking positions from EEG data is integral for both research and consumer use. Previously, we compared the performance of classifiers trained solely on finer-grain data to those trained solely on coarse-grain. Results indicated that despite the overall improvement in robustness, the performance of the fine-grain trained models decreased, compared to coarse-grain trained models, when the testing and training set contained the same distributional patterns \\cite{vectorbased}. This paper aims to address this case by training models using datasets of mixed data complexity to determine the ideal distribution of fine- and coarse-grain data. We train machine learning models utilizing a mixed dataset composed of both fine- and coarse-grain data and then compare the accuracies to models trained using solely fine- or coarse-grain data. For our purposes, finer-grain data refers to data collected using more complex methods whereas coarser-grain data refers to data collected using more simple methods. We apply covariate distributional shifts to test for the susceptibility of each training set. Our results indicated that the optimal training dataset for EEG-ET classification is not composed of solely fine- or coarse-grain data, but rather a mix of the two, leaning towards finer-grain. ",

The sensors most commonly used for passive Wi-Fi sensing are based on passive Wi-Fi radar (PWR) and channel state information (CSI) data, however current systems do not effectively exploit the information acquired through multiple sensors to recognise the different activities. In this paper, we explore new properties of the Transformer architecture for multimodal sensor fusion. We study different signal processing techniques to extract multiple image-based features from PWR and CSI data such as spectrograms, scalograms and Markov transition field (MTF). We first propose the Fusion Transformer, an attention-based model for multimodal and multi-sensor fusion. Experimental results show that our Fusion Transformer approach can achieve competitive results compared to a ResNet architecture but with much fewer resources. To further improve our model, we propose a simple and effective framework for multimodal and multi-sensor self-supervised learning (SSL). The self-supervised Fusion Transformer outperforms the baselines, achieving a F1-score of 95.9%. Finally, we show how this approach significantly outperforms the others when trained with as little as 1% (2 minutes) of labelled training data to 20% (40 minutes) of labelled training data. ",

In this paper, we concentrate on the tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD), which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and only provides the definite and limited tensor low-rank prior in the FFT domain, heavily reliant upon how closely the data and the FFT domain match up. By generalizing the FFT into an arbitrary unitary transformation of the transformed t-SVD and proposing the transformed tensor nuclear norm (TTNN), we introduce a flexible model based on TTNN with the ability to exploit the tensor low-rank prior of a transformed domain in a larger transformation space and elaborately design an iterative optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is further unrolled into a model-based deep unrolling reconstruction network to learn the transformed tensor low-rank prior (T$^2$LR-Net). The convolutional neural network (CNN) is incorporated within the T$^2$LR-Net to learn the best-matched transform from the dynamic MR image dataset. The unrolling reconstruction network also provides a new perspective on the low-rank prior utilization by exploiting the low-rank prior in the CNN-extracted feature domain.
