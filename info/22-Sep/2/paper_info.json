    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved excellent performance in various fields. However, DNNs' vulnerability to Adversarial Examples (AE) hinders their deployments to safety-critical applications. This paper presents a novel AE detection framework, named BEYOND, for trustworthy predictions. BEYOND performs the detection by distinguishing the AE's abnormal relation with its augmented versions, i.e. neighbors, from two prospects: representation similarity and label consistency. An off-the-shelf Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model is used to extract the representation and predict the label for its highly informative representation capacity compared to supervised learning models. For clean samples, their representations and predictions are closely consistent with their neighbors, whereas those of AEs differ greatly. Furthermore, we explain this observation and show that by leveraging this discrepancy BEYOND can effectively detect AEs. We develop a rigorous justification for the effectiveness of BEYOND. Furthermore, as a plug-and-play model, BEYOND can easily cooperate with the Adversarial Trained Classifier (ATC), achieving the state-of-the-art (SOTA) robustness accuracy. Experimental results show that BEYOND outperforms baselines by a large margin, especially under adaptive attacks. Empowered by the robust relation net built on SSL, we found that BEYOND outperforms baselines in terms of both detection ability and speed. Our code will be publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "Minimum flow decomposition (MFD) -- the problem of finding a minimum set of weighted source-to-sink paths that perfectly decomposes a flow -- is a classical problem in Computer Science, and variants of it are powerful models in different fields such as Bioinformatics and Transportation. Even on acyclic graphs, the problem is NP-hard, and most practical solutions have been via heuristics or approximations. While there is an extensive body of research on acyclic graphs, currently, there is no \\emph{exact} solution on graphs with cycles. In this paper, we present the first ILP formulation for three natural variants of the MFD problem in graphs with cycles, asking for a decomposition consisting only of weighted source-to-sink paths or cycles, trails, and walks, respectively. On three datasets of increasing levels of complexity from both Bioinformatics and Transportation, our approaches solve any instance in under 10 minutes.

    "abstract": "Predicting the possible future trajectories of the surrounding dynamic agents is an essential requirement in autonomous driving. These trajectories mainly depend on the surrounding static environment, as well as the past movements of those dynamic agents. Furthermore, the multimodal nature of agent intentions makes the trajectory prediction problem more challenging.

In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning based framework for multimodal trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, which considers the physical properties of the target and surrounding vehicles such as the object class and their physical dimensions through a weighted attention module, that improves the accuracy of the predictions. Our model has achieved the highest results in the nuScenes trajectory prediction benchmark, out of the models which use rasterized maps to input environment information.

    "abstract": "Current self-supervised approaches for skeleton action representation learning often focus on constrained scenarios, where videos and skeleton data are recorded in laboratory settings. When dealing with estimated skeleton data in real-world videos, such methods perform poorly due to the large variations across subjects and camera viewpoints. To address this issue, we introduce ViA, a novel View-Invariant Autoencoder for self-supervised skeleton action representation learning. ViA leverages motion retargeting between different human performers as a pretext task, in order to disentangle the latent action-specific `Motion' features on top of the visual representation of a 2D or 3D skeleton sequence. Such `Motion' features are invariant to skeleton geometry and camera view and allow ViA to facilitate both, cross-subject and cross-view action classification tasks. We conduct a study focusing on transfer-learning for skeleton-based action recognition with self-supervised pre-training on real-world data (e.g., Posetics). Our results showcase that skeleton representations learned from ViA are generic enough to improve upon state-of-the-art action classification accuracy, not only on 3D laboratory datasets such as NTU-RGB+D 60 and NTU-RGB+D 120, but also on real-world datasets where only 2D data are accurately estimated, e.g., Toyota Smarthome, UAV-Human and Penn Action.

Unlike prior work, therefore, we seek to leverage the information that can be gained from looking at association networks of individuals derived from textual evidence in order to disambiguate names. We combine BERT-based mention representations with a variety of graph induction strategies and experiment with supervised and unsupervised cluster inference methods. We experiment with data consisting of lists of names from two domains: bibliographic citations from CrossRef and chains of transmission (isnads) from classical Arabic histories. We find that in-domain language model pretraining can significantly improve mention representations, especially for larger corpora, and that the availability of bibliographic information, such as publication venue or title, can also increase performance on this task. We also present a novel supervised cluster inference model which gives competitive performance for little computational effort, making it ideal for situations where individuals must be identified without relying on an exhaustive authority list.

However, the cyber security breach classification is still a difficult problem, even using cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. In this paper, we study the multi-class classification problem in cyber security for attack detection. A challenging multi-node data-censoring case is considered. In such a case, data within each data center/node cannot be shared while the local data is incomplete. Particularly, local nodes contain only a part of the multiple classes. In order to train a global multi-class classifier without sharing the raw data across all nodes, the main result of our study is designing a multi-node multi-class classification ensemble approach. By gathering the estimated parameters of the binary classifiers and data densities from each local node, the missing information for each local node is completed to build the global multi-class classifier. Numerical experiments are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under the multi-node data-censoring case. Under such a case, we even show the out-performance of the proposed approach over the full-data approach. ",

    "abstract": "Long-latency load requests continue to limit the performance of high-performance processors. To increase the latency tolerance of a processor, architects have primarily relied on two key techniques: sophisticated data prefetchers and large on-chip caches. In this work, we show that: 1) even a sophisticated state-of-the-art prefetcher can only predict half of the off-chip load requests on average across a wide range of workloads, and 2) due to the increasing size and complexity of on-chip caches, a large fraction of the latency of an off-chip load request is spent accessing the on-chip cache hierarchy. The goal of this work is to accelerate off-chip load requests by removing the on-chip cache access latency from their critical path. To this end, we propose a new technique called Hermes, whose key idea is to: 1) accurately predict which load requests might go off-chip, and 2) speculatively fetch the data required by the predicted off-chip loads directly from the main memory, while also concurrently accessing the cache hierarchy for such loads. To enable Hermes, we develop a new lightweight, perceptron-based off-chip load prediction technique that learns to identify off-chip load requests using multiple program features (e.g., sequence of program counters). For every load request, the predictor observes a set of program features to predict whether or not the load would go off-chip. If the load is predicted to go off-chip, Hermes issues a speculative request directly to the memory controller once the load's physical address is generated. If the prediction is correct, the load eventually misses the cache hierarchy and waits for the ongoing speculative request to finish, thus hiding the on-chip cache hierarchy access latency from the critical path of the off-chip load. Our evaluation shows that Hermes significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art baseline. We open-source Hermes. ",

This work illustrates how a dataset of Geo-tagged images from a mobile phone camera, can be used in navigating to the most convenient public parking lot in Johannesburg with an available parking space, detected by a neural network powered-public camera. The images are used to fine-tune a Detectron2 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset to demonstrate detection and segmentation of vacant parking spots, we then add the parking lot's corresponding longitude and latitude coordinates to recommend the most convenient parking lot to the driver based on the Haversine distance and number of available parking spots. Using the VGG Image Annotation (VIA) we use 76 images from an expanding dataset of images, and annotate these with polygon outlines of the four different types of objects of interest: cars, open parking spots, people, and car number plates. We use the segmentation model to ensure number plates can be occluded in production for car registration anonymity purposes. We get an 89% and 82% intersection over union cover score on cars and parking spaces respectively.

    "abstract": "The recent advancement in language representation modeling has broadly affected the design of dense retrieval models. In particular, many of the high-performing dense retrieval models evaluate representations of query and document using BERT, and subsequently apply a cosine-similarity based scoring to determine the relevance. BERT representations, however, are known to follow an anisotropic distribution of a narrow cone shape and such an anisotropic distribution can be undesirable for the cosine-similarity based scoring. In this work, we first show that BERT-based DR also follows an anisotropic distribution. To cope with the problem, we introduce unsupervised post-processing methods of Normalizing Flow and whitening, and develop token-wise method in addition to the sequence-wise method for applying the post-processing methods to the representations of dense retrieval models. We show that the proposed methods can effectively enhance the representations to be isotropic, then we perform experiments with ColBERT and RepBERT to show that the performance (NDCG at 10) of document re-ranking can be improved by 5.17\\%$\\sim$8.09\\% for ColBERT and 6.88\\%$\\sim$22.81\\% for RepBERT. To examine the potential of isotropic representation for improving the robustness of DR models, we investigate out-of-distribution tasks where the test dataset differs from the training dataset. The results show that isotropic representation can achieve a generally improved performance. For instance, when training dataset is MS-MARCO and test dataset is Robust04, isotropy post-processing can improve the baseline performance by up to 24.98\\%. Furthermore, we show that an isotropic model trained with an out-of-distribution dataset can even outperform a baseline model trained with the in-distribution dataset. ",

    "abstract": "High-performance traffic flow prediction model designing, a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System, is a long-standing but still challenging task for industrial and academic communities. The lack of integration between physical principles and data-driven models is an important reason for limiting the development of this field. In the literature, physics-based methods can usually provide a clear interpretation of the dynamic process of traffic flow systems but are with limited accuracy, while data-driven methods, especially deep learning with black-box structures, can achieve improved performance but can not be fully trusted due to lack of a reasonable physical basis. To bridge the gap between purely data-driven and physics-driven approaches, we propose a physics-guided deep learning model named Spatio-Temporal Differential Equation Network (STDEN), which casts the physical mechanism of traffic flow dynamics into a deep neural network framework. Specifically, we assume the traffic flow on road networks is driven by a latent potential energy field (like water flows are driven by the gravity field), and model the spatio-temporal dynamic process of the potential energy field as a differential equation network. STDEN absorbs both the performance advantage of data-driven models and the interpretability of physics-based models, so is named a physics-guided prediction model. Experiments on three real-world traffic datasets in Beijing show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. A case study further verifies that STDEN can capture the mechanism of urban traffic and generate accurate predictions with physical meaning. The proposed framework of differential equation network modeling may also cast light on other similar applications. ",

In the SVC process, the encoding and decoding stages are jointly modeled as a standard compressed sensing (CS) problem. Hence, this paper aims at improving the decoding performance of SVC by optimizing the spreading matrix (i.e. measurement matrix in CS). To this end, two greedy algorithms to minimize the mutual coherence value of the spreading matrix in SVC are proposed. Specially, for practical applications, the spreading matrices are further required to be bipolar whose entries are constrained as +1 or -1. As a result, the optimized spreading matrices are highly efficient for storage, computation, and hardware realization. Simulation results reveal that, compared with the existing work, the block error rate (BLER) performance of SVC can be improved significantly with the optimized spreading matrices. ",

Despite their potential, they are computationally expensive and pose a major drawback, which limits utilizing these networks efficiently on more complex datasets. The current CapsNet models only compare their performance with the capsule baselines and do not perform at the same level as deep CNN-based models on complicated tasks. This paper proposes an efficient way for learning capsules that detect atomic parts of an input image, through a group of SubCapsules, upon which an input vector is projected. Subsequently, we present the Wasserstein Embedding Module that first measures the dissimilarity between the input and components modeled by the SubCapsules, and then finds their degree of alignment based on the learned optimal transport. This strategy leverages new insights on defining alignment between the input and SubCapsules based on the similarity between their respective component distributions. Our proposed model, (i) is lightweight and allows to apply capsules for more complex vision tasks; (ii) performs better than or at par with CNN-based models on these challenging tasks.

    "abstract": "The recently released IEEE 802.15.6 standard specifies several physical (PHY) layers and medium access control (MAC) layer protocols for variety of medical and non-medical applications of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). The medical applications of WBAN has several obligatory requirements and constrains viz. high reliability, strict delay deadlines and low power consumption. The standard IEEE 802.15.6 MAC scheme is not able to fulfil the all requirements of medical applications of WBAN. To address this issue we propose an IEEE 802.15.6-based MAC scheme that is the modification of superframe structure, user priorities and access mechanism of standard IEEE 802.15.6 MAC scheme. The proposed superframe has three access phases: random access phases (RAP), manage access phases (MAP) and contention access phase (CAP). The proposed four user priorities nodes access the channel during RAP using CAMA/CA mechanism with a large value of contention window. The proposed MAC scheme uses RTS/CTS access mechanism instead of basic access mechanism to mitigate the effect of hidden and expose terminal problem. Moreover, we develop an analytical model to evaluate the performance of proposed MAC scheme and solve the analytical model using Maple. The results show that the modified IEEE 802.15.6 MAC scheme achieve the better performance in terms of reliability, throughput, average access delay, energy consumption, channel utilization and fairness compared to standard IEEE 802.15.6 MAC scheme in E-health applications.

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity has become a primary global concern with the rapid increase in security attacks and data breaches. Artificial intelligence is promising to help humans analyzing and identifying attacks. However, labeling millions of packets for supervised learning is never easy. This study aims to leverage transfer learning technique that stores the knowledge gained from well-defined attack lifecycle documents and applies it to hundred thousands of unlabeled attacks (packets) for identifying their attack tactics. We anticipate the knowledge of an attack is well-described in the documents, and the cutting edge transformer-based language model can embed the knowledge into a high-dimensional latent space. Then, reusing the information from the language model for the learning of attack tactic carried by packets to improve the learning efficiency. We propose a system, PELAT, that fine-tunes BERT model with 1,417 articles from MITRE ATT&CK lifecycle framework to enhance its attack knowledge (including syntax used and semantic meanings embedded). PELAT then transfers its knowledge to perform semi-supervised learning for unlabeled packets to generate their tactic labels. Further, when a new attack packet arrives, the packet payload will be processed by the PELAT language model with a downstream classifier to predict its tactics. In this way, we can effectively reduce the burden of manually labeling big datasets. In a one-week honeypot attack dataset (227 thousand packets per day), PELAT performs 99% of precision, recall, and F1 on testing dataset. PELAT can infer over 99% of tactics on two other testing datasets (while nearly 90% of tactics are identified). ",

    "abstract": "Privacy issues on social networks have been extensively discussed in recent years. The user identity linkage (UIL) task, aiming at finding corresponding users across different social networks, would be a threat to privacy if unethically applied. The sensitive user information might be detected through connected identities. A promising and novel solution to this issue is to design an adversarial strategy to degrade the matching performance of UIL models. However, most existing adversarial attacks on graphs are designed for models working in a single network, while UIL is a cross-network learning task. Meanwhile, privacy protection against UIL works unilaterally in real-world scenarios, i.e., the service provider can only add perturbations to its own network to protect its users from being linked. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel adversarial attack strategy that poisons one target network to prevent its nodes from being linked to other networks by UIL algorithms. Specifically, we reformalize the UIL problem in the perspective of kernelized topology consistency and convert the attack objective to maximizing the structural changes within the target network before and after attacks. A novel graph kernel is then defined with Earth mover's distance (EMD) on the edge-embedding space. In terms of efficiency, a fast attack strategy is proposed by greedy searching and replacing EMD with its lower bound. Results on three real-world datasets indicate that the proposed attacks can best fool a wide range of UIL models and reach a balance between attack effectiveness and imperceptibility. ",

Recently, a pre-trained deep contextualized text encoder such as BERT has shown its potential in improving natural language tasks including abstractive summarization. Existing approaches in dialogue summarization focus on incorporating a large language model into summarization task trained on large-scale corpora consisting of news articles rather than dialogues of multiple speakers. In this paper, we introduce self-supervised methods to compensate shortcomings to train a dialogue summarization model. Our principle is to detect incoherent information flows using pretext dialogue text to enhance BERT's ability to contextualize the dialogue text representations. We build and fine-tune an abstractive dialogue summarization model on a shared encoder-decoder architecture using the enhanced BERT. We empirically evaluate our abstractive dialogue summarizer with the SAMSum corpus, a recently introduced dataset with abstractive dialogue summaries. All of our methods have contributed improvements to abstractive summary measured in ROUGE scores. Through an extensive ablation study, we also present a sensitivity analysis to critical model hyperparameters, probabilities of switching utterances and masking interlocutors. ",

Our generative framework consists of a transformer decoder that is used in a sliding window manner to predict a field of indices, with each index encoding a representation of the local neighborhood. The semantics of each index is determined by a dictionary of context vectors. The index field is then input to a decoder to compute the street graph.

    "abstract": "The systematic study of alternating minimization problems was initiated by Csisz\\'ar and Tusn\\'ady. The area gained renewed interest recently due to its applications in machine learning. We will use this theory in the context of conditional graph entropy. The unconditioned version of this entropy notion was introduced by K\\\"orner. The conditional version is important due to a result of Orlitsky and Roche showing that the minimal rate for a natural functional compression problem (with side information at the receiver) is given by conditional graph entropy. In this paper we show that conditional graph entropy can be formulated as an alternating minimization problem. More specifically, we present a function of two (vector-valued) variables such that, fixing any of the two variables, the optimal choice for the other variable can be expressed explicitly. Then minimizing in the fixed variable gives us the global minimum. Depending on which variable we start with, we get two different minimization problems with the same optimum. In one case we get back the original formula for conditional graph entropy. In the other we obtain a new formula. This new formula shows that conditional graph entropy is part of a more general framework: the solution of an optimization problem over a so-called convex corner. In the unconditioned case (i.e., graph entropy) this was known due to Csisz\\'ar, K\\\"orner, Lov\\'asz, Marton, and Simonyi. In that case the role of the convex corner was played by the so-called vertex packing polytope. In the conditional version it is a more intricate convex body but the function to minimize is the same. Furthermore, if we alternate in optimally choosing one variable given the other, then we get a decreasing sequence of function values converging to the minimum, which allows one to numerically compute (conditional) graph entropy.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has achieved great success in laser-based collision avoidance works because the laser can sense accurate depth information without too much redundant data, which can maintain the robustness of the algorithm when it is migrated from the simulation environment to the real world. However, high-cost laser devices are not only difficult to deploy for a large scale of robots but also demonstrate unsatisfactory robustness towards the complex obstacles, including irregular obstacles, e.g., tables, chairs, and shelves, as well as complex ground and special materials. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular camera-based complex obstacle avoidance framework. Particularly, we innovatively transform the captured RGB images to pseudo-laser measurements for efficient deep reinforcement learning. Compared to the traditional laser measurement captured at a certain height that only contains one-dimensional distance information away from the neighboring obstacles, our proposed pseudo-laser measurement fuses the depth and semantic information of the captured RGB image, which makes our method effective for complex obstacles. We also design a feature extraction guidance module to weight the input pseudo-laser measurement, and the agent has more reasonable attention for the current state, which is conducive to improving the accuracy and efficiency of the obstacle avoidance policy.

    "abstract": "Supervised machine learning provides state-of-the-art solutions to a wide range of computer vision problems. However, the need for copious labelled training data limits the capabilities of these algorithms in scenarios where such input is scarce or expensive. Self-supervised learning offers a way to lower the need for manually annotated data by pretraining models for a specific domain on unlabelled data. In this approach, labelled data are solely required to fine-tune models for downstream tasks. Medical image segmentation is a field where labelling data requires expert knowledge and collecting large labelled datasets is challenging; therefore, self-supervised learning algorithms promise substantial improvements in this field. Despite this, self-supervised learning algorithms are used rarely to pretrain medical image segmentation networks. In this paper, we elaborate and analyse the effectiveness of supervised and self-supervised pretraining approaches on downstream medical image segmentation, focusing on convergence and data efficiency. We find that self-supervised pretraining on natural images and target-domain-specific images leads to the fastest and most stable downstream convergence. In our experiments on the ACDC cardiac segmentation dataset, this pretraining approach achieves 4-5 times faster fine-tuning convergence compared to an ImageNet pretrained model. We also show that this approach requires less than five epochs of pretraining on domain-specific data to achieve such improvement in the downstream convergence time. Finally, we find that, in low-data scenarios, supervised ImageNet pretraining achieves the best accuracy, requiring less than 100 annotated samples to realise close to minimal error. ",

Based on the interviews, we developed DramatVis Personae (DVP), a visual analytics tool that allows writers to assign social identities to characters, and evaluate how characters and different intersectional social identities are represented in the story. To evaluate DVP, we first conducted think-aloud sessions with three writers and found that DVP is easy-to-use, naturally integrates into the writing process, and could potentially help writers in several critical bias identification tasks. We then conducted a follow-up user study with 11 writers and found that participants could answer questions related to bias detection more efficiently using DVP in comparison to a simple text editor.

In fields such as epidemiology, where researchers seek answers to challenging causal questions, a statistical methodology known as Causal Inference has addressed similar problems, enabling the inference of causal conclusions from noisy, biased, and sparse data instead of costly experiments. This paper introduces the Causal Testing Framework: a framework that uses Causal Inference techniques to establish causal effects from existing data, enabling users to conduct software testing activities concerning the effect of a change, such as Metamorphic Testing and Sensitivity Analysis, a posteriori. We present three case studies covering real-world scientific models, demonstrating how the Causal Testing Framework can infer test outcomes from reused, confounded test data to provide an efficient solution for testing scientific modelling software.

In this work, we present an approach to enable OOD detection for 2D object detection by employing the margin entropy (ME) loss. The proposed method is easy to implement and can be applied to most existing object detection architectures. In addition, we introduce Separability as a metric for detecting OOD samples in object detection. We show that a CNN trained with the ME loss significantly outperforms OOD detection using standard confidence scores. At the same time, the runtime of the underlying object detection framework remains constant rendering the ME loss a powerful tool to enable OOD detection. ",

    "abstract": "To enhance the compatibility in the version control of Java Third-party Libraries (TPLs), Maven adopts Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to standardize the underlying meaning of versions, but users could still confront abnormal execution and crash after upgrades even if compilation and linkage succeed. It is caused by semantic breaking (SemB) issues, such that APIs directly used by users have identical signatures but inconsistent semantics across upgrades. To strengthen compliance with SemVer rules, developers and users should be alerted of such issues. Unfortunately, it is challenging to detect them statically, because semantic changes in the internal methods of APIs are difficult to capture. Dynamic testing can confirmingly uncover some, but it is limited by inadequate coverage. To detect SemB issues over compatible upgrades (Patch and Minor) by SemVer rules, we conduct an empirical study on 180 SemB issues to understand the root causes, inspired by which, we propose Sembid (Semantic Breaking Issue Detector) to statically detect such issues of TPLs for developers and users. Since APIs are directly used by users, Sembid detects and reports SemB issues based on APIs. For a pair of APIs, Sembid walks through the call chains originating from the API to locate breaking changes by measuring semantic diff. Then, Sembid checks if the breaking changes can affect API's output along call chains. The evaluation showed Sembid achieved 90.26% recall and 81.29% precision and outperformed other API checkers on SemB API detection. We also revealed Sembid detected over 3 times more SemB APIs with better coverage than unit tests, the commonly used solution. Furthermore, we carried out an empirical study on 1,629,589 APIs from 546 version pairs of top Java libraries and found there were 2-4 times more SemB APIs than those with signature-based issues. ",

We observe that simple LBP-based systems are already quite accurate in the intra-dataset setting, but struggle with generalization, a phenomenon that is partially mitigated by fusing together several of those systems at score-level. We conclude that a pretrained ResNet effective for GAN image detection is the most effective overall, reaching close to perfect accuracy. We note however that LBP-based systems maintain a level of interest : additionally to their lower computational requirements and increased interpretability with respect to CNNs, LBP+ResNet fusions sometimes also showcase increased performance versus ResNet-only, hinting that LBP-based systems can focus on meaningful signal that is not necessarily picked up by the CNN detector.

    "abstract": "One of the main methods for semantic interpretation of text is mapping it into a vector in some embedding space. Such vectors can then be used for a variety of text processing tasks. Recently, most embedding spaces are a product of training large language models. One major drawback of this type of representation is its incomprehensibility to humans. Understanding the embedding space is crucial for several important needs, including the need to explain the decision of a system that uses the embedding, the need to debug the embedding method and compare it to alternatives, and the need to detect biases hidden in the model. In this paper, we present a novel method of transforming any embedding space into a comprehensible conceptual space. We first present an algorithm for deriving a conceptual space with dynamic on-demand granularity. We then show a method for transferring any vector in the original incomprehensible space to an understandable vector in the conceptual space. We combine human tests with cross-model tests to show that the conceptualized vectors indeed represent the semantics of the original vectors. We also show how the conceptualized vectors can be used for various tasks including identifying weaknesses in the semantics underlying the original spaces and differences in the semantics of alternative models.

    "abstract": "Given the increase of publications, search for relevant papers becomes tedious. In particular, search across disciplines or schools of thinking is not supported. This is mainly due to the retrieval with keyword queries: technical terms differ in different sciences or at different times. Relevant articles might better be identified by their mathematical problem descriptions. Just looking at the equations in a paper already gives a hint to whether the paper is relevant. Hence, we propose a new approach for retrieval of mathematical expressions based on machine learning. We design an unsupervised representation learning task that combines embedding learning with self-supervised learning. Using graph convolutional neural networks we embed mathematical expression into low-dimensional vector spaces that allow efficient nearest neighbor queries. To train our models, we collect a huge dataset with over 29 million mathematical expressions from over 900,000 publications published on arXiv.org. The math is converted into an XML format, which we view as graph data. Our empirical evaluations involving a new dataset of manually annotated search queries show the benefits of using embedding models for mathematical retrieval. This work was originally published at KDD 2020. ",

    "abstract": "Like many team sports, basketball involves two groups of players who engage in collaborative and adversarial activities to win a game. Players and teams are executing various complex strategies to gain an advantage over their opponents. Defining, identifying, and analyzing different types of activities is an important task in sports analytics, as it can lead to better strategies and decisions by the players and coaching staff. The objective of this paper is to automatically recognize basketball group activities from tracking data representing locations of players and the ball during a game. We propose a novel deep learning approach for group activity recognition (GAR) in team sports called NETS. To efficiently model the player relations in team sports, we combined a Transformer-based architecture with LSTM embedding, and a team-wise pooling layer to recognize the group activity. Training such a neural network generally requires a large amount of annotated data, which incurs high labeling cost. To address scarcity of manual labels, we generate weak-labels and pretrain the neural network on a self-supervised trajectory prediction task. We used a large tracking data set from 632 NBA games to evaluate our approach. The results show that NETS is capable of learning group activities with high accuracy, and that self- and weak-supervised training in NETS have a positive impact on GAR accuracy. ",

One of the most important contextual properties in clinical text is negation, which indicates the absence of findings. We aimed to improve large scale extraction of labels by comparing three methods for negation detection in Dutch clinical notes. We used the Erasmus Medical Center Dutch Clinical Corpus to compare a rule-based method based on ContextD, a biLSTM model using MedCAT and (finetuned) RoBERTa-based models. We found that both the biLSTM and RoBERTa models consistently outperform the rule-based model in terms of F1 score, precision and recall. In addition, we systematically categorized the classification errors for each model, which can be used to further improve model performance in particular applications. Combining the three models naively was not beneficial in terms of performance. We conclude that the biLSTM and RoBERTa-based models in particular are highly accurate accurate in detecting clinical negations, but that ultimately all three approaches can be viable depending on the use case at hand.

These models maximize the mutual information between the partial subgraph's summary and various substructures from nodes to full subgraphs.

As a new paradigm in wireless communications, how to analyze the coverage and capacity performance of STAR-RISs becomes essential but challenging. To solve the coverage and capacity optimization (CCO) problem in STAR-RIS assisted networks, a multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MO-PPO) algorithm is proposed to handle long-term benefits than conventional optimization algorithms. To strike a balance between each objective, the MO-PPO algorithm provides a set of optimal solutions to form a Pareto front (PF), where any solution on the PF is regarded as an optimal result. Moreover, in order to improve the performance of the MO-PPO algorithm, two update strategies, i.e., action-value-based update strategy (AVUS) and loss function-based update strategy (LFUS), are investigated. For the AVUS, the improved point is to integrate the action values of both coverage and capacity and then update the loss function. For the LFUS, the improved point is only to assign dynamic weights for both loss functions of coverage and capacity, while the weights are calculated by a min-norm solver at every update. The numerical results demonstrated that the investigated update strategies outperform the fixed weights MO optimization algorithms in different cases, which includes a different number of sample grids, the number of STAR-RISs, the number of elements in the STAR-RISs, and the size of STAR-RISs. Additionally, the STAR-RIS assisted networks achieve better performance than conventional wireless networks without STAR-RISs. Moreover, with the same bandwidth, millimeter wave is able to provide higher capacity than sub-6 GHz, but at a cost of smaller coverage. ",

Such potential has brought substantial research activity to the family in recent years. Therefore, a comprehensive survey of NPF models is needed to organize and relate their motivation, methodology, and experiments. This paper intends to address this gap while digging deeper into the formulation, research themes, and applications concerning the family members.

    "abstract": "Surface defect detection is one of the most essential processes for industrial quality inspection. Deep learning-based surface defect detection methods have shown great potential. However, the well-performed models usually require large training data and can only detect defects that appeared in the training stage. When facing incremental few-shot data, defect detection models inevitably suffer from catastrophic forgetting and misclassification problem. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a new knowledge distillation network, called Dual Knowledge Align Network (DKAN). The proposed DKAN method follows a pretraining-finetuning transfer learning paradigm and a knowledge distillation framework is designed for fine-tuning. Specifically, an Incremental RCNN is proposed to achieve decoupled stable feature representation of different categories. Under this framework, a Feature Knowledge Align (FKA) loss is designed between class-agnostic feature maps to deal with catastrophic forgetting problems, and a Logit Knowledge Align (LKA) loss is deployed between logit distributions to tackle misclassification problems. Experiments have been conducted on the incremental Few-shot NEU-DET dataset and results show that DKAN outperforms other methods on various few-shot scenes, up to 6.65% on the mean Average Precision metric, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Image object detection technology, despite the significant developments, is struggling to handle remote sensor images and small-scale objects, due to the limited pixels of small objects. Numerous existing studies have demonstrated that an effective way to promote small object detection is to introduce the spatial context. Meanwhile, recent researches for image classification have shown that spectral convolution operations can perceive long-term spatial dependence more efficiently in the frequency domain than spatial domain. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Frequency-aware Feature Pyramid Framework (FFPF) for remote sensing object detection, which consists of a novel Frequency-aware ResNet (F-ResNet) and a Bilateral Spectral-aware Feature Pyramid Network (BS-FPN). Specifically, the F-ResNet is proposed to perceive the spectral context information by plugging the frequency domain convolution into each stage of the backbone, extracting richer features of small objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce frequency-domain convolution into remote sensing object detection task. In addition, the BSFPN is designed to use a bilateral sampling strategy and skipping connection to better model the association of object features at different scales, towards unleashing the potential of the spectral context information from F-ResNet. Extensive experiments are conducted for object detection in the optical remote sensing image dataset (DIOR and DOTA). The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our method. It achieves an average accuracy (mAP) without any tricks. ",

This paper examines this emerging social imaginary through the phenomenological concept of dwelling, or being at home in the world, as developed by Martin Heidegger. To examine in depth one influential articulation of this social imaginary, this paper focuses on the metaverse as envisioned by Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta (formerly Facebook). The paper presents a thematic analysis of Zuckerberg's public statements regarding the metaverse to provide a close reading of this particular vision. Then, through the lens of Heidegger's philosophy of dwelling, this paper identifies numerous threats to dwelling posed by the metaverse social imaginary.

We show that when coupled with simple heuristics derived from the game's navigation mesh, Go-Explore finds challenging bugs and comprehensively explores complex environments without the need for human demonstration or knowledge of the game dynamics. Go-Explore vastly outperforms more complicated baselines including reinforcement learning with intrinsic curiosity in both covering the navigation mesh and number of unique positions across the map discovered.

The ability of these systems to complete these tasks depends on a large range of technologies such as the mechanical and electrical parts that make up the physical body of the robot and its sensors, perception algorithms to perceive the environment, and planning and control algorithms to produce meaningful actions. Therefore, it is often necessary to consider the interactions between these components when designing an embodied system. This thesis explores work on the task-driven co-optimization of robotics systems in an end-to-end manner, simultaneously optimizing the physical components of the system with inference or control algorithms directly for task performance. We start by considering the problem of optimizing a beacon-based localization system directly for localization accuracy. Designing such a system involves placing beacons throughout the environment and inferring location from sensor readings. In our work, we develop a deep learning approach to optimize both beacon placement and location inference directly for localization accuracy. We then turn our attention to the related problem of task-driven optimization of robots and their controllers. In our work, we start by proposing a data-efficient algorithm based on multi-task reinforcement learning. Our approach efficiently optimizes both physical design and control parameters directly for task performance by leveraging a design-conditioned controller capable of generalizing over the space of physical designs. We then follow this up with an extension to allow for the optimization over discrete morphological parameters such as the number and configuration of limbs. Finally, we conclude by exploring the fabrication and deployment of optimized soft robots. ",

    "abstract": "Many contextualized word representations are now learned by intricate neural network models, such as masked neural language models (MNLMs) which are made up of huge neural network structures and trained to restore the masked text. Such representations demonstrate superhuman performance in some reading comprehension (RC) tasks which extract a proper answer in the context given a question. However, identifying the detailed knowledge trained in MNLMs is challenging owing to numerous and intermingled model parameters. This paper provides new insights and empirical analyses on commonsense knowledge included in pretrained MNLMs. First, we use a diagnostic test that evaluates whether commonsense knowledge is properly trained in MNLMs. We observe that a large proportion of commonsense knowledge is not appropriately trained in MNLMs and MNLMs do not often understand the semantic meaning of relations accurately. In addition, we find that the MNLM-based RC models are still vulnerable to semantic variations that require commonsense knowledge. Finally, we discover the fundamental reason why some knowledge is not trained. We further suggest that utilizing an external commonsense knowledge repository can be an effective solution. We exemplify the possibility to overcome the limitations of the MNLM-based RC models by enriching text with the required knowledge from an external commonsense knowledge repository in controlled experiments.

One class is meta-path-based HGNNs which either require domain knowledge to handcraft meta-paths or consume huge amount of time and memory to automatically construct meta-paths. The other class does not rely on meta-path construction. It takes homogeneous convolutional graph neural networks (Conv-GNNs) as backbones and extend them to heterogeneous graphs by introducing node-type- and edge-type-dependent parameters. Regardless of the meta-path dependency, most existing HGNNs employ shallow Conv-GNNs such as GCN and GAT to aggregate neighborhood information, and may have limited capability to capture information from high-order neighborhood. In this work, we propose two heterogeneous graph tree network models: Heterogeneous Graph Tree Convolutional Network (HetGTCN) and Heterogeneous Graph Tree Attention Network (HetGTAN), which do not rely on meta-paths to encode heterogeneity in both node features and graph structure. Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graph data demonstrate that the proposed HetGTCN and HetGTAN are efficient and consistently outperform all state-of-the-art HGNN baselines on semi-supervised node classification tasks, and can go deep without compromising performance.

    "title": "SwiftPruner: Reinforced Evolutionary Pruning for Efficient Ad Relevance",
    "abstract": "Ad relevance modeling plays a critical role in online advertising systems including Microsoft Bing. To leverage powerful transformers like BERT in this low-latency setting, many existing approaches perform ad-side computations offline. While efficient, these approaches are unable to serve cold start ads, resulting in poor relevance predictions for such ads. This work aims to design a new, low-latency BERT via structured pruning to empower real-time online inference for cold start ads relevance on a CPU platform. Our challenge is that previous methods typically prune all layers of the transformer to a high, uniform sparsity, thereby producing models which cannot achieve satisfactory inference speed with an acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we propose SwiftPruner - an efficient framework that leverages evolution-based search to automatically find the best-performing layer-wise sparse BERT model under the desired latency constraint. Different from existing evolution algorithms that conduct random mutations, we propose a reinforced mutator with a latency-aware multi-objective reward to conduct better mutations for efficiently searching the large space of layer-wise sparse models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher ROC AUC and lower latency than the uniform sparse baseline and state-of-the-art search methods. Remarkably, under our latency requirement of 1900us on CPU, SwiftPruner achieves a 0.86% higher AUC than the state-of-the-art uniform sparse baseline for BERT-Mini on a large scale real-world dataset. Online A/B testing shows that our model also achieves a significant 11.7% cut in the ratio of defective cold start ads with satisfactory real-time serving latency. ",

    "abstract": "In Federated Learning (FL) of click-through rate (CTR) prediction, users' data is not shared for privacy protection. The learning is performed by training locally on client devices and communicating only model changes to the server. There are two main challenges: (i) the client heterogeneity, making FL algorithms that use the weighted averaging to aggregate model updates from the clients have slow progress and unsatisfactory learning results; and (ii) the difficulty of tuning the server learning rate with trial-and-error methodology due to the big computation time and resources needed for each experiment. To address these challenges, we propose a simple online meta-learning method to learn a strategy of aggregating the model updates, which adaptively weighs the importance of the clients based on their attributes and adjust the step sizes of the update. We perform extensive evaluations on public datasets. Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in both the speed of convergence and the quality of the final learning results. ",

    "abstract": "Estimation of causal effects is the core objective of many scientific disciplines. However, it remains a challenging task, especially when the effects are estimated from observational data. Recently, several promising machine learning models have been proposed for causal effect estimation. The evaluation of these models has been based on the mean values of the error of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) as well as of the Precision in Estimation of Heterogeneous Effect (PEHE). In this paper, we propose to complement the evaluation of causal inference models using concrete statistical evidence, including the performance profiles of Dolan and Mor{\\'e}, as well as non-parametric and post-hoc statistical tests. The main motivation behind this approach is the elimination of the influence of a small number of instances or simulation on the benchmarking process, which in some cases dominate the results. We use the proposed evaluation methodology to compare several state-of-the-art causal effect estimation models. ",

    "abstract": "Conventional automatic speaker verification systems can usually be decomposed into a front-end model such as time delay neural network (TDNN) for extracting speaker embeddings and a back-end model such as statistics-based probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) or neural network-based neural PLDA (NPLDA) for similarity scoring. However, the sequential optimization of the front-end and back-end models may lead to a local minimum, which theoretically prevents the whole system from achieving the best optimization. Although some methods have been proposed for jointly optimizing the two models, such as the generalized end-to-end (GE2E) model and NPLDA E2E model, all of these methods are designed for use with a single enrollment utterance. In this paper, we propose a new E2E joint method for speaker verification especially designed for the practical case of multiple enrollment utterances. In order to leverage the intra-relationship among multiple enrollment utterances, our model comes equipped with frame-level and utterance-level attention mechanisms. We also utilize several data augmentation techniques, including conventional noise augmentation using MUSAN and RIRs datasets and a unique speaker embedding-level mixup strategy for better optimization.

However, there has been relatively little work proposing spectral graph neural network (GNN) methods for analyzing such networks. Here we introduce a signed directed Laplacian matrix, which we call the magnetic signed Laplacian, as a natural generalization of both the signed Laplacian on signed graphs and the magnetic Laplacian on directed graphs. We then use this matrix to construct a novel spectral GNN architecture and conduct extensive experiments on both node clustering and link prediction tasks. In these experiments, we consider tasks related to signed information, tasks related to directional information, and tasks related to both signed and directional information. We demonstrate that our proposed spectral GNN is effective for incorporating both signed and directional information, and attains leading performance on a wide range of data sets. Additionally, we provide a novel synthetic network model, which we refer to as the signed directed stochastic block model, and a number of novel real-world data sets based on lead-lag relationships in financial time series.

To eliminate the color variation, many stain normalization approaches have been proposed. However, most were designed for hematoxylin and eosin staining images and performed poorly on immunohistochemical staining images. Current cell segmentation methods systematically apply stain normalization as a preprocessing step, but the impact brought by color variation has not been quantitatively investigated yet. In this paper, we produced five groups of NeuN staining images with different colors. We applied a deep learning image-recoloring method to perform color transfer between histological image groups. Finally, we altered the color of a segmentation set and quantified the impact of color variation on cell segmentation. The results demonstrated the necessity of color normalization prior to subsequent analysis. ",
