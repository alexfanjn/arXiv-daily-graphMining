    "abstract": "While multi-class 3D detectors are needed in many robotics applications, training them with fully labeled datasets can be expensive in labeling cost. An alternative approach is to have targeted single-class labels on disjoint data samples. In this paper, we are interested in training a multi-class 3D object detection model, while using these single-class labeled data. We begin by detailing the unique stance of our \"Single-Class Supervision\" (SCS) setting with respect to related concepts such as partial supervision and semi supervision. Then, based on the case study of training the multi-class version of Range Sparse Net (RSN), we adapt a spectrum of algorithms -- from supervised learning to pseudo-labeling -- to fully exploit the properties of our SCS setting, and perform extensive ablation studies to identify the most effective algorithm and practice. Empirical experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that proper training under SCS can approach or match full supervision training while saving labeling costs. ",

    "title": "A Deep Learning Approach for Predicting Two-dimensional Soil  Consolidation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)",
    "abstract": "Soil consolidation is closely related to seepage, stability, and settlement of geotechnical buildings and foundations, and directly affects the use and safety of superstructures. Nowadays, the unidirectional consolidation theory of soils is widely used in certain conditions and approximate calculations. The multi-directional theory of soil consolidation is more reasonable than the unidirectional theory in practical applications, but it is much more complicated in terms of index determination and solution. To address the above problem, in this paper, we propose a deep learning method using physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to predict the excess pore water pressure of two-dimensional soil consolidation. In the proposed method, (1) a fully connected neural network is constructed, (2) the computational domain, partial differential equation (PDE), and constraints are defined to generate data for model training, and (3) the PDE of two-dimensional soil consolidation and the model of the neural network is connected to reduce the loss of the model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparison with the numerical solution of PDE for two-dimensional consolidation. Using this method, the excess pore water pressure could be predicted simply and efficiently. In addition, the method was applied to predict the soil excess pore water pressure in the foundation in a real case at Tianjin port, China. The proposed deep learning approach can be used to investigate the large and complex multi-directional soil consolidation. ",

To address this challenge, we use federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that aims at collaboratively training a robust global model by accessing users' locally trained models but not their raw data. Specifically, we designed a novel ensemble-based Federated Deep Neural Network (eFedDNN). The ensemble method combines the outputs of the different models learned via FL by the users and shows an accuracy that surpasses comparable models reported in the literature. Extensive experimental studies on a real-world open-access dataset from Montreal demonstrate that the proposed inference model can achieve accurate identification of users' mode of travel without compromising privacy.

Working with a range of metrics, including the Mahalanobis distance, we propose a method to overapproximate the resulting optimisation problem using piecewise-linear functions to lower and upper bound the NN's non-linearities globally over the input space. We encode this computation as the solution of a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming problem and demonstrate that it can be used to compute IF guarantees on four datasets widely used for fairness benchmarking. We show how this formulation can be used to encourage models' fairness at training time by modifying the NN loss, and empirically confirm our approach yields NNs that are orders of magnitude fairer than state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Traditionally, learning from human demonstrations via direct behavior cloning can lead to high-performance policies given that the algorithm has access to large amounts of high-quality data covering the most likely scenarios to be encountered when the agent is operating. However, in real-world scenarios, expert data is limited and it is desired to train an agent that learns a behavior policy general enough to handle situations that were not demonstrated by the human expert. Another alternative is to learn these policies with no supervision via deep reinforcement learning, however, these algorithms require a large amount of computing time to perform well on complex tasks with high-dimensional state and action spaces, such as those found in StarCraft II. Automatic curriculum learning is a recent mechanism comprised of techniques designed to speed up deep reinforcement learning by adjusting the difficulty of the current task to be solved according to the agent's current capabilities. Designing a proper curriculum, however, can be challenging for sufficiently complex tasks, and thus we leverage human demonstrations as a way to guide agent exploration during training. In this work, we aim to train deep reinforcement learning agents that can command multiple heterogeneous actors where starting positions and overall difficulty of the task are controlled by an automatically-generated curriculum from a single human demonstration. Our results show that an agent trained via automated curriculum learning can outperform state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning baselines and match the performance of the human expert in a simulated command and control task in StarCraft II modeled over a real military scenario.

In this work we develop a method to quantify the robustness of decision functions with respect to credal Bayesian networks, formal parametric models of the environment where uncertainty is expressed through credal sets on the parameters. In particular, we address the maximum marginal probability (MARmax) problem, that is, determining the greatest probability of an event (such as misclassification) obtainable for parameters in the credal set. We develop a method to faithfully transfer the problem into a constrained optimization problem on a probabilistic circuit. By performing a simple constraint relaxation, we show how to obtain a guaranteed upper bound on MARmax in linear time in the size of the circuit. We further theoretically characterize this constraint relaxation in terms of the original Bayesian network structure, which yields insight into the tightness of the bound. We implement the method and provide experimental evidence that the upper bound is often near tight and demonstrates improved scalability compared to other methods. ",

Our approach builds on existing works on differentiable point-based rendering but introduces a novel technique we call \"Sculpted Neural Points (SNP)\", which significantly improves the robustness to errors and holes in the reconstructed point cloud.

The former encode information at a frame rate identical to the observation, while the latter globally governs the entire sequence. This introduces an inductive bias and facilitates unsupervised disentanglement of the underlying local and global factors. In this paper, we show that the vanilla DSAE suffers from being sensitive to the choice of model architecture and capacity of the dynamic latent variables, and is prone to collapse the static latent variable. As a countermeasure, we propose TS-DSAE, a two-stage training framework that first learns sequence-level prior distributions, which are subsequently employed to regularise the model and facilitate auxiliary objectives to promote disentanglement. The proposed framework is fully unsupervised and robust against the global factor collapse problem across a wide range of model configurations. It also avoids typical solutions such as adversarial training which usually involves laborious parameter tuning, and domain-specific data augmentation. We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations to demonstrate its robustness in terms of disentanglement on both artificial and real-world music audio datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Building robust deterministic deep neural networks is still a challenge. On the one hand, some approaches improve out-of-distribution detection at the cost of reducing classification accuracy in some situations. On the other hand, some methods simultaneously increase classification accuracy, out-of-distribution detection, and uncertainty estimation, but reduce inference efficiency, in addition to training the same model many times to tune hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose training deterministic deep neural networks using our DisMax loss, which works as a drop-in replacement for the commonly used SoftMax loss (i.e., the combination of the linear output layer, the SoftMax activation, and the cross-entropy loss). Starting from the IsoMax+ loss, we created novel logits that are based on the distance to all prototypes rather than just the one associated with the correct class. We also propose a novel way to augment images to construct what we call fractional probability regularization. Moreover, we propose a new score to perform out-of-distribution detection and a fast way to calibrate the network after training. Our experiments show that DisMax usually outperforms all current approaches simultaneously in classification accuracy, uncertainty estimation, inference efficiency, and out-of-distribution detection, avoiding hyperparameter tuning and repetitive model training.

    "abstract": "Blind image quality assessment (BIQA), which aims to accurately predict the image quality without any pristine reference information, has been highly concerned in the past decades. Especially, with the help of deep neural networks, great progress has been achieved so far. However, it remains less investigated on BIQA for night-time images (NTIs) which usually suffer from complicated authentic distortions such as reduced visibility, low contrast, additive noises, and color distortions. These diverse authentic degradations particularly challenges the design of effective deep neural network for blind NTI quality evaluation (NTIQE). In this paper, we propose a novel deep decomposition and bilinear pooling network (DDB-Net) to better address this issue. The DDB-Net contains three modules, i.e., an image decomposition module, a feature encoding module, and a bilinear pooling module. The image decomposition module is inspired by the Retinex theory and involves decoupling the input NTI into an illumination layer component responsible for illumination information and a reflectance layer component responsible for content information. Then, the feature encoding module involves learning multi-scale feature representations of degradations that are rooted in the two decoupled components separately. Finally, by modeling illumination-related and content-related degradations as two-factor variations, the two multi-scale feature sets are bilinearly pooled and concatenated together to form a unified representation for quality prediction. The superiority of the proposed DDB-Net is well validated by extensive experiments on two publicly available night-time image databases. ",

We propose a model to learn from the narration supervision and utilize multimodal features, including RGB, motion flow, and ambient sound. Our model learns to attend to the frames related to the narration label while suppressing the irrelevant frames from being used. Our experiments show that noisy audio narration suffices to learn a good action detection model, thus reducing annotation expenses. ",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on the development of a two-step field-split nonlinear preconditioner to accelerate the convergence of two-phase flow and transport in heterogeneous porous media. We propose a field-split algorithm named Field-Split Multiplicative Schwarz Newton (FSMSN), consisting in two steps: first, we apply a preconditioning step to update pressure and saturations nonlinearly by solving approximately two subproblems in a sequential fashion; then, we apply a global step relying on a Newton update obtained by linearizing the system at the preconditioned state. Using challenging test cases, FSMSN is compared to an existing field-split preconditioner, Multiplicative Schwarz Preconditioned for Inexact Newton (MSPIN), and to standard solution strategies such as the Sequential Fully Implicit (SFI) method or the Fully Implicit Method (FIM). The comparison highlights the impact of the upwinding scheme in the algorithmic performance of the preconditioners and the importance of the dynamic adaptation of the subproblem tolerance in the preconditioning step. Our results demonstrate that the two-step nonlinear preconditioning approach-and in particular, FSMSN-results in a faster outer-loop convergence than with the SFI and FIM methods. The impact of the preconditioners on computational performance-i.e., measured by wall-clock time-will be studied in a subsequent publication. ",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of weakly semi-supervised object detection with points (WSSOD-P), where the training data is combined by a small set of fully annotated images with bounding boxes and a large set of weakly-labeled images with only a single point annotated for each instance. The core of this task is to train a point-to-box regressor on well-labeled images that can be used to predict credible bounding boxes for each point annotation. We challenge the prior belief that existing CNN-based detectors are not compatible with this task. Based on the classic R-CNN architecture, we propose an effective point-to-box regressor: Group R-CNN. Group R-CNN first uses instance-level proposal grouping to generate a group of proposals for each point annotation and thus can obtain a high recall rate. To better distinguish different instances and improve precision, we propose instance-level proposal assignment to replace the vanilla assignment strategy adopted in the original R-CNN methods. As naive instance-level assignment brings converging difficulty, we propose instance-aware representation learning which consists of instance-aware feature enhancement and instance-aware parameter generation to overcome this issue. Comprehensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, Group R-CNN significantly outperforms the prior method Point DETR by 3.9 mAP with 5% well-labeled images, which is the most challenging scenario.

A main limitation of conventional NeRFs is that they often fail to produce high-quality renderings under novel viewpoints that are significantly different from the training viewpoints. In this paper, instead of exploiting few-shot image synthesis, we study the novel view extrapolation setting that (1) the training images can well describe an object, and (2) there is a notable discrepancy between the training and test viewpoints' distributions. We present RapNeRF (RAy Priors) as a solution. Our insight is that the inherent appearances of a 3D surface's arbitrary visible projections should be consistent. We thus propose a random ray casting policy that allows training unseen views using seen views. Furthermore, we show that a ray atlas pre-computed from the observed rays' viewing directions could further enhance the rendering quality for extrapolated views. A main limitation is that RapNeRF would remove the strong view-dependent effects because it leverages the multi-view consistency property. ",

Currently, computational predictions of drug-gene interactions mainly focus on the binding interactions without considering other relation types like agonist, antagonist, etc. In addition, existing methods either heavily rely on high-quality domain features or are intrinsically transductive, which limits the capacity of models to generalize to drugs/genes that lack external information or are unseen during the training process. To address these problems, we propose a novel Communicative Subgraph representation learning for Multi-relational Inductive drug-Gene interactions prediction (CoSMIG), where the predictions of drug-gene relations are made through subgraph patterns, and thus are naturally inductive for unseen drugs/genes without retraining or utilizing external domain features. Moreover, the model strengthened the relations on the drug-gene graph through a communicative message passing mechanism. To evaluate our method, we compiled two new benchmark datasets from DrugBank and DGIdb. The comprehensive experiments on the two datasets showed that our method outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in the transductive scenarios and achieved superior performance in the inductive ones. Further experimental analysis including LINCS experimental validation and literature verification also demonstrated the value of our model. ",

    "abstract": "Transfer Learning enables Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to acquire knowledge from a source domain and transfer it to a target domain, where collecting large-scale annotated examples is both time-consuming and expensive. Conventionally, while transferring the knowledge learned from one task to another task, the deeper layers of a pre-trained CNN are finetuned over the target dataset. However, these layers that are originally designed for the source task are over-parameterized for the target task. Thus, finetuning these layers over the target dataset reduces the generalization ability of the CNN due to high network complexity. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-stage framework called TASCNet which enables efficient knowledge transfer. In the first stage, the configuration of the deeper layers is learned automatically and finetuned over the target dataset. Later, in the second stage, the redundant filters are pruned from the fine-tuned CNN to decrease the network's complexity for the target task while preserving the performance. This two-stage mechanism finds a compact version of the pre-trained CNN with optimal structure (number of filters in a convolutional layer, number of neurons in a dense layer, and so on) from the hypothesis space. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated using VGG-16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-121 on CalTech-101, CalTech-256, and Stanford Dogs datasets. The proposed TASCNet reduces the computational complexity of pre-trained CNNs over the target task by reducing both trainable parameters and FLOPs which enables resource-efficient knowledge transfer.

    "abstract": "Robust perception is an essential component to enable long-term operation of mobile robots. It depends on failure resilience through reliable sensor data and preprocessing, as well as failure awareness through introspection, for example the ability to self-assess localization performance. This paper presents CorAl: a principled, intuitive, and generalizable method to measure the quality of alignment between pairs of point clouds, which learns to detect alignment errors in a self-supervised manner. CorAl compares the differential entropy in the point clouds separately with the entropy in their union to account for entropy inherent to the scene. By making use of dual entropy measurements, we obtain a quality metric that is highly sensitive to small alignment errors and still generalizes well to unseen environments. In this work, we extend our previous work on lidar-only CorAl to radar data by proposing a two-stage filtering technique that produces high-quality point clouds from noisy radar scans. Thus we target robust perception in two ways: by introducing a method that introspectively assesses alignment quality, and applying it to an inherently robust sensor modality. We show that our filtering technique combined with CorAl can be applied to the problem of alignment classification, and that it detects small alignment errors in urban settings with up to 98% accuracy, and with up to 96% if trained only in a different environment. Our lidar and radar experiments demonstrate that CorAl outperforms previous methods both on the ETH lidar benchmark, which includes several indoor and outdoor environments, and the large-scale Oxford and MulRan radar data sets for urban traffic scenarios The results also demonstrate that CorAl generalizes very well across substantially different environments without the need of retraining.

In this paper, we present a flexible and high-performance 3D detection framework, named MPPNet, for 3D temporal object detection with point cloud sequences. We propose a novel three-hierarchy framework with proxy points for multi-frame feature encoding and interactions to achieve better detection. The three hierarchies conduct per-frame feature encoding, short-clip feature fusion, and whole-sequence feature aggregation, respectively. To enable processing long-sequence point clouds with reasonable computational resources, intra-group feature mixing and inter-group feature attention are proposed to form the second and third feature encoding hierarchies, which are recurrently applied for aggregating multi-frame trajectory features. The proxy points not only act as consistent object representations for each frame, but also serve as the courier to facilitate feature interaction between frames. The experiments on largeWaymo Open dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with large margins when applied to both short (e.g., 4-frame) and long (e.g., 16-frame) point cloud sequences. Specifically, MPPNet achieves 74.21%, 74.62% and 73.31% for vehicle, pedestrian and cyclist classes on the LEVEL 2 mAPH metric with 16-frame input. ",

    "abstract": "We present TIPS-GAN, a new approach to improve the accuracy and stability in unsupervised adversarial 2D to 3D human pose estimation. In our work we demonstrate that the human kinematic skeleton should not be assumed as one spatially dependent structure. In fact, we believe when a full 2D pose is provided during training, there is an inherent bias learned where the 3D coordinate of a keypoint is spatially codependent on the 2D locations of all other keypoints. To investigate our theory we follow previous adversarial approaches but trained two generators on spatially independent parts of the kinematic skeleton, the torso and the legs. During our study we find that improving self-consistency is key to lowering the evaluation error and therefore introduce new consistency constraints within the standard adversarial cycle. We then produced a final TIPS model via knowledge distillation which can predict the 3D coordinates for the entire 2D pose with improved results. Furthermore we help address the question left unanswered in prior adversarial learning papers of how long to train for a truly unsupervised scenario. We show that two independent generators training adversarially can hold a minimum error against a discriminator for a longer period of time than that of a solo generator which will diverge due to the adversarial network becoming unstable. TIPS decreases the average error by 18\\% when compared to that of a baseline solo generator. TIPS improves upon other unsupervised approaches while also performing strongly against supervised and weakly-supervised approaches during evaluation on both the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP dataset.

In networked systems, where individual entities interact in pairs, anomalies are observed when pattern of interactions deviates from patterns considered regular. Properly defining what regular patterns entail relies on developing expressive models for describing the observed interactions. It is crucial to address anomaly detection in networks. Among the many well-known models for networks, latent variable models - a class of probabilistic models - offer promising tools to capture the intrinsic features of the data. In this work, we propose a probabilistic generative approach which incorporates domain knowledge, i.e., community membership, as a fundamental model for regular behavior, and thus flag potential anomalies deviating from this pattern. In fact, community membership act as the building blocks of a null model to identify the regular interaction patterns. The structural information is included in the model through latent variables for community membership and anomaly parameter.

In particular, we measure to what extent these recommendations change the structure of bi-populated networks and show how these changes affect the minority group. Our systematic experimentation helps to better understand when link recommendation algorithms are beneficial or harmful to minority groups in social networks. In particular, our findings suggest that, while all algorithms tend to close triangles and increase cohesion, all algorithms except Node2Vec are prone to favor and suggest nodes with high in-degree.

However, high-density LiDAR sensors are usually costly and still limited to a level of coverage per scan (e.g., 128 channels).

This paper aims to design a novel 3D point cloud representation that can continuously increase point cloud density while reducing its storage and transmitting size. The pipeline of the proposed Continuous, Ultra-compact Representation of LiDAR (CURL) includes four main steps: meshing, upsampling, encoding, and continuous reconstruction. It is capable of transforming a 3D LiDAR scan or map into a compact spherical harmonics representation which can be used or transmitted in low latency to continuously reconstruct a much denser 3D point cloud. Extensive experiments on four public datasets, covering college gardens, city streets, and indoor rooms, demonstrate that much denser 3D point clouds can be accurately reconstructed using the proposed CURL representation while achieving up to 80% storage space-saving.

The key design property in RPKI that allows our attacks is the tradeoff between connectivity and security: when networks cannot retrieve RPKI information from publication points, they make routing decisions in BGP without validating RPKI. We exploit this tradeoff to develop attacks that prevent the retrieval of the RPKI objects from the public repositories, thereby disabling RPKI validation and exposing the RPKI-protected networks to prefix hijack attacks. We demonstrate experimentally that at least 47% of the public repositories are vulnerable against a specific version of our attacks, a rate-limiting off-path downgrade attack. We also show that all the current RPKI relying party implementations are vulnerable to attacks by a malicious publication point. This translates to 20.4% of the IPv4 address space. We provide recommendations for preventing our downgrade attacks. However, resolving the fundamental problem is not straightforward: if the relying parties prefer security over connectivity and insist on RPKI validation when ROAs cannot be retrieved, the victim AS may become disconnected from many more networks than just the one that the adversary wishes to hijack. Our work shows that the publication points are a critical infrastructure for Internet connectivity and security. Our main recommendation is therefore that the publication points should be hosted on robust platforms guaranteeing a high degree of connectivity. ",

SoDA utilizes recordings of accelerometers and gyroscopes to recognize activities that may violate social distancing practice with simple yet effective Vision Transformer models. Extensive experiments over 10 volunteers and 1800+ samples demonstrate that SoDA achieves social activity recognition with the accuracy of 94.7%, 1.8% negative alert, and 2.2% missing alert. ",

    "abstract": "People perceive the world with multiple senses (e.g., through hearing sounds, reading words and seeing objects). However, most existing AI systems only process an individual modality. This paper presents an approach that excels at handling multiple modalities of information with a single model. In our \"{SkillNet}\" model, different parts of the parameters are specialized for processing different modalities. Unlike traditional dense models that always activate all the model parameters, our model sparsely activates parts of the parameters whose skills are relevant to the task. Such model design enables SkillNet to learn skills in a more interpretable way. We develop our model for five modalities including text, image, sound, video and code. Results show that, SkillNet performs comparably to five modality-specific fine-tuned models. Moreover, our model supports self-supervised pretraining with the same sparsely activated way, resulting in better initialized parameters for different modalities. We find that pretraining significantly improves the performance of SkillNet on five modalities, on par with or even better than baselines with modality-specific pretraining. On the task of Chinese text-to-image retrieval, our final system achieves higher accuracy than existing leading systems including Wukong{ViT-B} and Wenlan 2.0 while using less number of activated parameters.

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in adversarial machine learning is to quantify how much training data is needed in the presence of evasion attacks. In this paper we address this issue within the framework of PAC learning, focusing on the class of decision lists. Given that distributional assumptions are essential in the adversarial setting, we work with probability distributions on the input data that satisfy a Lipschitz condition: nearby points have similar probability. Our key results illustrate that the adversary's budget (that is, the number of bits it can perturb on each input) is a fundamental quantity in determining the sample complexity of robust learning. Our first main result is a sample-complexity lower bound: the class of monotone conjunctions (essentially the simplest non-trivial hypothesis class on the Boolean hypercube) and any superclass has sample complexity at least exponential in the adversary's budget. Our second main result is a corresponding upper bound: for every fixed $k$ the class of $k$-decision lists has polynomial sample complexity against a $\\log(n)$-bounded adversary. This sheds further light on the question of whether an efficient PAC learning algorithm can always be used as an efficient $\\log(n)$-robust learning algorithm under the uniform distribution. ",

Using this partition P we construct a so-called structure-maintaining minor F of G via specific contractions within the disjoint sets such that F has O(n/log n) vertices. The combination of (F, P) is referred to as a cloud decomposition. We call a graph G=(V, E) separable if it admits to an O(n^c)-separator theorem for some constant c < 1 meaning there exists a separator S subset V that partitions V into {A, S, B} such that no vertices of A and B are adjacent in G and neither A nor B contain more than c'n vertices for a fixed constant c' < 1. Due to the last property such separators are called balanced. This famously includes planar graphs, which admit an O(sqrt(n) n)-separator theorem. For planar graphs we show that a cloud decomposition can be constructed in O(n) time and using O(n) bits. Given a cloud decomposition (F, P) constructed for a planar graph G we are able to find a balanced separator of G in O(n/log n) time. Contrary to related publications, we do not make use of an embedding of the input graph. This allows us to construct the succinct encoding scheme for planar graphs due to Blelloch and Farzan (CPM 2010) in O(n) time and O(n) bits improving both runtime and space by a factor of Theta(log n). As an additional application of our cloud decomposition we show that a tree decomposition for planar graphs of width O(n^(1/2 + epsilon)) for any epsilon > 0 can be constructed in O(n) bits and a time linear in the size of the tree decomposition. Finally, we generalize our cloud decomposition from planar graphs to arbitrary separable graphs. ",

This work explores one facet of the question whether state-of-the-art NLP models exhibit elementary mechanisms known from human cognition. The exploration is focused on a relatively primitive mechanism for which there is a lot of evidence from various psycholinguistic experiments with infants. The computation of \"abstract sameness relations\" is assumed to play an important role in human language acquisition and processing, especially in learning more complex grammar rules. In order to investigate this mechanism in BERT and other pre-trained language models (PLMs), the experiment designs from studies with infants were taken as the starting point. On this basis, we designed experimental settings in which each element from the original studies was mapped to a component of language models. Even though the task in our experiments was relatively simple, the results suggest that the cognitive faculty of computing abstract sameness relations is stronger in infants than in all investigated PLMs. ",

Many previous works have proposed different data augmentations strategies for NLP, such as noise injection, word replacement, back-translation etc. Though effective, they missed one important characteristic of language--compositionality, meaning of a complex expression is built from its sub-parts. Motivated by this, we propose a compositional data augmentation approach for natural language understanding called TreeMix. Specifically, TreeMix leverages constituency parsing tree to decompose sentences into constituent sub-structures and the Mixup data augmentation technique to recombine them to generate new sentences. Compared with previous approaches, TreeMix introduces greater diversity to the samples generated and encourages models to learn compositionality of NLP data. Extensive experiments on text classification and SCAN demonstrate that TreeMix outperforms current state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. ",

Our algorithm classifies overlapping patches extracted from an input image, and aggregates the predicted logits to certify a larger radius around the input. We study two aggregation schemes -- max and mean -- and show that both approaches provide better certificates in terms of certified accuracy, average certified radii and abstention rates as compared to concurrent approaches. We also provide theoretical guarantees for such certificates, and empirically show significant improvements over other randomized smoothing methods that require expensive retraining. Further, we extend our approach to videos and provide meaningful certificates for video classifiers. A project page can be found at https://nyu-dice-lab.github.io/SmoothReduce/ ",

This paper presents a dataset-driven design and performance evaluation of a machine learning classifier for the network intrusion dataset UNSW-NB15.

We employed ensemble methods using Balanced Bagging (BB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest empowered by Hellinger Distance Decision Tree (RF-HDDT). BB and XGBoost are tuned to handle the imbalanced data, and Random Forest (RF) classifier is supplemented by the Hellinger metric to address the imbalance issue. Two new algorithms are proposed to address the class overlap issue in the dataset. These two algorithms are leveraged to help improve the performance of the testing dataset by modifying the final classification decision made by three base classifiers as part of the ensemble classifier which employs a majority vote combiner. The proposed design is evaluated for both binary and multi-category classification. Comparing the proposed model to those reported on the same dataset in the literature demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms others by a significant margin for both binary and multi-category classification cases.

    "abstract": "Formulated as a conditional generation problem, face animation aims at synthesizing continuous face images from a single source image driven by a set of conditional face motion. Previous works mainly model the face motion as conditions with 1D or 2D representation (e.g., action units, emotion codes, landmark), which often leads to low-quality results in some complicated scenarios such as continuous generation and largepose transformation. To tackle this problem, the conditions are supposed to meet two requirements, i.e., motion information preserving and geometric continuity. To this end, we propose a novel representation based on a 3D geometric flow, termed facial flow, to represent the natural motion of the human face at any pose. Compared with other previous conditions, the proposed facial flow well controls the continuous changes to the face. After that, in order to utilize the facial flow for face editing, we build a synthesis framework generating continuous images with conditional facial flows. To fully take advantage of the motion information of facial flows, a hierarchical conditional framework is designed to combine the extracted multi-scale appearance features from images and motion features from flows in a hierarchical manner. The framework then decodes multiple fused features back to images progressively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to other state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Candidate generation is the first stage in recommendation systems, where a light-weight system is used to retrieve potentially relevant items for an input user. These candidate items are then ranked and pruned in later stages of recommender systems using a more complex ranking model. Since candidate generation is the top of the recommendation funnel, it is important to retrieve a high-recall candidate set to feed into downstream ranking models. A common approach for candidate generation is to leverage approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search from a single dense query embedding; however, this approach this can yield a low-diversity result set with many near duplicates. As users often have multiple interests, candidate retrieval should ideally return a diverse set of candidates reflective of the user's multiple interests. To this end, we introduce kNN-Embed, a general approach to improving diversity in dense ANN-based retrieval. kNN-Embed represents each user as a smoothed mixture over learned item clusters that represent distinct `interests' of the user. By querying each of a user's mixture component in proportion to their mixture weights, we retrieve a high-diversity set of candidates reflecting elements from each of a user's interests. We experimentally compare kNN-Embed to standard ANN candidate retrieval, and show significant improvements in overall recall and improved diversity across three datasets. Accompanying this work, we open source a large Twitter follow-graph dataset, to spur further research in graph-mining and representation learning for recommender systems. ",

    "abstract": "Recently the surprising discovery of the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) method by Grill et al. shows the negative term in contrastive loss can be removed if we add the so-called prediction head to the network. This initiated the research of non-contrastive self-supervised learning. It is mysterious why even when there exist trivial collapsed global optimal solutions, neural networks trained by (stochastic) gradient descent can still learn competitive representations. This phenomenon is a typical example of implicit bias in deep learning and remains little understood. In this work, we present our empirical and theoretical discoveries on non-contrastive self-supervised learning. Empirically, we find that when the prediction head is initialized as an identity matrix with only its off-diagonal entries being trainable, the network can learn competitive representations even though the trivial optima still exist in the training objective. Theoretically, we present a framework to understand the behavior of the trainable, but identity-initialized prediction head. Under a simple setting, we characterized the substitution effect and acceleration effect of the prediction head. The substitution effect happens when learning the stronger features in some neurons can substitute for learning these features in other neurons through updating the prediction head. And the acceleration effect happens when the substituted features can accelerate the learning of other weaker features to prevent them from being ignored. These two effects enable the neural networks to learn all the features rather than focus only on learning the stronger features, which is likely the cause of the dimensional collapse phenomenon. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first end-to-end optimization guarantee for non-contrastive methods using nonlinear neural networks with a trainable prediction head and normalization.

In this paper, we present two experiment (total N = 364) exploring the effects of CF explanations of AI system's predictions on lay people's causal beliefs about the real world. In Experiment 1 we found that providing CF explanations of an AI system's predictions does indeed (unjustifiably) affect people's causal beliefs regarding factors/features the AI uses and that people are more likely to view them as causal factors in the real world. Inspired by the literature on misinformation and health warning messaging, Experiment 2 tested whether we can correct for the unjustified change in causal beliefs.

This is useful in many settings, for example when studying a dynamic biomolecular subsystem with genetic data providing causally relevant background information. Under a structural assumption that, we argue, must be satisfied in practice if informative answers are to be found, our method accommodates graphs of low or high sparsity while maintaining polynomial time complexity. We derive a sound and complete algorithm for identifying causal relationships under these conditions and implement testing procedures with provable error control for linear and nonlinear systems.

These systems usually consist of two main parts, i.e., a positioning network that learns the mapping from high-dimensional CSI to physical locations and a tracking system that utilizes historical CSI to reduce the positioning error. This paper presents a new localization system with high accuracy and generality. On the one hand, the receptive field of the existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based positioning networks is limited, restricting their performance as useful information in CSI is not explored thoroughly. As a solution, we propose a novel attention-augmented Residual CNN to utilize the local information and global context in CSI exhaustively. On the other hand, considering the generality of a tracking system, we decouple the tracking system from the CSI environments so that one tracking system for all environments becomes possible. Specifically, we remodel the tracking problem as a denoising task and solve it with deep trajectory prior. Furthermore, we investigate how the precision difference of inertial measurement units will adversely affect the tracking performance and adopt plug-and-play to solve the precision difference problem. Experiments show the superiority of our methods over existing approaches in performance and generality improvement. ",

However, the Yoneda embedding does not preserve coproducts. It is perhaps less well-known that if we restrict the codomain of the Yoneda embedding to the full subcategory of limit-preserving functors, then this embedding preserves colimits, while still enjoying most of the other useful properties of the Yoneda embedding. We call this modified embedding the Lambek embedding. The category of limit-preserving functors is known to be a reflective subcategory of the category of all functors, i.e., there is a left adjoint for the inclusion functor. In the literature, the existence of this left adjoint is often proved non-constructively, e.g., by an application of Freyd's adjoint functor theorem. In this paper, we provide an alternative, more constructive proof of this fact. We first explain the Lambek embedding and why it preserves coproducts. Then we review some concepts from multi-sorted algebras and observe that there is a one-to-one correspondence between product-preserving presheaves and certain multi-sorted term algebras. We provide a construction that freely turns any presheaf functor into a product-preserving one, hence giving an explicit definition of the left adjoint functor of the inclusion. Finally, we sketch how to extend our method to prove that the subcategory of limit-preserving functors is also reflective. ",

    "title": "NeuralTree: A 256-Channel 0.227\u03bcJ/class Versatile Neural Activity  Classification and Closed-Loop Neuromodulation SoC",
    "abstract": "Closed-loop neural interfaces with on-chip machine learning can detect and suppress disease symptoms in neurological disorders or restore lost functions in paralyzed patients. While high-density neural recording can provide rich neural activity information for accurate disease-state detection, existing systems have low channel count and poor scalability, which could limit their therapeutic efficacy. This work presents a highly scalable and versatile closed-loop neural interface SoC that can overcome these limitations. A 256-channel time-division multiplexed (TDM) front-end with a two-step fast-settling mixed-signal DC servo loop (DSL) is proposed to record high-spatial-resolution neural activity and perform channel-selective brain-state inference. A tree-structured neural network (NeuralTree) classification processor extracts a rich set of neural biomarkers in a patient- and disease-specific manner. Trained with an energy-aware learning algorithm, the NeuralTree classifier detects the symptoms of underlying disorders at an optimal energy-accuracy trade-off. A 16-channel high-voltage (HV) compliant neurostimulator closes the therapeutic loop by delivering charge-balanced biphasic current pulses to the brain. The proposed SoC was fabricated in 65nm CMOS and achieved a 0.227{\\mu}J/class energy efficiency in a compact area of 0.014mm\\textsuperscript{2}/channel. The SoC was extensively verified on human electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) epilepsy datasets, obtaining 95.6\\%/94\\% sensitivity and 96.8\\%/96.9\\% specificity, respectively. \\emph{In-vivo} neural recordings using soft {\\mu}ECoG arrays and multi-domain biomarker extraction were further performed on a rat model of epilepsy. In addition, for the first time in literature, on-chip classification of rest-state tremor in Parkinson's disease from human local field potentials (LFPs) was demonstrated. ",

    "title": "Faster quantum mixing of Markov chains in non-regular graph with fewer  qubits",
    "abstract": "Sampling from the stationary distribution is one of the fundamental tasks of Markov chain-based algorithms and has important applications in machine learning, combinatorial optimization and network science. For the quantum case, qsampling from Markov chains can be constructed as preparing quantum states with amplitudes arbitrarily close to the square root of a stationary distribution instead of classical sampling from a stationary distribution. In this paper, a new qsampling algorithm for all reversible Markov chains is constructed by discrete-time quantum walks and works without any limit compared with existing results. In detail, we build a qsampling algorithm that not only accelerates non-regular graphs but also keeps the speed-up of existing quantum algorithms for regular graphs. In non-regular graphs, the invocation of the quantum fast-forward algorithm accelerates existing state-of-the-art qsampling algorithms for both discrete-time and continuous-time cases, especially on sparse graphs. Compared to existing algorithms we reduce log n, where n is the number of graph vertices. In regular graphs, our result matches other quantum algorithms, and our reliance on the gap of Markov chains achieves quadratic speedup compared with classical cases. For both cases, we reduce the number of ancilla qubits required compared to the existing results. In some widely used graphs and a series of sparse graphs where stationary distributions are difficult to reach quickly, our algorithm is the first algorithm to achieve complete quadratic acceleration (without log factor) over the classical case without any limit. To enlarge success probability amplitude amplification is introduced. We construct a new reflection on stationary state with fewer ancilla qubits and think it may have independent application. ",

In particular, I look at cascade equilibria, in which agents switch over time from the risky action to the riskless action only when they become sufficiently pessimistic. I show that these equilibria exist under some conditions and establish their salient properties. Individual exploration in these equilibria can be more or less than the single-agent level depending on whether the agents start out with a common prior or not, but the most optimistic agent always underexplores. I also show that allowing the agents to write enforceable ex-ante contracts will lead to the most ex-ante optimistic agent to buy all payoff streams, providing an explanation to the buying out of smaller start-ups by more established firms.

    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms are the leading candidate for near-term advantage on noisy quantum hardware. When training a parametrized quantum circuit to solve a specific task, the choice of ansatz is one of the most important factors that determines the trainability and performance of the algorithm. Problem-tailored ansatzes have become the standard for tasks in optimization or quantum chemistry, and yield more efficient algorithms with better performance than unstructured approaches. In quantum machine learning (QML), however, the literature on ansatzes that are motivated by the training data structure is scarce. Considering that it is widely known that unstructured ansatzes can become untrainable with increasing system size and circuit depth, it is of key importance to also study problem-tailored circuit architectures in a QML context. In this work, we introduce an ansatz for learning tasks on weighted graphs that respects an important graph symmetry, namely equivariance under node permutations. We evaluate the performance of this ansatz on a complex learning task on weighted graphs, where a ML model is used to implement a heuristic for a combinatorial optimization problem. We analytically study the expressivity of our ansatz at depth one, and numerically compare the performance of our model on instances with up to 20 qubits to ansatzes where the equivariance property is gradually broken. We show that our ansatz outperforms all others even in the small-instance regime. Our results strengthen the notion that symmetry-preserving ansatzes are a key to success in QML and should be an active area of research in order to enable near-term advantages in this field. ",

    "abstract": "Poverty is one of the fundamental issues that mankind faces. Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is deployed for measuring poverty issues in a population beyond monetary. However, MPI cannot provide information regarding associations and causal relations among poverty factors. Does education cause income inequality in a specific region? Is lacking education a cause of health issues? By not knowing causal relations, policy maker cannot pinpoint root causes of poverty issues of a specific population, which might not be the same across different population. Additionally, MPI requires binary data, which cannot be analyzed by most of causal inference frameworks. In this work, we proposed an exploratory-data-analysis framework for finding possible causal relations with confidence intervals among binary data. The proposed framework provides not only how severe the issue of poverty is, but it also provides the causal relations among poverty factors. Moreover, knowing a confidence interval of degree of causal direction lets us know how strong a causal relation is. We evaluated the proposed framework with several baseline approaches in simulation datasets as well as using two real-world datasets as case studies 1) Twin births of the United States: the relation between birth weight and mortality of twin, and 2) Thailand population surveys from 378k households of Chiang Mai and 353k households of Khon Kaen provinces. Our framework performed better than baselines in most cases. The first case study reveals almost all mortality cases in twins have issues of low birth weights but not all low-birth-weight twins were died. The second case study reveals that smoking associates with drinking alcohol in both provinces and there is a causal relation of smoking causes drinking alcohol in only Chiang Mai province. The framework can be applied beyond the poverty context. ",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-based waveforms are used for communication links in many current and emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications, including the latest WiFi standards. For such OFDM-based transceivers, many core physical layer functions related to channel estimation, demapping, and decoding are implemented for specific choices of channel types and modulation schemes, among others. To decouple hard-wired choices from the receiver chain and thereby enhance the flexibility of IoT deployment in many novel scenarios without changing the underlying hardware, we explore a novel, modular Machine Learning (ML)-based receiver chain design. Here, ML blocks replace the individual processing blocks of an OFDM receiver, and we specifically describe this swapping for the legacy channel estimation, symbol demapping, and decoding blocks with Neural Networks (NNs). A unique aspect of this modular design is providing flexible allocation of processing functions to the legacy or ML blocks, allowing them to interchangeably coexist. Furthermore, we study the implementation cost-benefits of the proposed NNs in resource-constrained IoT devices through pruning and quantization, as well as emulation of these compressed NNs within Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Our evaluations demonstrate that the proposed modular NN-based receiver improves bit error rate of the traditional non-ML receiver by averagely 61% and 10% for the simulated and over-the-air datasets, respectively. We further show complexity-performance tradeoffs by presenting computational complexity comparisons between the traditional algorithms and the proposed compressed NNs. ",

The proposed GFT is consistent with the conventional GFT in the undirected graph setting, and on directed circulant graphs, the proposed GFT is the classical discrete Fourier transform, up to some rotation, permutation and phase adjustment.
