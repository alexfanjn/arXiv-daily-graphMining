    "title": "Minimum Cost Intervention Design for Causal Effect Identification",
    "abstract": "Pearl's do calculus is a complete axiomatic approach to learn the identifiable causal effects from observational data. When such an effect is not identifiable, it is necessary to perform a collection of often costly interventions in the system to learn the causal effect. In this work, we consider the problem of designing the collection of interventions with the minimum cost to identify the desired effect. First, we prove that this problem is NP-hard, and subsequently propose an algorithm that can either find the optimal solution or a logarithmic-factor approximation of it. This is done by establishing a connection between our problem and the minimum hitting set problem. Additionally, we propose several polynomial-time heuristic algorithms to tackle the computational complexity of the problem. Although these algorithms could potentially stumble on sub-optimal solutions, our simulations show that they achieve small regrets on random graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Human-translated text displays distinct features from naturally written text in the same language. This phenomena, known as translationese, has been argued to confound the machine translation (MT) evaluation. Yet, we find that existing work on translationese neglects some important factors and the conclusions are mostly correlational but not causal. In this work, we collect CausalMT, a dataset where the MT training data are also labeled with the human translation directions. We inspect two critical factors, the train-test direction match (whether the human translation directions in the training and test sets are aligned), and data-model direction match (whether the model learns in the same direction as the human translation direction in the dataset). We show that these two factors have a large causal effect on the MT performance, in addition to the test-model direction mismatch highlighted by existing work on the impact of translationese. In light of our findings, we provide a set of suggestions for MT training and evaluation. Our code and data are at https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/CausalMT ",

    "abstract": "Zero Day Threats (ZDT) are novel methods used by malicious actors to attack and exploit information technology (IT) networks or infrastructure. In the past few years, the number of these threats has been increasing at an alarming rate and have been costing organizations millions of dollars to remediate. The increasing expansion of network attack surfaces and the exponentially growing number of assets on these networks necessitate the need for a robust AI-based Zero Day Threat detection model that can quickly analyze petabyte-scale data for potentially malicious and novel activity. In this paper, the authors introduce a deep learning based approach to Zero Day Threat detection that can generalize, scale, and effectively identify threats in near real-time. The methodology utilizes network flow telemetry augmented with asset-level graph features, which are passed through a dual-autoencoder structure for anomaly and novelty detection respectively. The models have been trained and tested on four large scale datasets that are representative of real-world organizational networks and they produce strong results with high precision and recall values. The models provide a novel methodology to detect complex threats with low false-positive rates that allow security operators to avoid alert fatigue while drastically reducing their mean time to response with near-real-time detection. Furthermore, the authors also provide a novel, labelled, cyber attack dataset generated from adversarial activity that can be used for validation or training of other models. With this paper, the authors' overarching goal is to provide a novel architecture and training methodology for cyber anomaly detectors that can generalize to multiple IT networks with minimal to no retraining while still maintaining strong performance.

    "abstract": "Dense retrieval is becoming one of the standard approaches for document and passage ranking. The dual-encoder architecture is widely adopted for scoring question-passage pairs due to its efficiency and high performance. Typically, dense retrieval models are evaluated on clean and curated datasets. However, when deployed in real-life applications, these models encounter noisy user-generated text. That said, the performance of state-of-the-art dense retrievers can substantially deteriorate when exposed to noisy text. In this work, we study the robustness of dense retrievers against typos in the user question. We observe a significant drop in the performance of the dual-encoder model when encountering typos and explore ways to improve its robustness by combining data augmentation with contrastive learning. Our experiments on two large-scale passage ranking and open-domain question answering datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms competing approaches. Additionally, we perform a thorough analysis on robustness. Finally, we provide insights on how different typos affect the robustness of embeddings differently and how our method alleviates the effect of some typos but not of others. ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that auto-encoder based approaches successfully perform language generation, smooth sentence interpolation, and style transfer over unseen attributes using unlabelled datasets in a zero-shot manner. The latent space geometry of such models is organised well enough to perform on datasets where the style is \"coarse-grained\" i.e. a small fraction of words alone in a sentence are enough to determine the overall style label. A recent study uses a discrete token-based perturbation approach to map \"similar\" sentences (\"similar\" defined by low Levenshtein distance/ high word overlap) close by in latent space. This definition of \"similarity\" does not look into the underlying nuances of the constituent words while mapping latent space neighbourhoods and therefore fails to recognise sentences with different style-based semantics while mapping latent neighbourhoods. We introduce EPAAEs (Embedding Perturbed Adversarial AutoEncoders) which completes this perturbation model, by adding a finely adjustable noise component on the continuous embeddings space. We empirically show that this (a) produces a better organised latent space that clusters stylistically similar sentences together, (b) performs best on a diverse set of text style transfer tasks than similar denoising-inspired baselines, and (c) is capable of fine-grained control of Style Transfer strength. We also extend the text style transfer tasks to NLI datasets and show that these more complex definitions of style are learned best by EPAAE. To the best of our knowledge, extending style transfer to NLI tasks has not been explored before. ",

Economic and related factors were able to account for a portion of this trend, but the bulk has remained unexplained. Here, we propose a systemic, relational model of internal migration in the U.S., combining demographic, economic, political, and geographical factors with endogenous social mechanisms, with the objective of identifying factors limiting migration rates. We implement this model using valued temporal exponential-family random graph models, allowing us to calibrate it to the (valued) network of intercounty U.S. migration flows during the 2011-2015 period. Our analysis reveals a pattern of segmented immobility, where fewer people migrate between counties with dissimilar political contexts, levels of urbanization, and racial compositions. Probing our model using \"knockout\" experiments suggests that one would have observed approximately 3 million (17%) more intercounty migrants over the study period were the segmented immobility mechanisms inoperative. This analysis suggests that internal migration in the current era is driven not only by demographic and economic factors, but also cultural and political ones. It also reveals social and political cleavages that underlie geographical immobility in America. ",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs), which organize visual-text factual knowledge, have recently been successfully applied to tasks such as information retrieval, question answering, and recommendation system. Since most MKGs are far from complete, extensive knowledge graph completion studies have been proposed focusing on the multimodal entity, relation extraction and link prediction. However, different tasks and modalities require changes to the model architecture, and not all images/objects are relevant to text input, which hinders the applicability to diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hybrid transformer with multi-level fusion to address those issues. Specifically, we leverage a hybrid transformer architecture with unified input-output for diverse multimodal knowledge graph completion tasks. Moreover, we propose multi-level fusion, which integrates visual and text representation via coarse-grained prefix-guided interaction and fine-grained correlation-aware fusion modules. We conduct extensive experiments to validate that our MKGformer can obtain SOTA performance on four datasets of multimodal link prediction, multimodal RE, and multimodal NER.

However, the utility of such evidence is limited by the lack of databases of footwear impression patterns that cover the huge and growing number of distinct shoe models. We propose to address this gap by leveraging shoe tread photographs collected by online retailers. The core challenge is to predict the impression pattern from the shoe photograph since ground-truth impressions or 3D shapes of tread patterns are not available. We develop a model that performs intrinsic image decomposition (predicting depth, normal, albedo, and lighting) from a single tread photo. Our approach, which we term ShoeRinsics, combines domain adaptation and re-rendering losses in order to leverage a mix of fully supervised synthetic data and unsupervised retail image data. To validate model performance, we also collected a set of paired shoe-sole images and corresponding prints, and define a benchmarking protocol to quantify the accuracy of predicted impressions. On this benchmark, ShoeRinsics outperforms existing methods for depth prediction and synthetic-to-real domain adaptation. ",

The speed of these SLMs offers time multiplexing capabilities, essentially enabling partially-coherent holographic display modes. Here we report advances in camera-calibrated wave propagation models for these types of holographic near-eye displays and we develop a CGH framework that robustly optimizes the heavily quantized phase patterns of fast SLMs. Our framework is flexible in supporting runtime supervision with different types of content, including 2D and 2.5D RGBD images, 3D focal stacks, and 4D light fields.

A missing ingredient for robust tracking is achieving performance with minimal modification on network structure and semi-supervised learning intermittent labeled frames. In this paper, we ad-dress these problems in a Bayesian tracking and detection framework parameterized by neural network outputs. In our framework, the tracking and detection process is formulated in a probabilistic way as multi-objects dynamics and network detection uncertainties. With our formulation, we propose a particle filter-based approximate sampling algorithm for tracking object state estimation. Based on our particle filter inference algorithm, a semi-supervised learn-ing algorithm is utilized for learning tracking network on intermittent labeled frames by variational inference. In our experiments, we provide both mAP and probability-based detection measurements for comparison between our algorithm with non-Bayesian solutions.

Results showed a strong correlation between heave responses and significant wave height estimates, whilst the accuracy of mean wave period and wave heading predictions were observed to improve considerably when data from multiple vessel degrees of freedom (DOFs) was utilized. Overall, 3-DOF (heave, pitch and roll) NNs for SSE were shown to perform well when compared to existing SSE approaches that use similar simulation setups. Given the information-dense statistical representation of vessel motion responses in spectral form, as well as the ability of NNs to effectively model complex relationships between variables, the designed SSE method shows promise for future adaptation to mobile SSE systems using the SAWB approach.

Recent research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has advanced the development of various toxicity detection models with the intention of identifying and mitigating toxic language from existing systems. Despite the abundance of research in this area, less attention has been given to adversarial attacks that force the system to generate toxic language and the defense against them. Existing work to generate such attacks is either based on human-generated attacks which is costly and not scalable or, in case of automatic attacks, the attack vector does not conform to human-like language, which can be detected using a language model loss. In this work, we propose attacks against conversational agents that are imperceptible, i.e., they fit the conversation in terms of coherency, relevancy, and fluency, while they are effective and scalable, i.e., they can automatically trigger the system into generating toxic language. We then propose a defense mechanism against such attacks which not only mitigates the attack but also attempts to maintain the conversational flow. Through automatic and human evaluations, we show that our defense is effective at avoiding toxic language generation even against imperceptible toxicity triggers while the generated language fits the conversation in terms of coherency and relevancy. Lastly, we establish the generalizability of such a defense mechanism on language generation models beyond conversational agents. ",

To mitigate this gap, we propose DocReL, a Document Relational Representation Learning framework. The major challenge of DocReL roots in the variety of relations. From the simplest pairwise relation to the complex global structure, it is infeasible to conduct supervised training due to the definition of relation varies and even conflicts in different tasks. To deal with the unpredictable definition of relations, we propose a novel contrastive learning task named Relational Consistency Modeling (RCM), which harnesses the fact that existing relations should be consistent in differently augmented positive views. RCM provides relational representations which are more compatible to the urgent need of downstream tasks, even without any knowledge about the exact definition of relation. DocReL achieves better performance on a wide variety of VRD relational understanding tasks, including table structure recognition, key information extraction and reading order detection. ",

    "abstract": "We are entering a rapidly unfolding future driven by the delivery of real-time computation services, such as industrial automation and augmented reality, collectively referred to as AgI services, over highly distributed cloud/edge computing networks. The interaction intensive nature of AgI services is accelerating the need for networking solutions that provide strict latency guarantees. In contrast to most existing studies that can only characterize average delay performance, we focus on the critical goal of delivering AgI services ahead of corresponding deadlines on a per-packet basis, while minimizing overall cloud network operational cost. To this end, we design a novel queuing system able to track data packets' lifetime and formalize the delay-constrained least-cost dynamic network control problem. To address this challenging problem, we first study the setting with average capacity (or resource budget) constraints, for which we characterize the delay-constrained stability region and design a near-optimal control policy leveraging Lyapunov optimization theory on an equivalent virtual network. Guided by the same principle, we tackle the peak capacity constrained scenario by developing the reliable cloud network control (RCNC) algorithm, which employs a two-way optimization method to make actual and virtual network flow solutions converge in an iterative manner. Extensive numerical results show the superior performance of the proposed control policy compared with the state-of-the-art cloud network control algorithm, and the value of guaranteeing strict end-to-end deadlines for the delivery of next-generation AgI services.

    "title": "FAITH: Few-Shot Graph Classification with Hierarchical Task Graphs",
    "abstract": "Few-shot graph classification aims at predicting classes for graphs, given limited labeled graphs for each class. To tackle the bottleneck of label scarcity, recent works propose to incorporate few-shot learning frameworks for fast adaptations to graph classes with limited labeled graphs. Specifically, these works propose to accumulate meta-knowledge across diverse meta-training tasks, and then generalize such meta-knowledge to the target task with a disjoint label set. However, existing methods generally ignore task correlations among meta-training tasks while treating them independently. Nevertheless, such task correlations can advance the model generalization to the target task for better classification performance. On the other hand, it remains non-trivial to utilize task correlations due to the complex components in a large number of meta-training tasks. To deal with this, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework FAITH that captures task correlations via constructing a hierarchical task graph at different granularities. Then we further design a loss-based sampling strategy to select tasks with more correlated classes. Moreover, a task-specific classifier is proposed to utilize the learned task correlations for few-shot classification. Extensive experiments on four prevalent few-shot graph classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FAITH over other state-of-the-art baselines. ",

In this paper, we present a novel deep learning method, called the Dst Transformer, to perform short-term, 1-6 hour ahead, forecasting of the Dst index based on the solar wind parameters provided by the NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive. The Dst Transformer combines a multi-head attention layer with Bayesian inference, which is capable of quantifying both aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty when making Dst predictions. Experimental results show that the proposed Dst Transformer outperforms related machine learning methods in terms of the root mean square error and R-squared. Furthermore, the Dst Transformer can produce both data and model uncertainty quantification results, which can not be done by the existing methods. To our knowledge, this is the first time that Bayesian deep learning has been used for Dst index forecasting. ",

While the literature has a variety of algorithms that achieve the asymptotically optimal rates for this problem, the performance of these algorithms in practice can vary significantly due to varying (and often large) hidden constants. In this work, we investigate the question of designing the protocol with the smallest variance. We show that PrivUnit (Bhowmick et al. 2018) with optimized parameters achieves the optimal variance among a large family of locally private randomizers. To prove this result, we establish some properties of local randomizers, and use symmetrization arguments that allow us to write the optimal randomizer as the optimizer of a certain linear program. These structural results, which should extend to other problems, then allow us to show that the optimal randomizer belongs to the PrivUnit family. We also develop a new variant of PrivUnit based on the Gaussian distribution which is more amenable to mathematical analysis and enjoys the same optimality guarantees. This allows us to establish several useful properties on the exact constants of the optimal error as well as to numerically estimate these constants. ",

This paper considers scheduling coflows with precedence constraints in identical parallel networks, such as to minimize the total weighted completion time of coflows. The identical parallel network is an architecture based on multiple network cores running in parallel. In the divisible coflow scheduling problem, the proposed algorithm achieves $(6-\\frac{2}{m})\\mu$ and $(5-\\frac{2}{m})\\mu$ approximate ratios for arbitrary release time and zero release time, respectively, where $m$ is the number of network cores and $\\mu$ is the coflow number of the longest path in the precedence graph.

In the single network core scheduling problem, we propose a $5\\mu$-approximation algorithm with arbitrary release times, and a $4\\mu$-approximation without release time. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be modified to solve the coflows of multi-stage jobs scheduling problem. In multi-stage jobs, coflow is transferred between servers to enable starting of next stage. This means that there are precedence constraints between coflows of job. Our result represents an improvement upon the previous best approximation ratio of $O(\\tilde{\\mu} \\log(N)/ \\log(\\log(N)))$ where $\\tilde{\\mu}$ is the maximum number of coflows in a job and $N$ is the number of servers.

    "abstract": "Online social networks are a dominant medium in everyday life to stay in contact with friends and to share information. In Twitter, users can connect with other users by following them, who in turn can follow back. In recent years, researchers studied several properties of social networks and designed random graph models to describe them. Many of these approaches either focus on the generation of undirected graphs or on the creation of directed graphs without modeling the dependencies between reciprocal (i.e., two directed edges of opposite direction between two nodes) and directed edges. We propose an approach to generate directed social network graphs that creates reciprocal and directed edges and considers the correlation between the respective degree sequences. Our model relies on crawled directed graphs in Twitter, on which information w.r.t. a topic is exchanged or disseminated. While these graphs exhibit a high clustering coefficient and small average distances between random node pairs (which is typical in real-world networks), their degree sequences seem to follow a $\\chi^2$-distribution rather than power law. To achieve high clustering coefficients, we apply an edge rewiring procedure that preserves the node degrees. We compare the crawled and the created graphs, and simulate certain algorithms for information dissemination and epidemic spreading on them. The results show that the created graphs exhibit very similar topological and algorithmic properties as the real-world graphs, providing evidence that they can be used as surrogates in social network analysis. Furthermore, our model is highly scalable, which enables us to create graphs of arbitrary size with almost the same properties as the corresponding real-world networks. ",

    "abstract": "Recent work for extracting relations from texts has achieved excellent performance. However, most existing methods pay less attention to the efficiency, making it still challenging to quickly extract relations from massive or streaming text data in realistic scenarios. The main efficiency bottleneck is that these methods use a Transformer-based pre-trained language model for encoding, which heavily affects the training speed and inference speed. To address this issue, we propose a fast relation extraction model (FastRE) based on convolutional encoder and improved cascade binary tagging framework. Compared to previous work, FastRE employs several innovations to improve efficiency while also keeping promising performance. Concretely, FastRE adopts a novel convolutional encoder architecture combined with dilated convolution, gated unit and residual connection, which significantly reduces the computation cost of training and inference, while maintaining the satisfactory performance. Moreover, to improve the cascade binary tagging framework, FastRE first introduces a type-relation mapping mechanism to accelerate tagging efficiency and alleviate relation redundancy, and then utilizes a position-dependent adaptive thresholding strategy to obtain higher tagging accuracy and better model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that FastRE is well balanced between efficiency and performance, and achieves 3-10x training speed, 7-15x inference speed faster, and 1/100 parameters compared to the state-of-the-art models, while the performance is still competitive.

However, without considering the penalization of problematic tokens, LMs trained using cross-entropy exhibit text degeneration. To address this, unlikelihood training has been proposed to force unlikely tokens to be assigned a low probability by a LM. But unlikelihood does not consider the relationship between the label tokens and the unlikely token candidates, thus showing marginal improvements in degeneration. We propose a new contrastive token learning objective that inherits the advantages of cross-entropy and unlikelihood training and avoids their limitations. The key idea is to force a LM to generate high probabilities for label tokens at each step while low probabilities of negative candidates. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling and open-domain dialogue generation tasks show that the proposed contrastive token objective yields less repetitive texts, with a higher generation quality than unlikelihood training, achieving the new state-of-the-art performance.

Extensive experiments are performed on six NIR and one visible-light iris databases to show the effectiveness and robustness of proposed A-PBS methods.

We validate our proposed backdoor attack to a typical job scheduling task in cloud computing.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attack perturbs an image with an imperceptible noise, leading to incorrect model prediction. Recently, a few works showed inherent bias associated with such attack (robustness bias), where certain subgroups in a dataset (e.g. based on class, gender, etc.) are less robust than others. This bias not only persists even after adversarial training, but often results in severe performance discrepancies across these subgroups. Existing works characterize the subgroup's robustness bias by only checking individual sample's proximity to the decision boundary. In this work, we argue that this measure alone is not sufficient and validate our argument via extensive experimental analysis. It has been observed that adversarial attacks often corrupt the high-frequency components of the input image. We, therefore, propose a holistic approach for quantifying adversarial vulnerability of a sample by combining these different perspectives, i.e., degree of model's reliance on high-frequency features and the (conventional) sample-distance to the decision boundary. We demonstrate that by reliably estimating adversarial vulnerability at the sample level using the proposed holistic metric, it is possible to develop a trustworthy system where humans can be alerted about the incoming samples that are highly likely to be misclassified at test time. This is achieved with better precision when our holistic metric is used over individual measures. To further corroborate the utility of the proposed holistic approach, we perform knowledge distillation in a limited-sample setting. We observe that the student network trained with the subset of samples selected using our combined metric performs better than both the competing baselines, viz., where samples are selected randomly or based on their distances to the decision boundary.

    "abstract": "Multiple access (MA) design is investigated for facilitating the coexistence of the emerging semantic transmission and the conventional bit-based transmission in future networks. The semantic rate is considered for measuring the performance of the semantic transmission. However, a key challenge is that there is a lack of a closed-form expression for a key parameter, namely the semantic similarity, which characterizes the sentence similarity between an original sentence and the corresponding recovered sentence. To overcome this challenge, we propose a data regression method, where the semantic similarity is approximated by a generalized logistic function. Using the obtained tractable function, we propose a heterogeneous semantic and bit communication framework, where an access point simultaneously sends the semantic and bit streams to one semantics-interested user (S-user) and one bit-interested user (B-user). To realize this heterogeneous semantic and bit transmission in multi-user networks, three MA schemes are proposed, namely orthogonal multiple access (OMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and semi-NOMA. More specifically, the bit stream in semi-NOMA is split into two streams, one is transmitted with the semantic stream over the shared frequency sub-band and the other is transmitted over the separate orthogonal frequency sub-band. To study the fundamental performance limits of the three proposed MA schemes, the semantic-versus-bit (SvB) rate region and the power region are defined. An optimal resource allocation procedure is then derived for characterizing the boundary of the SvB rate region and the power region achieved by each MA scheme. The structures of the derived solutions demonstrate that semi-NOMA is superior to both NOMA and OMA given its highly flexible transmission policy. Our numerical results validate the analysis and show the superiority of semi-NOMA. ",

    "abstract": "We present GANimator, a generative model that learns to synthesize novel motions from a single, short motion sequence. GANimator generates motions that resemble the core elements of the original motion, while simultaneously synthesizing novel and diverse movements. Existing data-driven techniques for motion synthesis require a large motion dataset which contains the desired and specific skeletal structure. By contrast, GANimator only requires training on a single motion sequence, enabling novel motion synthesis for a variety of skeletal structures e.g., bipeds, quadropeds, hexapeds, and more. Our framework contains a series of generative and adversarial neural networks, each responsible for generating motions in a specific frame rate. The framework progressively learns to synthesize motion from random noise, enabling hierarchical control over the generated motion content across varying levels of detail. We show a number of applications, including crowd simulation, key-frame editing, style transfer, and interactive control, which all learn from a single input sequence.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of autonomously detecting text on technical drawings. The detection of text on technical drawings is a critical step towards autonomous production machines, especially for brown-field processes, where no closed CAD-CAM solutions are available yet. Automating the process of reading and detecting text on technical drawings reduces the effort for handling inefficient media interruptions due to paper-based processes, which are often todays quasi-standard in brown-field processes. However, there are no reliable methods available yet to solve the issue of automatically detecting text on technical drawings. The unreliable detection of the contents on technical drawings using classical detection and object character recognition (OCR) tools is mainly due to the limited number of technical drawings and the captcha-like structure of the contents. Text is often combined with unknown symbols and interruptions by lines. Additionally, due to intellectual property rights and technical know-how issues, there are no out-of-the box training datasets available in the literature to train such models. This paper combines a domain knowledge-based generator to generate realistic technical drawings with a state-of-the-art object detection model to solve the issue of detecting text on technical drawings. The generator yields artificial technical drawings in a large variety and can be considered as a data augmentation generator. These artificial drawings are used for training, while the model is tested on real data. The authors show that artificially generated data of technical drawings improve the detection quality with an increasing number of drawings. ",

However, as in most analogous seismic models, the peculiar statistics of the corresponding time-series severely jeopardize this endeavour, due to the time intermittence and scale-invariance of these events. But more importantly, such predictions are hard to {\\it assess}: depending on the choice of what to predict, the results can be very different and not easily compared. Furthermore, forecasting models may be trained with various generic metrics which ignore some important specificities of the problem at hand, in our case seismic risk. Finally, these models often do not provide a clear strategy regarding the best way to use these predictions in practice. Here we introduce a framework that allows to design, evaluate and compare not only predictors but also decision-making policies: a model seismically active {\\it city} subjected to the crackling dynamics observed in the mechanical response of knitted fabric. We thus proceed to study the population of KnitCity, introducing a policy through which the mayor of the town can decide to either keep people in, which in case of large events cause human loss, or evacuate the city, which costs a daily fee. The policy only relies on past seismic observations. We construct efficient policies using a reinforcement learning environment and various time-series predictors based on artificial neural networks. By inducing a physically motivated metric on the predictors, this mechanism allows quantitative assessment and comparison of their relevance in the decision-making process. ",

As opposed to other industrial and urban environments, the environment under study includes many interfering background noises, complicating the identification of leaks. Furthermore, the harsh environmental conditions limit the amount of data collected and impose the use of low-complexity algorithms. To address the environment's constraints, the developed ML pipeline applies multiple steps, each addressing the environment's challenges. The proposed ML pipeline first reduces the data dimensionality by feature selection techniques and then incorporates time correlations by extracting time-based features. The resultant features are fed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) of low-complexity that generalizes well to a small amount of data. An extensive experimental procedure was carried out on two datasets, one with background industrial noise and one without, to evaluate the validity of the proposed pipeline. The SVM hyper-parameters and parameters specific to the pipeline steps were tuned as part of the experimental procedure. The best models obtained from the dataset with industrial noise and leaks were applied to datasets without noise and with and without leaks to test their generalizability. The results show that the model produces excellent results with 99\\% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.93 and 0.9 for the respective datasets. ",

We hereby present a novel solution to mimic such human perception capability based on a new paradigm of amodal 3D scene understanding with neural rendering for a closed scene. Specifically, we first learn the prior knowledge of the objects in a closed scene via an offline stage, which facilitates an online stage to understand the room with unseen furniture arrangement. During the online stage, given a panoramic image of the scene in different layouts, we utilize a holistic neural-rendering-based optimization framework to efficiently estimate the correct 3D scene layout and deliver realistic free-viewpoint rendering. In order to handle the domain gap between the offline and online stage, our method exploits compositional neural rendering techniques for data augmentation in the offline training. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our two-stage design achieves robust 3D scene understanding and outperforms competing methods by a large margin, and we also show that our realistic free-viewpoint rendering enables various applications, including scene touring and editing.

However, complex designs are not uncommon in TAD, such as two-stream feature extraction, multi-stage training, complex temporal modeling, and global context fusion. In this paper, we do not aim to introduce any novel technique for TAD. Instead, we study a simple, straightforward, yet must-known baseline given the current status of complex design and low efficiency in TAD. In our simple baseline (BasicTAD), we decompose the TAD pipeline into several essential components: data sampling, backbone design, neck construction, and detection head. We empirically investigate the existing techniques in each component for this baseline and, more importantly, perform end-to-end training over the entire pipeline thanks to the simplicity in design. Our BasicTAD yields an astounding RGB-Only baseline very close to the state-of-the-art methods with two-stream inputs. In addition, we further improve the BasicTAD by preserving more temporal and spatial information in network representation (termed as BasicTAD Plus). Empirical results demonstrate that our BasicTAD Plus is very efficient and significantly outperforms the previous methods on the datasets of THUMOS14 and FineAction. Our approach can serve as a strong baseline for TAD. The code will be released at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/BasicTAD. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel negative training paradigm, called negative distillation, to keep the model away from the undesirable generic responses while avoiding the above problems. First, we introduce a negative teacher model that can produce query-wise generic responses, and then the student model is required to maximize the distance with multi-level negative knowledge.

Our method encodes the volumetric field of a 3D shape with an adaptive feature volume organized by an octree and applies a compact multilayer perceptron network for mapping the features to the field value at each 3D position. An encoder-decoder network is designed to learn the adaptive feature volume based on the graph convolutions over the dual graph of octree nodes. The core of our network is a new graph convolution operator defined over a regular grid of features fused from irregular neighboring octree nodes at different levels, which not only reduces the computational and memory cost of the convolutions over irregular neighboring octree nodes, but also improves the performance of feature learning. Our method effectively encodes shape details, enables fast 3D shape reconstruction, and exhibits good generality for modeling 3D shapes out of training categories.

Given a malfunctional object, humans can perform mental simulations to reason about its functionality and figure out how to fix it. Inspired by this, we propose FixIt, a dataset that contains about 5k poorly-designed 3D physical objects paired with choices to fix them. To mimic humans' mental simulation process, we present FixNet, a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates perception and physical dynamics. Specifically, FixNet consists of a perception module to extract the structured representation from the 3D point cloud, a physical dynamics prediction module to simulate the results of interactions on 3D objects, and a functionality prediction module to evaluate the functionality and choose the correct fix. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms baseline models by a large margin, and can generalize well to objects with similar interaction types. ",

Many previous works have shown impressive reconstruction results on textured objects, but they still have difficulty in handling low-textured planar regions, which are common in indoor scenes. An approach to solving this issue is to incorporate planer constraints into the depth map estimation in multi-view stereo-based methods, but the per-view plane estimation and depth optimization lack both efficiency and multi-view consistency. In this work, we show that the planar constraints can be conveniently integrated into the recent implicit neural representation-based reconstruction methods. Specifically, we use an MLP network to represent the signed distance function as the scene geometry. Based on the Manhattan-world assumption, planar constraints are employed to regularize the geometry in floor and wall regions predicted by a 2D semantic segmentation network. To resolve the inaccurate segmentation, we encode the semantics of 3D points with another MLP and design a novel loss that jointly optimizes the scene geometry and semantics in 3D space. Experiments on ScanNet and 7-Scenes datasets show that the proposed method outperforms previous methods by a large margin on 3D reconstruction quality.

    "abstract": "Accurate uncertainty estimates can significantly improve the performance of iterative design of experiments, as in Sequential and Reinforcement learning. For many such problems in engineering and the physical sciences, the design task depends on multiple correlated model outputs as objectives and/or constraints. To better solve these problems, we propose a recalibrated bootstrap method to generate multivariate prediction intervals for bagged models and show that it is well-calibrated. We apply the recalibrated bootstrap to a simulated sequential learning problem with multiple objectives and show that it leads to a marked decrease in the number of iterations required to find a satisfactory candidate. This indicates that the recalibrated bootstrap could be a valuable tool for practitioners using machine learning to optimize systems with multiple competing targets. ",

    "abstract": "The semi-random graph process is a single player game in which the player is initially presented an empty graph on $n$ vertices. In each round, a vertex $u$ is presented to the player independently and uniformly at random. The player then adaptively selects a vertex $v$, and adds the edge $uv$ to the graph. For a fixed monotone graph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy this property with high probability in as few rounds as possible. We focus on the problem of constructing a Hamiltonian cycle in as few rounds as possible. In particular, we present an adaptive strategy for the player which achieves it in $\\alpha n$ rounds, where $\\alpha < 2.01678$ is derived from the solution to some system of differential equations. We also show that the player cannot achieve the desired property in less than $\\beta n$ rounds, where $\\beta > 1.26575$. These results improve the previously best known bounds and, as a result, the gap between the upper and lower bounds is decreased from 1.39162 to 0.75102. ",

    "abstract": "Driven by the critical needs of biomanufacturing 4.0, we present a probabilistic knowledge graph hybrid model characterizing complex spatial-temporal causal interdependencies of underlying bioprocessing mechanisms. It can faithfully capture the important properties, including nonlinear reactions, partially observed state, and nonstationary dynamics. Given limited process observations, we derive a posterior distribution quantifying model uncertainty, which can facilitate mechanism learning and support robust process control. To avoid evaluation of intractable likelihood, Approximate Bayesian Computation sampling with Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) is developed to approximate the posterior distribution. Given high stochastic and model uncertainties, it is computationally expensive to match process output trajectories. Therefore, we propose a linear Gaussian dynamic Bayesian network (LG-DBN) auxiliary likelihood-based ABC-SMC algorithm. Through matching observed and simulated summary statistics, the proposed approach can dramatically reduce the computation cost and accelerate the posterior approximation convergence. ",

    "title": "Investigating molecular transport in the human brain from MRI with  physics-informed neural networks",
    "abstract": "In recent years, a plethora of methods combining deep neural networks and partial differential equations have been developed. A widely known and popular example are physics-informed neural networks. They solve forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations in terms of a neural network training problem. We apply physics-informed neural networks as well as the finite element method to estimate the diffusion coefficient governing the long term, i.e. over days, spread of molecules in the human brain from a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique. Synthetic testcases are created to demonstrate that the standard formulation of the physics-informed neural network faces challenges with noisy measurements in our application. Our numerical results demonstrate that the residual of the partial differential equation after training needs to be small in order to obtain accurate recovery of the diffusion coefficient. To achieve this, we apply several strategies such as tuning the weights and the norms used in the loss function as well as residual based adaptive refinement and exchange of residual training points. We find that the diffusion coefficient estimated with PINNs from magnetic resonance images becomes consistent with results from a finite element based approach when the residuum after training becomes small. The observations presented in this work are an important first step towards solving inverse problems on observations from large cohorts of patients in a semi-automated fashion with physics-informed neural networks.

Here we introduce MultiScaleGNN, a novel multi-scale graph neural network model for learning to infer unsteady continuum mechanics in problems encompassing a range of length scales and complex boundary geometries. We demonstrate this method on advection problems and incompressible fluid dynamics, both fundamental phenomena in oceanic and atmospheric processes. Our results show good extrapolation to new domain geometries and parameters for long-term temporal simulations. Simulations obtained with MultiScaleGNN are between two and four orders of magnitude faster than those on which it was trained. ",

    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have recently received significant attention from the research community due to their promising performance in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum computers (NISQ). However, VQAs run on parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) with randomly initialized parameters are characterized by barren plateaus (BP) where the gradient vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits. In this paper, we first review quantum natural gradient (QNG), which is one of the most popular algorithms used in VQA, from the classical first-order optimization point of view. Then, we proposed a \\underline{L}ook \\underline{A}round \\underline{W}arm-\\underline{S}tart QNG (LAWS) algorithm to mitigate the widespread existing BP issues. LAWS is a combinatorial optimization strategy taking advantage of model parameter initialization and fast convergence of QNG. LAWS repeatedly reinitializes parameter search space for the next iteration parameter update. The reinitialized parameter search space is carefully chosen by sampling the gradient close to the current optimal. Moreover, we present a unified framework (WS-SGD) for integrating parameter initialization techniques into the optimizer. We provide the convergence proof of the proposed framework for both convex and non-convex objective functions based on Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. Our experiment results show that the proposed algorithm could mitigate the BP and have better generalization ability in quantum classification problems. ",
