    "abstract": "Signage is everywhere and a robot should be able to take advantage of signs to help it localize (including Visual Place Recognition (VPR)) and map. Robust text detection & recognition in the wild is challenging due to such factors as pose, irregular text, illumination, and occlusion. We propose an end-to-end scene text spotting model that simultaneously outputs the text string and bounding boxes. This model is more suitable for VPR. Our central contribution is introducing utilizing an end-to-end scene text spotting framework to adequately capture the irregular and occluded text regions in different challenging places. To evaluate our proposed architecture's performance for VPR, we conducted several experiments on the challenging Self-Collected Text Place (SCTP) benchmark dataset. The initial experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the SOTA methods in terms of precision and recall when tested on this benchmark. ",

    "title": "Label-Efficient Self-Supervised Federated Learning for Tackling Data  Heterogeneity in Medical Imaging",
    "abstract": "The curation of large-scale medical datasets from multiple institutions necessary for training deep learning models is challenged by the difficulty in sharing patient data with privacy-preserving. Federated learning (FL), a paradigm that enables privacy-protected collaborative learning among different institutions, is a promising solution to this challenge. However, FL generally suffers from performance deterioration due to heterogeneous data distributions across institutions and the lack of quality labeled data. In this paper, we present a robust and label-efficient self-supervised FL framework for medical image analysis. Specifically, we introduce a novel distributed self-supervised pre-training paradigm into the existing FL pipeline (i.e., pre-training the models directly on the decentralized target task datasets). Built upon the recent success of Vision Transformers, we employ masked image encoding tasks for self-supervised pre-training, to facilitate more effective knowledge transfer to downstream federated models. Extensive empirical results on simulated and real-world medical imaging federated datasets show that self-supervised pre-training largely benefits the robustness of federated models against various degrees of data heterogeneity. Notably, under severe data heterogeneity, our method, without relying on any additional pre-training data, achieves an improvement of 5.06%, 1.53% and 4.58% in test accuracy on retinal, dermatology and chest X-ray classification compared with the supervised baseline with ImageNet pre-training. Moreover, we show that our self-supervised FL algorithm generalizes well to out-of-distribution data and learns federated models more effectively in limited label scenarios, surpassing the supervised baseline by 10.36% and the semi-supervised FL method by 8.3% in test accuracy.

    "abstract": "We present CV4Code, a compact and effective computer vision method for sourcecode understanding. Our method leverages the contextual and the structural information available from the code snippet by treating each snippet as a two-dimensional image, which naturally encodes the context and retains the underlying structural information through an explicit spatial representation. To codify snippets as images, we propose an ASCII codepoint-based image representation that facilitates fast generation of sourcecode images and eliminates redundancy in the encoding that would arise from an RGB pixel representation. Furthermore, as sourcecode is treated as images, neither lexical analysis (tokenisation) nor syntax tree parsing is required, which makes the proposed method agnostic to any particular programming language and lightweight from the application pipeline point of view. CV4Code can even featurise syntactically incorrect code which is not possible from methods that depend on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). We demonstrate the effectiveness of CV4Code by learning Convolutional and Transformer networks to predict the functional task, i.e. the problem it solves, of the source code directly from its two-dimensional representation, and using an embedding from its latent space to derive a similarity score of two code snippets in a retrieval setup. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison to other methods with the same task and data configurations. For the first time we show the benefits of treating sourcecode understanding as a form of image processing task. ",

Here, we introduce a graph representation of molecular ensembles and an associated graph neural network architecture that is tailored to polymer property prediction. We demonstrate that this approach captures critical features of polymeric materials, like chain architecture, monomer stoichiometry, and degree of polymerization, and achieves superior accuracy to off-the-shelf cheminformatics methodologies. While doing so, we built a dataset of simulated electron affinity and ionization potential values for >40k polymers with varying monomer composition, stoichiometry, and chain architecture, which may be used in the development of other tailored machine learning approaches. The dataset and machine learning models presented in this work pave the path toward new classes of algorithms for polymer informatics and, more broadly, introduce a framework for the modeling of molecular ensembles.

    "abstract": "In living organisms, homeostasis is the natural regulation of internal states aimed at maintaining conditions compatible with life. Typical artificial systems are not equipped with comparable regulatory features. Here, we introduce an artificial neural network that incorporates homeostatic features. Its own computing substrate is placed in a needful and vulnerable relation to the very objects over which it computes. For example, artificial neurons performing classification of MNIST digits or Fashion-MNIST articles of clothing may receive excitatory or inhibitory effects, which alter their own learning rate as a direct result of perceiving and classifying the digits. In this scenario, accurate recognition is desirable to the agent itself because it guides decisions to regulate its vulnerable internal states and functionality. Counterintuitively, the addition of vulnerability to a learner does not necessarily impair its performance. On the contrary, self-regulation in response to vulnerability confers benefits under certain conditions. We show that homeostatic design confers increased adaptability under concept shift, in which the relationships between labels and data change over time, and that the greatest advantages are obtained under the highest rates of shift. This necessitates the rapid un-learning of past associations and the re-learning of new ones. We also demonstrate the superior abilities of homeostatic learners in environments with dynamically changing rates of concept shift. Our homeostatic design exposes the artificial neural network's thinking machinery to the consequences of its own \"thoughts\", illustrating the advantage of putting one's own \"skin in the game\" to improve fluid intelligence.

Our goal is to improve a low-resource semantic parser using utterances collected through user interactions. In this highly challenging but realistic setting, we investigate data augmentation approaches involving generating a set of structured canonical utterances corresponding to logical forms, before simulating corresponding natural language and filtering the resulting pairs. We find that such approaches are effective despite our restrictive setup: in a low-resource setting on the complex SMCalFlow calendaring dataset (Andreas et al., 2020), we observe 33% relative improvement over a non-data-augmented baseline in top-1 match.

Although many spatial-temporal methods are currently proposed, these methods are deficient in capturing the spatial-temporal dependence of traffic data synchronously. In addition, most of the methods ignore the dynamically changing correlations between road network nodes that arise as traffic data changes. To address the above challenges, we propose a neural network-based Spatial-Temporal Interactive Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (STIDGCN) for traffic forecasting in this paper. In STIDGCN, we propose an interactive dynamic graph convolution structure, which first divides the sequences at intervals and captures the spatial-temporal dependence of the traffic data simultaneously through an interactive learning strategy for effective long-term prediction. We propose a novel dynamic graph convolution module consisting of a graph generator, fusion graph convolution. The dynamic graph convolution module can use the input traffic data, pre-defined graph structure to generate a graph structure and fuse it with the defined adaptive adjacency matrix, which is used to achieve the filling of the pre-defined graph structure and simulate the generation of dynamic associations between nodes in the road network. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate that STIDGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline. ",

As service development using deep learning models has gradually become competitive, many developers highly demand rapid hyperparameter optimization algorithms. In order to keep pace with the needs of faster hyperparameter optimization algorithms, researchers are focusing on improving the speed of hyperparameter optimization algorithm. However, the huge time consumption of hyperparameter optimization due to the high computational cost of the deep learning model itself has not been dealt with in-depth. Like using surrogate model in Bayesian optimization, to solve this problem, it is necessary to consider proxy model for a neural network (N_B) to be used for hyperparameter optimization. Inspired by the main goal of neural network pruning, i.e., high computational cost reduction and performance preservation, we presumed that the neural network (N_P) obtained through neural network pruning would be a good proxy model of N_B. In order to verify our idea, we performed extensive experiments by using CIFAR10, CFIAR100, and TinyImageNet datasets and three generally-used neural networks and three representative hyperparameter optmization methods. Through these experiments, we verified that N_P can be a good proxy model of N_B for rapid hyperparameter optimization. The proposed hyperparameter optimization framework can reduce the amount of time up to 37%. ",

However, existing DA techniques have addressed only one of these OOV types and limit to considering either syntactic constraints or semantic constraints. We present a word and phrase replacement-based DA technique that consider both types of OOV, by augmenting (1) rare words in the existing parallel corpus, and (2) new words from a bilingual dictionary. During augmentation, we consider both syntactic and semantic properties of the words to guarantee fluency in the synthetic sentences. This technique was experimented with low resource Sinhala-English language pair. We observe with only semantic constraints in the DA, the results are comparable with the scores obtained considering syntactic constraints, and is favourable for low-resourced languages that lacks linguistic tool support. Additionally, results can be further improved by considering both syntactic and semantic constraints. ",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, 3D data plays an indelible role in the computer vision field. However, extensive studies have proved that deep neural networks (DNNs) fed with 3D data, such as point clouds, are susceptible to adversarial examples, which aim to misguide DNNs and might bring immeasurable losses. Currently, 3D adversarial point clouds are chiefly generated in three fashions, i.e., point shifting, point adding, and point dropping. These point manipulations would modify geometrical properties and local correlations of benign point clouds more or less. Motivated by this basic fact, we propose to defend such adversarial examples with the aid of 3D steganalysis techniques. Specifically, we first introduce an adversarial attack and defense model adapted from the celebrated Prisoners' Problem in steganography to help us comprehend 3D adversarial attack and defense more generally. Then we rethink two significant but vague concepts in the field of adversarial example, namely, active defense and passive defense, from the perspective of steganalysis. Most importantly, we design a 3D adversarial point cloud detector through the lens of 3D steganalysis. Our detector is double-blind, that is to say, it does not rely on the exact knowledge of the adversarial attack means and victim models. To enable the detector to effectively detect malicious point clouds, we craft a 64-D discriminant feature set, including features related to first-order and second-order local descriptions of point clouds. To our knowledge, this work is the first to apply 3D steganalysis to 3D adversarial example defense. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3D adversarial point cloud detector can achieve good detection performance on multiple types of 3D adversarial point clouds. ",

These equations aim to generalise the recent PDE obtained by Stefan Steinerberger (2019) in the real case, and the PDE obtained by Sean O'Rourke and Stefan Steinerberger (2020) in the radial case, which amounts to work in 1D. These PDEs approximate dynamics of the complex roots for random polynomials of sufficiently high degree n. The unit of the time t corresponds to n differentiations, and the increment $\\Delta$t corresponds to 1 n. The general situation in 2D, in particular for complex roots of real polynomials, was not yet addressed. The purpose of this paper is to present a first attempt in that direction. We assume that the roots are distributed according to a regular distribution with a local homogeneity property (defined in the text), and that this property is maintained under differentiation. This allows us to derive a system of two coupled equations to model the motion. Our system could be interesting for other applications. The paper is illustrated with examples computed with the Maple system. ",

However, there still remain some challenges in the application of PINNs: 1) the mechanism of PINNs is unsuitable (at least cannot be directly applied) to exploiting a small size of (usually very few) extra informative samples to refine the networks; and 2) the efficiency of training PINNs often becomes low for some complicated PDEs. In this paper, we propose the generative adversarial physics-informed neural network (GA-PINN), which integrates the generative adversarial (GA) mechanism with the structure of PINNs, to improve the performance of PINNs by exploiting only a small size of exact solutions to the PDEs. Inspired from the weighting strategy of the Adaboost method, we then introduce a point-weighting (PW) method to improve the training efficiency of PINNs, where the weight of each sample point is adaptively updated at each training iteration. The numerical experiments show that GA-PINNs outperform PINNs in many well-known PDEs and the PW method also improves the efficiency of training PINNs and GA-PINNs. ",

Existing studies in this task attach more attention to the sequence modeling of sentences while largely ignoring the rich domain-invariant semantics embedded in graph structures (i.e., the part-of-speech tags and dependency relations). As an important aspect of exploring characteristics of language comprehension, adaptive graph representations have played an essential role in recent years. To this end, in the paper, we aim to explore the possibility of learning invariant semantic features from graph-like structures in CDSC. Specifically, we present Graph Adaptive Semantic Transfer (GAST) model, an adaptive syntactic graph embedding method that is able to learn domain-invariant semantics from both word sequences and syntactic graphs. More specifically, we first raise a POS-Transformer module to extract sequential semantic features from the word sequences as well as the part-of-speech tags. Then, we design a Hybrid Graph Attention (HGAT) module to generate syntax-based semantic features by considering the transferable dependency relations. Finally, we devise an Integrated aDaptive Strategy (IDS) to guide the joint learning process of both modules.

    "abstract": "Although existing monocular depth estimation methods have made great progress, predicting an accurate absolute depth map from a single image is still challenging due to the limited modeling capacity of networks and the scale ambiguity issue. In this paper, we introduce a fully Visual Attention-based Depth (VADepth) network, where spatial attention and channel attention are applied to all stages. By continuously extracting the dependencies of features along the spatial and channel dimensions over a long distance, VADepth network can effectively preserve important details and suppress interfering features to better perceive the scene structure for more accurate depth estimates. In addition, we utilize geometric priors to form scale constraints for scale-aware model training. Specifically, we construct a novel scale-aware loss using the distance between the camera and a plane fitted by the ground points corresponding to the pixels of the rectangular area in the bottom middle of the image. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset show that this architecture achieves the state-of-the-art performance and our method can directly output absolute depth without post-processing. Moreover, our experiments on the SeasonDepth dataset also demonstrate the robustness of our model to multiple unseen environments. ",

    "abstract": "Facial Action Unit (AU) detection is a crucial task for emotion analysis from facial movements. The apparent differences of different subjects sometimes mislead changes brought by AUs, resulting in inaccurate results. However, most of the existing AU detection methods based on deep learning didn't consider the identity information of different subjects. The paper proposes a meta-learning-based cross-subject AU detection model to eliminate the identity-caused differences. Besides, a transformer-based relation learning module is introduced to learn the latent relations of multiple AUs. To be specific, our proposed work is composed of two sub-tasks. The first sub-task is meta-learning-based AU local region representation learning, called MARL, which learns discriminative representation of local AU regions that incorporates the shared information of multiple subjects and eliminates identity-caused differences. The second sub-task uses the local region representation of AU of the first sub-task as input, then adds relationship learning based on the transformer encoder architecture to capture AU relationships. The entire training process is cascaded. Ablation study and visualization show that our MARL can eliminate identity-caused differences, thus obtaining a robust and generalized AU discriminative embedding representation. Our results prove that on the two public datasets BP4D and DISFA, our method is superior to the state-of-the-art technology, and the F1 score is improved by 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Context modeling and recognition represent complex tasks that allow mobile and ubiquitous computing applications to adapt to the user's situation. Current solutions mainly focus on limited context information generally processed on centralized architectures, potentially exposing users' personal data to privacy leakage, and missing personalization features. For these reasons on-device context modeling and recognition represent the current research trend in this area. Among the different information characterizing the user's context in mobile environments, social interactions and visited locations remarkably contribute to the characterization of daily life scenarios. In this paper we propose a novel, unsupervised and lightweight approach to model the user's social context and her locations based on ego networks directly on the user mobile device. Relying on this model, the system is able to extract high-level and semantic-rich context features from smartphone-embedded sensors data. Specifically, for the social context it exploits data related to both physical and cyber social interactions among users and their devices. As far as location context is concerned, we assume that it is more relevant to model the familiarity degree of a specific location for the user's context than the raw location data, both in terms of GPS coordinates and proximity devices. By using 5 real-world datasets, we assess the structure of the social and location ego networks, we provide a semantic evaluation of the proposed models and a complexity evaluation in terms of mobile computing performance. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of the extracted features by showing the performance of 3 machine learning algorithms to recognize daily-life situations, obtaining an improvement of 3% of AUROC, 9% of Precision, and 5% in terms of Recall with respect to use only features related to physical context.

LogiGAN implements a novel sequential GAN approach that (a) circumvents the non-differentiable challenge of the sequential GAN by leveraging the Generator as a sentence-level generative likelihood scorer with a learning objective of reaching scoring consensus with the Verifier; (b) is computationally feasible for large-scale pre-training with arbitrary target length. Both base and large size language models pre-trained with LogiGAN demonstrate obvious performance improvement on 12 datasets requiring general reasoning abilities, revealing the fundamental role of logic in broad reasoning, as well as the effectiveness of LogiGAN. Ablation studies on LogiGAN components reveal the relative orthogonality between linguistic and logic abilities and suggest that reflective thinking's facilitation effect might also generalize to machine learning.

    "abstract": "Entity Alignment (EA) has attracted widespread attention in both academia and industry, which aims to seek entities with same meanings from different Knowledge Graphs (KGs). There are substantial multi-step relation paths between entities in KGs, indicating the semantic relations of entities. However, existing methods rarely consider path information because not all natural paths facilitate for EA judgment. In this paper, we propose a more effective entity alignment framework, RPR-RHGT, which integrates relation and path structure information, as well as the heterogeneous information in KGs. Impressively, an initial reliable path reasoning algorithm is developed to generate the paths favorable for EA task from the relation structures of KGs, which is the first algorithm in the literature to successfully use unrestricted path information. In addition, to efficiently capture heterogeneous features in entity neighborhoods, a relation-aware heterogeneous graph transformer is designed to model the relation and path structures of KGs. Extensive experiments on three well-known datasets show RPR-RHGT significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods, exceeding the best performing baseline up to 8.62% on Hits@1. We also show its better performance than the baselines on different ratios of training set, and harder datasets. ",

Often, however, real-world data are prohibitively expensive to collect or unshareable due to privacy concerns. A promising solution is `surrogate networks', synthetic graphs with the properties of real-world networks. Until now, the generation of realistic surrogate temporal networks has remained an open problem, due to the difficulty of capturing both the temporal and topological properties of the input network, as well as their correlations, in a scalable model. Here, we propose a novel and simple method for generating surrogate temporal networks. By decomposing graphs into temporal neighborhoods surrounding each node, we can generate new networks using neighborhoods as building blocks. Our model vastly outperforms current methods across multiple examples of temporal networks in terms of both topological and dynamical similarity. We further show that beyond generating realistic interaction patterns, our method is able to capture intrinsic temporal periodicity of temporal networks, all with an execution time lower than competing methods by multiple orders of magnitude.

    "abstract": "During the training of machine learning models, they may store or \"learn\" more information about the training data than what is actually needed for the prediction or classification task. This is exploited by property inference attacks which aim at extracting statistical properties from the training data of a given model without having access to the training data itself. These properties may include the quality of pictures to identify the camera model, the age distribution to reveal the target audience of a product, or the included host types to refine a malware attack in computer networks. This attack is especially accurate when the attacker has access to all model parameters, i.e., in a white-box scenario. By defending against such attacks, model owners are able to ensure that their training data, associated properties, and thus their intellectual property stays private, even if they deliberately share their models, e.g., to train collaboratively, or if models are leaked. In this paper, we introduce property unlearning, an effective defense mechanism against white-box property inference attacks, independent of the training data type, model task, or number of properties. Property unlearning mitigates property inference attacks by systematically changing the trained weights and biases of a target model such that an adversary cannot extract chosen properties. We empirically evaluate property unlearning on three different data sets, including tabular and image data, and two types of artificial neural networks. Our results show that property unlearning is both efficient and reliable to protect machine learning models against property inference attacks, with a good privacy-utility trade-off. Furthermore, our approach indicates that this mechanism is also effective to unlearn multiple properties. ",

In this work we propose world value functions (WVFs), which are a type of general value function with mastery of the world - they represent not only how to solve a given task, but also how to solve any other goal-reaching task. To achieve this, we equip the agent with an internal goal space defined as all the world states where it experiences a terminal transition - a task outcome. The agent can then modify task rewards to define its own reward function, which provably drives it to learn how to achieve all achievable internal goals, and the value of doing so in the current task. We demonstrate a number of benefits of WVFs. When the agent's internal goal space is the entire state space, we demonstrate that the transition function can be inferred from the learned WVF, which allows the agent to plan using learned value functions. Additionally, we show that for tasks in the same world, a pretrained agent that has learned any WVF can then infer the policy and value function for any new task directly from its rewards. Finally, an important property for long-lived agents is the ability to reuse existing knowledge to solve new tasks. Using WVFs as the knowledge representation for learned tasks, we show that an agent is able to solve their logical combination zero-shot, resulting in a combinatorially increasing number of skills throughout their lifetime.

One of the most challenging aspects of this task is handling the independently moving objects as they break the rigid-scene assumption. For the first time, we show that pixel positional information can be exploited to learn SVDE (Single View Depth Estimation) from videos. Our proposed moving object (MO) masks, which are induced by shifted positional information (SPI) and referred to as `SPIMO' masks, are very robust and consistently remove the independently moving objects in the scenes, allowing for better learning of SVDE from videos. Additionally, we introduce a new adaptive quantization scheme that assigns the best per-pixel quantization curve for our depth discretization. Finally, we employ existing boosting techniques in a new way to further self-supervise the depth of the moving objects. With these features, our pipeline is robust against moving objects and generalizes well to high-resolution images, even when trained with small patches, yielding state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with almost 8.5x fewer parameters than the previous works that learn from videos. We present extensive experiments on KITTI and CityScapes that show the effectiveness of our method. ",

    "abstract": "Most differentially private (DP) algorithms assume a central model in which a reliable third party inserts noise to queries made on datasets, or a local model where the users locally perturb their data. However, the central model is vulnerable via a single point of failure, and in the local model, the utility of the data deteriorates significantly. The recently proposed shuffle model is an intermediate framework between the central and the local paradigms where the users send their locally privatized data to a server where messages are shuffled, effacing the link between a privatized message and the corresponding user, giving a better trade-off between privacy and utility than the local model, as its privacy gets amplified without adding more noise. In this paper, we theoretically derive the strictest known bound for DP guarantee for the shuffle models with $k$-Randomized Response local randomizers. There on, we focus on the utility of the shuffle model for histogram queries. Leveraging on the matrix inversion method, which is used to approximate the original distribution from the empirical one produced by the $k$-RR mechanism, we de-noise the histogram produced by the shuffle model to evaluate the total variation distance of the resulting histogram from the true one, which we regard as the measure of utility of the privacy mechanism. We perform experiments on both synthetic and real data to compare the privacy-utility trade-off of the shuffle model with that of the central one privatized by adding the state-of-the-art Gaussian noise to each bin. Although the experimental results stay consistent with the literature that favour the central model, we see that, the difference in statistical utilities between the central and the shuffle models is very small, showing that they are almost comparable under the same level of DP.

Spatial data is of particular interest, and its sensitive nature often leads to privacy concerns. We introduce GeoPointGAN, a novel GAN-based solution for generating synthetic spatial point datasets with high utility and strong individual level privacy guarantees. GeoPointGAN's architecture includes a novel point transformation generator that learns to project randomly generated point co-ordinates into meaningful synthetic co-ordinates that capture both microscopic (e.g., junctions, squares) and macroscopic (e.g., parks, lakes) geographic features. We provide our privacy guarantees through label local differential privacy, which is more practical than traditional local differential privacy. We seamlessly integrate this level of privacy into GeoPointGAN by augmenting the discriminator to the point level and implementing a randomized response-based mechanism that flips the labels associated with the 'real' and 'fake' points used in training. Extensive experiments show that GeoPointGAN significantly outperforms recent solutions, improving by up to 10 times compared to the most competitive baseline. We also evaluate GeoPointGAN using range, hotspot, and facility location queries, which confirm the practical effectiveness of GeoPointGAN for privacy-preserving querying. The results illustrate that a strong level of privacy is achieved with little-to-no adverse utility cost, which we explain through the generalization and regularization effects that are realized by flipping the labels of the data during training.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has become an important paradigm for cyberthreat detection (CTD) in the recent years. A substantial research effort has been invested in the development of specialized algorithms for CTD tasks. From the operational perspective, however, the progress of ML-based CTD is hindered by the difficulty in obtaining the large sets of labelled data to train ML detectors. A potential solution to this problem are semisupervised learning (SsL) methods, which combine small labelled datasets with large amounts of unlabelled data. This paper is aimed at systematization of existing work on SsL for CTD and, in particular, on understanding the utility of unlabelled data in such systems. To this end, we analyze the cost of labelling in various CTD tasks and develop a formal cost model for SsL in this context. Building on this foundation, we formalize a set of requirements for evaluation of SsL methods, which elucidates the contribution of unlabelled data. We review the state-of-the-art and observe that no previous work meets such requirements. To address this problem, we propose a framework for assessing the benefits of unlabelled data in SsL. We showcase an application of this framework by performing the first benchmark evaluation that highlights the tradeoffs of 9 existing SsL methods on 9 public datasets. Our findings verify that, in some cases, unlabelled data provides a small, but statistically significant, performance gain. This paper highlights that SsL in CTD has a lot of room for improvement, which should stimulate future research in this field. ",

    "abstract": "Using a convGRU-based autoencoder, this thesis proposes a framework to learn spatial-temporal aspects of raw network traffic in an unsupervised and protocol-agnostic manner. The learned representations are used to measure the effect on the results of a subsequent anomaly detection and are compared to the application without the extracted features. The evaluation showed, that the anomaly detection could not effectively be enhanced when applied on compressed traffic fragments for the context of network intrusion detection. Yet, the trained autoencoder successfully generates a compressed representation (code) of the network traffic, which hold spatial and temporal information. Based on the models residual loss, the autoencoder is also capable of detecting anomalies by itself. Lastly, an approach for a kind of model interpretability (LRP) was investigated in order to identify relevant areas within the raw input data, which is used to enrich alerts generated by an anomaly detection method.

    "abstract": "While deep neural networks are sensitive to adversarial noise, sparse coding using the Basis Pursuit (BP) method is robust against such attacks, including its multi-layer extensions. We prove that the stability theorem of BP holds upon the following generalizations: (i) the regularization procedure can be separated into disjoint groups with different weights, (ii) neurons or full layers may form groups, and (iii) the regularizer takes various generalized forms of the $\\ell_1$ norm. This result provides the proof for the architectural generalizations of Cazenavette et al. (2021), including (iv) an approximation of the complete architecture as a shallow sparse coding network. Due to this approximation, we settled to experimenting with shallow networks and studied their robustness against the Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method on a synthetic dataset and MNIST. We introduce classification based on the $\\ell_2$ norms of the groups and show numerically that it can be accurate and offers considerable speedups. In this family, linear transformer shows the best performance. Based on the theoretical results and the numerical simulations, we highlight numerical matters that may improve performance further. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the more dramatic multi-scale variations and more complicated foregrounds and backgrounds in optical remote sensing images (RSIs), the salient object detection (SOD) for optical RSIs becomes a huge challenge. However, different from natural scene images (NSIs), the discussion on the optical RSI SOD task still remains scarce. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale context network, namely MSCNet, for SOD in optical RSIs. Specifically, a multi-scale context extraction module is adopted to address the scale variation of salient objects by effectively learning multi-scale contextual information. Meanwhile, in order to accurately detect complete salient objects in complex backgrounds, we design an attention-based pyramid feature aggregation mechanism for gradually aggregating and refining the salient regions from the multi-scale context extraction module. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that MSCNet achieves competitive performance with only 3.26M parameters. The code will be available at https://github.com/NuaaYH/MSCNet. ",

    "abstract": "In recommender systems, models mostly use a combination of embedding layers and multilayer feedforward neural networks. The high-dimensional sparse original features are downscaled in the embedding layer and then fed into the fully connected network to obtain prediction results. However, the above methods have a rather obvious problem, that is, the features directly input are treated as independent individuals, and in fact there are internal correlations between features and features, and even different features have different importance in the recommendation. In this regard, this paper adopts a self-attentive mechanism to mine the internal correlations between features as well as their relative importance. In recent years, as a special form of attention mechanism, self-attention mechanism is favored by many researchers. The self-attentive mechanism captures the internal correlation of data or features by learning itself, thus reducing the dependence on external sources. Therefore, this paper adopts a multi-headed self-attentive mechanism to mine the internal correlations between features and thus learn the internal representation of features. At the same time, considering the rich information often hidden between features, the new feature representation obtained by crossover between the two is likely to imply the new description of the user likes the item. However, not all crossover features are meaningful, i.e., there is a problem of limited expression of feature combinations. Therefore, this paper adopts an attention-based approach to learn the external cross-representation of features. ",

    "abstract": "It is well noted that coordinate-based MLPs benefit -- in terms of preserving high-frequency information -- through the encoding of coordinate positions as an array of Fourier features. Hitherto, the rationale for the effectiveness of these positional encodings has been mainly studied through a Fourier lens. In this paper, we strive to broaden this understanding by showing that alternative non-Fourier embedding functions can indeed be used for positional encoding. Moreover, we show that their performance is entirely determined by a trade-off between the stable rank of the embedded matrix and the distance preservation between embedded coordinates. We further establish that the now ubiquitous Fourier feature mapping of position is a special case that fulfills these conditions. Consequently, we present a more general theory to analyze positional encoding in terms of shifted basis functions. In addition, we argue that employing a more complex positional encoding -- that scales exponentially with the number of modes -- requires only a linear (rather than deep) coordinate function to achieve comparable performance. Counter-intuitively, we demonstrate that trading positional embedding complexity for network deepness is orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art; despite the additional embedding complexity. To this end, we develop the necessary theoretical formulae and empirically verify that our theoretical claims hold in practice. ",

Although recent work has shown that there can be significant improvements in OOS detection when the intent classes are represented as dense-vectors based on domain specific knowledge, we argue in this paper that such gains are more likely due to advantages of dense-vector to one-hot encoding methods in representing the complexity of the OOS space. We start by showing how dense-vector encodings can create OOS spaces with much richer topologies than one-hot encoding methods. We then demonstrate empirically, using four standard intent classification datasets, that knowledge-free, randomly generated dense-vector encodings of intent classes can yield massive, over 20% gains over one-hot encodings, and also outperform the previous, domain knowledge-based, SOTA of one of the datasets. We finish by describing a novel algorithm to search for good dense-vector encodings and present initial but promising experimental results of its use. ",

Its advantages include uncovering hidden interactions in data and automating procedures which were performed manually in the past. Representation learning is also being adopted by earth and environmental sciences. However, there are still subfields that depend on manual feature engineering based on expert knowledge and the use of algorithms which do not utilize the latent space. Relying on those techniques can inhibit operational decision-making since they impose data constraints and inhibit automation. In this work, we adopt a case study for nitrogen response rate prediction and examine if representation learning can be used for operational use. We compare a Multilayer Perceptron, an Autoencoder, and a dual-head Autoencoder with a reference Random Forest model for nitrogen response rate prediction. To bring the predictions closer to an operational setting we assume absence of future weather data, and we are evaluating the models using error metrics and a domain-derived error threshold. The results show that learning latent representations can provide operational nitrogen response rate predictions by offering performance equal and sometimes better than the reference model. ",

    "abstract": "Visible Light Communication (VLC) is one the most promising enabling technology for future 6G networks to overcome Radio-Frequency (RF)-based communication limitations thanks to a broader bandwidth, higher data rate, and greater efficiency. However, from the security perspective, VLCs suffer from all known wireless communication security threats (e.g., eavesdropping and integrity attacks). For this reason, security researchers are proposing innovative Physical Layer Security (PLS) solutions to protect such communication. Among the different solutions, the novel Reflective Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology coupled with VLCs has been successfully demonstrated in recent work to improve the VLC communication capacity. However, to date, the literature still lacks analysis and solutions to show the PLS capability of RIS-based VLC communication. In this paper, we combine watermarking and jamming primitives through the Watermark Blind Physical Layer Security (WBPLSec) algorithm to secure VLC communication at the physical layer. Our solution leverages RIS technology to improve the security properties of the communication. By using an optimization framework, we can calculate RIS phases to maximize the WBPLSec jamming interference schema over a predefined area in the room. In particular, compared to a scenario without RIS, our solution improves the performance in terms of secrecy capacity without any assumption about the adversary's location. We validate through numerical evaluations the positive impact of RIS-aided solution to increase the secrecy capacity of the legitimate jamming receiver in a VLC indoor scenario. Our results show that the introduction of RIS technology extends the area where secure communication occurs and that by increasing the number of RIS elements the outage probability decreases. ",

There are continuous attempts to use features of the human visual system to improve the robustness of neural networks to data perturbations. We provide a detailed analysis of such bio-inspired models and their properties. To this end, we benchmark the robustness of several bio-inspired models against their most comparable baseline DCNN models. We find that bio-inspired models tend to be adversarially robust without requiring any special data augmentation. Additionally, we find that bio-inspired models beat adversarially trained models in the presence of more real-world common corruptions. Interestingly, we also find that bio-inspired models tend to use both low and mid-frequency information, in contrast to other DCNN models. We find that this mix of frequency information makes them robust to both adversarial perturbations and common corruptions. ",

Compared with other medical images such as Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), pathological images are more difficult to annotate, thus there is an extreme lack of data sets that can be used for supervised learning.

The Camelyon16 and NCTCRC datasets are used to evaluate the performance of our model. When dealing with transfer learning tasks with different data sets, the experimental results show that GCMAE has better linear classification accuracy than MAE, which can reach 81.10% and 89.22% respectively.

Lastly, we determine the upper bound on throughput of our system ($\\sim$0.9 exaMAC/s), set by the maximum optical bandwidth before significant loss of accuracy. This joint use of wide spectral and spatial bandwidths enables highly efficient computing for next-generation DNNs. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the outage minimization problem in a decode-and-forward cooperative network with relay uncertainty. To reduce the outage probability and improve the quality of service, existing researches usually rely on the assumption of both exact instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and environmental uncertainty. However, it is difficult to obtain perfect instantaneous CSI immediately under practical situations where channel states change rapidly, and the uncertainty in communication environments may not be observed, which makes traditional methods not applicable. Therefore, we turn to reinforcement learning (RL) methods for solutions, which do not need any prior knowledge of underlying channel or assumptions of environmental uncertainty. RL method is to learn from the interaction with communication environment, optimize its action policy, and then propose relay selection and power allocation schemes. We first analyse the robustness of RL action policy by giving the lower bound of the worst-case performance, when RL methods are applied to communication scenarios with environment uncertainty. Then, we propose a robust algorithm for outage probability minimization based on RL. Simulation results reveal that compared with traditional RL methods, our approach has better generalization ability and can improve the worst-case performance by about 6% when evaluated in unseen environments.

The weights among connected layers are encoded in the amplitude of controlled frequency modes that act as pumps. Interaction among these modes for information processing is enabled by non-linear optical processes. Both the matrix multiplication and element-wise activation functions are performed through coherent processes, enabling the direct representation of negative and complex numbers without the use of detectors or digital electronics. Via numerical simulations, we show that our design achieves a performance commensurate with present-day state-of-the-art computational networks on image-classification benchmarks. Our architecture is unique in providing a completely unitary, reversible mode of computation. Additionally, the computational speed increases with the power of the pumps to arbitrarily high rates, as long as the circuitry can sustain the higher optical power. ",

Theoretically, we derive new finite sample and asymptotic $L^2$ convergence rates for series estimators. We show that the rates can be improved in smooth settings by splitting the feature space and generating polynomial features separately for each partition.

The traditional central PIs cannot adapt well to skewed distributions, and their offline training fashion is vulnerable to unforeseen changes in future load patterns. Therefore, we propose an optimal PI estimation approach, which is online and adaptive to different data distributions by adaptively determining symmetric or asymmetric probability proportion pairs for quantiles. It relies on the online learning ability of reinforcement learning to integrate the two online tasks, i.e., the adaptive selection of probability proportion pairs and quantile predictions, both of which are modeled by neural networks. As such, the quality of quantiles-formed PI can guide the selection process of optimal probability proportion pairs, which forms a closed loop to improve the quality of PIs. Furthermore, to improve the learning efficiency of quantile forecasts, a prioritized experience replay strategy is proposed for online quantile regression processes. Case studies on both load and net load demonstrate that the proposed method can better adapt to data distribution compared with online central PIs method. Compared with offline-trained methods, it obtains PIs with better quality and is more robust against concept drift. ",

Bond percolation is motivated by problems in mathematical physics and it is studied in parallel computing and network science to understand the resilience of distributed systems to random link failure and the spread of information in networks through unreliable links. Full-bond percolation is also equivalent to the \\emph{Reed-Frost process}, a network version of \\emph{SIR} epidemic spreading, in which the graph represents contacts among people and $p$ corresponds to the probability that a contact between an infected person and a susceptible one causes a transmission of the infection. We consider \\emph{one-dimensional power-law small-world graphs} with parameter $\\alpha$ obtained as the union of a cycle with additional long-range random edges: each pair of nodes $(u,v)$ at distance $L$ on the cycle is connected by a long-range edge $(u,v)$, with probability proportional to $1/L^\\alpha$. Our analysis determines three phases for the percolation subgraph $G_p$ of the small-world graph, depending on the value of $\\alpha$. 1) If $\\alpha < 1$, there is a $p<1$ such that, with high probability, there are $\\Omega(n)$ nodes that are reachable in $G_p$ from one another in $O(\\log n)$ hops; 2) If $1 < \\alpha < 2$, there is a $p<1$ such that, with high probability, there are $\\Omega(n)$ nodes that are reachable in $G_p$ from one another in $\\log^{O(1)}(n)$ hops; 3) If $\\alpha > 2$, for every $p<1$, with high probability all connected components of $G_p$ have size $O(\\log n)$. The setting of full-bond percolation in finite graphs studied in this paper, which is the one that corresponds to the network SIR model of epidemic spreading, had not been analyzed before. ",

We notice that the importance of each feature is different and they should be weighted dissimilarly so that tiny information can be captured by the neural network. Furthermore, the synthesis on some regions of interest is important in some applications. Here we propose a novel segmentation guided style-based generative adversarial network (SGSGAN) for PET synthesis.

However, there is still a lack of systematic understanding of how prediction markets aggregate information and why they work so well. This work proposes a multivariate utility (MU)-based mechanism that unifies several existing prediction market-making schemes. Based on this mechanism, we derive convergence results for markets with myopic, risk-averse traders who repeatedly interact with the market maker. We show that the resulting limiting wealth distribution lies on the Pareto efficient frontier defined by all market participants' utilities. With the help of this result, we establish both analytical and numerical results for the limiting price for different market models. We show that the limiting price converges to the geometric mean of agents' beliefs for exponential utility-based markets. For risk measure-based markets, we construct a risk measure family that meets the convergence requirements and show that the limiting price can converge to a weighted power mean of agent beliefs. For markets based on hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utilities, we show that the limiting price is also a risk-adjusted weighted power mean of agent beliefs, even though the trading order will affect the aggregation weights. We further propose an approximation scheme for the limiting price under the HARA utility family. We show through numerical experiments that our approximation scheme works well in predicting the convergent prices. ",

In this paper, we investigate position-aided beam prediction using a real-world large-scale dataset to derive insights into precisely how much overhead can be saved in practice.

Existing studies attempt to predict more accurately, efficiently, or generically from the aspects of network structure, attribute characteristics, and their combination. Few of them analyze the effects of intralayer links. Namely, few works study the backbone structures which can effectively preserve the predictive accuracy while dealing with a smaller number of intralayer links. It can be used to investigate what types of intralayer links are most important for correct prediction. Are there any intralayer links whose presence leads to worse predictive performance than their absence, and how to attack the prediction algorithms at the minimum cost? To this end, two kinds of network structural perturbation methods are proposed. For the scenario where the structural information of the whole network is completely known, we offer a global perturbation strategy that gives different perturbation weights to different types of intralayer links and then selects a predetermined proportion of intralayer links to remove according to the weights. In contrast, if these information cannot be obtained at one time, we design a biased random walk procedure, local perturbation strategy, to execute perturbation. Four kinds of interlayer link prediction algorithms are carried out on different real-world and artificial perturbed multiplex networks. We find out that the intralayer links connected with small degree nodes have the most significant impact on the prediction accuracy. The intralayer links connected with large degree nodes may have side effects on the interlayer link prediction. ",
